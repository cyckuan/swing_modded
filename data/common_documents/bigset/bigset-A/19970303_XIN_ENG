<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today instructed Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to pay a
working visit to the United States in preparation for his meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's hour-long talks with Primakov at the president's
country residence outside Moscow focused on the agenda of the
summit, which is scheduled for March 20 in the Finnish capital of
Helsinki, said the presidential news service.
</P>
<P>
The eastward expansion plan of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is expected to be one of the central issues
for discussions at the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Primakov briefed the president on the results of his trip to
Brussels, Oslo, Copenhagen and London last week.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reportedly told Yeltsin that some progresses were made
in discussions on NATO's eastward expansion but Russia and NATO
would have much work to do in a bid to reach an agreement that
would satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long been opposed to NATO expansion, saying that an
enlarged NATO will pose as a potential threat to its security. But
the Western military alliance says it will go ahead with its plan
despite Russia's objections.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Registration for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian government announced today
that presidential nominees will start registration from April 21
through 26.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the announcement
was made by Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati in a
nationwide gathering of commanders of the Law Enforcement Forces.
</P>
<P>
So far, four dignities, including three ruling clergymen,
have declared themselves as nominees for the 7th presidential
elections scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
They are Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, former
minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mohammad Khatami,
former minister of information Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri and
deputy head of the judiciary Seyed Reza Zavarei.
</P>
<P>
Observers here regard the 54-year-old parliament speaker as the
would-be front-runner in the presidential race, because he has the
support of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the rightist
camp called the Association of Combatant Clergymen.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that next president will assume office in August.
</P>
<P>
Since Iran's Constitution bars present President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani from running for a third consecutive term, so the
64-year-old president has to step down from the office.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Rafsanjani might serve as a deputy leader
or still as No. 2 man in the country after Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Besharati said, "holding the next presidential elections in
full security is one of the main responsibilities of the Law
Enforcement Forces during the next Iranian year," which starts
from March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Besharati pledged that his ministry will give equal treatment
to all the contending candidates.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Egyptian National
Assembly Ahmed Fathi Sorour, leading a delegation, left here
today for Casablanca on a visit to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement, he said he would be holding talks
with Moroccan Parliament speaker and other officials on the
current outstanding Arab issues, and preparatory works for the
convocation of an Arab parliamentary conference in Cairo
initially scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
Sorour said that his visit to Morocco was taking place at
extraordinary political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
On the role of Arab parliaments in supporting the Middle East
peace process and in confronting Israeli intransigence, he said
that Arab parliaments were playing an important role toward
national mobilization and inter-governmental cooperation to
accelerate the peace march.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Arab parliaments' role in clearing the Arab
atmosphere, Sorour said that Damascus had recently been the seat
of an inter-Arab parliamentary conference. The conference issued
several recommendations on Arab reconciliation, and the Arab
atmosphere is certainly better than before, he said.

<HEADLINE> Finland's Population Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Finland had a population of 5.13
million at the end of 1996, or 15,000 more than the previous year,
said a report from the Finnish Population Registration Center
today.
</P>
<P>
On average, each Finnish woman had 1.81 children, and the
Nordic country's birth rate ranked second among the European
Union's 15 member states, after Ireland's 1.87 children per
woman.
</P>
<P>
However, demographic experts believed that despite the
relatively high average birth rate, there was no need to worry
about a sharp increase of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, they noted, the birth rate had actually been
declining, due to the country's economic recession and a rise in
the number of Finnish people who prefer to remain single.

HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 to 70 percent of
Zimbabweans have been involved in drug abuse at one stage or
another, according to the Social Welfare Department.
</P>
<P>
An liaison officer with the Harare Resource Center, Joseph
Jabangwe confirmed the findings when addressing members of the
Midlands Provincial Drug and Alcohol Abuse Committee at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said recent studies had indicated that some 38.1 percent of
school children had experimented with cannabis or alcohol and 35
percent of people at workplaces had also taken to drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of establishing drug and alcohol abuse
committees is to teach people about the dangers of taking hard
drugs and alcohol and to create an awareness among the Zimbabwean
population.
</P>
<P>
A regional conference on drug and alcohol abuse will be
convened at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe in August this year, he

LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Small firms in Britain are the most
sceptical about the European Monetary Union (EMU) and most
European ownership-managers believed that there is still some way
to go before the single market benefits are realized, according to
a research survey.
</P>
<P>
The European Business Survey, carried out by Grant Thornton and
Business Strategists, shows that a majority of British business
owners reserved deep doubts over the single European currency, due
to be launched in 1999.
</P>

Uncertainty about European integration is also reflected in the

<HEADLINE> Deng's Ashes Scattered into Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ashes of beloved Comrade Deng
Xiaoping today were scattered into the vast sea of the motherland
in accordance with the wishes of Deng himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who passed away in Beijing on February 19 at the age of
93, was cremated on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the central authorities, Comrade Hu Jintao and
other central leaders, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's widow Zhuo Lin and
other family members of his escorted the ashes and scattered them
into the sea, in the most simple yet most solemn manner to express
the profound mourning for and endless memory of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, an outstanding leader who enjoyed high prestige
acknowledged by the Party, the army, and the people of all ethnic
groups across the country, a great Marxist, a great proletarian
revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, and a
long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's
socialist reforms, opening up and modernization drive, and the
founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
As a thorough-going materialist, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had in
recent years told his family about his ideas of his own funeral
affairs. He had asked his family to donate his corneas to an
eyebank, give his body for medical research, and scatter his ashes
into sea when he passed away.

<P>
On the morning of March 2, the Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai,
where Comrade Deng Xiaoping had worked for a long time during his
lifetime, was filled with a solemn silence broken only by faint
notes of the dirge, and the flag was flown at half-mast. A color
portrait of Comrade Deng Xiaoping hung on a blue curtain in the
auditorium in the hall, flanked by black and yellow silk streamers
inscribed with memorial messages.
</P>
<P>
Below the portrait sat the casket containing Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's ashes, covered by a flag of the Communist Party of
China. In front of the casket stood the wreath dedicated by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's widow Zhuo Lin and their children. The
casket was surrounded with fresh flowers and green
cypresses. Eight armed honor guards of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) stood solemnly to guard the casket.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the office of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's funeral
committee, Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao,
Zhang Wannian and Ren Jianxin, and members of the office Luo Gan,
Zeng Qinghong, Cao Zhi, Zhu Xun, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ruilin, Zhang
Quanjing, Yang Dezhong, Hu Guangbao, Zeng Jianhui, He Chunlin, Liu
Huaqiu, Jia Qinglin, Xu Guangchun and Tang Jiaxuan, along with
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's relatives, solemnly stood there in
mourning. With extremely deep grief and profound memory, they
bowed three times to the portrait of Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Then, with Deng's children carrying his portrait, the casket
and the wreath, Hu Jintao and other leaders, Deng's widow Zhuo Lin
and some relatives, and the honor guards escorted the ashes as
they slowly stepped out of the hall.
</P>
<P>
The hearse started slowly and went out of Zhongnanhai. Staff
members of the General Offices of the CPC Central Committee and
the State Council, and PLA officers and men wearing white flowers
on their chests, clustered on both sides of the driveway to bid a
tearful farewell to Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

and men, holding their hats and wearing white flowers on their
chests, followed the aircraft carrying comrade Deng Xiaoping's
ashes with their eyes as it took off and flew out toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
Inside the cabin of the aircraft hung the portrait of comrade
Deng Xiaoping and streamers of "Eternal glory to Dear comrade Deng
Xiaoping," "Dear comrade Deng Xiaoping lives in our hearts
forever." Deng's cinerary casket was covered with the flag of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and surrounded with more streamers.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, Zhuo Lin and deng's children with zhuo, Deng Lin,
Deng Pufang, Deng Nan, Deng Rong and Deng Zhifang, full of grief
and tears, slowly cast the ashes of comrade Deng Xiaoping with
colorful flower petals over the endless blue waves of the
sea. Meanwhile, the other leaders and Deng's relatives stood in
silent tribute.
</P>
<P>
Although Comrade Deng Xiaoping has left us, he will be there
forever with the sea, the motherland and the people.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Morning, March 2 of 1997, a silver
grey plane with a special mission took off from the Xijiao Airport
in west Beijing. It made a circle low and slowly over the Chinese
capital, and then penetrated the clouds and flew toward the vast
sea of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Carried on the plane were the ashes of Comrade Deng Xiaoping,
who was deeply loved and esteemed by the whole Party, the whole
army, and the people of various ethnic groups throughout the
country. The casket was covered by a bright red flag of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Today, Comrade Hu Jintao and other central leaders, along with
Deng's widow Zhuo Lin and other family members, were fulfilling
the last wish of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in an utterly plain yet
solemn manner.
</P>
<P>
The plane headed for the sea, a place with which this great man
of the century had been most fascinated throughout his magnificent
life.
</P>
<P>
Even the Heaven seemed to be touched, for a splendid rainbow
emerged in the horizon when the plane was approaching the sea.
</P>
<P>
At 11:25 a.m., the plane descended to 1,800 meters. Trying hard
to hold grief, the 81-year-old, tearful Zhuo Lin took out a
handful of Deng's ashes with shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
She held the ashes in her hands for quite a long time before
letting them go down into the sea together with colorful flower
petals.

Deng loved the sea for his whole life. The many ups and downs
in his political life were just like the sea waves.
</P>
<P>
In his revolutionary career for over half a century, in spite
of the numerous dangers and risks he encountered, he had always
been indomitable. The more setbacks he went through, the more
vigorously he roused himself again. Time and again, he had been
able to turn the tide at crucial moment, demonstrating the
dauntless heroism of a great proletarian revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
At 11:50, the aircraft completed the task of casting Deng's
ashes and headed back.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's heart had been linked with the hearts
of the people throughout the country, of the compatriots in
Hongkong, Macao and Taiwan and of the overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He would see that the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics he initiated will be continued with a
bright future.
</P>
<P>
The rolling waves would perhaps carry his ashes to Hong Kong
and Macao, where his concept of "one country, two systems" will
soon become a reality.
</P>
<P>
The waves would perhaps carry his ashes to Taiwan. He would see
the final reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The waves would perhaps carry his ashes to the Pacific Ocean,
to the Indian Ocean and to the Atlantic Ocean, for he does not
only belong to China, but also to the world.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping--it is a name that will live forever in the
hearts of billions of people with eternal glory. He will come to
eternity in the sea.

Deng Xiaoping and Zhuo Lin met in Yan'an in August 1939 when
the latter was attending a school there. They fell in love and got
married. Deng was then 35 and Zhuo lin 23. The couple spent 58
years together, going through all the vicissitudes of life. Now,
facing the ashes of her beloved husband, how could she not be
stricken with profound grief?
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, who was also filled with sorrow, scattered slowly
the ashes and petals over the sea.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Deng Xiaoping's five children - Deng Lin,
Deng Pufang, Deng Nan, Deng Rong and Deng Zhifang, and his four
grandchildren - Mianzi, Mengzi, Yangyang and Xiaodi, who, kneeing
in the cabin, scattered the ashes and flower petals over the sea,
fulfilling the last wish of their beloved father and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
Choking with tears, Deng Rong said, "Daddy, you have returned

</P>
<P>
Sun Yong and Zhang Baozhong had been Deng's bodyguards for many
years. In military uniforms, they were now guarding the casket as

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: CIA Drops over 1,000 Secret Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has dropped more than 1,000 informants from its
worldwide payroll in the last two years because the agency has
considered that they were unproductive or had likely been involved
in serious criminal activity or human rights abuses in their based
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that about 90 percent of the
dismissed secret agents were judged to be poor sources of the type
of information the CIA considers important in the post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
The remainder, numbering more than 100 agents, were sacked
because agency officials concluded they were implicated in major
crimes abroad, such as killings, assassinations, kidnappings or
terrorist acts, and they also provided inadequate intelligence.
</P>
<P>
A disproportionately high number of the informants dropped for
such abuses were employed in Latin America during the 1980s and
early 1990s, but some were employed in the Middle East and Asia,
the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The total number discharged approached one-third of the
informants employed by the CIA, the post quoted the agency
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The dismissals resulted from a year-long review of informants
that began in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under a policy established by former CIA director John Deutch,
CIA officers for the first time must submit annual reports
assessing the quality of their informants.
</P>
<P>
They also are generally barred from recruiting new sources
implicated in human rights abuses or criminal behavior, the Post
said.

LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A bag containing about 1.5 million
pounds (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) in cash, part of an
American aid package to Russia, was stolen at Heathrow Airport in
London last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard was quoted by BBC television as saying earlier

arriving from New York.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Dunhill Cup Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China emerged as the
champion of the Dunhill Cup soccer tournament Sunday by beating
Bosnia Herzegovina 3-0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless draw in the first half, China sent in fresh
legs in the second half and they pumped in three goals to keep
them unbeaten in all five outings in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
China started off aggressively and forced the Bosnians to move
deep into defence. With attacks flying in from all angles, Bosnian
goalkeeper Dedic Mirsad had to leave his position often to save
the situation.
</P>
<P>
China came fighting in the second half and subsitute Li Jinyu
ended the goal drought by scoring in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinyu, who replaced Li Bing, collected a pass from Zhang
Xiaorui and tricked Mirsad to put China 1-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Zhang Xiaorui, another subsitute who came in
for Peng Weiguo during the break, consolidated China's position
when he blasted in a rebound from Mirsad.
</P>
<P>
Another subsitute, Ma Mingyu, set up the third goal when he
crossed from the right flank for an unmarked Hao Haidong to head
in the ball in the 80st minute.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia tried to make a comeback but it was too late with the
Chinese keeping up the pressure and denying them any chances.
</P>
<P>
The second Dunhill Cup tournament will be held in Ho Chin Minh
City in Vietnam in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Dunhill Cup tournament which opened on February
21 had attracted eight teams. Besides China and Bosnia, other
participating teams were Malaysia, Singapore, Finland, Indonesia,
Vietnam and Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Envoy in Tehran to Save Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel's special envoy held talks with Iranian authorities here
this afternoon to mend ties after expulsion of ambassadors from
each sides.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said that Ali Tuygan, Turkish Deputy
Foreign Minister, is expected to deliver a written message from
the Turkish president to his Iranian counterpart Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides did not revealed the content of their
talks between Tuygan and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allaeddin
Boroujerdi.
</P>
<P>
Tuygan was quoted by the well-informed sources as saying "We
discussed the latest development between Turkey and Iran and I
have told them our stand toward the bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the discussion will be helpful to the better
understanding of our stance toward Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Tehran relations went into trouble Saturday as the
two governments have ordered to kick out each other's envoys
within a week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry announced that Turkish Ambassador
Osman Koruturk and Consul General Ufuk Ozsancak leave Iran in
a tit-for-tat measure against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish consul general in Iran's northwestern city of
Orumieh was declared by the Iranian authorities as persona
non-grata for his involvement in activities inconsistent with
diplomatic norms.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri and Consul
General to Istanbul Mohammad Reza Rashedi were expelled from
Turkey last week for their statement made in public about Islam
and fundamentalism. Then came the expulsion order Friday to Saeed
Zare, Iranian Consul general to Erzurum, who was called a persona
non-grata by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA only gave a short and brief
report about today's meeting between the two deputy foreign
ministers in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Turkish special envoy as saying
"relations between Tehran and Ankara have always been of special
significance and supported by the presidents of the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi expressed his welcome to the Turkish envoy and
said that dispatch of a special envoy by the Turkish
government shows the importance attached by Turkish leaders to
their ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has been following the same policy toward its relations
with Ankara," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, secretary of Supreme National Security
Council, today expressed his hope that the two friendly and
brotherly countries of Iran and Turkey would continue their
relations in a cordial and desirable manner.
</P>
<P>
Three local English dailies today also commented on recent
developments in Tehran-Ankara ties, stressing that deterioration
of bilateral relations will serve neither the interests of Turkey
nor Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times said it should be born in mind that Tehran and
Ankara have to maintain their cordial ties, a fact easily
discernible from the history of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The urgency of maintaining cordial bilateral ties calls for
immediate steps on the part of both sides to find out the
reasons for the present unpleasant situation and mend fences as
soon as possible, it said.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that self-restraint is the most befitting
response from Tehran to what is going on in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan International said that Tehran, while maintaining its
right to retaliate, should work to cool tempers and avoid
measures that may leave a negative impact on bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Tariff Regime to Stimulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The new tariff regime recently
announced by the Zimbabwe government will stimulate innovation
and development in some sectors of the economy, Confederation of
Zimbabwe Industries Chief Economist Farai Zizhou said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a one-day workshop on the new tariff regime,
Zizhou said the new structure offered protective rates of duty to
the electronic, leather, clothing and battery manufacturing
sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regime, finished goods, which in the past have
been invading the Zimbabwean markets, are now subjected to
punitive 40 to 85 percent import duty.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''The protection given to these sub-sectors will
stimulate innovation and development as they aim at improving
their products to satisfy the domestic market.''
</P>
<P>
The move is also expected to create new jobs, especially in
the clothing industry, and lure more foreign investment in the
country. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of India
(SBI) today inaugurated its Johannesburg branch, the first
banking presence from India in South Africa, informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
With an endowment capital of 67.5 million Rands (15.1 million
U.S. Dollars) in South Africa, the branch will deal primarily
with corporate lending and trade finance, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, managed by Indians, will also employ 15 to 20 South
Africans in keeping with business growth, the South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an inauguration ceremony, SBI Chairman P. G. Kakodkar said
that the decision to set up offices in South Africa was based on
the historical ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The SBI will do its effort to support the development of joint
ventures between India and South Africa, Kakodkar said.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between India and South Africa has registered two
billion Rands (449 million U.S. Dollars), India's Consul General
in Johannesburg Skand Tayal said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Johannesburg branch, the SBI is also planning
to open a sub-branch in Durban, one of the major port cities in east
coast of South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The SBI, which has a network of over 8,800 branches in India
and 51 overseas offices in 34 countries, is India's largest
commercial banking organization, with a share of almost 30
percent in total banking business in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Take Refugee Camp, Reject Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel chief Laurent-Desire
Kabila today announced the capture of the refugee camp of
Tingi-Tingi, 250 kilometers southeast of the strategically key
city of Kisangani, and rejected a cease-fire proposal presented by
the United States and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Kabila as saying in Goma
that the Zairean city of Kindu, 400 kilometers south of Kisangani,
had "completely fallen" to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Some 160,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees fled the Tingi-Tingi refugee
camp on Friday after they heard that the rebel forces were
approaching.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said that his forces are now within 23 kilometers of
Kisangani, and said that he had rejected the ceasefire proposal
because he wanted "South Africans and Americans to convince first
those who are opposed to negotiations".
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has rejected any negotiation with the
rebels until what it called the total withdrawal of foreign troops
from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Most of the staff of international humanitarian groups withdrew
from Kisangani on Saturday, because they said that all the
refugees had fled their camps nearby amid rumors of imminent
arrival of rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, whose forces have been gaining ground against the
government troops of Zaire since the beginning of the year, said
that "the clique of Kinshasa will profit from an immediate
ceasefire"".
</P>
<P>
He also said the Lubutu, seven kilometers west of Tingi-Tingi,
had been "liberated" from government forces.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy forces of Lubutu, which was the stronghold of the
elite forces of the Zairean army aided by mercenaries, including
Angolans as well as former Rwandan soldiers, were crushed," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticized for Attempting to Prolong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily today criticized
the U.S. for attempting to prolong U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra Daily, organ of the major Arab Ba'th Socialist
Party, said U.S. "attempts to prolong the sanctions and inflict
more harm on the Iraqi people.'
</P>
<P>
The paper said that U.S. has been intending to "attack Iraq and
destroy its infrastructure, and to stop the country's scientific
progress and development."
</P>
<P>
"The time has gone when Washington used to dictate its will on
the international community, a fact that the U.S. should
understand to be able to reconsider its calculations and
priorities," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said Iraq cooperated seriously with U.N. and the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming
Iraq. "However, the cooperation has not resulted in the lifting of
the sanctions because U.S. impeded the finalization of the
UNSCOM's mission," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to international community to help lift the
sanctions which were imposed six years ago for Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Only after UNSCOM clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all the
weapons of mass destruction, can the sanctions be lifted,
according to U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> PNA Tries to Prevent Terror Attacks on Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is still working to prevent terrorist attacks
against Israel despite the current dispute over eastern
Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said today.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was quoted by the state-run Israel Radio as saying
that the PNA was making "every effort" to check any terrorist
attack in response to Israel's recent decision to build a
settlement in the Har Homa area in southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Despite the anger and strong protests from the Palestinian
side, no widespread violence has erupted in the Palestinian
territories, Mordechai noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Palestinians have been holding demonstrations
against Israel, mostly in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai said that, in view of the current brewing
tension, no one could predict what would happen once Israeli
bulldozers were sent to the site to clear the ground for the
construction.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have warned against carrying out of the
Har Homa project. PNA Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal
Husseini said Saturday that if bulldozers were sent to the site,
"it will mean the end of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli security service have also warned about possible
outbreak of Palestinian violence aimed at disrupting the Har Homa
project.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel announced the Har Homa building plan last week,
Palestinians have responded with restraint to the decision
apparently under the order of the PNA leadership.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence analysts attributed the PNA's restraint
mainly to the following two reasons: PNA President Yasser Arafat
feared that violence would affect negatively his ongoing visit to
the United States starting from Monday. Meanwhile, the PNA did
not want to disrupt the expected Israeli further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank expected to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Israeli government has sternly warned the PNA
 against violent response, saying violence would end Israel's
further pullouts. Because Israel has the right to determine the
scope of futher troop withdrawals, this gives it a crucial
leverage in containing the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Israeli President Ezer Weizman expressed the hope
that the current crisis over Har Homa project would pass. He
said it was inconceivable that the peace process between the two
sides, which has come so far, would end on this point.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Arafat would ask U.S. President
Bill Clinton to exert pressure on Israel to reverse its decision
to build new houses in Har Homa. But it is doubtful that Clinton
would accept Arafat's request except calling for restraint from
both Israeli and Palestinian sides.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Miss Deadline of Further Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel is not expected to meet
the deadline set in the Hebron agreement for carrying out the
first phase of the further Israeli army redeployment in the West
Bank, Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebron Agreement signed between Israel and
the Palestinians, the redeployment is scheduled to be completed
by this Friday, while the Israeli government will hold a meeting
to discuss the matter only on this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Nevah told Israel Radio that the
Israeli government "does not want to put off the implementation
of the further troop redeployment."
</P>
<P>
He said the extent will be decided by security considerations
for the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank
has halted demolishing Palestinians' illegal houses in Area C,
which is under sole Israeli control, in accordance with the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio noted that the decision was aimed at preventing
escalation of tensions in the West Bank, in the wake of the
Israeli government's approval for building a new Jewish
neighborhood in the southern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Israeli government approved the
controversial plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes, in addition to
construct more housing for the Palestinians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for what will ultimately be 6,500 units in the
southern Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa, of which 2,450 will
be completed in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, the government said it would start to build
3,015 units for Palestinians in 10 existing neighborhoods within
the city limits, though it would boost that number to 9,000
units over an unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the building plan,
saying the Israeli government's decision is a violation of law
and its agreements with the Palestinians, and has put the peace
process in danger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
called on the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League to help
stop the construction in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa issue is surely to be stressed in this week's
meeting between U. S. President Bill Clinton and Arafat, who left
for Washington today for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
The United States had expressed its "disappointment" last week
over the Israeli government's decision to go ahead with the
construction of the new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Receives Invitation to Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri will visit Russia in April as a major campaign
for Iran's 7th presidential elections scheduled for May 23,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 54-year-old speaker received the official
invitation from Speaker of Russian State Duma Gennady Seleznev.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the invitation was delivered to Nateq-
Nouri by Russian Ambassador to Tehran Sergei Tretyakov here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador termed the visit to Moscow by the Iranian
parliament speaker as a major step toward strengthening
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities said earlier that the visit by
Nateq-Nouri to Moscow has been postponed due to the likelihood
of drastic changes in the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian parliament speaker
would prefer an earlier visit to Moscow in a bid to gain much
publicity during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is a front-runner among the four nominees in the
current presidential race. He has a strong possibility of
winning the 7th presidential elections this year.
</P>
<P>
While stressing importance of strategic relations between the
two countries, Nateq-Nouri said consolidation of Tehran-Moscow
ties will have positive and constructive impacts on all regional
and world countries.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit by the strong presidential candidacy
shows that the Iranian regime attaches greater importance to its
strategic relations with its northern neighbor of Russia, which
has already sold three submarines and nuclear reactors to Iran
despite strong opposition by the United States.

<P>
AMMAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti today reiterated Jordan's firm opposition to Israeli
government's decision to build new Jewish settlements in Arab's
East Jerusalem, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti made the remarks when he met with Israeli Knesset
(parliament) member and former foreign minister Ehud Barak, who
arrived here today on a two-day visit for talks with senior
Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's decision would have negative
repercussion on the whole Middle East peace process, said
Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, together with most other Arab nations, has been
voicing opposition to Israel's settlement policy since its
government made the decision to build new Jewish houses in East
Jerusalem last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government approved the controversial plan to
build 6,500 Jewish housing units in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Jordan's Upper House of Parliament
today issued a statement saying that there will be no promising
future in the Middle East without a just settlement to the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
It said that it must be ensured that Arab's Jerusalem be the
future capital of the Palestinian State. The Palestinian people's
aspiration to fulfill their legitimate rights on their national
soil should be respected, the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will grant
Mozambique 20,000 liters of insecticide to help remove locusts
in its four central provinces, the Mozambique Information
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was pledged by South African's agricultural minister,
said Mozmabican Minister of Agriculture and Fishing Sergio

Gouveia noted that Mozambique needs 30,000 liters of pesticide
to kill the locusts, adding that 5,000 liters has arrived in Port
Beira and will be distributed to the locus-hit areas as soon as
possible.

<P>
The four Mozambican provinces -- Manica, Sofala, Niassa
and Cabo Delgado -- have been suffering from the locust plague
since mid last year, which has caused great losses to their
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been making efforts to destroy the locusts, but

<HEADLINE> Big Parties Win German Local Elections in Hesse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite record unemployment, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) boosted
their share of the votes in local elections in the western German
state of Hesse today but was still left behind the leftist Social
Democratic Party (SPD), the lastest computer projection showed.
</P>
<P>
The CDU won 33.3 percent of the votes, up from 32 percent in
the last local poll in 1993, according to the latest projection of
the German ZDF television network.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, the main opposition in Bonn, led in Hesse with 37.5
percent, up from 36.4 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But in the hottest race in the banking center Frankfurt, the
CDU appeared to be the clear winner by a share of 36.9 percent of
the votes compared to only 29.5 percent for the SPD, the ZDF said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's small political parties were the big losers of the
Hesse elections.
</P>
<P>
The Greens Party posted only 11 percent, the same result as in
the last election, while the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the
junior partner in Kohl's ruling coalition in Bonn, saw their share
dropping to four percent from 5.1 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The far-right Republicans Party also lost votes, winning 6.2
percent compared with 8.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Hesse elections were widely seen as a key test of German
voter sentiment prior to German general elections due to be held
in Autumn 1998. The only next sampling of the electorate's mood
this year will be in September for the statehouse vote in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Both the CDU and the SPD claimed victory after the first
computer projections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze saw the election results as
"an encourage for the reform policy of Chancellor Helmut Kohl".
</P>
<P>
Hesse's SPD state premier, Hans Eichel, also commented that
"The SPD has consolidated, things are moving forward".

CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs

<P>
AMMAN -- The first shipment of phosphoric acid produced by a
170 million U.S. dollars Indo-Jordanian joint venture will head
for India in mid-April, two months ahead of schedule, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment will be worth 3 million dollars, said Babu
Varghese, managing director of the Indo-Jordanian Chemicals
Comapny (IJCC).
</P>
<P>
IJCC is expected to export phosphoric acid worth 90 million
dollars to India in its first full year of operation, Varghese
said.
</P>
<P>
IJCC, located in southern Jordan adjoining the largest
rock-phosphate mining facility in the kingdom, is a joint venture
between India's Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation
Limited (SPIC) and the Jordanian Phosphate Mines Company.
</P>
<P>
Work began 15 months ago on the plant, which includes a
700-tonne per-day sulphuric acid plant in addition to associated
utilities at Shidiyeh and an acid storage facility at the port of
Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The company will produce 220,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid
every year and export the entire output to SPIC in India, where it
will be used to manufacture diammonium phosphate, a fertilizer
under heavy demand among Indian farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the world's fifth largest producer and third largest
exporter of rock phosphates.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is Jordan's first major project realized
under its strategy to switch to finished fertilizers rather than
raw rock phosphates as one of its main exports following a change
of trend in the international market since 1990.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The fifth session of the Tunisian-Egyptian high joint
committee ended here today with the signing of several bilateral

el-Ganzouri, opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed by Karoui and Ganzouri include an
executive program for cooperation in the field of tourism, an
executive program for the promotion of trade exchange and some
other bilateral cooperation accords in various fields.
</P>
<P>

the session and it had results that are likely to confirm the
already strong ties between Tunisia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, who arrived here Friday at the head of a delegation
to the session, said that the agreements signed include all
sectors and are likely to enhance integration and partnership
between the two countries.

KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait will pass a privatization law during the
current National Assembly's four-year legislative term which
started last October, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan made the remarks following the inauguration of a
two-day seminar here on legal issues in privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization has been fully studied by law and
finance experts of the parliament and the government as well,
adding that a blueprint of privatization law had already been
devised.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech, Al-Ruhdan said Kuwaiti
privatization was aimed at increasing citizens' role in national
investments, boosting the private sector and encouraging
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait initiated the privatization program in 1994, so far it
has sold more than 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of shares of
state-owned enterprises to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government officials have expressed the hope that the
parliament would soon pass a privatization law to help kick off
a plan to shed state involvement in some public utilities and
services during 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, participants will discuss the legal
aspects of privatization of public services and utilities in the
country. They will examine several matters related to the legal
aspects of turning government-run projects to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan said that in recent years, Kuwaiti private sector
began to grow and show eagerness to compete with the government
in taking on gigantic projects.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Around-the-clock access to all Automated Teller
Machines (ATMs) will be provided throughout Jordan in its banks in
the network, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a capital of half a million Jordanian dinars
(about 710,000 U.S. dollars), is the first in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It took six months to execute the project since the signing of
the agreement last July between Jordan Payment Service Company and
Nomad Software, owners of Cortex Software.
</P>
<P>
The number of Jordanians with credit cards ranges between
70,000 and 100,000 but the number is expected to reach 300,000 in
the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The new service will benefit the millions of tourists rushing
into Jordan every year, as most of them are from Western
countries, usually bearing their own credit cards.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today said
rejuvenation of state-owned enterprises is of great significance
in consolidating the socialist system and accomplishing China's
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark when attending a panel discussion of the
Beijing deputies to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body, as a member
of the delegation. The discussion was related to his government
work report to the current NPC session before making a speech
himself.
</P>
<P>
The premier voiced his opinions on Beijing's economic
development and other relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, NPC deputies from Beijing said the
government work report gave an accurate summary of last year's
achievements and analyzed existing problems realistically.
</P>
<P>
They added that the tasks and objectives set forth in the
report were clearly defined, and the measures to be taken are
practical and feasible.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li Peng emphasized that efforts should be pooled
to do a good job in conducting reform and effecting the
development of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties faced by some state-owned enterprises are a
concentrated reflection of problems that have accumulated for
decades, he added, and improvement of the enterprises is of great
importance in modernizing China and consolidating its socialist
system.
</P>
<P>
He noted the whole nation has reached consensus that reform of
state-owned enterprises is an urgent, arduous and protracted task,
and experiences have been obtained in the field.
</P>
<P>
"The central authorities have confidence in retooling or
upgrading these state-owned enterprises," the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since problems of the state-owned enterprises are resultant
from both external and internal factors, Li pointed out, they
should be resolved in line with specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his approval of experiments Beijing has
introduced, which featured the combination of enterprise reform
with the adjusted distribution of capitals, labor, and technology,
and the internal management structure.
</P>
<P>
It is a characteristics of market economy that the superior
enterprises excel whereas the inferior ones are eliminated. In the
course of reform process, there will be always mergers,
restructuring or bankruptcy and, therefore, the reform and
development of the state-owned enterprises is a process of
constant advancement.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Li noted, a well-developed social security system
should also be set up to ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his confidence in the reform of state-owned
enterprises, which is bound to succeed under the planning of the
central authorities.
</P>
<P>
On Beijing's development, Beijing has taken new steps in reform
and opening-up and economic development over recent years, and the
overall situation and the popular feeling are stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the requirement of Beijing's own development to do the
work of the city well, the premier noted, and this is also
significant for nationwide reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
As the capital, he added, Beijing is the national political and
cultural center, and a hub for domestic and international
exchanges. Consequently, it should provide normal services for the
Party and government institutions and army headquarters, for
expanding international exchanges, for national education,
scientific, and cultural development, and for facilitating the
work and daily life of the residents.

characteristics in urban development in a bid to give full scope
to its advantages and favorable conditions#,so that solid
foundation can be laid for the city to serve as the national
political and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on the municipal authorities to effect a
change in both economic structure and the mode of economic growth,
focus on improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic
growth, and make progress based on stability.
</P>
<P>
In view of its actual conditions, Li suggested, the capital
should focus on service industry, such as commercial and catering
trades.
</P>
<P>
He asked the municipality to take full advantage of its rich
tourism resources as an ancient capital and strive to promote both
domestic and international tourism.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Beijing's agriculture should focus on increased
application of new technologies in agricultural production so that
better farm and sideline produce can be produced.
</P>
<P>
The premier acknowledged that Beijing should also serve as a
good example for other parts of China to follow by promoting
socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
As a member deputy of the Beijing delegation, he also asked the
municipal authorities to ease the ban on the practice of setting
off fireworks in the urban area by allowing residents in several
neighborhoods to set off fireworks during national festivals.
</P>
<P>
"Especially since Hong Kong's return is in sight, and the
central authorities have decided on a grand celebration to mark
the event," said the premier.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called for developing an objective, comprehensive and correct
understanding of difficulties being faced by state-owned
enterprises so as to work out effective ways to tackle them.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with Shanghai deputies to the National
People's Congress now in session here, Jiang, who is also general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the
Central Military Commission, said that China's state-owned
economic sector has been growing stronger as a whole since
reform began.
</P>
<P>
"China's state-owned enterprises control the lifeline of
the national economy and play a dominant role in national
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said much progress has been made in reform of state
enterprises since the 14th Party Congress. Reform measures include
providing priority support for big enterprises while giving small
ones freedom of operation, allowing mergers and bankruptcies,
alleviating enterprises' social burdens, and diverting their
surplus labor, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided support for, and cultivated the
birth of, a number of large, strong enterprise groups that have
economic vitality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Small enterprises have adopted flexible ways of operation and
have kept developing amid competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, however, acknowledged that a
considerable number of state enterprises face difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"This has become an outstanding issue in our economic life," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay great attention to, correctly handle, and
earnestly tackle, the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang analyzed briefly the causes of difficulties faced by
state enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
"First of all, state-owned enterprises are not yet adapted to
evolving socialist market economics in terms of operational
mechanism and management system.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, they are structurally irrational. The traditional
industrial structure and the traditional product mix are no longer
suited for the change from a sellers' to a buyers' market.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, with the influx of foreign investment and a rapid
rise of township enterprises, competition has become ever
tougher for state-owned enterprises. Repetitive construction of
factories over a long period of time has resulted in a situation
where different areas have the same kind of economic structure,
leading to oversupply of many product lines.
</P>
<P>
"And fourth, owing to historical reasons, state-owned
enterprises suffer from too high a debt burden and shoulder too
heavy social burdens."
</P>
<P>
The fundamental way out for state-owned enterprises is to carry
out reforms, he said, "to develop a new operational mechanism that
is consistent with a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
"Efforts must be made to rectify economic order, standardize
market practices, break regional and departmental barriers, and
oppose unlawful competition, so as to gradually establish a
unified, open and orderly market system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that Shanghai would carry work forward
at the behest of Deng Xiaoping, who proposed the opening up of
Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of Shanghai's work in the past year and
called for recognizing its important position and role.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest cities in China, he said, Shanghai has
developed itself into an economic powerhouse and serves as the
"dragon head" of the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai should lead the rest of the country in reform,
opening to the outside world, and supporting economic development
in central and western regions of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Shanghai should concentrate on economic
restructuring," he said. "Efforts should be made to reorganize its
state-owned sector with a strategic point of view. Particular
attention should be paid to bringing forth a number of large
enterprises and enterprise groups that have a competitive
strength."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Hopes to Normalize Ties With Iran, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today said it does not want
to see diplomatic relations with Iran degraded despite the fact
the two countries have expelled each other's top diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference, Foreign Ministry Deputy
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli, said Turkey hopes to normalize the
Turkish-Iranian relations when the country is concerned about the
mutual interests and security of the two states.
</P>
<P>
He said "Turkey attaches importance to its relations with
Iran," stressing that Turkey has not made any decision to
downgrade its diplomatic level in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Turkey first requested Iran to withdraw its ambassador to
Tehran Muhammed Reza Baqeri and Consul General in Istanbul
Muhammed Reza Rasheed. It then declared Iranian Consul General in
Erzurum Saeeda Zedeh as "persona non grata" on February 27 and
asked him to leave the country within 48 hours, saying the two
Iranian diplomats had interfered with the internal affairs of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry Saturday ordered Turkish
Ambassador Osman Koruturk and Consul General in Orumieh Ufuk
Ozsancak to quit Iran in a tit-for-tat measure against the
Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel sent
Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan as special envoy
to hand over his written message to Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Demirel said his country values close relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Iran should abide by diplomatic norms and
protect each other's security interests, but not to intervene in
other's internal affairs and system, the message said.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Highlight Deng's Ashes Scattered into Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- All Hong Kong-based newspapers
today carried photos and stories about Deng Xiaoping's ashes
having been scattered over the sea.
</P>
<P>
Most of the papers claimed that the scattering of the ashes at
sea manifested Deng's selfless spirit, broad mind and his firm
will for the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Many of the newspapers including the Express News and Hong Kong
 Standard presented maps about Deng's ashes scattering with a
big-character caption: some of Deng's ashes will float through the
 Taiwan Straits and to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A feature on the front page of the Express News said that Deng
had wished to see Hong Kong's returning to her motherland before
his death. Now his ashes are likely to drift to the seas around
Hong Kong, thus fulfilling his wishes.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao published a commentary titled "the Hong Kong People
 Always Remember Deng Xiaoping's Kindness," stressing Deng's great
 contributions to the development of Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that it is Deng Xiaoping's concept and
principle of "One Country, Two Systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "high-degree autonomy" that led to the
solution of the Hong Kong question, the signing of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong, and
the promulgation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It said that due to Deng's strategic plan for China's economic
reforms and opening to the outside world, China has witnessed a
sustained and fast growth and in turn, Hong Kong met with great
opportunities in development.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Hong Kong people are now confident in Hong
Kong's future, for the is a strong backing from her motherland.
</P>
<P>
It noted that under the guideline of the set principle of "One
Country, Two Systems" and with the support from the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China with Jiang Zemin at its
core and from the central government, Hong Kong will enter the
21st century with increasing prosperity and stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba asked all lawmakers to cooperate with the government
in approving a bill on decentralization when the parliament began
its 11th session today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the lower house today, Deuba said the
decentralization bill, which is expected to give more autonomy to
local administration bodies, will help provide relief to local
people who are still deprived of basic requirements like drinking
water, roads and health service.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's three-party government has decided to postpone the
local elections, which were originally scheduled to conclude by
mid-April, till after the introduction of new decentralization
laws.
</P>
<P>
The government will present the decentralization bill to the
on-going winter session for approval, Deuba said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will also seek a vote of confidence for his
government in the house during the winter session as the
government had been reduced to a minority status by an opposition
challenge last December.
</P>
<P>
Deuba is scheduled to table a motion on the vote of confidence
in the 205-seat lower house when the session resumes on Thursday,

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Leader On Learning from Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
standing committee of the CPC Central Committee's Politburo, said
today that the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics must be held high and the
Party's
 line and principles upheld.
</P>
<P>
All party comrades, especially leading cadres of all levels,
should be under the strong leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and should follow the will
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking the opening of the Central Party School's
new semester, Hu called on the leading cadres to learn from Deng
and his way of observing both the international and domestic
situation. Deng was far-sighted and always observed the situation
scientifically, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should follow the teachings of Comrade Deng Xiaoping to
concentrate all force and wisdom on pushing the sustained, rapid
and healthy development of the national economy forward," Hu told
the participants who were teachers and students in the school.
</P>
<P>
The main task for this year is to maintain social stability and
smoothly push forward the reforms, opening up, and modernization
drive, according to Hu, who quoted Deng in pointing out that the
number one issue in China is stability.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also president of the school, called on leading cadres
throughout China to keep an open mind and to eliminate any factor
that could affect stability. He stressed the building of a
high-quality army of cadres and accelerating the anti-corruption
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The participants honored Deng with a three-minute silence at
the beginning of the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> More People in North China Bidding Farewell to Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province in
the Loess Plateau had some success in poverty relief last year,
helping 1.04 million people get adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics at the end of 1996, 1.54 million poor
people, more than 40 percent of the province's total, escaped
poverty since the nationwide anti-poverty project began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The province invested 830 million yuan in poverty-stricken
areas last year, providing clean water for 270,000 people and
electricity to 122 villages, and building 1,500 kilometres of
roads.
</P>
<P>
Education has remarkably improved in mountainous regions, with
all schools in caves being replaced by new buildings.
</P>
<P>
Priority was also given to farmland improvements, spreading the
use of plastic sheeting and developing economic forests in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year's unprecedented poverty relief measures were the
result of a "number one man project", that is, heads at all
government, including party secretaries and governors, assumed
responsibility for designated townships or villages.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 21,000 officials were sent to help poor
people and as a result one million peasants received scientific
and technological training. The province's poverty relief
department says that peasants in all its 50 poorest counties had
955 yuan net income per capita in 1996, a 27.7 percent increase
over the previous year, and 437 kilograms of grain, up 38
percent. enditem

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese Province Makes Progress in Anti-Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- In 1996, Southwest China's Yunnan
Province made substantial progress in its anti-poverty efforts
with the help of 10 state organs, including the Foreign Ministry
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the 10 units began their assistance
in the early 90s in response to a call by the central government,
and have provided poverty-stricken areas in the province with
funds, technology and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials in these state departments lead their
anti-poverty teams to the areas to help them map out development
blueprints. With their help, a large number of professionals have
been introduced to the province from other parts of the
country. In 1996 alone, nearly 200 such persons came, bringing
over 20 major technological items.
</P>
<P>
Last year, these state organs organized more than 190 training
courses and trained more than 5,000 local people. In the same
year, these units put over 70 million yuan in funds into the poor
areas and helped introduce over 94 million yuan from other parts
of the country and foreign countries and international donors.
</P>
<P>
Some local provincial government officials told Xinhua that the
funds, technology, and professional help brought in by the state
departments have been very helpful for the local anti-poverty
efforts, and that in 1995 the province had 6.6 million poor
people, mostly living in remote, mountainous areas, but in 1996,
1.2 million had gotten out of poverty, much more than the annual
average of 500,000 in previous years.

<HEADLINE> Qiao on Agriculture, Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
today called for continued efforts to reinforce the fundmental
basis of agriculture in the national economy, and to reform
township enterprises to adapt to the market development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made the call when attending a group
discussion of the Zhejiang deputies of the Fifth Session of the
Eighth NPC, who were deliberating Premier Li Peng's government
work report.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot to do to enhance the foundation of
agriculture in the national economic development in spite of good
harvests for years running," Qiao said after hearing views and
suggestions from the deputies
</P>
<P>
The relatively good farm yields last year indicate that the
efforts to strengthen agricultural development were effective and
the weather conditions generally helpful, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the climate conditions would not be always
good yearly#,so that the vigilance must never be slackened, but
preparedness to deal with natural adversities be enhanced," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
"In a populous country like China, if fluctuations occur in
agriculture and its grain production, that would be a major
problem and the whole world would be affected," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"All work should be done well and meticulously, from grain
production, processing, purchase and storage," he noted, saying
that "grain procurement is especially important, for it directly
concerns the enthusiasm of farmers for grain production."
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is explicit and farmers should be made to feel it
difficult to sell surplus grain, and all related problems and
loopholes must be carefully addressed," Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's township or village run enterprises, Qiao
said that these enterprises have scored a rapid growth these
years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "township and village-run enterprises are now
confronted with a new situation and some problems regarding their
adaptation to socialist market economy, and on how to stand the
test of increasingly fierce market competition, and to shift its
growth mode from being extensive to intensive, as well as on how
to conduct in-depth reform, improve their product quality and
upgrade their management."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "It is essential to look into the development of
township enterprises and absorb good experience in this regard
from different areas," Qiao said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Rain season is expected to be
delayed for a month in most areas in Uganda, and the delay could
deteriorate food situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
S. A. K. Magezi, the Commissioner of the Uganda Meteorology
Department, said rain season will run from April to June this
year, instead of from March to May, the local English daily ''The
New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The current prolonged dry spells are expected to deteriorate
food situation in the country, especially in the east, which is
experiecing famine now, he said.
</P>
<P>
Valdo Odeke, the Agriculture Officer of Eastern District of
Kumi, said people of eight of the 16 counties of his district are
already starving, adding that many people have one meal a day
while others eat once in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Ogole Meselamy, the Agriculture Official in charge of
monitoring and evaluation in the district, said bad harvest in
his district was caused first by water logging and then by acute
drought last year.
</P>
<P>
Reports from another eastern Diestrict of Kamuli said efforts
to grow food were frustrated by the drought in recent months. Mosaic
disease devastated cassava and other crops in the area.
</P>
<P>
In another eastern District of Pallisa, local councils began
registering needy families last month for any possible
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the north and the west said famine loomed there
partially due to long drought. enditem

<HEADLINE> Fake Silver Coins Made in China's Soviet Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Soviet Republic set
up 70 years ago made copies of Mexican silver coins to use in
areas under Kuomintang rule, according to a Chinese coin collector.
</P>
<P>
The republic was attempting to break an economic blockade set
up by the Kuomintang, said Li Nianchun, vice-secretary of the
Numismatic Society in Ganzhou in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The republic, set up by the Communist Red Army on Jinggangshan
Mountain in Jiangxi in 1927, invited craftsmen from south China's
Guangdong Province to copy the Mexican silver coins to use them in
Kuomintang ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
To distinguish the fakes from the originals, the Chinese
character "gong" (worker) was cast on them, which, because it was
hard to detect, did not prevent their being used in Kuomintang
controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to coin experts, even banks at that time
accepted the spurious silver coins, if they contained enough
silver. The silver for making the copies was confiscated from
local landlords.
</P>
<P>
Li published his findings recently in an illustrated book on
coins made by the Soviet authorities of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
His book has been received well by experts who say that it
fills a blank in the history of Chinese money.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a manager of a business group of the Ganzhou Branch
of the People's Bank of China, wrote a total of 400,000 characters
on the subject after 20 years of study on the history of Chinese
money-making.

BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Internet is being widely used by
right-wing extremists in Germany to gather information on neo-Nazi
organizations worldwide, the German media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Computer samplings on the Internet have found thousands of
contact addresses and telephone numbers of right-wing extremist
organizations, Nazi symbols and slogans, such as "Skinhead Front,"
"Storm Front," and "Aryan Crusaders," according to a report by the
German news agency DPA.
</P>
<P>
German police said a U.S.- based extremist group known as White
Aryan Resistance, which preaches white supremacy, is one of
numerous far-right organizations using the Internet to publicize
its activities.
</P>
<P>
A computer specialist was quoted by the German daily Bild as
saying that the Internet was currently being "swamped by
right-wing propaganda, above all from the U.S. and Canada."
</P>

German officials said far-right organizations in the country
were profiting from such information. They also feared that

HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Local and overseas scientists
will exchange their views in the study of global and regional air
pollution at a seminar to be opened here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Hosted by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the
Atmospheric Chemistry Workshop is to study issues such as global
warming and climate change. Some 50 atmospheric scientists from
the United States, Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong will take
part in the four-day academic event.
</P>
<P>
Air quality has become a concern for many Asian cities, where
rapid economic and population growth has led to drastically rising
 emission of air pollutants. That is why one of the main topics at
 the workshop will be on a regional air monitoring project now
being undertaken by the Atmospheric Research Group of the PolyU.
</P>
<P>
A report will be presented on the research results, which will
have
 far-reaching implications for the assessments of climate change,
chemistry and transport of airborne pollutants and urban air
quality in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States will report their findings
from an air mission conducted in 1994, when a U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration aircraft was used to
undertake studies on air chemistry over the West Pacific at many

Nazarbayev today fired Education Minister Murat Zhurinov and
Culture Minister Talgat Mamashev for abusing their power for
personal gain when deciding on the list of students to study

Mamashev for their failure to promote the country's culture and
education while they were in office, the Kazakhstan Telegraph

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Expresses Concern Over Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif expressed deep concern over the bomb blast which damaged
the office of a newspaper in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said in an official handout that the blast, which ripped
through the office of the Urdu language newspaper Qaumi Akhbar
early today, amounts to an assault on the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked the Sindh provincial authorities to
probe into the incident and apprehend the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Two employees of Qaumi Akhbar were slightly injured when a
time-bomb went off at 5:53 a.m. in the newspaper's building in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister of Sindh province, Liaquat Ali Jatoi, earlier
ordered an inquiry into the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The government will take necessary measures for the enforcement
of law and order in Karachi, the Sindh capital and Pakistan's
largest city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though resulting in minor casualties, the extent of damage
caused by the blast was estimated by the executive editor of the
newspaper, Mukhtar Aqil, at 10 million rupees (250,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's offices, nearby rooms, newly acquired
computers, air conditioners and other equipment were damaged in
the blast, Aqil was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
No group or people has claimed responsibility so far for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the bomb disposal experts discovered that the
bomb was a home-made device of 400 gram TNT with a timer.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was placed on the first floor and its impact made a 14
inch diameter hole, the sources quoted the bomb experts saying.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there were no staff in the office when the bomb
ripped through the office, causing major damage to the equipment
in the room, the sources said. The staff usually come to office at
around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Local police in Karachi are investigating the incident.

SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China now ranks second in the
world in term of overall electricity capacity, with a modern power
industry taking shape, according to Shi Dazhen, the minister of
Power Industry.
</P>
<P>
Shi said recently in Shanghai that China generated 1.075
trillion kilowatt hours of electricity last year, and there are
now 12 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions where
electricity is available in every village.
</P>
<P>
China has seen quick growth in its power industry in recent
years, and the tension between supply and demand in power has
eased up, he said. The country will realize the goal of bringing
electricity to 95 percent of its rural families and make it
available in every county by the year 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
Construction has started on two nuclear power units for the
second stage of the country's Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in
Zhejiang Province, each with a generating capacity of 600,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China will start issuing bonds for power industry enterprises
to raise funds and will speed up the listing of those enterprises
on the stock market this year, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, China has utilized 12 billion US
dollars in foreign investment in its power industry.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China will focus on clarifying the relationship
between the state power industry and its major subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Concerned About Urban Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- While giving high credit to
government achievement in poverty relief in the countryside,
Chinese legislators today voiced their concern about an increasing
number of urban residents in China falling into economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
As China deepens enterprise reforms, some workers have been
displaced, and this, coupled with the failure of service
industries to create enough job opportunities, has landed some of
them in economic difficulties, said deputies to the Eight National
People's Congress (NPC), which has been in session since last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangguo, an NPC deputy and secretary of Wanxian Municipal
Party Committee in Sichuan Province, said that the number of
people living below the poverty line in rural areas of Wanxian has
come down to 920,000 from 2.9 million and that it will not be a
problem to eliminate rural poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"But, what worries me is that the number of urban poor is
increasing as more workers are displaced," Chen said, pledging to
put urban poverty relief on the local government's work agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We should not bring the issue of urban poverty into the 21st
century," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In response to the concern of the deputies, Doj Cering,
Minister of Civil Affairs, said the central government has already
begun paying attention to poverty relief in cities while doing a
great deal to eliminate destitution in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The central government has built "three defense lines" for
reducing urban poverty, namely, establishing an unemployment
insurance fund, stipulating a minimum wage, and establishing a
system that ensures a minimum standard of living in urban areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng said earlier this week in his
government work report, "We must take care of employees, including
retired ones, of enterprises which have completely or partially
suspended production, helping them overcome livelihood-related
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Zhao Chunmei, a worker of Chongqing No. 2 Textile Mill, said
many of her fellow workers are living on a subsistence monthly
wage of 120 yuan (about 15 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are some other factories like the textile mill in
Chongqing and other large industrial cities.
</P>
<P>
To resolve urban poverty, there must be a combination of
"outside help" and "internal effort," Zhao said, adding that
Chinese workers need to update their ideas and work in whatever
sectors that offer jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing city government has eased restrictions on
business starts to encourage more poor urban residents to make a
living on their own, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Doj Cering said that more than two million people in 137 cities
nationwide have been covered by the minimum standard
of living system.
</P>
<P>
"For an ultimate solution to the problem of urban poverty, we
must rely on economic development and re-employment programs," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Minister On Sino-US Joint Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- At a seminar in Beijing this
afternoon to mark the 25th anniversary of the Sino-US Shanghai
Joint Communique, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
said that Sino-US relations can make further progress, so long as
the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques are observed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that 25 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou
Enlai, and President Nixon, with courage and vision as statesmen,
opened the door for Sino-US relations and the Sino-US Shanghai
Joint Communique stands as the first milestone on the road to
normalization of China-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"The communique provides the fundamental guiding principles for
Sino-US relations, namely, that countries, regardless of their
social systems, should handle their relations on the basis of the
principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality
and mutual benefits, and peaceful coexistence," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The US side acknowledges that there is only one China, and that
Taiwan is a part of China, Qian said, and that these principles
have been reaffirmed in the joint communique on the establishment
of diplomatic relations and in the August 17 communique between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 25 years, under the guidance of these principles,
Sino-US relations have as a whole continued to improve, despite
twists and turns," he said, and "the development of Sino-US
relations has brought tangible benefits to the Chinese and
American people and has helped promote peace, stability, and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
History has proven yet again the great vitality of the three
Sino-US joint communiques, which can stand the test of time. And
as long as the principles enshrined in them are observed, Qian
pointed out, the Sino-US relations will move forward.
</P>
<P>
emphasizing that, as permanent members of the UN Security
Council and major nuclear powers, China and the US have important
responsibilities in safeguarding global and regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The development of mutually-beneficial cooperation and trade
between China, the biggest developing country in the world, and
the US, the biggest developed country, not only serves the
economic interests of the two countries, but also contributes to
the prosperity of the region and the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, under the new circumstances," he said, "the need
for pushing forward the Sino-US relations is increasing instead of
decreasing, and the potential for strengthening cooperation
between the two countries in various fields is expanding instead
of shrinking."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the key to steady development of Sino-US
relations is properly handling the question of Taiwan. This
question is related to China's sovereignty, territorial integrity
and reunification, and it touches the national sentiments of the
1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The three Sino-US joint communiques have set the guiding
principles in handling the Taiwan question, he noted, saying that
we hope this principle will be strictly observed so that this
question will not become an obstacle to the development of Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
A delegation led by Barber Conable Jr, chairman of the National
Committee on US-China Relations, and Robert McNamara, former US
defense secretary, attended the seminar, which was sponsored by
the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
In speaking of the historical contribution of the Sino-US
Shanghai joint communique, Conable said that the 25 years have
seen remarkable progress in Sino-US relations, and that the
communique laid a solid foundation for US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar's purpose is to help secure bilateral ties and to
mark the historical event 25 year ago, and also to advance the the
bilateral relations, Conable said.

<HEADLINE> Renault Chief to Go to Belgium to Talk on Plant Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Louis Schweitzer, the president of
the Renault auto group, will go to Vilvoorde, Belgium, to meet
with the local enterprise council members who are angry at the
decision by Renault to close the plant in Vilvoorde.
</P>
<P>
But the date of such a meeting with representatives of the
staff of the Vilvoorde plant remains undecided, said Renault today.
</P>
<P>
Renault announced last Friday that it will close in July the
Vilvoorde plant, its oldest overseas workshop, in a restructuring
program aimed at cutting heavy deficits and strengthen competition.
</P>
<P>
The closure will result in the mass lay-off of 3,100 local
workers.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a unionist of Vilvoorde
as saying that Schweitzer will meet with representatives of the
Renault Industrie Belgique on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government is angry at Renault's decision and is
trying to prevent it from closing the plant.
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer reaffirmed his decision last Saturday in Brussels to
close the Vilvoorde plant, which was established in 1925.

<HEADLINE>   Palestinians Hold General Strike Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip are holding a one-day general strike
today in protest against an Israeli government's decision to build
a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As called by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), all
stores and places of business are closed throughout the
Palestinian autonomous areas, as well as in East Jerusalem,
Palestinian Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Israeli government approved the
controversial plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes, in addition to
construct more housing for the Palestinians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for what will ultimately be 6,500 units in
the southern Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa (Jabal Abu
Ghneim), of which 2,450 will be completed in the first three
years.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, the government said it would start to build
3,015 units for Palestinians in 10 existing neighborhoods within
the city limits, though it would boost that number to 9,000
units over an unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the building plan,
saying the Israeli government's decision is a violation of law
and its agreements with the Palestinians, and has put the
peace process in danger.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat called on the U.N. Security
Council and the Arab League to help stop the construction in
Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa issue is surely to be stressed in this
week's meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Arafat, who arrived in Washington earlier today for an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had expressed its "disappointment" last week over the
Israeli government's decision to go ahead with the construction
of the new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Work of Preparatory Committee for HK SAR Praised by Legislator (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator today praised
the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) for its contributions to Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch
and a deputy to the Eighth National People's Congress, proposed
that the NPC, China's top legislature, fully affirm the work of
the preparatory committee since its establishment a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With the authorization of the NPC, the Preparatory Committee of
the HKSAR has done a great deal of beneficial and effective work
for the founding of the Hong Kong SAR, contributing positively to
the smooth transfer of Hong Kong's political power," Zhou said at
a panel discussion of the Guangdong delegation to the current NPC
session.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that in retrospect, the establishment of the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee was
entirely necessary and timely, which has won both the time and
initiative for the work in preparations for the founding of the
Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a non-cooperative attitude on the Hong Kong issue by
the British side, and the unilateral implementation of its
so-called Constitutional Package, the NPC Standing Committee
decided to establish in 1993 the Preliminary Working Committee
composed of representative figures from all strata in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in January 1996, Zhou noted, the
preparatory committee has adopted resolutions on political,
economic, legal, and social, education, cultural and other major
issues in compliance with President Jiang Zemin's principles of
"taking ourselves as the mainstay" and "facing to the Hong Kong
people and relying on them", after repeated inquiries and adoption
of reasonable proposals from the Hong Kong people, and
accomplished the election of the first chief executive of the Hong
Kong SAR and its provisional legislative council.

<P>
"The election of the first chief executive and the Provisional
Legislative Council not only helps to form the basic framework for
the future SAR government, but will be advantageous to Hong Kong's
smooth transition, thus drawing widespread welcome from various
strata in Hong Kong," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing ups and downs since the signing of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and the present good
situation, he stressed the farsightedness of Deng Xiaoping's
concept of 'one country, two systems'and the importance of his
instructions on how to deal with the problems that might occur
during the transition period, and the correct leadership of the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and its
determination to implement a series of principles and policies
concerning the issue during a new period after Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also paid tribute to the Hong Kong people for their high
sense of responsibility and enthusiasm they have shown in
safeguarding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and active
support and involvement in the work of preparations for the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
There is still much to do in the next 100 days, and the
Preparatory Committee will define the method of producing the
SAR's first legislative council.
</P>
<P>
With the first chief executive and the Provisional Council in
office, Zhou said, "we should vigorously support them in
performing their duties, in an effort to help guarantee Hong
Kong's smooth transition and safeguard its long-term prosperity
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the central government has also worked out
a series of principles, which require government departments in
the interior areas to strictly follow the Basic Law of the HKSAR
when dealing with affairs concerning Hong Kong after its return,
so as to ensure the all-round implementation of the concept of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong's mutually-beneficial, cooperative ties
with the interior areas is sure to scale a new height and enter
into a new period, and the great cause of the motherland's
reunification will certainly be achieved steadily and there is a
great hope for invigorating the Chinese nation, Zhou Nan said.

LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will today launch a family
economic advancement program to promote rural development
through the advancement of the economy of individual families.
</P>
<P>
The first lady, Maryam Abacha, is expected to unfold the
blue-print of the program at the International Conference Center

</P>
<P>
A month ago, Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha

billion Naira (about 54 million U.S. Dollars) for the
implementation of the program this year.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the money will be used as soft revolving
loans and advances to cooperative societies at ward levels for
the establishment of cottage industries.

fairly successful in the areas of health, education and welfare
for the disabled, women and children.

Speaking to the official "New Nigerian" newspaper, Professor

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM's Envoy to Visit Damascus After Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A top advisor to Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, announced here this afternoon that he
will visit Damascus after talks in Beirut on the "Red Army" case.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Hirabyashi, the Japanese envoy, announced that the
identities of some Japanese citizens detained by the Lebanese
authorities half a month ago will be made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hirabyashi, the Japanese prime minister's advisor for foreign
relations, made the announcements at the end of a meeting with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz at the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He described the 40-minute talks with the Lebanese foreign
minister as "fruitful," noting that the talks dealt with
bilateral relations and the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The case of the "Red Army" was figured high during the meeting,
Hirabyashi told reporters, noting that the two sides agreed that
this case should be handled "in a suitable and positive way in
which the two countries' laws are respected."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official clarified that the Lebanese government
has decided to "very positively cope with this issue."
</P>
<P>
He added that he was waiting for the last results of
the investigations by the Lebanese and Japanese judicial
authorities to distinguish the identities of those arrested in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hirabyashi announced that he will visit Damascus and have
talks with Syrian officials on bilateral relations, the Middle
East peace process and "probably the issue of the detainees in
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Syria, with some 35,000 troops deployed on most of the
Lebanon's land, often plays a major role in settling problems
in this country.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official, who arrived in Beirut last night,
conveyed to the Lebanese prime minister a letter from
Hashimoto pertaining to the Japanese citizens detained
in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Hirabyashi was carrying evidences,
including fingerprint analysis, to prove that some of the
Japanese arrested by the Lebanese authorities are members of
the "Red Army."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials denied last week that the security forces
had taken any members of the Japanese "Red Army" into
custody.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Lebanese authorities detained
seven members of the "Red Army" in a search-and-arrest campaign
in the capital on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The radical Japanese group is accused of responsibility for a
series of bloody terror attacks in the Middle East and elsewhere
in the 1970s and 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors in Nigeria are
repatriating large sums of money home following the removal of
certain restrictions on foreign exchanges by the government.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Vanguard", a major Nigerian newspaper, reported that
the flight of capital has created increasing demands at the
country's Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market since January 20.
</P>
<P>
When the Central Bank of Nigeria intervened in the market for
the first time in 1997, the demand was only 76,000 U.S. Dollars,
but later it soared all the way to 90.4 million U.S. Dollars,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Financial Minister Anthony Ani announced in the government's
1997 budget the lift of the original limitation of personal
traveling allowance to a maximum of 500 U.S. Dollars every adult
and business traveling allowance to 5,000 U.S. Dollars per year
for each company.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the removal of the limitation of home
remittances by foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
The report said there has been a significant rise in the
number of applications for personal and business traveling
allowances since the budget was announced.
</P>
<P>
It called the removal of the restrictions a major loophole in
the 1997 budget and expressed the worry over the flight of
foreign capital.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests 50 Spies in Northwest Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces arrested
50 spies in West Azarbaijan province bordering with Turkey in
the past 11 months, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Information Ministry's office in Orumiyeh, capital of the
province, said that 50 spies and members of six espionage
networks have been identified and arrested.
</P>
<P>
The office said that those arrested had put confidential
and classified information of government organizations at the
disposal of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
They have also taken pictures from sensitive and military areas
and collected information on these places. The spies have
confessed to their crimes and been tried at court, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the office did not point their finger to specific
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"Propagation of western culture" is among the charges brought
against the group of spies, according to the office.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian security authorities
indirectly referred to neighboring Turkey shortly after the
Tehran government expelled Turkish Ambassador Osman Koruturk and
Consul General Ufuk Ozsancak Saturday in a tit-for-tat measure
against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the past seven years for the
two countries to expel their top diplomats each other.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri and Consul
General to Istanbul Mohammad Reza Rashedi were expelled from
Turkey last week for their statement about Islam and
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the spies, some 10 other people have been
arrested by the Information Ministry in Orumiyeh for being
"agents of the western cultural assaults."
</P>
<P>
The group was said to have been involved in distributing
5,000 pieces of indecent photographs in the province. Some 10
satellite dishes were confiscated from the group as well.
</P>
<P>
Sharing a long border with Turkey, West Azarbaijan province
has consistently had such serious problems as espionage,
unlawful ownership of weapons and smuggling of narcotics and
other contraband items.

PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- France remains committed to a Europe

He was responding to concerns expressed by British Foreign

He said this community implies that "these nations are ready to

<HEADLINE> Only 19 Rally Cars Start Final Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Only 19 of the original 51 Safari
Rally cars have survived to start the final leg Monday morning,
and the factory teams have been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
Britain Colin McRae took his Subaru Impreza and a six-minute
lead into the first section, ahead of compatriot Richard Burns in
the lone Ralliart Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
Both Cars are reported fully fit after extensive service at the
end of the second day of the three-day Safari Rally, round three
of the World Rally Championships.
</P>
<P>
Local driver Ian Duncan, in the Toyota Team Kenya Celica, is
only two minutes further behind and has been right on the pace
throughout the event despite off-spec suspension from the the end
of the second leg.
</P>
<P>
The only other main team car still running is the Ford Escort
of Armin Schwarz, who was with a deficit of more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
Prederic Dor (Subaru) and Emmanuel Katto (Toyota) have a
three-day tussle to sort out to see who will be runner-up in that
category.
</P>
<P>
Johnney Hellier in a Subaru has only to avoid disasters to take
the GP N honors with a lead of nearly an hour over the GP N
Daewoo Clelo of Azar Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar has the considerable consolation of leading the 2-litre
Cup class, and as the only survivor of the four-car Daewoo team
his priority will be to maintain that position.
</P>
<P>
Although only 19 cars started the third leg, there are still 12
different nationalities in the cockpits.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean civil war is less than
140 km from the Zambian border, according to today's Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted unconfirmed reports as saying that the fleeing
Zairean government soldiers are heading for Zambia's Copperbelt
and Luapula provinces bordering Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government soldiers, most of whom are heading for
Lubumbashi, 60 km from Copperbelt's border towns of Chingola and
Chililabombwe, were reportedly looting villages and towns and
selling arms to feed themselves as they run away from a rebel
advance which was at present at Kamina district of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Fleeing Assistant District Commissioner of Kamina, Kasuka
Bundala, said at the weekend that the rebel advance coming from
the north had pushed Zaire's government forces towards the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes Japan for Following US Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official today
criticized Japan for following U.S. policy in postponing the
implementation of the Iraqi-U.N. "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the Trade Ministry, Trade
Minister Mohammed Mehdi Salsh said the Japanese government has
been used by the U.S. in obstructing the approval of contracts
submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. uses Japan, with a representative in the sanctions
committee, to hold the contracts", said the minister, adding
that this is a means of the U.S. to delay the implementation of
the "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Japanese companies will pay for the
pro-U.S. policy, Salsh said: "The Japanese government has damaged
 the reputation of Japanese companies. There will be no
potentials for them to find commercial chances in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Iraq to criticize Japan publicly
since the implementation of the deal signed between Iraq and the
U.N. last May.
</P>
<P>
Salsh also accused the U.S. and Britain of deliberately making
obstacles for the implementation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Iraq has submitted to the
U.N. Sanctions Committee 222 contracts up till now, but only
nine of them have been approved.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to finance its purchase
for food and medicine badly needed in Iraq because of the over
six-year-long sanctions imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security
Council following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Outlines New Agenda For Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today outlined a new agenda for the nation's oceans,
promoting exploitation of resources but also pledging new marine
reserves and some areas to be dedicated to conservation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament, Howard announced 106 million Australian
dollars (81.62 million US dollars) of funding for a series of
programs dealing with marine and coastal management.
</P>
<P>
These include a program to improve co-ordination of planning
for the nation's coastal and marine zones, a key recommendation of
a 1993 Resource Assessment Commission coastal zone inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The government will also fund a project to examine the
feasibility of using satellites to monitor fishing in Australia's
waters in a bid to crack down on illegal fishing, particularly in
the far Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Industries related to the country's ocean resources are worth
around 30 billion Australian dollars (23.1 billion US dollars) a
year, including the offshore oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the offshore oil and gas industry needed
sufficient freedom to invest, particularly as Australia would
become increasingly dependent on domestic supplies in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that exploitation of resources had to be
responsible, otherwise both the environment and future job
opportunities would be damaged.
</P>
<P>
Howard released a consultation paper designed to promote public
debate, and will release a detailed options paper mid-year with
the aim of finalizing a national oceans policy in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tycoon on Hong Kong Stability and Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong tycoon Henry Ying Tung
Fok said here today that Hong Kong will play a significant
role in China's modernization process, and will have more
opportunities of development with the backing of the powerful
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Fok is attending sessions of the Eighth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC) and the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). He
is vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and also a
deputy to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland is a
great event for Hong Kong, for the Chinese nation, and for the
whole world as well," he said at a meeting of the NPC delegation
from south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that the return of Hong Kong marks the start of a new
era in Hong Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
"For Hong Kong, the age of 'Letters Patent' and 'Royal
Instructions' has come to an end, and we should by no means let
these outdated laws constrain the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). This is a principle of
critical importance to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the election of Tung Chee-hwa as the first Chief
Executive of the HKSAR has been welcomed and accepted by people
from various circles of Hong Kong, most of whom believe that Tung
is the right choice for HKSAR's leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe that the leadership of the HKSAR is
trustworthy, and has the ability to manage Hong Kong well and
promote Hong Kong's development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in recent years many Hong Kong residents who had
emigrated to foreign countries have returned to the land, because
they share deep affections for Hong Kong and the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for us to do to maintain Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability is to unite the general public
of Hong Kong, and we must be principled, reasonable, tolerant, and
able to distinguish between right and wrong while seeking unity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is possible that some people can't understand some
policies of the HKSAR government for a while, but after hearing
clear and patient explanations, most of these people will
gradually understand and accept the policies.
</P>
<P>
"As for those attacking the HKSAR government with vicious
intentions, no matter how well they disguise themselves, they
will not be able to stand the test of time. Time will expose
their nature," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM's Envoy Meets Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An envoy of Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto held a meeting here this morning with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on the arrest of some
allegedly Japanese "Red Army" members in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Hirabyashi, who arrived in Beirut Sunday night,
conveyed to the Lebanese prime minister a letter from Hashimoto,
according to sources in Hariri's Beirut residence where the
meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the anonymous sources said, the Japanese
premier thanked his Lebanese counterpart for the latter's
"personal interference" in the "Red Army" case.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto stressed that if it is proved that the Japanese
arrested by the Lebanese authorities more than half a month ago
are members of the "Red Army," "they should be treated as
criminals in accordance with international laws."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 30-minute meeting, the Japanese envoy
announced that he discussed with Hariri how to promote the
bilateral relations, especially on the economic and political
levels.
</P>
<P>
On the case of the Japanese "Red Army," the Japanese official
said that he reached an agreement with the Lebanese prime minister
that this case should be handled "on the basis of the laws in
Lebanon and Japan and on the basis of the international laws."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the identities of these people should
be distinguished and the Lebanese and Japanese governments are
working together in this framework in order to reach results "as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Being reminded that there is no treaty of extraditing
criminals between the two states, the Japanese envoy said that
after finding out those people's identities, "we will see how to
cope with this problem in a way satisfying the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Hirabyashi is expected to have meetings later today with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and President Elias
Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Hirabyashi was carrying evidences that
some of the Japanese arrested by the Lebanese authorities are
members of the "Red Army."
</P>
<P>
A senior Lebanese judicial official expected that the
Japanese envoy will present results of fingerprint analysis
conducted by Japanese investigators.
</P>
<P>
Michel Al-Murr, Lebanon's Vice Prime Minister and Interior
Minister, and Adnan Addoum, the country's state prosecutor,
denied last week that the security forces had taken any members
of the "Red Army" into custody.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Lebanese authorities detained up
to seven members of the "Red Army" in a search-and-arrest
campaign in the capital on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The radical Japanese group is accused of responsibility for a
series of bloody terror attacks in the Middle East and elsewhere
in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto said Saturday he was
puzzled over the handling of the "Red Army" case and was seeking
answers after contradictory statements by senior Lebanese
officials.

<HEADLINE> Second APEC Fair Due in Yantai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Overseas businessmen will flock to
Yantai, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, to
attend the second international fair of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation, scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 800 overseas businessmen from nine out of the 18
APEC member countries, including Japan, the United States, New
Zealand, Singapore, Australia, and China, have registered to come
to the fair, according to Wang Dehe, director of the organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
Official and corporate representatives from 20 non-APEC
countries and regions, such as Europe, the Middle East and Latin
America also applied to join the gathering, he added.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the total number of overseas participants is
expected to reach 3,000 to 5,000. There will be between 500 and
700 booths set up for the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, one of the coastal cities which opened to overseas
investment in the 1980s, plans to introduce 1,000 cooperative
projects at the fair and achieve a trade volume of one billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
To offer better back-up services, the municipal government of
Yantai is to provide 50-80 free rooms for commercial talks. A
700-million-yuan international trade mart and a
10,000-square-meter square, due to be completed at the end of
this month, will house incoming guests.
</P>
<P>
Yantai has established close economic ties with APEC
members. Of its 2.7-billion-dollar trade volume posted last year,
85 percent was gained from APEC members. Some 90 percent of the
2.8 billion dollars of overseas investment actually used by the
city was from APEC members.
</P>
<P>
The first APEC international fair was held in Osaka, Japan in
1994, with 260 booths.

officials and wealthy businessmen from their hometown in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists, who have also found carvings, painted
pillars, cross beams, and wall paintings at the site, say that the
find will contribute to the study of the economy of the Qing
Dynasty when businessmen from Shanxi played an active role across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The hall, which was named 'Jindu' ('Shanxi Capital'), was built
235 years ago and was the first guild hall built by Shanxi people
in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Guild halls, which started in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), were
agencies set up by people from the same place in other parts of
China who used the halls for gatherings, worship, putting on
plays, conducting business, and for lodgings.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Shandong Prosper through Patent Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The word "patent" was unknown to
most Chinese farmers in the days before the rural reforms,
initiated by the late senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the introduction of a market economy, farmers not
only know what patents are, they are making money from them.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Sijiazhuang Village outside the city of Penglai, in
east China's Shandong Province, have earned 280 million yuan (33.7
million US dollars) by selling patented products, and turned over
30 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars) in tax revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas around Yantai, more than 2,000
newly-patented technological methods were used for agricultural
production during the 1992-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
As poorly-educated farmers had difficulty creating inventions
on their own, Shandong farmers bought patents from other parts of
the country, invited talented personnel to the province and
trained their own inventors.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 100 young farmers in Sijiazhuang
have been sent to the prestigious Chinese universities such as
Beijing University and Qinghua University. The farmers have
invented 11 patents, among which is the instrument used for
lowering craniocerebral temperature in emergency cases. The device
won a prize for scientific and technological progress from the
provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, village farmers started to transfer their patents, which
not only benefited their own factories, but also brought in hefty
profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in the city of Shanghai
have developed a new medical procedure that can guarantee the fast
and accurate detection of viral myocarditis.
</P>
<P>
Doctors around the world have been diagnosing the disease with
the use of antibodies, proteins and enzymes which are related to
the virus causing myocarditis. The detection process may take as
many as three days.
</P>
<P>
Using a chemical made from polypeptides, Chinese doctors are
now able to easily and reliably detect the disease in just one
day, according to Yang Yingzhen, a professor who has conducted the
research.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the new method requires no complex and
expensive medical equipment, so it can be carried out in small
hospitals, said Yang Yingzhen, who works at the Zhongshan Hospital
attached to the Shanghai Medical University.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the method is also expected to be used in the
detection of some other diseases.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Leader Warns against Dalai's Visit to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Puchu, president of the
Buddhist Association of China, has severely criticised the Dalai
Lama's upcoming visit to Taiwan from March 22 to 27.
</P>
<P>
"We seriously warn that the Dalai Lama should not continue his
foolish activities that will hurt the feelings of both religious
people and laymen on both sides of the (Taiwan) Straits, and that
will disrupt national unity," Zhao said in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
He said it is known to all that the Dalai Lama, who lives in
exile, has lost the trust of Buddhist believers by advocating the
independence of Tibet and engaging in activities that will damage
the unity of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Separatist forces in Taiwan have colluded with the Dalai clique
carrying out various farcical activities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much the Dalai Lama will gloss over his visit to
Taiwan, he cannot conceal his real attempt to split the motherland
and disrupt national unity, and he will suffer from his own
actions in the end," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the motherland and national unity are the
historical trend of the times and the common aspiration of the
vast legion of patriotic Buddhist believers and laymen on both
sides of the Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
He admonished some people with the Buddhist Association of
Taiwan, saying they should take a more sensible attitude toward
the invitation of the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan, in order to
ensure the sound development of Buddhist relations across the
Straits Straits.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Town of Pingyao Well Conserved, ICOMOS Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The ancient town of Pingyao in
north China's Shanxi Province illustrates what can be accomplished
when historical preservation is put into practical use, according
to an expert from the International Council on Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS).
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tan Tanaka, entrusted by the United States Education,
Science, and Culture Organization (UNESCO), recently made a final
inspection of Pingyao before turning in his nominations for the
World Heritage List, which Pingyao has applied to join.
</P>
<P>
With 3,900 residences built during the Ming (1368-1644) and
Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, the town now reflects a bygone era as
many locals have opened their homes to tourists.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles are banned in the "Street of Ming and Qing Dynasties,"
where a group of typical ancient buildings are located.
</P>
<P>
Hundred-year-old stores are still in use; some of the most
historically significant have been turned into tourist spots. The
Richengchang Exchange Shop, for instance, China's first firm for
exchange and transfer of money, is now a museum of Chinese
exchange shops.
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, an expert on ancient Chinese architecture, said after
the inspection that he was impressed by the "wise conservation" of
the town which is used efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Besides Pingyao, two other sites in China are applying to the
World Heritage List this year: the famous Chinese gardens in
Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, and the ancient town of Lijiang in
Yunnan Province, an 800-year-old city of rivers built by the Naxi
people, who have a unique cultural tradition.

<HEADLINE> PC Warns of Israeli Schemes on East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian Council
(PC) Ahmed Korei warned today that Israel is trying to tighten its
grip on East Jerusalem by isolating it from the rest of the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Voice of Arab radio, Korei said that the Israeli
decision on building 6,500 Jewish housing units in Abu Ghoneim in
East Jerusalem is an attempt to create a belt of settlements
around the third holiest city to Islam.
</P>
<P>
"It is aimed at isolating Jerusalem from the rest of the West
Bank and separating the north of the West Bank from its south,"
said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
He said what is even worse than the issue of Abu Ghoneim is the
fact that the Israeli civilian administration two days ago
announced that it would confiscate more lands from the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in any negotiations if Israel does not
suspend the building of settlements and the Judaization of the
holy city," Korei said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreements, Israel and the Palestinians are to
settle the status of Jerusalem and other sensitive issues in the
peace negotiations set for this month.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and wants it to be its "undivided" eternal capital while the
Palestinians insist to have East Jerusalem as the capital of a
future state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official urged the U.S. to shoulder its full
responsibility as a fair sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be stressed in today's meeting between
U. S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Washington had expressed its "disappointment" last week over
the Israeli government's decision to go ahead with the
construction of the Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A prescription to treat female
sterility has been found among Buddhist sutras in the Dunhuang
Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The treatment, a combination of schisandra fruit and polygala
root, has been proved effective by Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Such prescriptions were common in Buddhist and Taoist classics
found in Dunhuang's Thousand-Buddha Cave in 1899-1900.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars say that Taoism, or the search for longevity,
developed many ways for preserving health, while Buddhism, which
emphasizes spiritual freedom, can be used in conjunction with
psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly-found cures are treatments for poisoning caused
by the ingestion of a certain elixir, and for detoxifying internal
organs with the help of medicine and Qigong (deep-breathing
exercises).
</P>
<P>
The elixir poisoning became a serious problem during the
Southern and Northern dynasties (265-589), when the entire upper
class was drinking the elixir to excess to ensure
longevity.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Tops Priority in PNA Future Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority's (PNA) has listed tourism as the most important
industry in the future economic development, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
PNA Deputy International Cooperation Minister Anis Al-Qaq said
in an interview published on today's The Jerusalem Post that the
PNA was establishing vocational training centers in which the
main subjects will be tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA Higher Education Ministry is currently
working on a package of incentives to persuade some university
students to pursue more vocational-based subjects.
</P>
<P>
The main focus in the region will be put on joint tourism
projects in the Aqaba-Eilat-Taba triangular area, the Jordan
Valley, the Dead Sea and Mediterranean areas, where the
Palestinians have the smallest interests of the partners. Al-Qaq
said this meant there had to be a 100 percent cooperation with
Israel, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The PNA official regards the tourism potential in the region as
immense, noting that there are about 1 billion Muslims, some 200
million of whom could be attracted to these areas which are rich
in historic and religious sites.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of tourism depended on the peace
process and the final status of Hebron, Bethlehem and, most
significantly, Jerusalem, Al-Qaq pointed out.

<HEADLINE> More Competitive China Merchants Travel Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Over the past decade, the China
Merchants International Tourism Corporation has handled more than
800,000 tourists, including more than 400,000 overseas travelers.
</P>
<P>
This makes the travel company, which is directly under the
China Merchants Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, a strong
competitor that can hold its own in the tourism market against the
well-known China International Travel Service, China Travel
Service, and China Youth Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, and He Guangwei, director-general of
the China National Tourism Administration, attended a recent
reception marking the company's tenth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders asked travel services in the country to get
a better understanding of the successful techniques used by China
Merchants, which is known for making big profits with scaled-down
administration and its fair-minded handling of tourists.
</P>
<P>
China Merchants ranked first in per capita profit many times
over the past ten years, said Zhang Yibing, general director of
the company.
</P>
<P>
Now the company is engaged in the handling of tourists, tourism
industrial business, and hotel management, with 17 travel
agencies, solely-funded or joint-funded, in Hong Kong, Britain,
Singapore, and the Chinese mainland. In addition, it has offices
in Japan, Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
China Merchants is the first Category-A travel service in the
country listed on the INTERNET, as well as one of the first
Chinese members of the Asia-Pacific Travel Association, Zhang
said.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Arrested on Child Sex Charges in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The INTERPOL said today a
Frenchman has been arrested here for allegedly having sex with
children under 15.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Hennion Amedee, was arrested Friday by
the International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO-INTERPOL) at
his apartment here on charges of coercing children into
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Head of the INTERPOL's local bureau General Skadavy Math Ly Rou
said at a press conference that Amedee, 54, has forced more than
100 Cambodian children under 15 to have sex with him since he came
to the Cambodian capital on November 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Seven children have testified as witnesses to the charges
against Amedee, accusing the Frenchman of repeatedly coercing them
to have oral sex with him and paying two to three U.S. dollars
apiece, the police official said.
</P>
<P>
Amedee, thin with long brush moustache, showed up at today's
conference for a while with some of his victims for photo-taking
by journalists.
</P>
<P>
The police officer said Amedee will be sent to court later
today and may be sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison under
Cambodian laws.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia approved a legislation last year imposing fines or up
to 20 years imprisonment for those involved in kidnapping, selling
or coercing minors into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The general added that police may arrest some other foreigners
suspected of joining Amedee in forcing children into sex.

<HEADLINE> HK Container Throughput to Increase in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's shipping throughput
will be higher in 1997 over 1996, an official of the Hong Kong
Port Development Board (PDB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, the official said that
Hong Kong's shipping throughput has remained on the top in the
world shipping business for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total container throughput rose 6.9 percent to
13.41 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 1996 compared
with 1995.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the first half of 1996, the throughput at Hong
Kong port rose only two percent.
</P>
<P>
The slow growth was due to the higher growth rate of 13 percent
in the same period of 1995 and the tariff readjustment policy made
by the Customs of the Chinese mainland, she said.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1996, Hong Kong's shipping throughput was
improved and the growth rate hit eight percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects for this year's throughput, she said, an eight
percent growth is expected this year over 1996.
</P>
<P>
She said that one of the factors for the growth is most Hong
Kong companies have been accustomed to the tariff policy
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
She said that the growth will be also promoted by the
improvement of the Sino-U.S. trade relations and the increase of
cargoes shipped on the Beijing-Kowloon Railway to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Orphans' Family in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- "Would you like to be my mum?" a
seven-year-old girl orphan asked her nurse in an orphanage in
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Qiongqiong, the youngest among the 90 abandoned children in
that orphanage, now says everything to the child-care worker,
Tsongge. It is a far cry from the year when she was taken to the
orphanage from her hometown -- unresponsive, difficult, and nameless.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 orphans live in this make-shift big family, the first
orphanage of its kind located in Nagqu Town in northern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, various interests in the town set up the orphanage with
donations worth over three million yuan (360,000 US dollars),
including 500,000 yuan (60,000 US dollars) from a Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
The orphanage includes a special school with three classrooms,
dormitories, a dining hall, a reading room, an entertainment hall
and a playground. It provides for these children courses on
Tibetan, Chinese, math, civics, and physical education, with
grades from one to three.
</P>
<P>
The children who graduate from the orphanage will go to other
regular primary schools to continue their education, said Daje,
head of the orphanage.
</P>
<P>
The orphans' monthly living expenses are budgeted at 120 yuan
per person, covered by local and state educational and
administrative bodies, which provide for their zanba, a
traditional staple food of Tibet made from barley flour, their
buttered tea, stewed beef, noodles and rice.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their school uniforms, the school authority has
issued to all the orphans leather jackets and Tibetan robes for
special ceremonies and formal occasions.
</P>
<P>
"It's not simply a piece of cake to take care of these
children," Daje said. For many of the orphans, lack of parental
care has resulted in unkempt appearances and bad habits.
</P>
<P>
The 28 child-care workers who cook and wash for the orphans
know that parenting is a 24-hour responsibility, often getting
up in the middle of the night to look after bed-wetting children.
</P>
<P>
"All workers here like staying with these children," Daje said,
"although sometimes we don't always have enough time with our own
families."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Social workers and secondary
school teachers in Hong Kong urged the government to strengthen
counseling programs among students to check the increasing student
suicides.
</P>
<P>
According to an educational profession symposium held in Hong
Kong last weekend, 17 students took their own lives during the
1995-96 school year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a steady rise on the 12 cases in the year
of 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
Wu Pui-wa, a school social worker supervisor, said that
students were facing more emotional problems now while suicides a
decade ago were mainly related to academic results.
</P>
<P>
School social workers dealing with student problems are short.
An official of the Education Department said that there are only
272 social workers for more than 452,800 students in Hong Kong's
400 secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The number of new cases among the students which were handled
by social workers soared from 5,677 in 1992-93 school year to
8,323 in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Social workers called for the government's swift actions to
handle student suicides and cases.

URUMQI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Kashi prefecture and Aksu county,
two major cotton producers in northwest China's Uygur Autonomous
Region of Xinjiang, have planned to produce 475,000 tons of cotton
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Xinjiang battled natural disasters caused by freezing
temperatures, floods, earthquakes and insects plagues, and
harvested 950,000 tons of cotton, accounting for one third of
China's total cotton output.

The regional leaders of Xinjiang have planned to increase the
cotton planting area from to 866,700 hectares, 66,700 hectares
more than 1996, and develop the cotton production to 1.15 million
tons of total cotton output, 200,000 tons over 1996.
</P>
<P>
An official with the regional government said that to reach the
goal of producing 1.5 million tons of ginned cotton annually, the
government will put in 1.7 billion yuan (about 202 million US
dollars) in exploiting 66,700 hectares of cultivated land every
year. The government will also earmark 30 million yuan (about 3.57
million US dollars) for agriculture technology construction.

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corporation has signed an investment guaranty agreement
with the Inter-Arab Investment Fund to help promote the Middle
East peace process, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed Sunday in the Omani capital of Muscat by
Mrs. Ruth R. Harkin, President of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC), and Fuad S. Abu Zayyed, chairman of the fund,
Khaleej Time said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper gave no details of the agreement, but it quoted
Harkin as saying that the agreement is mainly aimed at
encouraging peace in the Middle East through backing the efforts
by the Inter-Arab Investment Fund to promote the region's economy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Industry to Stress Quality and Marketability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's iron and steel industry,
which in 1996 turned out a record output of more than 100 million
tons of steel, this year will shift its attention from output to
product quality and market competitiveness, and try to achieve a
output-to-sales ratio of 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Beijing today, Liu Qi, minister of
metallurgical industry, said his ministry has set a steel output
target of 100 million tons in 1997, an amount approximately the
same as last year's. This, he said, is intended to encourage steel
enterprises to pay greater attention to product quality and
marketability, rather than to producing more.
</P>
<P>
"We should not only produce 100 millions tons of steel, but
also sell every tone of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future development of the iron and steel
industry, Liu stressed structural readjustment in three major
respects.
</P>
<P>
"First, we must adjust the product mix, turning out more
products that come with high added value or are urgently needed on
the market; second, we should upgrade our technologies, trying to
reach international advanced levels by the end of this century,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Third, he said, the industry must make every effort to raise
productivity through internal restructuring, trying to achieve an
annual steel output of 150 tons per worker by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
"That means China's steelmaking by then will need 800,000
workers only," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on the current situation of China's
state-owned large and medium-sized steel enterprises, Weng Yuqing,
vice-minister of metallurgical industry, said that their
performance in recent years has fully displayed their ability to
adapt themselves to evolving socialist market economics.
</P>
<P>
"Our ministry is fully confident that reforms in all our
subordinate enterprises have bright prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
While new and modern enterprises, such as the Handan Iron and
Steel Company in north China's Hebei Province and the Baosteel
Group in east China's Shanghai, have set successful examples in
reforms, he said, old-timers including the Anshan Iron and Steel
Company in northeast China's Liaoning Province and the Wuhan Iron
and Steel Company in central China's Hubei Province have also made
big strides in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that in 1996, 70 percent of the 107 large and
medium-sized state enterprises in China made money, and net
profits for the 107 enterprises in all reached 5.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi said that only one of China's 24 largest steelmakers,
each producing more than one million tons of steel, lost money
last year. The top 24 producers account for 70 percent of the
country's total steel output.
</P>
<P>
China's steel output in 1996 was 101.1 million tons, the
world's largest, with a sales rate of 99 percent.

<HEADLINE> China: A Big Producer for Stone Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China produced 100 million sq m of
stone materials including granite, marble and terrazzo in 1996,
ranking behind Italy as the world's second-largest producer of
stone.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China Chamber of
International Commerce, production of stone materials in China has
been growing at an average annual rate of 30 percent over the past
15 years. China boasts the largest reserve of stone in the world,
with the greatest variety and vast distribution of products.
</P>
<P>
A large group of important stone quarries have been established
in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Shandong,
Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
China is well-known internationally for its granite, marble and
white marble production. Its export volume of stone topped a
record 700 million US dollars in 1996. So far, China has found
markets for its stone products in Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Germany, the United States, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia as well as
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With steady expansion in stone production and markets, China
has made great headway in expanding Sino-foreign cooperation in
the sector by setting up over 400 foreign-funded quarries
nationwide, which have become backbones in the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Wenbo, deputy director of the China Stone
Materials Industry Association, China has also made remarkable
progress in improving its technological equipment for stone
materials production. In recent years, the country has introduced
a large amount of advanced equipment from Italy, Germany and other
countries, which effectively boosted the development of China's
stone materials production.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has developed equipment which conforms
to the country's stone production requirements by drawing on
advanced foreign technology.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has set up over 100 equipment manufacturing
enterprises for stone production and has basically met the
country's needs for stone.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1990, China has exported equipment for stone
production to Russia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Indonesia and
Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Smooth Return of Hong Kong beyond Any Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Developments in the international
and domestic situations have made Hong Kong's return to the
motherland beyond any doubt, said Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
"All signs show that a smooth return of Hong Kong is definite,"
Zhou said in a penal discussion of the on-going Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Colonial rule in Hong Kong will come to an end in just over 100
days and the region will return to the embrace of the motherland,
shaking off a national disgrace for one and a half centuries, he
said in the panel discussion of the delegation of Guangdong
deputies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the confidence of Hong Kong residents in its
future has been on rise, adding that the number of Hong Kong
residents migrating overseas has been declining and those coming
back increasing over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
As many as one third of those Hong Kong people residing
overseas have returned, with still more following suit.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong People now associate Hong Kong's return and
stability more closely and they have become increasingly aware of
the Chinese Government's firm determination to carry out the 'one
country, two systems' principle," Zhou said. They hope that they
will have a more secured living environment which guarantees their
business still greater prospects at the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Acknowleding that China's high economic growth rate is a
miracle resultant from the pursuance of the road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics in line with Deng
Xiaoping's directives, he said that this trend of development
plays a decisive role in the development of the world situation
and will surely produce a profound and far-reaching impact on the
situation in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "China factor" and the "return factor" constitute two major
reasons for the rebound of the Hong Kong economy, which has ended
a two-year cyclical correctional period and grew over 4.7 percent
last year, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed forecasts of a capital flight, saying: "On the
contrary, what we see is a steady inflow of international
capital."
</P>
<P>
An announcement of the International Monetary Fund based on the
summary report done on a recent survey said that the unclear
factors over the 1997 transfer of power in Hong Kong have
basically been eliminated and Hong Kong will be more prosperous
after its return.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the developing trend of the Hong Kong economy and
the external environment, Zhou said, Hong Kong's economy this year
is expected to be better than last year.
</P>
<P>
"Now only few people doubt that the status of Hong Kong as an
international financial, trade, shipping and information center
will be further consolidated and strengthened instead of being
weakened," he said.
</P>
<P>
Various pessimistic sayings about the future of Hong Kong
spread and disseminated by some Western media have gone bankrupt
before the stark, objective reality."
</P>
<P>
He went to say that the principle of "one country, two systems"
initiated by Deng Xiaoping has struck root in people's hearts and
will soon become a reality.
</P>
<P>
"We must carry forward at Deng's behest, unite the masses of
Hong Kong residents and do a good job in matters related to Hong
Kong," Zhou Nan said.

ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The chief minister of Pakistan's
southern Sindh Province today visited the scene of a bomb blast in
a newspaper office in Karachi, in which two employees were
slightly injured, sources said.
</P>
<P>
A time-bomb went off early today in the office building of the
Urdu newspaper Qaumi Akhbar in Karachi, the Sindh capital and
Pakistan's largest city, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the incident yet.
</P>
<P>
The sources said bomb disposal experts discovered that the bomb
was a home-made device of 400 gram TNT flake with a timer.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was placed on the first floor of the building and its
impact made a 14 inch diameter hole, the sources quoted the
experts as saying. Other rooms in the building were also affected.
</P>
<P>
There were no staff in the office when the bomb exploded,
causing major damage to equipment in the room, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> NP May Withdraw From S. Africa's Political Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP) may
soon disappear from South Africa's political scene and be
replaced by a new political movement, a senior NP official said
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Roelf Meyer, former NP Secretary-General, was quoted by the
local daily Sowetan as saying that the NP members would meet at
various federal councils to decide whether they would disband the
party in favor of the new movement which is expected to be
launched in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Meyer is currently heading a task team to establish a possible
realignment in South Africa's opposition politics.
</P>
<P>
Last month, NP leader De Klerk announced a major shake-up to
restructure the party's top leadership, including the disbandment
of the NP's secretariat, in a bid to set up a new political
movement and boost the party membership in 1999 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The NP, a traditionally white party governing South Africa
since 1948, became opposition last May when it withdrew from the
African National Congress-led government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
However, Meyer believed that the proposed new political
movement, would inevitably have Black leadership, which analysts
said could spell an end of an era for De Klerk.
</P>
<P>
"Without significant growth boosted by black numbers, the NP
will continue to be a declining party by 1999, and there will be
proportionally fewer white, coloured and Indian voters to boost
its membership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer also dispelled any notion that the movement would be
controlled by the NP.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to help more than
ten million people with speech difficulties overcome their
psychological barriers by setting up the first linguistic training
center in southwestern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation institute of speech psychology, formally
established on the basis of the Chengdu Hospital for Speech
Difficulties which had cured more than 10,000 patients with speech
obstacles in the past 13 years, plans to improve those patients'
confidence and realize their speech potential, said Wang Wei, head
of the institute, who is a well-known linguist.
</P>
<P>
Speech difficulties, including common problems such as
stuttering and too much nasalization, obstruct personal
communication.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu-based institute, Wang said, will systematically
research speech psychology and rehabilitation methods while
drawing on research discoveries in other countries.
</P>

About 100 doctors and experts, all retired from the West
China's Medical University, the United University of Sichuan and

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Becomes Increasingly Magnet for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's economic vitality and
enormous market potential are strong attractions for overseas
investors with an interest in this largest industrial and
commercial center in China, said a municipal foreign trade
official.
</P>
<P>
Contractual foreign investment in the city has topped 10
billion yuan for three consecutive years. In 1996, such investment
in the city totaled 11 billion US dollars, up five percent over
the year before.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the city had approved 15,692
overseas-funded enterprises, with contractual investment amounting
to 45.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said overseas investment in the city is taking on
several new characteristics:
</P>
<P>
First, the scale of overseas-invested projects continues to
expand. In 1996, the number of projects with pledged investment
surpassing 10 million US dollars had reached 220.
</P>
<P>
Second, the majority of the projects are in the industrial
sector. Among the 1,266 projects approved in 1996, 60 percent were
related to industry. The industrial projects are led by pillar and
high-tech industries, such as automobiles, computers, bio-medicine
and fine chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Third, investment in the service sector, such as real estate
and financing, has increased. Most of the 50 top financial
institutions in the world have opened offices in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai has established trade relationships with
40,000 customers in 199 countries and regions. In 1996, Shanghai's
imports and exports totaled 52.87 billion US dollars, a 9.8
percent rise over 1995. Of the total, exports accounted for 13.2
billion dollars and imports, nine billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A current notable characteristic of foreign trade is that the
imports volume is growing rapidly; in recent years the city was
attentive to the need to introduce state-of-the-art technology,
equipment and industrial raw materials. From 1992 to 1996, imports
into the city grew at an annual rate of 20 percent.

</P>
<P>
Yao's father, a college professor in Beijing, plans to spend
his summer vacation with his son in Dalian, a booming coastal city
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"We have so many transportation choices to get to Dalian,
including airplanes and ships," the father said. "Even if we
choose express trains or buses, we need much less time than before
to reach our destination."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from transportation administrations show that China
has 1.18 million kilometers of roads, including over 17,000
kilometers of high grade highways and 3,258 kilometers of
expressways.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 55.5 million people in China traveled by air, up 8.5
percent over the year before. Some Shanghai residents even took
chartered flights to Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia.
</P>
<P>
While the country's developed public transportation system has
made life easier for people on the go, increased incomes have
whetted the appetite of many Chinese people to buy their own cars.
</P>
<P>
A car dealer shop near the Asian Games Village in northern
Beijing listed a record sale of automobiles in 1996, reaching over
10,000, with 5,900 purchased for private use.
</P>
<P>
About 2.5 million Chinese have their own cars, which account
for a quarter of the market share in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most Chinese still use bicycles as their daily means
of transport. The utilitarian, unadorned bikes of the past have
been replaced by more colorful models, and many Chinese prefer to
ride mountain bikes to work.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Like most Beijingers, 10-year-old
Yao Ziqi has grown accustomed to the easy convenience of
taxis. But he likes to tell the story of the day he was born, when
his father carried his pregnant mother on a bicycle to the
hospital because the capital city had so few cabs.
</P>
<P>
Now, Yao says, flagging down taxis is part of his everyday
life, used for family outings or when he visits his grandparents'
house five bus stops away.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has the country's largest taxi fleet -- over 60,000
vehicles in 1,600-plus taxi companies. And what was once a rich
man's privilege has become an affordable service for many
residents.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey released by the Chinese Cities' Taxi
Association shows that China has a total of 500,000 taxis, spread
throughout 803 cities in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In many cities, more than 60 percent of the residents often
take taxis; in some areas, the figure is as high as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Riding in taxis has even become fashionable on the streets of
Lhasa, the capital of western China's Tibet Autonomous Region,
where residents of the Himalayan city like to go shopping during
the traditional Lunar New Year, which coincides with the Tibetan
New Year.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Invests More in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan invested 370 million US
dollars last year, eight percent more than the previous year, in
Xiamen City, a port city of eastern China's Fujian Province,
according to the Xiamen city government.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the coastal city's trade with Taiwan rose 27 percent
to 1.6 billion US dollars, according to Kong Changcai, director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Xiamen city government.
</P>
<P>
He said that as more than 270,000 Taiwan compatriots visited
Xiamen last year, a rise of more than ten percent over the
previous year, Xiamen has already become one of the major gates
for Taiwan compatriots to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is a special economic zone where flexible policies are
being pursued to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan
and overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, over 1,600 Taiwan business people came to Xiamen to
conduct trade and investment talks," he said. "The number exceeded
that of Hong Kong business people for the first time."
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen government attaches great importance to the
promotion of Xiamen-Taiwan economic cooperation and has adopted a
series of measures to ensure that the legitimate rights and
interests of Taiwan investors in Xiamen were protected, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Calls for Rejuvenation of Ship-Building Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator urges
enacting a law to instill more vitality into the country's
ship-building industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youjun, a National People's Congress (NPC) deputy from
Shanghai, suggested China's top legislature provide a legal
guarantee for the rejuvenation of the country's ship-building
industry when discussing with other deputies Premier Li Peng's
government work report to the current annual NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a computer expert working for Shanghai Shipyard, said
China boasts a coastal line with thousands of kilometers, and the
demands for a faster developing shipbuilding industry come from
various sectors like ocean shipping, off-shore development and
defense of coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the shipbuilding industry is a labor-intensive
one with a highly concentrated combination of labor, capital and
technology, and that China has been emerging as a rising
competitor in the world's ship-building market as its shipyards
have done good work and are operating at low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
China's shipyards are confronted with great opportunities since
90 percent of the world trade volume today goes to ocean shipping,
which is expected to flourish in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China's shipbuilding industry has shown robust growth over the
past few yeas, with an output value exceeding 25 percent annually.
On the international market, the total tonnage of orders are
placed to Chinese shipbuilders. So China has, for fifth
consecutive year, ranked the third in term of orders it received,
only next to Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
To date, three shipbuilding bases have been established in
China, namely, Shanghai in east China, Dalian in northeast China,
and Guangzhou in south China, which are also three major ports in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The development of the shipbuidling industry must have the
backing of the some 50 industries, involving metallurgical,
machinery, electronic and telecommunications, and many other
industries, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ship building, if designated as a pillar
industry, will help promote the development of other industries,
and the government should increase input in the industry and
strengthen its macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has been reported that the drafting of a law
concerning rejuvenation of the shipbuilding industry is under way.

LANZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Lanzhou municipal government
in northwest China's Gansu province has ushered in large-scale
regulation of the local real estate market, normalizing

</P>
<P>
The total floor space of real estates of Lanzhou has reached 48

The Lanzhou government established a real estate trade
center in last October to manage the market, and regulate
real estate brokerage.

<P>
A Lanzhou municipal official indicated that new regulation
focuses on checking of the qualifications of the organizations and
individuals engaging in real estate advertising, brokerage,
appraising and auction.

Those who are qualified will receive the "Real Estate Agent
Certificate" and "Real Estate Broker Certificate".
</P>

percent over the previous year. Aquatic products netted in through
deep-sea fishing stood at 150,000 tons, 22 percent more than in
1995.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Zhejiang provincial government attributed
the province's achievements in fishery to fishermen's initiative
for buying boats through a share-holding system. The farmers
jointly owned over 6,000 boats, which enabled them to cast nets in
the north Pacific Ocean and waters off the coast of western Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seawater farming on tidal flats and off the coast also
contributed a large share of the province's fishery output, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhejiang had a total of 53,300 ha of seawater
farming area, which turned out over 770,000 tons of aquatic
products, 17 percent more than in 1995.

<P>
WEIHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- With encouragement from the
government, this coastal city in east China's Shandong Province
has witnessed the burgeoning of its private economic sector.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the registered capital of the
private companies in this beachside resort by the Bohai Sea has
reached 960 million yuan (115.6 million US dollars), 3.6 percent
of the total industrial and commercial registration.
</P>
<P>
The city, one of the 14 coastal cities in China, has five
private enterprises which each have recorded more than 10 million
yuan in registered capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the output value of the private sector amounted to 3.5
billion yuan.

The sector has become an important source for drawing surplus
rural and urban laborers and college graduates.

The modern enterprise mechanism has become a trend for the
sector, which has already seen the establishment of over 800
limited-liability companies.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns Arafat Against Declaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
against declaring independence in reaction to Israel's building
plan in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Likud Central Committee meeting held in Tel
Aviv Sunday night, Netanyahu said Arafat's declaring of
independent state would be a grave mistake that could halt
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We will know how to react and we have a very good
answer," he said, referring to the warning issued by Arafat
earlier in the day that he could declare independence unilaterally
in reaction to Israel's plan to build a Jewish settlement in Har
Homa area in the disputed eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Israeli President Ezer Weizman also cautioned
Arafat against declaring a Palestinian state now. "It will be
a terrible mistake. This is not the right time. It would
be a shame that something which seems important to the
Palestinians should disrupt the peace process," he said during
a visit of the soldiers wounded in south Lebanon fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu promised about 2,000 enthusiastic party
supporters that Israel would build in Jerusalem and anywhere
else it decided to.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he had reached a deal over the Har Homa
project with Arafat, in which Israel reportedly agreed to
widen the scope of further troop withdrawals on the West
Bank in return for Arafat's agreement to the Har Homa
project.
</P>
<P>
"I have not promised Arafat anything," claimed Netanyahu,
adding bureaucratic procedures had been sped up in order to
start the Har Homa building immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Likud gathering was convened in a show of support to
the prime minister and his policies in the wake of Har
Homa controversy, and the current "Bar-On scandal" that
threatens to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
According to the exposure by the state-run Television Channel
I, the abortive appointment of Jerusalem attorney Roni Bar-On
as the Attorney General in January involved a plea-bargain
deal arranged between the government and the influential Shas
leader Aryeh Deri, who has been facing criminal investigation
on fraud and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Deri reportedly pushed for the appointment of Bar-On, who
had promised a plea bargain to him in future trials, by
conditioning Shas' support of the Hebron agreement on Bar-On's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Bar-On, also a member of Likud Central Committee, was
indeed appointed the Attorney General by the cabinet, but
he resigned automatically only tow days later due to the
strong protests over his insufficient professional qualification
and political background.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu remained confident that the government would
get through the crisis. "We shall get over these difficult
times, I promise you," he told the supporters.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Pakistani Friendship Stands Long: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Pakistani diplomat who
left China in January of this year after spending 14 years here
described the country as open, friendly and rapidly-changing and a
place where he met thousands of friends.
</P>
<P>
Habib-ur-Rahman, former Minister of the Pakistani Embassy in
Beijing, said in a letter to Xinhua News Agency that throughout
his entire stay in China, he experienced the sincere friendship
between the people of Pakistan and the Chinese. He also said that
he was deeply impressed by the fast changes that China witnessed
during his tenure here.
</P>
<P>
Habib was sent to study at the Beijing Language Institute in
China by Pakistani foreign ministry in 1977.
</P>
<P>
As a diplomat, Habib was posted in China three times, from 1977
to 1982, 1983 to 1987, and 1993 to this January.
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago, like many Pakistani people, I was looking
forward to knowing China and her people," he recalled in his
letter.
</P>
<P>
During my study at the Beijing Language Institute, Habib
realized that his Chinese friends were eager to learn about
Pakistan, he said. "I made thousands of friends in my 14 years in
China."
</P>
<P>
He said that offers of assistance were extended to him wherever
he went, and that he learned to rely on his Chinese friends for
help, including those from the leading organs of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), the Foreign Ministry, the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Diplomatic
Personnel Service Bureau, the Islamic Association of China, the
State Education Commission and many other culture, education and
research institutes.
</P>
<P>
"It's very pleasant to work in China, because China is a true
friend and the most sincere neighbor of Pakistan. Not only the
Chinese government has offered a lot of help to Pakistan, but the
Chinese people cherish deep feelings of friendship toward the
country," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, Habib suffered a serious heart problem
which required surgery.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhu at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing recommended that Habib be
treated in either the United States or Germany, or go back to
Pakistan. Habib opted to stay in China and asked Zhu to perform
the operation.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have the operation done by my Chinese friends. I
didn't want to go to any other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and ten other medical experts formed a surgical team to
treat Habib. Fifty days after the operation, Habib walked out of
the hospital, and now he can walk, run and attend in a variety of
activities.
</P>
<P>
"China has given me a new life," Habib said.

SHENZHEN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen now supplies about 70
percent of the fresh vegetables sold in Hong Kong everyday,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Other figures indicate that 90 percent of the leaf vegetable
consumption in Hong Kong comes from its neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, taking advantage of its relatively cheaper labor
resources, has set up many well-equipped processing plants for the
more expensively-packaged fresh vegetables, which have been
favorites among Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine authorities at the ports of entry are strictly
examining goods, banning the use of over 40 types of pesticides
and over 100 sorts of compound pesticides for vegetables sold to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do our utmost to ensure the quality of the vegetables to
Hong Kong," said Liu Zhaojing, an official with Wenjingdu Port,
where 60 percent of the vegetables pass through.
</P>
<P>
A quota system is in effect to prevent market surplus, and last
year's quota of vegetables sold to Hong Kong from Shenzhen was
80,786 tons.

<HEADLINE> South China Breeds More Rare Monkeys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Twelve of 16 artificially-bred
baby langur monkeys, one of the world's rarest long-tailed
primates, have survived after their birth last year in a special
breeding center in China.
</P>
<P>
The center, the largest of its kind in China, in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, now has 93 of the monkeys, which are
under top state protection. The figure accounts for one fourth of
all those raised in captivity in the world, according to the
"China Environmental News."
</P>
<P>
One of the female monkeys has given birth 12 times, and now has
a family of four generations, also a rarity.
</P>
<P>
The monkey, formally known as presbytis francdisi, is from the
langur family, with jet-black fur and a tail longer than its
body. Slimly built, it lives on a diet of tree leaves. The species
is native to southern China.
</P>
<P>
China set up the center in Wuzhou City in 1991, with a total
planned investment of 30 million yuan (3.61 million US
dollars). To date, more than three million yuan has been spent on
construction.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists began artificial breeding of the monkey in
1976, and a number of monkeys raised by the center have been sent
as "envoys of friendship" to zoos in Japan, the United States,
Canada and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Advise Caution about Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Approval and appreciation laced
with cautionary advices have replaced serious concern and a strong
desire to address inquires on the issue of inflation at the
ongoing session of the Chinese legislature.
</P>
<P>
This is indicated by what legislators say in group discussions
and in interviews. They are here attending the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
High inflation was a serious concern among deputies at NPC
sessions of a recent past when rates stood at 13, 21.7 and 14.8
percent respectively in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Inflation came down
to 6.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"As Premier Li Peng said in his government work report, last
year, while prices came down speedily, the entire national economy
maintained a sustained, rapid growth, with our GDP reaching more
than 6,770 billion yuan, a growth of 9.7 percent over the previous
year," said Deputy Zeng Haorong, who is also mayor of Haikou,
capital of Hainan province. "This proves that we've achieved an
economic soft landing, that we've made a good beginning in our
effort to change the mode of growth, and that people's living
standard has genuinely improved."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Zhang Zhongli, president of the Shanghai Academy of
Social Sciences and a prestigious economist, said that maintaining
a high growth rate and driving down inflation at the same time is
a "remarkable achievement" on the part of the government.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that governments at all levels are not powerless
about price control. "For local governments, one of the things
they should do is to strengthen supervision over markets and
prices, while endeavoring to increase the supply of farm produce,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Hanqing, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Municipal
People's Congress of Chongqing, said local governments'
supervision over prices should be "appropriate" so that both
consumers and producers are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Deputies also warned against relaxation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Some factors that drive up inflation still exist, and China is
not entirely free from cycles of overheating and stagnation
consequent upon a loosening or tightening of macro controls," said
Deputy Cai Lulun, president of the Hunan branch of the People's
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"Effective measures are still needed to restrict money supply
and investment increases," he said. "The government must pursue
unswervingly appropriately tight financial and monetary policies."

<HEADLINE> India Leads in Gold Consumption </HEADLINE>

NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- India continued to lead in the
world's gold consumption in 1996 when for the first time more than
500 tons of gold were consumed in the country, a six-percent
increase over 1995, The Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Gold Demand Trends, a quarterly publication
issued by the World Gold Council, while India led in gold
consumption with 508 tons, it was closely followed by the United
States with 345 tons which was also six percent higher than last
year for that country.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the demand buoyancy for gold buying in India
to the improved political and economic environment with a stable
coalition government and a tighter monetary policy.

HANGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Waste water will no longer be
drained into West Lake, a well-known scenic spot in East China's
Zhejiang Province, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection department of Hangzhou, the
capital of Zhejiang Province, said that the last sewage
source around the 5.2 square kilometer lake has been eliminated
after nearly six months' effort.
</P>
<P>
The city government has laid 9.4 kilometers of drainage pipes
around the lake to divert waste water, while 300,000 cubic meters
of water from the nearby Qiangtang River is being channeled into
West Lake for cleaning daily.
</P>
<P>
A newly completed project, with a two-kilometer-long drainage
pipe, will divert rain water and sewage in the area into the
city's sewer system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of pollutant plants around the lake have
moved out, and motor-driven pleasure-boats have been replaced by
battery-operated ones, to preserve the lake's natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the lake's transparency now reaches 50 to 60
centimeters, and air quality around the lake has improved, and
flocks of birds that had left the lake area have since returned.

<P>
DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Expansion of trade and investment
opportunities between Bangladesh and the Philippines will be the
main focus during Philippine President Fidel Ramos' three-day
official visit here this week, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
A number of agreements and protocols on business links and
cultural cooperation signed between the two countries previously,
but now dormant, are likely to be reactivated during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president, who flies in on March 5 on the second
leg of his four-nation trip, will head a 120-member delegation.
His entourage includes Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon and some
business and industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first top level visit by a Philippine leader
since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will hold official
talks with Ramos on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Increased commercial interaction between the two countries by
identifying new areas and commodities for export and import would
be the main topic at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry official said the volume of trade between
the two countries now is "at a very insignificant level" although
Bangladesh enjoys a favorable trade surplus by exporting jute
goods and some traditional items.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will leave Dhaka for Islamabad, Pakistan, on March 7.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Croatia to Help Reconstruct Bosnia- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Croatia today
stressed the importance of cooperation in the reconstruction of
Bosnia- Herzegovina and pledged to encourage their companies
concerned to immediately develop some projects.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina was a major topic of the
talks between Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his
Croatian counterpart Zlatko Matesa here today.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders stressed that it was important that war criminals
in that country be brought to trial in the Hague, because as long
as the criminals remain at large, then there is always a threat to
peace, Malaysian foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a
news conference after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that agreements reached earlier that Malaysia and
Croatia should join together to undertake various construction
projects in Bosnia-Herzegovina could not proceed as expected, both
leaders emphasized the importance of getting these joint ventures
to move ahead, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders pledged to encourage the companies concerned to
immediately develop some projects.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the Croatian side suggested that Malaysia, with
some experiences in developing small businesses, should help
Bosnia- Herzegovina and Malaysia agreed to send soon a delegation
to Bosnia- Herzegovina to identify what possible types of small
businesses can be introduced in that country so that disarmed
soldiers, large in number without jobs, could participate in.
</P>
<P>
Bilaterally, the two leaders agreed that there has been some
progress in the areas of bilateral cooperation since the last
visit of Mahathir to Croatia last April but more needs to be done,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders decided to intensify the cooperation in three
specific areas where they believe that Croatia and Malaysia have
some advantages and the areas are power generation, ship-building
and construction.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said it was hoped that companies of the two countries
can develop joint ventures to work on these projects not only in
Croatia and Malaysia but also in third countries.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government has also accepted the suggestion made
by the Malaysian side that they should also accept another
designated Malaysian airline to fly to Croatia instead of the
Malaysian Airline and the AirAsia, the second Malaysian airline,
is the possible designated airline for that.
</P>
<P>
Zlatko Matesa, leading a 12-member delegation comprising three
ministers, two vice ministers, senior government officials and
businessmen, arrived here last night for a three-day visit to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During Mahathir's visit to Croatia, a total of five Memoranda
of Understanding (MOUs), three instruments of agreement and a
joint venture agreement were signed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national car "Proton" also penetrated the Croatian
market with the first export of 200 cars to Niva Holdings, the
Proton distributor in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kuala Lumpur and Zagreb also signed an agreement
for partial abolition of visa requirements, allowing people of
both countries to travel for 30 days without the need for visa.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade has been improving. The trade volume
increased from 5.12 million US dollars in 1994 to 6.31 million US
dollars in 1995 and further to 10 million US dollars last year,
with trade balance in favor of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Croatia also signed an air services agreement last
year, providing both national carriers seven flights a week
between the two countries.

NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) will be going ahead with its plan to move a
no-confidence motion against the eight-month-old United Front
government during the current budget session, The Times of India
said today.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of
parliament) Atal Behari Vajpayee told the influential Indian
newspaper on Sunday that there had been no change in the BJP's
stand of pressing for the no-confidence motion even after the
presentation of the budget last week.
</P>
<P>
The veteran BJP leader said his party would be deciding in the
next two to three days on the timing of the no-confidence motion
against the United Front government.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a decision on the no-confidence
motion moved by the BJP ally -- the Samata Party -- is already
pending with the Lok Sabha and it is likely that the BJP and its
allies may press for its admission.
</P>
<P>
The minority government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda
is being supported by the Congress party from the outside.

NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A new international organization
will be formally launched by 14 countries belonging to three
continents of Asia, Africa and Oceania when their foreign
ministers meet in Mauritius between March 5 and 7, The Times of
India reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the avowed goal of facilitating regional cooperation, this
new organization will be called Indian Ocean Rim Association for
Regional Cooperation (IORARC).
</P>
<P>
India, along with Mauritius, South Africa, Australia,
Singapore, Oman and Kenya, have been working towards the
establishment of IORARC during the last two years. In the
meantime, seven other countries -- Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Yemen, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar -- joined the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Going by its proposed charter, the IORARC will have four main
features:
</P>
<P>
-- The highest decision-making body of the organization will be
the ministerial council of foreign ministers who will meet at
least once every two years.
</P>
<P>
-- It will have a unique three-pronged approach in working in
the sense that it involves a coordinated endeavor of officials,
academicians and businessmen of the member countries. The point is
that officials alone will not be responsible for its functioning.
</P>
<P>
-- Though the IORARC aims to be "universal," involving all the
Indian Ocean countries, the membership will be restricted to begin
with. The underlying assumption is that there should be a "core
group approach" for the sake of viability and efficiency. The
objective is to realize goals in a phased manner.
</P>
<P>
-- All cooperative endeavors will be voluntary in nature. In
fact, 10 such ventures have already been identified, with India
responsible for four of them.

marking the beginning of a big "green screen" project for the
Zhujiang (Pearl) River.
</P>
<P>
The project is the second-biggest ecological undertaking
launched by the Chinese government, following the building of
shelterbelts along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Zhujiang River is the third-longest river in China, and the
Zhujiang River Delta, on the lower reaches of the river, is one of
the most important economic and industrial regions of China.
</P>
<P>
The region, however, has been experiencing severe soil erosion
and degradation of the ecological environment for many years, due
to over-exploitation of the river valley.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the green project has been drawn up, and it will be
first carried out in ten counties, with a total afforestation area
of about 33 million ha. At the present stage, more than 1,000
local people plant trees here on barren mountains each day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, similar projects are being carried out in the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong Province along the
middle and lower reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislator: No Problems with Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) has never considered, much less discussed, holding a special
session to assess the capability of Indonesian President Soeharto,
deputy to the house speaker Ismail Hasan Metareum said.
</P>
<P>
Metareum made the remarks Sunday in response to journalists'
question on President Soeharto's statement before prospective Haj
pilgrims in Boyolali, Central Java, last Friday, Antara News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the president among others said that he only
implemented what had been trusted by the people to him, which were
decided through the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
"If I am considered unable to carry out the people's mandate,
please discharge me though the MPR's special session," Soeharto
said.
</P>
<P>
He further said he had no objection or would not maintain his
position if the people wanted him to step down provided that such
a demand be made constitutionally.
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted that he would "clobber" anyone who
tried through unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the assembly's leadership had not found any crucial
problems concerning President Soeharto's capability to carry out
his administrative and stately duties to justify bringing him
before an extraordinary session.
</P>
<P>
"We can see that President Soeharto is still in sound condition
and able to overcome various challenges. MPR sees Soeharto as able
president to carry out his duties well. And whether or not he is
ready to resume the post as president for the next term, it
depends on him," he added.
</P>
<P>
The People's Consultative Assembly comprises 500 members of the
House of Representatives and 500 representatives of various
regions, professions and mass organizations. They convene every
five years to deliberate the guidelines of state policies and
elect the president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto became acting president in 1967 and assumed full
leadership the following year. In 1972, the People's Consultative
Assembly which was established by the 1971 general election,
elected him. So far, he has been elected five times.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will hold general elections on May 29 this year.

YANGON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is fully prepared to
improve linkages in all modes of transport with all countries in
and outside the Southeast Asia region, Myanmar Minister for
Transport Thein Win was quoted by official paper The New Light of
Myanmar as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting in
Chiang Mai, Thailand, last Friday, Thein Win reaffirmed Myanmar's
full and irreversible commitment to becoming a full member of
ASEAN, determining to fully cooperate with all ASEAN member
countries in the promotion of transport operations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<P>
Under the proposal initiated by Thailand, Myanmar is among
countries where national highways throughout the ASEAN and
Southeast Asian mainland are to be linked, which also include
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is seen as an attempt to facilitate the transport
of goods over land through these countries to ensure that the

lead to freer trade by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tachilek-Kengtung Road in Shan state of Myanmar

<HEADLINE> Shandong Farmers Become "Experts for Hire" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Yinji Township, Gaotang
County, in east China's Shandong Province often attend lectures on
greenhouse vegetable growing given by Wang Dianwen, deputy head of
the town in charge of vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wang is one of the 4,000 farmers from Shouguang
County, also in Shandong, who were invited to be township
officials or vegetable experts in China's inland provinces and
autonomous regions last year.
</P>
<P>
Of these farmers, 80 became contracted deputy township
heads in charge of science and technology work and three became
deputy magistrates in other areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 percent of vegetable growers in Shouguang,
a rich county famous for its greenhouse vegetables, have become
experts after years of study and practice.
</P>
<P>
With the development of vegetable growing in other provinces,
many provincial or county officials have invited experts from
Shouguang in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Shouguang County received 60 million yuan (about 7.5
million US dollars) in 1996 from sending such experts to other
areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zhongxin, a farmer in Sunjiaji Township, was invited to be
deputy magistrate of Wuyi County in Hebei Province in 1993.
</P>

When Wu returned home he recalled his experience in the Hebei
county proudly. He said his family has been farmers for
generations, and his grandfathers would never have dreamt of being
county officials.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Washington amid Middle East Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived in Washington Sunday amid an explosive tension
triggered by Israel's approved housing project in Arab east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who flew here after attending an emergency session of
the Cairo-based Arab League, will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday morning to express his concern over the Israeli decision
to construct 6,500 homes for Jewish settlers in Har Homa in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has denounced the Israeli plan, saying
the settlement issue is an attempt by Israel to blast the peace
process to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
"We say that there can be no peace without Jerusalem and no
peace with settlements. Settlements and peace do not go
together, and there will be no peace as long as Israel violates
our rights in Jerusalem," Arafat told the Arab League session in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in
the occupied territories with east Jerusalem as its capital, but
Israel has declared the whole Holy city as its capital since
taking hold of the east part of it even though the international
community refused to recognize its claim.
</P>
<P>
Arafat suggested that he could declare a Palestinian state in
response to Israel's housing project in Arab east Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to declare the setting up of a Palestinian
state in five years, but what would happen if I declare it right
here? What would he (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu)
do then? It's tit-for-tat, and we have our weapons, too." he said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League issued a statement after the
session asking "countries that give economic and financial aid
to Israel to stop this aid because it will be used in settlement
plans on occupied Arab lands."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian minister of higher
education, urged the Clinton administration to take a clear
position on Jerusalem and settlement issues, denouncing Israel's
recent move on settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We take it for granted the U.S. policy and peace agreements
clearly indicate that building of a new settlement in Jerusalem
is not only illegal but is extremely destructive and an act of
extreme provocation and incitement that could lead the whole
peace process to unravel," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has criticized Israel's approval of housing
construction in Arab east Jerusalem, saying it complicated an
already complex situation and was not a step to "build
confidence and trust."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Become World's Largest Palm Oil Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will probably become the
world's largest palm oil producer because it is continuously
expanding palm oil plantation area and growing productivity, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Syarifuddin Baharshah said Sunday in
Sukawaringin village, Bangunrejo, Central Lampung, that at present
Indonesia's production of palm oil has exceeded four million tons,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The level of productivity per hectare has increased from 1.6
tons to 2.2 tons and on large enterprise-managed plantations
productivity has even reached 5.4 tons per hectare, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A survey team of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences has also
come to the conclusion that Indonesia will in the future replace
Malaysia as the dominant palm oil producer and regain control of
the oil palm world market.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the area of productive oil palm plantations in
Indonesia increased to two million hectares from 1994, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's palm oil production also increased from four
million tons in 1994 to about 4.7 million tons in 1996 and it is
expected to increase to 7.2 million tons by the year 2000 and to
9.9 million tons by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling MPs Ordered to Back Govt in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party has
ordered all of its lawmakers to support the coalition government
led by Sher Bahadur Deuba during the upcoming vote of confidence
in parliament.
</P>
<P>
President of the Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad
Koirala Sunday issued a whip directing all MPs of his party to
attend the winter session of parliament, which is to start later
today, and vote in favor of the government.
</P>
<P>
The party whip by the NC chief came out after over a dozen of
NC MPs threatened to be absent from the parliament session if
Deuba, who is also an NC leader, does not reduce the size of his
47-member cabinet before the session in accordance with the
party's decision.
</P>
<P>
Deuba last week vowed to reshuffle his cabinet only after his
three-party government obtains a proposed vote of confidence in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to seek the vote of confidence for his
government during the winter session as it had been reduced into
the minority status by an opposition-sponsored no-confidence
motion last December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deuba Sunday registered a motion at the Parliament
Secretariat seeking the vote of confidence in the 205-seat lower
house of parliament during the session, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The winter session, the 11th since the country reintroduced the
multi-party parliamentary system in 1990, will also discuss and
approve some important bills including those on decentralization
and local autonomy.

18 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's cash supply went up by 11.6 percent to 91.7 billion

<HEADLINE> China Improving Freight Train Service To Hong Kong, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Inland parts of China are
trying to shorten the amount of time goods take to reach Hong Kong
and Macao and to make sure that the three express-trains now
available provide fresh or frozen foods and livestock of top
quality more timely.
</P>
<P>
An executive with the Henan Provincial Cereals, Oils and
Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation disclosed in an interview
with Xinhua that an effort is also being made to make arrival
times in Hong Kong or Macao more reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Following a principle of "good quality, proper quantity,
balanced supply, and promptness", railway departments have
acquired 6,000 new pieces of equipment for livestocks or cold
storage, and have built more service stops en route that provide
water, ice, and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The three express freight trains started service in 1962, from
Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Changsha, with the support of
Premier Zhou Enlai, to meet the fresh food needs of Hong Kong and
Macao compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The service has never been shut down, even during the Cultural
Revolution, or in periods of heavy traffic, flooding, bridge
collapses, or landslides.
</P>
<P>
The three trains have carried more than 80 million live pigs,
five million head of cattle, and a large amount of poultry, eggs,
fresh fish, vegetables, fruits, and frozen food in the past 35
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today called on all Albanian parties to "sit around a table"
and seek to restore calm in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is to restore calm in Albania and "all
(Albanian) parties must sit around a table," Dini said on the
sidelines of a trade fair.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the law and order problem in Albania where the
government has resigned and street violence remained unabated, the
Italian foreign minister said, "We cannot maintain law and
order ... this is something (the Albanian) authorities must do."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Albanian authorities to establish dialogue and not
resort to confrontation and violence.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the unstable situation in Albania has become a
problem for all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see intervention by Europe and international
financial organizations," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The two months of protests, which were sparked by the collapse
of popular pyramid investment schemes, showed no signs of ebbing
despite the resignation on Saturday of the government led by Prime
Minister Aleksander Meksi.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out in several cities across the country after
the parliament declared a state of emergency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that four people have been killed by stray bullets
since street violence broke out.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha has threatened to quash the
unrest.

foodstuff, and pharmaceuticals into leading industries locally by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The city had more than 109 billion yuan in industrial output
value in 1996, and an annual growth rate of more than 25 percent
in recent years. In the 1996-2000 period, the city plans to invest
nearly 24 billion yuan in developing the four industries into
local pillar sectors.
</P>
<P>
During that period it also aims to help expand 66 large
enterprises with annual output value exceeding 500 million yuan
each, five of which are expected to have more than five billion
yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will give priority to 14 hi-tech and
popular categories of products, such as optical fibre and cable
and engineering machinery to add local name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output value of the four leading sectors is expected
to account for more than 70 percent of the local total by the turn

<P>
All the concerned departments have been directed for strict

It is reported that in most of the cases the provision of

However, they used to avail this facility for minor ailment and
diseases which could have been easily treated in the country. Due
to this provision, millions of dollars were being wasted annually
and it was an economic burden on the national exchequer.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
saw speedy development in its metallurgy industry in 1996, with
industry profits ranking second among all provinces, reaching 790
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The sector had 24.3 billion yuan in sales and nearly 2.4
billion yuan in pre-tax profits in 1996. This success was the
result of greater efforts by the industry to develop new
technology and restructure its product mix.
</P>
<P>
The province produced more than six million tons of rolled
steel last year, nearly 10 percent more than for the previous
year. Total output of wire, ship-building steel, and seamless
steel tubing rose 38 percent over 1995 to more than 271,000 tons
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Application of new technology has helped the sector add 715
million yuan in returns by increasing output, reducing energy
consumption, and improving product mix. The province's nine steel
mills all use continuous casting technology, and have led the
country in the product in 1996. They produced more than 6.7
million tons of continuous casting billets last year. enditem

BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- All state universities in Thailand
will have electronic libraries within three years, according to
the Thai University Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Between 1998 and 2000, the ministry will spend one billion baht
(40 million U.S. dollars) to upgrade libraries at state-run
universities, Wanchai Sirichana, permanent secretary for the
ministry, was quoted today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
This will involve linking state-run universities through
computer networks to give students nationwide equal access to
information from books, research papers and other materials
available worldwide, Wanchai said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it will help cut the operating cost of libraries,
which have to spend a sizable sum buying new books and mending old
ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Suebsaeng Promboon, a member of the
House Committee on Education, has called on the University Affairs
Ministry to install a fiber optic cable network nationwide so that
people can have a ready access to electronic libraries.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry should also establish a fund to buy
personal computers for students and teachers, push the government
to cut taxes on educational computer software and make Internet

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry in China to See Turning Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's auto industry is
approaching a turning point as more individuals are buying motor
vehicles, today's "China Daily" quoted a senior offical from the
Ministry of Machine-building Industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister Lu Fuyan predicted that when 51 percent of the
automobiles are sold to individuals and institutional purchases no
longer dominate the automotive market, the industry will see the
real turning point.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, 34 percent of China's three million
passenger cars, buses and trucks and at least 95 percent of the 17
million motorcycles and 4.7 million farm vehicles sold were bought
by individuals.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, 2.5 million, or 24 percent of the 10.5 million
passenger cars, trucks and buses were owned privately, compared
with 19 percent of 8.2 million in 1993, 15 percent of 5.5 million
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At the largest automotive market in the country's capital of
Beijing --the Beijing Asian Games Village Automobile Exchange-- 59
percent of the motor vehicles sold last year were bought privately.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that existing regional rules restricting the use of
private vehicles and discrimination against economy cars, as well
as exorbitant taxes and fees levied on car owners will not prevent
demand from rising.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the production and sale of motorcycles have grown
steadily. In 1996, the country churned out 9.3 million units,
compared with 7.8 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that there is a bright side this year as sales of all
types of motor vehicles have risen, heralding a good year for
auto-makers and companies selling cars.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Quality of Industrial Products Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The quality of Chinese
industrial products has maintained a steady rise over the past
decade, with the "first-grade" and "high-quality" products in
particular expanding their shares among the country's industrial
output, according to the newly released results of a nationwide
industrial survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, of 770 kinds of major industrial products, says
that in terms of output value about 19.8 percent of the country's
qualified products met the benchmark standards for "high-quality"
goods in 1995, enjoying the same quality assurance as advanced
foreign products. Meanwhile, 41.5 percent reached the standard of
"first-grade" products, which stands for the average level of
industrial goods on global markets.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of "high-quality" and "first-grade" goods
represents increases of 3.5 percentage points and 16 percentage
points, respectively, from a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
The survey report, however, showed that a quality gap still
remains between domestic products and those of advanced nations,
so Chinese enterprises should make more efforts for quality
improvement.

</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines would continue to have a trade gap
with Bahrain and Qatar due to the country's oil dependency,
Bautista said it could narrow the trade deficit with India,
Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
India's top exports to the Philippines include rice,
pharmaceutical products, beef and steel products. Bangladesh
exports jute bags and some construction materials while Pakistan
provides cotton, leather and fabrics.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Sign WTO Infotech Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
agreed in principle to sign a World Trade Organization (WTO)
agreement that will eliminate or reduce import duties on
information technology products, Local newspaper The Manila Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista
as saying the government has agreed to sign the WTO's Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) after concerned local firms dropped
their opposition to the proposed accord.
</P>
<P>
The opposition of some local companies, many of whom make
infotech products themselves, had earlier prompted the government
to put on hold its endorsement of the ITA, a WTO initiative that
is being pushed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Prevailing tariffs on infotech products range from 3 to 20
percent, but Bautista said most computer products are subject to
import duties of only between 3 and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The elimination or reduction of import duties on infotech
products is expected to boost further the computerization of
Philippine businesses as well as households, he said.
</P>
<P>
In getting the support of affected local firms, the government
decided to adopt a two-stage plan in reducing tariffs on
information technology products, Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the first stage, which will take effect in the
year 2000, entails the removal of tariffs on "non-sensitive"
computer products. The second stage entails the removal of tariffs
on "sensitive products" by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the private sector has also agreed to expand the
list of non-sensitive products, but he did not give an exact
number. The Department of Trade and Industry earlier received a
proposal to limit to only 60 the number of items in government's
list of non-sensitive products.

reached a record amount in 1996, to the tune of 196.742 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The amount was 1.485 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the issue of government bonds in 1985 and annual
issue has been expanding rapidly over the past years, due to a
1995 legal stipulation that the state treasury can no longer cover
fiscal deficits with overdrafts from the central bank and to a
growing need to repay the principal and interest of old bonds.
</P>
<P>
More than 153 billion yuan in treasury bonds was issued in
1995.

<HEADLINE> McRae Leads Leg Two Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Briton Colin McRae leads the
Safari Rally with their Subaru Impreza car after two days and 960
kilometers of competitive sections.
</P>
<P>
The Safari Rally is the third round of world championship. In
Sunday's competitions, Richard Burns of Britain in a Mitsubishi
was only seven minutes behind McRae and Kenyan Ian Duncan was
less than two minutes behind Burns. The two is fighting a close
battle for the second place.
</P>
<P>
McRae had a rear suspension damage during last section, but
managed to keep his leading place.
</P>
<P>
McRae "is using his head, driving really steadily, no
heroics," said McRae's co-driver Nicky Grist.
</P>
<P>
Overnight leader German Armin Schwarz, finished fourth after
some mechanic troubles on his Ford Escort car.
</P>
<P>
Today's run through the rocky regions north of Nairobi, has
been less punishing on the survivors of the first leg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Finn driver Tommi Makinen, 1996's world champion and
Safari winner, retired today as his Mitsubishi car had three
punctures on today's first competitive section.
</P>
<P>
Makinen's car motored on a flat and with transmission troubles
for about 40 kilometers but finally quit 23 kilometers before the
Elburgon control.
</P>
<P>
McRae had an oil leak from his power steering while local
driver Ian Duncan's front struts are still faulty this morning.
</P>
<P>
He went crashing through a wall of rocks placed on the road
near the end of the second competitive section of the day, but
escaped with minor damage to his Subaru.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the rally, regarded widely as the toughest event
on world championships calendar, has changed at least four times
in a dramatic start to the second day of the event.
</P>
<P>
Richard Burns, second overnight and with his Mitsubishi's
clutch no more serviceable, had to come to a near standstill
several times in the dusty wake of Schwarz's limping Ford car
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Burns also dropped crucial minutes with a "clumsy" puncture
change on today's third section.
</P>
<P>
"The car fell off the jack and we were less than brilliant,"
said Burns' navigator Robert Reld.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz and his navigator Denis Giraudet lost nearly half an
hour and the lead with a mid-section repair by themselves to a
broken rear shock-absorber.
</P>
<P>
World championship leader Spaniard Carlos Sainz and Swedish
Kenneth Eriksson, the winner of the latest round in Sweden, were
forced out of rally on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 39 entrants have quit the rally.

<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic met no
further trouble in beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain 6-2, 6-2 in
Sunday's final in Milan and chalked up the Italian Indoor Tennis
title.
</P>
<P>
It was his second ATP Tour title of the year also his second
victory at the Milan event.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old big-serving Croatian used only 45 minutes to
overpower his opponent at Assago Forum.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, world No. 5, improved his record to 22-3 this year
and captured his 19th career title relying on his powerful,
precise serve and deep backhand passing shots.

Bruguera, 26, playing his first final since the 1996 Atlanta

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins Philadelphia Tennis Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and world No. 1 Pete
Sampras beat unseeded Patrick Rafter of Australia 5-7, 7-6 (7-4),
6-3 in the finals of the 589,250-U.S.-dollar Advanta
Championships held in Philadelphia today.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who earned 110,000 dollars, extended his winning
streak to 20 matches and grabbed his 11th title in his last 18
tournaments including the Australian Open in January.
</P>
<P>
He picked up his third singles title of 1997, his third title
at this event and the 47th of his career. He captured the
Australian Open in January and won last month's Sybase Open in
San Jose, California.
</P>
<P>
Sampras served poorly, getting his first serve in play just 55
percent of the time. He was broken by Rafter for three times.
</P>
<P>
He was broken in the third game of the opening set. However,
he broke back in the 10th game as Rafter hit a forehand return
out.
</P>
<P>
The Australian, playing in his first final since Hong Kong in
1994, sprinted around the court, challenging Sampras' approach
shots and volleys, then broke back in the next game and held on
for the set.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Sampras fired an ace to take a 5-4 lead.
Rafter hit a passing shot wide for set point and backhanded a
volley into the net to take the match into the deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Rafter went up a break in the third set, but Sampras broke
back in the next game on a winning overhead smash. Sampras broke
again in the seventh game as Rafter hit a forehand volley into
the net. Sampras concluded the two-hour, 20-minute match with a
forehand, crosscourt winner.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has now won four of five career meetings with Rafter
and improved to 16-0 lifetime in finals against players ranked
outside the top 20. Rafter is currently ranked 60th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, 24, was making his first appearance in an ATP Tour
singles final in three years. He prevailed in Manchester in 1994
for his lone career singles title and also reached the finals in
Hong Kong earlier that year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Premier Removed as Ruling Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's ruling Basotholand
Congress Party (BCP) leader, Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has
been removed as party leader due to a decision taken at a BCP
conference at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
BCP Secretariat announced tonight in Maseru, capital of
Lesotho that Mokhehle's dismissal from the party leadership
resulted from a report by the BCP secretary-general which pointed
out his weakness as party leader.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association quoted unidentified BCP
officials as charging that Mokhehle failed to perform his duties
effectively and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle was also accused of failing to attend several
meetings of the National Executive Committee and the BCP Working
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He allegedly attended only one meeting of the BCP Working
Committee since he was elected as party leader.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said Mokhehle's removal as party leader is
likely to plunge the kingdom into a constitutional crisis,
because under Lesotho's constitution, the leader of the majority
party in parliament or the leader of a coalition of political
parties shall form the government.
</P>
<P>
The news about whether Mokhehle will command the support of
the majority BCP in parliament is not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Meet Opposition to Reduce Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan said today that he would meet opposition
leaders in a bid to reduce the current political tension in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters prior to a meeting of his Welfare
Party's central executive board, Erbakan said Turkey was really
in need of a relaxed and peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would start a round of discussions with
opposition leaders to explore means for achieving such an aim.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made this announcement as local media said that the
coalition government would receive some important recommendations
from the National Security Council (NSC) Monday.
</P>
<P>
These points from the NSC meeting, which was held Friday, were
reportedly aimed at underscoring a total commitment to the
secular system established by Kemel Ataturk, founder of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Severely warned by the NSC to safegauard Turkish secularism,
Erbakan said he would hold his first meeting Monday with leaders
of the Democratic Left Party Bulent Ecevit, one of his harshest
critics.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the main one of the NSC
recommendations was a suggestion of reviving article 163 of
the Turkish Penal Code, which bans politically motivated religious
activities, especially those that endangered the country's
secular system.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Party's recent proposals on ordering women civil
servants to wear Islamic-style head covering in government
offices and building a mosque in one of Istanbul's main
commercial squares triggered strong criticism from the secular
forces in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a Muslim nation which has a secular system.
