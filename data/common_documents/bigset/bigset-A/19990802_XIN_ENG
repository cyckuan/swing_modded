<HEADLINE> President: Syria Serious in Pursuing Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
said his country was serious in its pursuit of fair and
comprehensive peace to "preserve its national fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
Assad made the remarks in a message to the Syrian armed forces
on the occasion of the 54th anniversary of the founding of the
Syrian army.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the message, the Damascus Radio said "the fundamentals
are based on justice and international legitimacy. We expect the
others to share with us the desire to establish fair and
comprehensive peace and return the usurped rights and land to
their legitimate owners."
</P>
<P>
Syria advocates the establishment of genuine peace that can put
an end to occupation and aggression, and create favorable
conditions for coexistence among all parties, Assad said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Syria was not responsible for the missing
chances of realizing peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East
war. The talks between the two sides on the return of the Golan
Heights broke down in early 1996 due to the intransigence of
Israeli former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Peace is a noble goal and pressing need for the region and the
world as well, Assad said, adding "it is not us who put hurdles on
the road to this goal."
</P>
<P>
Assad reiterated that the Golan Heights would return to the
embraces of the homeland sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he underlined the parallelism of peace talks on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon, in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Turkish Claim on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran Sunday rejected a claim made
recently by Turkish Foreign Ministry that one of the places hit
by the Turkish warplanes is located out of Iranian borders.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi expressed
regret at the claim and said Ankara tries to make false claims in
covering up its violation of Iranian air space and bombing Iranian
territory to avoid consequences.
</P>
<P>
Iran respects international borders and territory integrity
of other countries, which is part of Iran's foreign policy, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Ankara would be better to live up to
its legal and political obligations to compensate rather than
making baseless claims.
</P>
<P>
Iran had said that four Turkish warplanes raided the border
region of Piranshahr on July 18, killing five people and injuring
10 others.
</P>
<P>
Protesting against the bombing, Iranian Foreign Ministry
summoned the Turkish charge d'affaire to Tehran twice in a week.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Turkish delegation toured the hit sites, a border
military post controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
and a summer camping site of nomadic tribes. They also inspected
an unexploded missile in Piranshahr region in Iran's West
Azarbaijan province.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit, Turkish Foreign Ministry said Thursday
that one of the places hit by the Turkish warplanes is situated
out of Iranian borders.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey have been in a new tension following the air
raids as Iran accused Turkey of violating its territory while
Turkey blamed Iran for supporting Turkish outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

the Moscow State University and held the equivalent of a doctorate
in history.
</P>
<P>
He started diplomatic service in 1964 and worked in the Soviet
embassies in Yemen and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, EU Discuss Regional Issues, Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and his Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen held talks on
Sunday in Alexandria on regional issues and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the latest developments in the Mideast
peace process, efforts exerted by the concerned parties to bring
the peace process back on track and the role of the European Union
(EU), Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Halonen arrived in the Mediterranean port city, 220 kilometers
northwest of Cairo, earlier in the day for a two-day visit within
a regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Finland is holding EU's rotating presidency for the second half
of 1999. The 15-nation European bloc desires to play a key role in
the Mideast peace process and keeps a close contact with Egypt,
the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and an
active mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in May, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has repeatedly expressed readiness to push the peace talks with
the Palestinians forward and resume negotiations with Syria, which
came to halt in early 1996. Barak has also voiced welcome to any
efforts aimed at giving momentum to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two foreign ministers also tackled other
regional and international issues of mutual interest, including
the situation in the Mediterranean, the Gulf and the Balkans, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Halonen also discussed ways of boosting their
partnership within the framework of the Barcelona process, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona process, or Euro-Med partnership, kicked off
during the 1995 conference in Barcelona, Spain, is aimed at
forging close cooperation in political coordination, economy,
trade, security and social affairs among the EU members and 12
Mediterranean countries, including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and the EU have endorsed the text of their
partnership agreement after nearly four years of negotiations. The
accord provides for more open trade, coordination in many economic
and financial areas, a political dialog and joint efforts to
combat money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Halonen is also expected to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.

A team made up of representatives from the security agencies

is to collect first- hand information from the Nigerian
authorities on the circumstances surrounding the alleged
importation to help with investigations in Ghana.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Considers Delaying Troop Withdrawal Until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that Israel will put off troop withdrawal from
the West Bank stipulated in an interim agreement with the
Palestinians until October 1, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak told a cabinet meeting that implementation of other
aspects of the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, including the release of
Palestinian political prisoners, would start by the end of August
or early September, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Barak's timetable for the
implementation of the Wye agreement had been revealed by Israeli
media.
</P>
<P>
Since winning the May election, Barak has pledged to revive the
peace process with the Palestinians and Syria, largely frozen
under the three years of rule by his hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, he has committed himself to the Wye
agreement, signed and then frozen by Netanyahu late last year, but
proposed some changes to its implementation, suggesting the
combination of some parts with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered interim deal calls for Israeli withdrawal
from additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures on security.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu halted the implementation of the agreement after
handing over 2 percent to the Palestinians in the first of its
three stages, citing alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
Barak hopes the Palestinians would agree to bypass or at least
postpone for three to six months the final stage of the remaining
two phases in troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Barak fears the withdrawal would create sources
of friction between Israeli settlers and Palestinians since some
settlements would be isolated after the troop pullbacks, and thus
harm the chance of reaching a permanent agreement in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
During their summit last week, Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat reluctantly accepted Barak's suggestion to
consider the proposal for two weeks, but stressed that the
Palestinians would not agree to any delay and change in the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised that he would carry out the accord
immediately if his proposal was rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been lobbying for international support
for their positions in the past week. Both sides have called
on Washington to intervene to resolve the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Set Free More Demonstrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police Sunday
released 44 of the 75 men who participated in an illegal
demonstration in the capital Dar es Salaam two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told reporters here
Sunday that the 44 men were freed after it was discovered that
their role in the denaturation was minimal.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said the remaining 31 man are still kept in police custody
as they are believed to be the major players in the demonstration
in Dar es Salaam Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration led to an unrest in which many people in the
streets were wounded after rioters began to threw stones, bottles
and pieces of iron at the police.
</P>
<P>
To disperse rioters who were gathering around the Manyema
Mosque in the Kariakoo area, policemen fired tear gases and used
pistols, dogs and horses, seizing 75 men and 21 women.
</P>
<P>
The women, however, were released hours after they were
detained.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said the released women confessed before the law enforcers
that fundamentalists told them to wear hijab, or Moslem headscarf,
to make the event colorful and enhance the spirits of the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapuya tabled a move before the National Assembly or parliament
demanding the right for Moslem girls to wear hijab in common
schools and when attending Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya, himself a Moslem, later withdrew the move amid concerns
of the majority of members of parliament, who claimed that
Tanzania is a secular country in which students in common schools
are supposed to wear school uniforms when attending classes.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya's change of position has caused wide protests from
Moslems and the riot was ensued.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma urged people to maintain
peace and security in the country and guard against those who use
religious forums to fulfill their ill intentions.
</P>
<P>
Meeting sheiks and imams in Dar es Salaam, Juma said proper
procedures should be followed when people wish to present their
grievances to the government. He said Friday's demonstration was
not the best way.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the sheiks condemned the demonstration as a
hooligan affair. They said Moslems should be engaged in activities
according to the Koran.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Moslem leaders asked the government to
form a coordination body so as to enable Moslems to channel their
grievances smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president directed the Dar es Salaam regional
commander to determine who were accidentally rounded up in the
Friday demonstration and set the innocent free as soon as
possible.

CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday threw another
person, who claimed himself a prophet, into prison, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Alexandria Juveniles Criminal Court sentenced Ibrahim Sayed
Ibrahim to three years imprisonment with hard labor for contempt

Ibrahim, a 17-year-old student who was arrested at the end of

stability by claiming himself a prophet.
</P>
<P>
His five followers were acquitted, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, an Alexandria court gave Ibrahim Mahfouz, a retired
civil servant, a five-year jail term for claiming to be God's
messenger and abusing religion.
</P>
<P>
Mahfouz's 21 followers were also given 1-3 years of prison
terms on charges of collaborating with him.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rebuffs KLA Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Sunday condemned as "absolutely unacceptable" the conduct of
Kosovo Liberation Army chiefs and remarks of Hashim Taqi, the KLA
political leader.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Taqi's remarks in connection with the
detention of the KLA chief of staff, Agim Ceku, was a "gross
provocation," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian peacekeepers stopped a group of people wearing KLA
uniform in the town of Kijevo Saturday and Ceku was among the
group, the ministry's statement said.
</P>
<P>
The detained people were released upon being identified, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Taqi said it was "a premeditated act with a political aim" and
made threats against Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"Russian peacekeepers' actions fully comply with the agreed
upon rules for the presence of peacekeeping contingents in
Kosovo," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The KLA claims of being in charge of the situation in Kosovo
contradict resolution 1244 of the U.N. Security Council, the
Kosovo settlement principles, which were adopted by G-8, and other
documents determining the status and objectives of the
international peacekeepers in Kosovo," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Tolerance to the KLA illegal use of force against local Serbs
prompted its leaders to make public threats against international
peacekeepers," the statement said, calling for "urgent and
efficient steps" to make the KLA "unequivocally comply with all
requirements of the Kosovo peace process and to avert events that
could jeopardize the peacekeeping operation."
</P>
<P>
It said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has sent messages to the
United Nations, the leadership of the peacekeeping operation and
his G-7 counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Impeding Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday accused the
U.S. and British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee
of impeding its transport contracts signed under the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Murtadha Ahmed, Minister of Transport and Communications,
said in a statement carried by Iraqi News Agency that the
contracts concluded by his ministry are still on hold despite the
elapse of a long period since they were concluded.
</P>
<P>
These contracts provide the transport sector with spare parts
under the oil-for-food program, he said, adding that the
contracts worth very tiny sums that do not cope with the needs of
this sector.
</P>
<P>
The contracts include some spare parts and some buses, but
U.S. and British representatives in the Sanctions Committee
blocked their approval, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations allocated for this sector sums
to cover needs of railways with an estimated amount of 15 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The transport sector signed a contract with the French Alstom
Company in June 1998, and one with a Chinese company to supply 80
buses in January 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking or delaying the approval of
its contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, now in its sixth phase which
started on May 25, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion dollars
worth of oil in six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is making effort to
curb the spread of tuberculosis, with 32,581 TB sufferers having
got access to direct observation treatments (Dots) over the past
seven years, an official of the Health Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Ketema, an expert working in National TB and Leprosy
Control Program Office, said at the weekend that 12,477 of the TB
patients got the treatment in last Ethiopian year ending July 8.
</P>
<P>
Dots, proved to be an effective way of treating TB and
recommended by the World Health Organization, was launched in
Ethiopia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been for years carrying out its TB and Leprosy
Control Program in major parts of the country at the cost of 13
million U.S. dollars secured from the government of Netherlands,
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to popularize the program throughout
the country by 2002, the expert said, adding by that time 75
percent of the country's population will become beneficiary of the
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Luneng Taishan remained on top of
the 14-team Chinese First Division soccer league after forcing a 1-
1 drew with Tianjin Taida in the 17th round match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Luneng Taishan, took over the leading spot in last Sunday's
15th round, also became the first team ensured their berth for
next season's first division competition with a leading 32 points
from a win-drew-loss outcome of 9-5-3 after 17 of the total 26
rounds competition.
</P>
<P>
Luneng Taishan found themselves trailed 0-1 at the 29th minute
when the visiting Taida open the score with follow-up shot by Chi
Rongliang.
</P>
<P>
But Luneng Taishan tied it at 1-1 with a penalty goal with 17
minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Luneng Taishan now is holding just one point leading margin
over second placers Liaoning Fushun, who trounced the bottom team
of Wuhan Heart A 5-2 in a road victory.
</P>
<P>
In the third position of the 14-team standings was Shanghai
Shenhua, who recover from their first loss of the season in last

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Votes to Expand Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Sunday approved as expected a bill presented by the coalition of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to enlarge the cabinet from 18
ministers to 24.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset voted 68-32 to amend the legislation on government
to allow Barak to widen his cabinet, a move the prime minister
hopes will give him the broad backing he needs to accelerate peace
talks with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The bill secured its approval after Barak resolved a minor
dispute with one of his key coalition partners, the Shas party, by
agreeing to its demand that the party be allocated two more deputy
ministerial posts in the expansion.
</P>
<P>
The 17-seat Shas is the third largest party in the 120-member
Knesset and it has four ministers in Barak's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Since winning the May election on a platform to move forward
the Middle East peace process, Barak has managed to cobble
together a coalition that garners 75 seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
He has sought to expand the cabinet in an effort to satisfy his
coalition partners vying for governmental posts.
</P>
<P>
His move has raised criticism both in the opposition and his
own coalition. The critics said the government expansion would
cost tens of millions of extra shekels.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset, which begins its summer recess Monday, will
convene a special session later this week to swear in the six new
ministers and all the deputies ministers.

<HEADLINE> Albania Restores Its First Cinema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Albania has reopened its first
cinema, rewriting its chronicles without a cinema since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
The new cinema, called "Millennium," was inaugurated in
downtown Tirana late Saturday afternoon after the reconstruction
of the old movie house "Republic" when Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani cut the ribbon.
</P>
<P>
The cinema, which cost the government 300,000 U.S. dollars in
reconstruction, will operate under several policies, including an
anti-pornographic rule, show of films on Sundays for children, and
introduction of Albanian films.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA) Sunday said the movie
houses in Albania gradually disappeared since the early 1990s when
the country moved towards a private economy.
</P>
<P>
The cinemas since then have been privatized, or changed their
function, turning into clubs, game houses, store houses or other
premises, the Albanian official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Albanian Culture Minister Edi Rama as saying
that Albania will no longer be the only country without a cinema
in the world (perhaps in Europe), although it just has one.

<HEADLINE> Waldner Says He Is Not A Spent Force  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Never too old to
learn. Never too old to play table tennis.
</P>
<P>
Competitive table tennis is a sport for the old and experienced
more than the young and strong, said Jan-Ove Waldner, one of table
tennis oldies here bidding for a repeat of former glory.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede and one of all-time table tennis legends
said those over-30 guys would be forces to be reckoned with in the
world table tennis championships which opens here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a few veteran players have experience, skill and strong
psyche, you'd better keep an eye on them," said the only player in the
world who has won a "Grand Slam" of Olympic, world championships and
World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good because we are playing in Europe," added
Waldner. "The home-court advantage may help."
</P>
<P>
Waldner still keeps Chinese players in awe.
</P>
<P>
"Except Olympic champion Liu Guoliang who has beaten Waldner
five straight times, the Chinese players are more or less afraid of
the immensely talented Swede," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who has developed an all-round game of deceptive serves
and follow-up attack, has won so many titles that he lost count.
</P>
<P>
Waldner has competed in the world championships for eight times,
on four occasions he has reached the final and twice he emerged
victorious.
</P>
<P>
Between his 1989 and 1997 world singles titles were the Olympic
gold medal in 1992, European champion in 1994 and four European Top
12 crowns.
</P>
<P>
Waldner was on Sunday drawn into the second quarter with World Cup
holder Jorg Rosskopf of Germany. If everything goes as rankings,
World No. 5 Waldner will take on No. 3 Kong Linghui of China in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"My draw is not bad," said Waldner. "Rosskopf has a shoulder
problem and he is not in form, and I have a good record against
Kong."
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus and South Korea's World
Cup runner-up Kim Taek Soo are bundled in the first quarter, while
two-time World Cup winner Zoran Primorac tops the third quarter. The
30-year-old Croatian will very likely fight for a semifinal berth with
Chinese upstart Wang Liqin.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter of the men's singles draw begins with Swedish
Jorgen Persson, 32, and ends with dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Toll In India's Rail Accident Up to 250 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 250 passengers were
killed and over 460 injured early Monday morning in one of the
worst rail accidents in India.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred when a Delhi-bound mail train collided
head-on with an east-bound express in the wee hours Monday in
Gaisal of the Northern Siligury District of the West Bengal state.
</P>
<P>
While Indian railway officials in New Delhi confirmed 190
deaths and injuries to 310 others, reports quoted officials of the
Border Security Forces supervising rescue operations at the scene
as saying that some 200 bodies had already been extricated from
the badly Twisted remains of the two trains which collided at
01:55 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 bodies were lying at different hospitals nearby
where the condition of over 100 injured was "serious", rescuers
and voluntary organizations reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal Minister of State for Civil Defense Srikumar
Mukherjee, who was supervising rescue operations at the scene,
reportedly estimated that the toll might cross the 500 mark.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers feared that about 250 passengers were still trapped in
the four bogies, which could not be reached till Monday evening
due to lack of gas cutters and their precarious position and
chances of their survival were described as bleak.
</P>
<P>
Local news media said earlier Monday that at least 500 people
were feared killed and over 1,000 injured in the train mishap,
which killed four drivers of the two trains.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Nitish Kumar, accompanied by senior railway
officials, rushed to the site Monday and met some of the injured
passengers in nearby hospitals, according to the Press Trust of
India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The central government has announced an ex-gratia of 25,000
rupees (581 U.S. dollars) to the next of those killed, 5,000
rupees (162 U.S. dollars) to those seriously injured and 500
rupees (11.6 U.S. dollars) to those with manor injuries.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Railway Ministry said the accident could be due
to a human error while a railway police officer said it was caused
by a signal failure.
</P>
<P>
This might be the worst railway accident that ever happened in
India in the last decade, during which over 1,500 people were
killed in some 30 tragedies.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 last year, a south-bound express train rammed
into three derailed coaches near Khanna in Ludhiana district of
the Northwest Punjab state, killing some 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The worst train accident before the latest happened in August
1995 when 302 people were killed as a Delhi-bound express train
rammed into a stationary passenger train near Firozabad in North
Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan expressed shock
Monday over the rail accident at Gaisal and extended his heartfelt
condolences to the families of the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
PTI reported at the site that at least 14 compartments beside
the engines of both trains bore the brunt of the collision and
four compartments telescoped into each other.
</P>
<P>
The victims of the mail train were mostly army men and border
security forces, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports claimed that preliminary information suggested
the accident was a case of a bomb blast, but after seeing the
actual position of the engine and compartments of the trains, it
seemed to be a case of head-on collision.
</P>
<P>
The Railway Ministry announced a statutory inquiry into the
cause of the tragedy by Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety M.
Mani.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's dominant Taliban
militia Monday captured Jablus Siraj and reached the mouth of the
Panjsher valley, the stronghold of the opposition forces, the
Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) agency reported.
</P>
<P>
AIP said Taliban troops were carrying out clean-up operations
around Chakikar, capital of Parwan province the militia captured
earlier Monday, and Jablus Siraj, some 70 kilometers north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It said the Taliban lost five lives in the battle against 28 of
opposition forces killed and 130 taken prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Afghan analysts here said the capture of Jablus Siraj puts the
Taliban in an advantageous position to attack the Panjsher valley.
</P>
<P>
The troops loyal to former defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood
have retreated into the valley.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Taliban forces Monday began clean-up operations in
the vast areas they captured from Masood forces who have been
pushed back some 50 kilometers from the positions they were
occupying as close as 25 kilometers from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that some 1,500 pieces of arms also fell
to the hands of the Islamic militia during the clean-up
operations.
</P>
<P>
Several strategic points including Nejrab, one of the seven
known entries into the Panjsher valley, and Bagram, the only air
base of the opposition forces, have fallen into the militia since
the latter launched a major offensive last Wednesday against the
Masood forces.
</P>
<P>
Another AIP report said the Taliban troops had also captured
Mahmmud-i-Raqi, capital of the northeastern province of Kapisa.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have been waging a five-year-old war against forces
loyal to Masood who hold the northeast provinces.

<HEADLINE> Special Fund Allocated to Flood-Hit Thai Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided
to allocate a 150 million baht (4.1 million U.S. dollars) special
fund for the northern province of Chantaburi which was hit by
severe flood, Channel 9, the state television, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, five people have died and another three were missing in
the flood, which was described as the worst in the province this
century.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 8,000 families, or around 40,000
people, in the most seriously hit Muang district have been
affected by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart inspected the
province and distributed goods to the affected people there.
</P>
<P>
The province has been suffering from flash floods since last
Friday, when heavy rains began to pour into the province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have ordered the urgent distribution
of 10,000 packs of food and drink to people seriously affected by
the flood.
</P>
<P>
Officers have been using flat-bottomed boats to evacuate people
to safe areas, while using helicopters to reach people in remote
areas. School and temple buildings have been used as shelters for
the displaced people.
</P>
<P>
As the rain decreased Monday, the water level in the province
has receded significantly.
</P>
<P>
However, the Meteorology Department of Thailand warned that
there would be more heavy rain throughout the country over the
next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Flash floods could happen any time in some areas of the upper
Northeastern, Eastern, and upper Southern regions.

<HEADLINE> 15 Detained in Destructive Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi police Monday detained
15 persons for "creating anarchy" and "damaging public property"
here during the first day of the opposition-sponsored 30-hour
nationwide destructive strike.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 riot police and paramilitary Bangladesh Rifle
forces were deployed at different important points in the capital,
and a police constable was seriously injured in the capital city
when a teargas shell bounced back from his own gun.
</P>
<P>
Barring some stray incidents, the shutdown was largely peaceful
and life was almost normal throughout the country. Most of the
government, semi-government and private offices remained open, and
rickshaws and many buses plied in the streets defying the strike,
the eighth of its kind sponsored by the opposition alliance this
year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, which includes the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the
Islami Oikya Jote, started the strike Monday to protest the
government's decision last week allowing "corridor to India in the
name of transshipment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Bangladesh Awami League brought out
anti-strike processions in the city protesting the 30-hour strike
enforced by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Destructive strike is very common in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call strikes to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-strike activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatian striker Davor Suker is to
replace Arsenal's outgoing French striker Nicolas Anelka,
according to the club here on Monday.

With Anelka on the verge of signing with Real, ending three

Suker from Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Suker, the leading goalscorer in the '98 World Cup, where he
lifted Croatia into the semifinals, is moving on a transfer worth
3.5 million pounds (about 5.64 million U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Military Situation Worsens in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The military situation in
Southern Somalia is getting more complicated as the opposing
local factions, Ethiopian and Eritrean involvement are further
devastating the lives of thousands of nomads and farmers.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports from Lower Shabelle Region controlled by
Hussein Mohamed Aidid indicate that the town of Aw- Dhegleh, about
80 km south of the capital, Sunday night fell for the new armed
group called the Digil Salvation Army (DSA) fighting against
Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed reports received through the VHF radios
in the neighboring villages and towns, Aw-Dhegleh district is
being run by the DSA forces and is reportedly quiet and calm.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said the shooting was heard in Barirreh
village and the towns of Qoryoley and Jannaleh in the region
controlled by forces loyal to Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Asad Abdi Mohamed, the spokesman of the DSA, also said that the
town has fallen for his forces early in Sunday evening. Mohamed
said his forces using battle wagons and infantry troops have
taken control of the town at about 7:00 PM Sunday night chasing
away the forces of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this stage
since all communications have been either cut off or been put
under firm control by the DSA forces.
</P>
<P>
However, according to eyewitnesses who fled the fighting Sunday
night at least four people were killed and nearly ten others were
wounded during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The DSA spokesman who briefly spoke with reporters in Mogadishu
 Monday said that his forces did not suffer any casualties.
</P>
<P>
In response to Sunday night's sudden attack on Aw-Dhegleh town,
Hussein Aidid's forces launched early Monday morning what could
be termed as a counter-attack against the DSA forces in Aw-Dhegleh
town.
</P>
<P>
Strong militia preparations have been visible in the streets of
the capital Monday for the reorganization of another
counter-attack operation against the DSA men in Aw-Dhegleh town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least five people including a woman were killed
and 15 others were wounded after militiamen loyal to Muse Sudi
Yalahow have exchanged heavy gunfire with militiamen escorting a
lorry transporting commercial goods on the way from El-Ma'an
natural port to Mogadishu Monday.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of Muse Sudi have reportedly erected a
checkpoint and tried to tax the lorries coming from El-Ma'an
port, an attempt refused by the militiamen escorting to
commercial convoys.

<P>
NANNING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The public security department in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has arrested 6
members of a gang suspected of involvement in the armed robbery of
a bank and casinos in Macao.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary police report said that the gang is accused of
four armed robberies between 1991 and 1994 in Macao with

casino in the Hyatt Hotel, another casino in a major hotel, a
commercial bank, and a hotel, taking away money and casino chips
valued at over 40 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Macao police discovered that the people involved in the Hyatt
Hotel robbery were members of the Macao Mafia working with people
from the mainland and reported the case to the Zhuhai Public
Security Bureau in Guangdong Province in September, 1994. Zhuhai
police arrested two members of the gang. Then, this January,
police in Guangxi found evidence of the gang and by July 20 had

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japan Congress Against A and H
Bombs (Gensuikin) on Monday opened a two-day international
conference in Hiroshima, western Japan, calling for efforts to
make the 21st century free of nuclear weapons and wars, the Kyodo
News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 antinuclear advocates and academics, including 11 from
abroad, took part in the annual conference sponsored by Gensuikin,
an antinuclear group backed by Japan's Social Democratic Party (
SDP).
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Shigetoshi Iwamatsu, executive
committee chairman of the conference, said that even though
negative signs for peace are seen as Japan steps up defense
cooperation with the United States with newly enacted laws, "
discussions with people from various countries will help
strengthen movements to realize a nuclear-free world in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
The group called on the world to take concrete measures for
nuclear disarmament and abolition of nuclear weapons and requested
the Japanese government to take the initiative in the global
antinuclear movement.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first of the group's series of
antinuclear events until August 9 to commemorate the 54th
anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's Scientists Forum of World Conference Against
A and H bomb also held its 12th annual meeting in Shizuoka,
central Japan, with some 150 people attending for talks on
scientists' roles in realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The forum began in 1987 and is linked with the Japan Council
Against A and H Bombs (Gensuikyo), backed by the Japanese
Communist Party (JCP).

<HEADLINE> Clashing Schedules Hold Chinese Swimmers from Pan Pacs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China had pulled out 15 swimmers
of the Pan Pacific international meeting due to the conflicting
schedules with domestic competitions, according to Chinese
swimming officials here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We reduced our line-up to five swimmers for the Pan Pacs
because of the clashing schedules," said Zhang Qiuping, spokesman
of the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA).
</P>
<P>
Zeng Qiliang, world No. 3 in the men's 100 meters breaststroke
last year, and Fu Yong, number 4 in the men's 200m backstroke on
the world rankings, will spearhead the five-member Chinese squad,
including three males and two females to the Pan Pacs from August
19 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese national team originally planned to send 20
swimmers to the two-day Pan Pacs event in Sydney, Australia, which
is the main warm-up event prior to the 2000 Olympic Games. But now
they have only five swimmers remained as the rest of the squad
were asked by their provincial associations to compete in the
National City Games.
</P>
<P>
"The National City Games, held very four years, is more
important for our provincial associations." Zhang said. "The City
Games is slated to kick off in September, just 10 days after the
Pan Pacs and the Military World Games is also in advance in the
mid August."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National City Games, inaugurated in Shandong
Province in 1988, has made big progress in developing young
potentials across the whole country in the last decade because of
the age-limitation for its participants and the winners will bring
a lot of pride to their local associations and fans.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our swimmers who were under the age limit and
qualified for the National City Games won't compete the Pan Pacs,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
While young swimmers are preparing for the City Games, elder
swimmers are concentrating on the biannual National Championships
in mid October, which is the first of the only two national
Olympic trails.
</P>
<P>
CSA had tested 326 swimmers for banned drugs through the end of
June, including 196 out-of-competition tests, and all the results
turned out negative, according to Zhang.

JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President

<HEADLINE> Plutonium From U.S., Russia to Remain in Canada Forever: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Surplus Plutonium from U.S. and
Russian weapons will remain forever in Canada after being used in
Ontario nuclear reactors, the Globe and Mail newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a signed memo from the Department of Foreign Affairs,
the newspaper reported that Canada will become the permanent
repository for some of the most dangerous waste products from the
nuclear-arms race, once the country starts using plutonium as fuel
in its generating stations.
</P>
<P>
This is against the backdrop where Canada has not been able to
develop a long-term storage site for atomic waste from its own
generating stations, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo written by a Canadian Foreign Affairs nuclear-
proliferation expert, Canadian officials met with their U.S.
counterparts on Canada's offer to use as fuel the weapons-grade
plutonium left over from up to 40,000 surplus nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
"The DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) should be advised that
this is the Canadian government position and it is also the
position of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. and Ontario Hydro," the
newspaper quoted the document as saying.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of plutonium in the spent weapons-grade fuel
will be 68 percent higher than regular uranium, which is usually
used by Canadian atomic plants. But reactors using the plutonium
need about 15 percent less fuel, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin: Russia Against Iran Acquiring Nuke Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said here Monday that "the acquisition of nuclear
weapons by any country, including Iran," is not in Moscow's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin made the statement following his meeting with
visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who expressed concern
about the alleged "penetration of missile know-how into Iran, and
about the absence of control over this in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"If there are any fears or suspicions that know-how which
could be used by Iran in the making of nuclear weapons is leaking
from Russia, Moscow is ready to look into these issues," the
Interfax news agency quoted Stepashin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Barak had been very productive. "
We understood one another and found a common language. I had the
feeling that I've known Barak for a long time. We openly
discussed the most complicated of issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We both have come to the conclusion that Russia could take a
more active part in the settlement of the Middle East situation
and in the normalization of Israeli-Syrian relations," Stepashin
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a serious step could be taken today toward the
normalization of relations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"This chance must not be let slip by Israel, Syria, Russia or
the United States," said Stepashin. Barak echoed by saying that "
this chance must be taken advantage of."
</P>
<P>
Barak said Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace
process, could make a significant contribution to a Middle East
settlement.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Stepashin said the two sides have agreed to
restart the work of the Intergovernmental Trade and Economic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an agreement concerning cooperation between the
Russian and Israeli law-enforcement agencies in the fight against
crime and terrorism has also been reached, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who arrived here early Monday on a one-day working
visit, also met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Barak said during the meeting with the Russian leaders, the
two sides had "detailed discussions on the peace process in the
Middle East and on the contribution Russia could make to the
restoration of peace in this region. We also discussed issues
pertaining to Iran and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Barak also urged Stepashin to help find two Israeli citizens
who have gone missing in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism was also a topic during the talks. "The Russian
side has assured us that it will do everything possible to curb
anti-Semitism," Barak said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Faction Rejects Offer to Join PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A major Palestinian opposition
faction has turned down Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's offer
to join the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Damascus, Syria, Maher Taher, spokesman for
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), told
reporters here on Monday that Arafat has proposed that PFLP
officials take posts in the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"But we will not take part" in the Gaza-based administration,
Taher said, adding that the PFLP will not "deal with the Oslo
agreement and its consequences," referring to the 1993 peace deal
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met here on Sunday with Abu Ali Moustafa, deputy chief
of the Damascus-based PFLP. The meeting, the first since 1993,
was aimed at ending a six-year rift over the Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended on an upbeat note, with representatives of
both sides terming the meeting as a success and on the right path.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to meet again in a few weeks and
decided to set up a committee comprising two members from each
side to make a list of proposals for reactivating the role of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and achieving Palestinian

With peace hopes having revived by the election of Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat wants to make sure the divisions

The final status talks will deal with the most difficult issues
of the peace process, including the Palestinian statehood, the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Foreign Currency Rating Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's long-term
foreign currency rating of "BB" was confirmed Monday, indicating
growing faith in the country's credit-worthiness, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The international credit rating agency, Fitch IBCA, said
although, South Africa had had a difficult year in 1998, facing
large outflows of foreign capital, a sharp depreciation in the
rand and virtually no economic growth, it did manage to avoid the
sharp fall in output and rise in bad debt and bankruptcies
suffered by many other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, it passed an important stress test," Fitch was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said there had been some recovery in both foreign confidence
and the currency this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency warned that the country faced even higher
unemployment and described its external debt burden as
"potentially volatile".
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the country's recovery remained vulnerable
to its low international liquidity and that the high crime level
and AIDS crisis posed serious threats to the economy.
</P>
<P>
"There may also be a return to economic growth, but
unemployment will almost certainly increase further from its
already high level.
</P>
<P>
"The incipient recovery remains vulnerable to the country's low
 international liquidity, even though short-term credit lines to
the Reserve Bank are in place.
</P>
<P>
"The Reserve Bank has also accumulated substantial uncovered
forward liabilities during its past defense of the rand, which
greatly exceed actual foreign reserves and pose a continuing risk
to market confidence, as does the high proportion of total South
African external debt, which is potentially volatile," the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
Listing South Africa's achievements, the agency said the
government had been able to reduce progressively the fiscal
deficit since 1994 and hold the government debt to GDP ratio
steady at just under 50 percent for the past four year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing exports, which were also disappointing last year,
should benefit from the depreciation and continue to erode South
Africa's traditional over-dependence on minerals, especially gold.
The fall in the gold price, however, had not been helpful.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, South Africa under ANC (African National Congress)
rule has demonstrated that it can retain its traditional credit
strengths: a sound and well-run banking system, good physical
infrastructure, and a functioning civil legal system.
</P>
<P>
Also in the country's favor was the fact that traditional
political risks had diminished. The ANC government had proven its
political maturity through a second, successful and peaceful
parliamentary election and the smooth transition in the hand over
of power to President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"The government has also made significant progress in defusing
the tensions in KwaZulu-Natal and cementing the Inkatha Freedom
Party into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
"Although the ethnic mix retains the potential to cause
trouble, political extremists, both black and white, are less of a
risk.
</P>
<P>
"However, violent crime is a major fear among all sectors of
the community and a threat to social stability and inward
investment, of which South Africa requires more," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The country's short-term foreign currency rating of "B" and
long-term local currency "BBB" rating were also confirmed by the
agency.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Evidence of Japanese Crimes Over 50 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China today revealed some
materials it says prove that crimes were committed by Japan's Unit
731 during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six volumes of materials have been made available by the
Heilongjiang provincial government to both Chinese and foreigners
to provide solid proof of Unit 731's germ warfare experiments that
used live people.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for China to make such materials
available to the public, according to Tian Ruzheng, the head of
Heilongjiang Archives. These records were selected by researchers
from the provincial archives of the years 1941 to 1944. They are
printed with the Japanese expression "special transfer", meaning
prisoners who were sent by the Japanese to Unit 731 to be for
experiments.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 was part of Japan's Kwantung Army, whose headquarters
were in Harbin during World War II and which had a reputation for
manufacturing materials for germ warfare that were tested on live
people.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have guessed, based on confessions of Japanese war
criminals, that more than 3,000 people died from the experiments
between 1940 and 1945, but these records suggest a much larger
figure.
</P>
<P>
Judging from these records, at least 936 Chinese, Soviets,
Mongolians, and Koreans who were fighting the Japanese died as
special transfer victims in the first nine months of 1941.
</P>
<P>
The Kwantung Army headquarters burned and buried the records of
Unit 731 to get rid of evidence just before Japan surrendered on
August 15, 1945. The materials that were made public today are
just a small part of the archives that were found by accident.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Table Tennis Players Too Powerful for Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese were so
powerful and dominant that they just lost one set on the opening day
of the world table tennis championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese but a mixed doubles duo entered the second round with
straight-set victories. Only Tan Ruiwu and Zhang Yining conceded one
set in their three-set win over the Canadian combination of Johnny
Huang and Geng Lijuan in the mixed doubles opening round.
</P>
<P>
Tan, 21, and Zhang, 17, overcame mid-game setbacks to beat the
former Chinese nationals 21-18, 15-21, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tan Ruiwu combined with Leung Chul Seung of Hong Kong,
China, to join teammats Feng Zhe/Zhang Yong in the men's doubles
second round.
</P>
<P>
Six Chinese pairs made the women's singles second round and nine
advanced in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
"We had an easy day today," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
"We will face very strong challenge from third or fourth round."
</P>
<P>
China is bidding for a five-title sweep in the world championships,
and Cai said the men's singles event would be the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
"China and Europe are on equal footing in the men's singles event,"
Cai said. "I think at least 15 players have a chance to win this
event."
</P>
<P>
Chinese are odds-on favorites for the women's singles and doubles,
men's doubles and mixed doubles.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Returning to Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Dang Qinghai, who used to
farm in China's Hebei Province, saved up more than 100,000 yuan
over the past five years from the transport business and a box
factory he ran with some partners.
</P>
<P>
With all that money he thought of having a factory of his own
but changed his mind and decided to get 50 hectares of ground for
an orchard. In explaining this surprising move, Dang says that
there is little risk and big profits in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Dang is not the only person making this move. More Chinese
farmers have returned to the land after making some money by
working in big cities or doing business far away from home. And
many are not like what they used to be before they left their
farmland years ago. Some come back to run bigger farms with better
management methods, according to the State Council's Development
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yufang, a farmer in Hebei Province's Tanghai County,
bought a farm with 500,000 yuan that he earned from business. He
now hires college students and gets help from specialists at the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences for planting and
processing vegetables and makes a profit of nearly 200,000 yuan
annually.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Chinese government's attempt to get
farmers to return to the land have proven effective and more
farmers have left the city where it was difficult to find a job.
The Agriculture Ministry says that about 1.8 million farmers who
had abandoned their farmland have got involved in agriculture
again, and some 200,000 have contracts to run farms or reclaim
barren hillsides.

<HEADLINE> July Sees Robust Growth in SIMEX Trading Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) announced Monday that it registered a
double-digit percentage growth year-on-year in trading volume in
July 1999.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,275,615 contracts were traded in the month,
representing an increase of 18.1 percent compared with the
1,927,165 contracts traded in July 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
The total trading volume for the first seven months of 1999 hit
15,606,513 contracts, amounting to a growth of 2.3 percent over
the 15,255,992 contracts traded in the same period last year, it
added.
</P>
<P>
SIMEX, formerly the Gold Exchange of Singapore (GES), changed
to its present name in 1983 to reflect its expanded role to
include financial futures trading. SIMEX began its business of
financial futures trading in 1984 and the financial futures market
in SIMEX features the system of mutual offset with the Chicago
Merchantile Exchange (CME) in the trading of Eurodollar and
Euroyen futures contracts. At the end of 1998, SIMEX listed 18
contracts, comprising 12 futures contracts and six options
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Evading Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat on Monday accused the Israeli government
of trying to evade the implementation of the Wye River agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader made this accusation when he was
speaking to reporters in front of his presidential premises here
upon returning from Egypt where he held talks Sunday with an
opposition Palestinian faction on Palestinian unification.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the failure of Sunday's Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations over the implementation of Wye agreement demonstrated
Israel's attempt to avoid enforcement of the terms of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Israel must faithfully carry out all signed
agreements in order to activate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meeting of the joint Palestinian-Israeli committee in Jerusalem
on Sunday failed to reach agreement on the implementation of the
Wye accord, and the Palestinian chief negotiator and Minister
Local Government Saeb Erekat "angrily left" the negotiating table,
Radio Israel reported Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced at a
cabinet meeting Sunday that Israeli redeployment in the West Bank,
in accordance with the interim Wye agreement, would begin on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Barak had proposed to combine the last part of the Wye deal
into the more complicated final status talks with the
Palestinians, but the Palestinians rejected such idea and demanded
immediate and faithful implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The United States-brokered agreement, signed last October
and then frozen by Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu, stipulates that Israel should return another 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Two-States Remarks Betray Taiwanese, Xinhua Commentator Says(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A commentator of the Xinhua News
Agency said today that the recent speech by Koo Chen-fu, the
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), adheres to Lee
Teng-hui's "two-states" statement which betrays the Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
The commentator said that Koo's sophistry about Lee's "two-
states" remark reflecting the public opinion in Taiwan actually
has the potential for causing social turbulence and goes against
the interest of the Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time Lee damaged relations across the
Straits. During a talk with Japanese writer Shiba Ryotaro, he said
he was Japanese before the age of 22 and knew nothing about China
and that "China" is an ambiguous word.
</P>
<P>
In a new book, Lee set "Taiwanese" against "Chinese", attacked
the patriotism of the Chinese people, and got the United States
and Japan to support his attempt to split Taiwan from China, the
commentator said, adding that Lee denies the coherence of interest
between Taiwanese and the Chinese nation and damages the exchanges
and cooperation between the two.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lee made use of his "two-states" statement to destroy
the contacts, exchanges, and dialogue between the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
SEF and closed the door to settling political differences across
the Straits through peaceful negotiation, the commentator said.
</P>
<P>
Lee has put relations across the Straits in a state of crisis,
caused social instability in Taiwan, and put the 22 million
Taiwanese in a dangerous situation for his political ambition, the
commentator pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Landslide, Floods Kill 15 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of casualties in
Sunday's flash floods in the Philippine capital of Manila and
nearby Rizal province has risen to 15 as eight more were reported
drowned, the National Disaster Coordinating Center (NDCC) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains, which the authorities claimed were brought
about by the much-feared La Nina phenomenon, have been pelting
Manila and nearby provinces during the past few days and Sunday's
heavy downpour that continued until Monday triggered the flash
floods.
</P>
<P>
Two of the drowned victims were from Rizal province while the
other six were from Marikina city of Metro Manila, the NDCC said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, seven persons, including a seven-month pregnant
mother, were killed in a landslide in Rizal province at dawn
Monday. The landslide fatalities came from two families, not one
as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst flash flood in Metro Manila and the environs
in several years in terms of casualties, said the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is also the NDCC chair,
said 8,529 families or 42,645 persons were affected by the floods
and some of them have been evacuated to higher grounds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities continued to watch on five dams in
the country's largest and most prosperous Luzon Island, as waters
were rising.
</P>
<P>
As Metro Manila was under water, lahar flows from Mt. Pinatubo,
about 100 kilometers northwest of Manila, were three to five feet
deep in the Pasig-Potrero River early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said it would be disastrous if lahar would overflow as
Metro Manila and Rizal were already battered by flash floods.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes has deployed
all available air, land and sea assets of the military in the
ongoing rescue operations in Metro Manila and Rizal province.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said 23 trucks, seven rubber boats and six helicopters
were in action to rescue stranded residents in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 people stranded in various places in Metro Manila and
Rizal due to the flash floods have been rescued.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said the government has set up 69 evacuation centers
for the flood victims and 400 packages of relief goods have been
distributed.
</P>
<P>
Many people had to climb to the rooftop of their houses as
rampaging floodwaters surged overnight.
</P>
<P>
In many areas, the water was seven feet deep, rendering streets
impassable to all types of vehicles.

SHENYANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An academic symposium will be
held in Taian County, the birthplace of General Zhang Xueliang, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province to celebrate his 99th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The event is scheduled for August 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Zhang joined General Yang Hucheng in arresting Chiang Kai-shek
in the Xi'an Incident on December 12, 1936 to try and force him to
end the civil war and co-ordinate resistance with Communist forces
against the Japanese invasion. They released Chiang Kai-shek
unharmed after negotiations, but Zhang himself was imprisoned by
Chiang. Since the 1980s, Zhang has been living in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is jointly sponsored by the provincial committee
of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the Zhang
Xueliang Foundation, and other organizations. It is expected to
attract scholars from China, the United States, Japan, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Canada, and other countries.
More than 90 papers will be presented for the symposium.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Reports 12-Percent Rise in Half-year Net Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Banking giant HSBC Holdings plc
Monday announced that the group's net profit in the first half of
1999 rose 12 percent to 2.694 billion U.S. dollars owing to
strength of the Western economies and recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The London-based group said its profit before tax was 4.068
billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of the year, up 382
million U.S. dollars or 10 percent, over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Our (year-on-year) results for the first half of 1999 reflect
the continuing strength of the Western economies and a degree of
recovery in some emerging markets," HSBC chairman John Bond said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The results also indicate solid progress in implementing our
strategy of 'management for value'," which HSBC adopted after its
slump in profits in 1998 due to hefty provisions for bad and
doubtful debts in crisis-hit Asia.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Holdings' charge for bad and doubtful debt fell 64 million
U.S. dollars from the first six months of 1998 to 1.082 billion U.
S. dollars. The figure was 409 million U.S. dollars lower than for
the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The directors have declared a first interim dividend for 1999
of 0.133 U.S. dollars per ordinary share, an increase of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Holdings plc reported a net interest income of 5.913
billion U.S. dollars, 262 million U.S. dollars or 5 percent higher
than the same period in 1998. Other operating income rose by 179
million U.S. dollars or 4 percent to 4.497 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group's cost-to-income ratio improved marginally to 52.0
percent from 52.2 percent in the same period in 1998. The total
assets of the group at June 30, 1999 were 497 billion U.S. dollars,
an increase of 13 billion U.S. dollars or 3 percent since year-end
1998.
</P>
<P>
Net interim profit at HSBC's subsidiary, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. Ltd. (Hongkong Bank), was up 39.7 percent year-on-
year to 8.509 billion HK dollars (1.09 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Net profits in the period for Hang Seng Bank Ltd., a unit of
Hongkong Bank, rose 12.1 percent year-on-year to 4.261 billion HK
dollars (546 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Domestic Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia plans to provide
tax and monetary incentives for travel agents to promote domestic
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The decision on tax and monetary incentives which were given to
travel agents bringing in foreign tourists seven years ago to be
accorded to those handling domestic tourism as proposed by the
Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents would be announced
soon, Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This would encourage more locals to spend their vacations in
the country instead of going abroad, he said after chairing a
Malaysian Tourism Action Council (MTAC) Exco meeting, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The MTAC Exco was set up to enable the private sector to help
the government draw up policies towards boosting Malaysia's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government would launch the domestic
tourism campaign on a wide scale in conjunction with the launch
of the "Malaysia Fest" on September 11, to inculcate the culture
of holidaying locally among Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's domestic tourism had a market of 22 million people
and it would be a boon to this sector if they take vacations
locally, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the "Colors of Malaysia" procession would be held
on September 25 at the Merdeka Square (Independence Square) in
conjunction with the campaign to attract foreigners to visit
Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Faces Challenges of Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- One of the major challenges
facing the world is trafficking in illicit drugs and related
organized crimes, said Clarie Lo, commissioner for narcotics of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Hong Kong and
Mainland Conference on Drug Dependence, Lo said that posing a
challenge to anti-drug work would be the crisis to be brought
about by mass production of synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong faces such problems as youngsters
abusing psychotropic substances at places of public entertainment
and other places, and female drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
She said Hong Kong adopted a multi-pronged approach in
combating the problems of drug trafficking and drug abuse through
law enforcement, international cooperation, treatment and
rehabilitation, preventive education and publicity, as well as
research.
</P>
<P>
Lo pointed out that Hong Kong adopted a multi-modality approach
for treatment and rehabilitation to meet the needs of drug abusers
with different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we'll propose legislation to require treatment and
rehabilitation centers providing voluntary residential services to
register in order to raise the standard of their services," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of reported drug abusers had
been on the decrease since 1995. There were about 16,000 reported
drug abusers in 1998, and 5,527 in the first quarter of 1999,
representing a drop of 11 percent compared with the same period of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Rosanna Wong, member of the Executive Council, said that
strengthening liaison and exchanges in anti-drug work between Hong
Kong and the mainland was essential to the long term cooperation
in tackling drug problems.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that anti-drug work and latest developments in the
mainland and Hong Kong can be explored in depth at this conference,
and can benefit from your experience for further improvement to
existing services and measures," she told the participants.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Department of Psychiatry of the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, the conference features the main theme of
"Challenges and Opportunities: Multi-Modality Approach in
Substance Abuse".
</P>
<P>
Over 200 anti-drug policy administrators, law enforcers,
academics and professionals all over China attended the five-day
conference.

<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The New People's Army (PNA) rebels
of the Philippines ambushed a nine-man police team Monday and
killed four cops in Masbate province in the central Philippines, a
police report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that another policeman and two civilian
volunteers were wounded seriously in the firefight that lasted
about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the police team was responding to a
report that the NPA rebels had gunned down a village captain when
they were fired upon by the heavily-armed rebels shortly before
noon.
</P>
<P>
The firefight resulted in a running gun battle after which the
rebels withdrew in different directions, dragging with them a
policeman in an attempt to use him as a shield.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has stepped up its fight against the government after
the Philippine Senate ratified the U.S.-Philippines Visiting
Forces Agreement in May.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows the resumption of large-scale joint
military exercises between the U.S. and Philippine troops in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Astonished at Arafat's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said on Monday he was astonished that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat had accused Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
trying to get out of some of Israel's peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Barak last week, Arafat had agreed to
consider Israel's proposal over implementation of the Wye accord
and pledged to give an answer after two weeks, Israel Radio quoted
Levy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Environment Minister Dalia Itzik paid a
visit to Gaza on Monday and met Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
At the start of her trip, Itzik said she had a message from
Barak to the Palestinians that Israel would carry out the Wye
accord in full if the PNA would not accept Israel's proposal of
blending part of it with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Itzik said the new Israeli government "wanted to create a good
atmosphere in the peace talks with the PNA."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA signed the Wye accord in the United States
last October, which requires Israel to hand over an additional
13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, hard-line predecessor of Barak, carried out
the first phase of a three-stage withdrawal, but then suspended
the accord, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
After assuming office last month, Barak pledged to implement
the second stage of withdrawal, but proposed to combine the third
-stage withdrawal with the more complicated final status talks, a
stance rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The sense of a crisis between the two sides emerged on Sunday
after the meeting between top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
and Barak's envoy and attorney Gilead Sher broke down.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians complained that Sher reiterated what Arafat
had already rejected a week earlier, while the Israeli government
complained that the Palestinians are not flexible enough.

<HEADLINE> Thai-Myanmar Border Check Point to Be Closed to Curb Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) - Thailand is expected to close a
check point along the Thai-Myanmar border, which is allegedly used
as a channel to smuggle drugs from Myanmar to Thailand, Minister
of the Prime Minister's Office Jurin Laksanavisit said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jurin, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control Board
(ONCB), said the San Ton Doo check point in the northern Chiang
Mai province would be temporarily shut down until the drug problem
was eased.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai inspected
the area Sunday and hinted at the imminent closure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it is so far the government's most drastic
anti-drug action which has bilateral implications.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry is known to have been cautious over the
proposed closure, but most senior military officers, local
authorities, police, the National Security Council and the ONCB
favor the measure.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government would be informed of the closure.
According to international practice, closure of a border check
point should be agreed to by the countries which share the border.
</P>
<P>
Jurin said the check point closure was believed to help curb
the problem of drug trafficking from Myanmar, while an all-out
surveillance of Thailand's four provinces bordering Myanmar was
still needed.
</P>
<P>
The check point is adjacent to the Myanmar city of Yon,
reportedly a stronghold of the separatist United Wa State Army, a
major trafficker of amphetamines and other illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the National Security Council Kachadpai
Burusapatana said earlier that the check point had no substantial
economic benefits for Thailand and was a threat to national
security.

<HEADLINE> Nets Sign Van Hron and Feick to Multi-year Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Jersey Nets reached
multi-year contract with their young stars Keith Van Horn and
Jamie Feick on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Keith is obviously one of the premier young players in the
league and Jamie is an emerging player," Nets general manager John
Nash said Sunday in a telephone conference call.
</P>
<P>
The Nets' leading scorer his first two years, Van Horn was
given an NBA maximum-length, six-year contract extension valued at
roughly 73 million U.S. dollars. The deal will keep him under
contract with Nets until 2006.
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-10 power forward with the moves of a small forward,
Van Horn averaged 20.5 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first two
seasons. He averaged 19.7 points as a rookie and 21.8 last year.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn, who has had hand surgery since the end of the season,
scored 20 or more points 28 times last season and recorded a
career-high 35 points February 16 against Detroit. He shot just
under 43 percent from the field, including 30 percent from 3-point
range, and was just under 86 percent from the free-throw line,
including a streak of 48 in a row.
</P>
<P>
Feick, 25, averaged 6.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in 28 games
with New Jersey, getting the bulk of the playing time after Jayson
Williams broke his leg.
</P>
<P>
Williams has been slow in recovering from the injury, which
forced the Nets to put even greater emphasis on signing Feick.
</P>
<P>
The Nets gave Feick the middle-class exception starting at two
million U.S. dollars with annual 10 percent increases for six
years, making the deal worth about 15 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Working Class Urged To Take Lead In Criticizing Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua News Agency commentary "
The Working Class Should Stand in the Forefront of Criticizing
Falun Gong" today said that the nationwide political struggle
against Li Hongzhi and the Falun Gong should be led by the working
class.
</P>
<P>
It said that the People's Republic of China is a socialist
country led by the working class with a people's democratic
dictatorship that is based on an alliance of workers and peasants.
In China, the working class is the representative of advanced
productive forces and the fundamental dynamic force for social
stability, it said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi took advantage of people's desire to improve their
health to spread his fallacies and some workers followed him, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the new China in 1949, the life span of
the Chinese has been increasing because of improvements in social
conditions and the development of science and technology, it said,
so, to become good masters of their country, the working class
should believe in science and study science to distinguish between
truth and falsehood and to be the masters of their own fate.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that solving the Falun Gong problem as soon
as possible is in the basic interest of workers and that workers
should do a good job in their work and support the Communist Party
Central Committee's crackdown on Falun Gong and help maintain
social stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Monday that it granted a transfer of
the restricted banking license of P.T. Bank Pembangunan Indonesia
(Persero) (Bapindo) to Mandiri under the Banking Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
This grant of transfer took effect on July 31, 1999, the date
on which the merger of the Legacy Banks into Mandiri became
effective in Indonesia, according to a HKMA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the restricted banking license of Bapindo to
Mandiri enables Mandiri to continue to carry on the business
activities of the Legacy Banks in Hong Kong, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the businesses of the Legacy Banks were conducted
through the Hong Kong Branch of Bapindo and two deposit-taking
companies, namely, Staco International Finance Ltd. and Bumi Daya
International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Established and wholly owned by the State of the Republic of
Indonesia, Mandiri is under the direct supervision of Bank
Indonesia, the banking supervisory body in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that as a restricted license bank, the Hong
Kong Branch of Mandiri (Mandiri-HK) will focus on trade financing
and corporate lending, which were the Legacy Banks' core business
activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The total number of restricted license banks in Hong Kong
remains unchanged, currently at 59.

<HEADLINE> Nine Killed as Rebels Attack Namibian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were reportedly
killed Monday in fighting between Namibian security forces and
secessionists in Katima Mulilo, the main town of the country's
northeastern Caprivi Region, Agence France Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
Six members of the security forces and three alleged rebels
were killed earlier Monday in a gun battle at the state-owned
Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) offices. The casualties
included three soldiers and three policemen.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who entered the town after midnight, were
apparently still occupying the NBC studios by midday Monday,
Caprivi police chief Hieronymus Goraseb was quoted as saying on
radio.
</P>
<P>
They had also attempted to occupy the main police station and
an army base at the airport but had failed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and police officers surrounding the NBC building were
not coming under fire but were prevented from entering the offices
by tear gas in the air, he said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Defense Force Major General Martin Shalli said eight
alleged secessionists had been captured so far.
</P>
<P>
NBC spokeswoman Umbi Swartz-Karuiahe sasid in capital Windhoek:
"The police and the army are surrounding the building and are
trying to get them out using mortar bombs. This is causing heavy
damage to the property."
</P>
<P>
She said there had been no threat to NBC staff.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Katima is extremely tense and all the schools
are closed and all the streets are deserted. A colleague of mine
made a call over there and we could hear the gunshots in the
background," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was not aware if the rebels had made any broadcasts from
the station.
</P>
<P>
A Namibian Press Agency journalist, Oscar Mainga, was quoted as
saying that gunfire, which had earlier come from the town center,
had moved to the northern outskirts, towards the border with
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The shooting is now coming from outside the town, along the
Wenela border post. We hope this is a sign the rebels are
leaving."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Defense Force was still verifying the facts and
could not comment, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
People in the town believed the rebels were members of the
Caprivi Liberation Front, an armed secessionist movement launched
in the region last year. If their identity is confirmed, this
would be the first armed attack carried out by the group.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government in October claimed to have uncovered a
training camp for the group seeking the secession of the Caprivi
strip, a finger of land bordered with Botswana, Zambia, Angola and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In the security sweeps that followed, about 2,500 people,
including 15 rebel leaders, fled into neighboring Botswana, where
they were given refugee status.
</P>
<P>
Botswana insisted the separatist leaders be resettled in third
countries to avoid jeopardizing diplomatic relations with its
western neighbor. Two of the leaders of the group have already
been resettled in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The other Namibians, who claimed to have fled Namibia for fear
of prosecution, began returning home in May.
</P>
<P>
Four of the leaders absconded from Botswana in June and were
arrested in Zambia a week later. A fifth, who disappeared from his
Botswana accommodation earlier in the year, has not been traced.
</P>
<P>
Botswana revoked the refugee status it had accorded to the five
 absconders.

<HEADLINE> Save Gulf of Thailand: SEAPOL Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A regional environmental
organization has urged the countries bordering the Gulf of
Thailand to establish a joint mechanism to regulate the use of the
gulf in order to prevent a possible environmental catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Thailand News Agency (TNA) Monday quoted Phipat Tangsubkul,
director of the Southeast Asian Program in Ocean Law, Policy and
Management (SEAPOL), as saying that the Gulf of Thailand is
becoming more and more polluted and fish stocks are rapidly
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the four countries bordering it - Cambodia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam - for not taking concrete steps to prevent
these disasters.
</P>
<P>
He said all the four governments must quickly realize the
seriousness of managing the sea, and such a plan should be
implemented at the earliest date.
</P>
<P>
He urged the four countries to immediately sit down and
exchange views on how to save the sea. Otherwise, he warned that
the sea condition will deteriorate to a point when no one can
rescue it.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the four countries participated in an
informal roundtable discussion organized recently by the SEAPOL, a
non-governmental organization, in Thailand's coastal province of
Phetchaburi.
</P>
<P>
Phipat said the discussion will help the countries concerned
exchange views on the proposal and other sea-related issues.
Whether they need the joint mechanism or a mandate is up to them,
he said, but the sooner it is established the better for the
benefit of the gulf.
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal had won support from Malaysia and
Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam were reluctant to accept it, saying
that it would certainly overlap existing mechanisms, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> China Trying To Stop Unreasonable Fees Farmers Are Made To Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has forwarded a
circular from the Ministry of Agriculture and other departments
that asks local governments and departments to take steps to
relieve the burden farmers have from unreasonable fees.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that in some places, government policies to
cut the burden farmers have to bear have not been properly
implemented and this destroys farmers' incentive and in turn
affects the reforms and development and stability in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and other departments have
suggested 8 ways to give farmers relief that include a stricter
observation of tax laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
Farmers can have their own say in deciding how to pay taxes,
the circular says. Only the central government has the right to
legislate taxes and local governments are not entitled to change
or adjust tax laws and policies and can not collect fees that are
called taxes.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks local governments to arrange for checks on
these unreasonable burdens placed on farmers and to solve any
problems they discover.

<P>
SINGAPORE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Concerns over the recent falls
on Wall Street spooked local bourse as the benchmark Straits Times
Index gave up 17.12 points to end at 2,128.65 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was 362.33 million shares worth 491.55 million
Singapore dollars (292.78 million U.S. dollars). Falls outnumbered
rises by 207 to 112 with 126 counters unchanged.
</P>

wrestles with this problem -- the small but increasing probability

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Appeals for Immediate EU Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking Nigerian official
has appealed to the European Union (EU) to resume its development
aid to his country "without further delay".
</P>
<P>
Phillip Asiodu, special economic adviser to the president made
the appeal while attending the 69th session of the African,
Caribbean and Pacific and EU Council of Ministers in Brussels, the
New Nigerian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the current encouraging level of
understanding between the two partners would lead to further
strengthening of relations between them, following Nigeria's
restoring of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Asiodu told the session that the present administration was
currently on the path of achieving full re-engagement of
development cooperation between Nigeria and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU indicated late last year that its would resume
development assistance to the west African country, which would
enable Nigeria to draw about 500 million US dollars from its
backlog of development cooperation with the union.
</P>
<P>
The organization announced the calling off of all the
restrictions in the cooperation between Nigeria and the EU days
after the west African nation's May-29 handover to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and the EU were severed in 1995 when
the EU imposed sanctions on Nigeria to punish the human rights
abuses of the military regime of the late Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions covered development assistance and cooperation,
military training, sales of military hardwares and other
equipment, as well as military cooperation, high level visits by
military personnel and their families, and sporting contacts.

<HEADLINE> HK District Councils Electors Receive Polling Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.83 million
registered electors for the coming District Councils election in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) are receiving a
notice of polling information, said a spokesman for the
Registration and Electoral Office (REO).
</P>
<P>
The notice details the electors' constituency and the
whereabouts of their designated polling station, enabling them to
know well in advance where to vote in the District Councils
election, which will be held on November 28, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The notices are being sent to electors in batches, inviting
them to indicate their language preference for election-related
communications with candidates, and the last batch will be mailed
by mid-August, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"If electors wish candidates to communicate with them in
English during the election, they should return the postage-paid
reply slip to the REO within 10 days of receipt of the notice.
Otherwise it is assumed that their preferred language is Chinese,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Electors' language preference will also be made known to
candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement was recommended by the Electoral Affairs
Commission in response to remarks made by some electors that most
candidates' publicity materials in the 1998 Legislative Council
election were printed only in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
A hotline is also set up by the REO for registered electors who
have inquiries about the notice.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a poll card, a map of the polling station, a
voting guide and an introductory leaflet on candidates of their
respective constituency will be mailed to electors around 10 days
before the polling day to remind them to vote.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Agriculture Hindered by Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A special self-sufficient
agricultural program in the besieged Huambo city in central Angola
will be endangered if seeds and fertilizer can't be transported to
the city in a few days, said an agricultural official in Huambo.
</P>
<P>
Claudio Julio, delegate of agriculture of Huambo Province, said
he is worried about the fact that agricultural materials on the
highway can't go through areas controlled by the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the city hoped to receive seeds of potatoes,
 fertilizer and other agricultural materials through the highway
which just connected Huambo Monday with its nearest harbour city
Benguela, capital of Benguela Province.
</P>
<P>
The Huambo government put forward on June 28 a special
self-sufficient policy called Emergency Program of Agricultural
Production, deciding to resolve the deteriorating food crisis
through production. On July 15, the central government began
enacting the same program.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said transportation is the bottleneck of the new
policy. In central Angola, government troops can only station in
main cities, while UNITA rebels control vast rural areas,
attacking government convoy escorts along the highway.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Huambo are also disturbed by deteriorating seeds
imported by local government.  Local press quoted an official
source as saying that of the 15 tons of potato seeds distributed
to Caala and Calenga, four tons are completely rotten and the rest
has little capacity of germination.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the deterioration of seeds is due to bad
 conditioning in Benguela Province, through which squads of
government soldiers escorted potato seeds to Huambo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government imported 500 tons of potato seeds for
Huambo Province, but only 30 tons has been transported to Benguela
city.
</P>
<P>
If the agricultural materials reaches Huambo in time, the
Huambo Province is expected to harvest, in the next three month,
about 4,000 tons of potatoes, according to estimates.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Int'l Cooperation in Curbing Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar said Monday that the international community
should cooperate in curbing terrorism following the slaying of a
leading Tamil legislator here last week.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar told a news conference that Sri Lanka has always
been committed to the peaceful resolution of international
conflicts as well as internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, "enough mayhem and carnage has already occurred in
various countries in the last few years as a result of terrorist
activity," said Kadirgamar.
</P>
<P>
Neelan Thiruchelvam, vice-president of the moderate Tamil
United Liberation Front (TULF), was killed in a suicide bomb
attack here last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials confirmed that the suicide bomber was sent by the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been
fighting for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
They said Thiruchelvam was the 36th Tamil leader killed by the
LTTE since their first high-profile assassination of then Jaffna
Mayor Alfred Duraiappa in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The assassination has provoked condemnation from U.N. Secretary
General Koffi Annan, the United States, India and others.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of the government of Sri Lanka and the people of
Sri Lanka, I earnestly seek the help of all governments to ensure

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Factions to Issue Communique on Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Two major Palestinian groups will
issue a joint communique later Monday on their first meet since
the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord in 1993,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Maher Taher, a leading member of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), said here on Monday that the
delegations of PFLP and Fatah "reviewed all issues on the
Palestinian arena" during their meeting in Cairo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fatah, led by Arafat, is the major faction to support the peace
talks with Israel while PFLP is opposed to the Palestinian-Israeli
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Taher said the joint communique will underline that the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led by Yasser Arafat is
the sole representative of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The two sides "have agreed to continue and maintain meetings,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat led the Fatah delegation to the meeting with the PFLP
delegation headed by its deputy leader Abu Ali Moustafa.
</P>
<P>
Salim al-Zanoun, a senior Fatah leader and speaker of the
Palestine National Council, called the meeting "a major success."
Al-Zanoun said the meeting called on other PLO factions and
Palestinian groups to join the unity drive.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finalize a formula that will achieve the
Palestinian national unity," Moustafa told reporters. No matter
what differences exist between PFLP and Fatah, "what is important
is to reinvigorate the PLO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zanoun revealed that the two sides have agreed to meet again
in a few weeks and to set up a committee comprising two members
from each side to make a list of proposals for achieving
Palestinian unity and reactivating the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hopes the Fatah-PFLP meeting will be extended to include
other Palestinian factions in a bid to realize a national
reconciliation. He is scheduled to meet Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) in
Cairo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Both PFLP and DFLP, alongside six other Palestinian factions,
are based in Damascus, Syria.

<HEADLINE> China Lodges Strong Protest Against U.S. Arms Sales To Taiwan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yang pointed out that there is only one China in the world and
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and that
the international community, including the U.S. government,
generally acknowledges that the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Government declared clearly in the August 17 Joint
Communique of 1982 that it did not seek to carry out a long-term
policy of arms sales to Taiwan and promised that its arms sales to
Taiwan would not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative
terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States
and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its arms sales
to Taiwan, leading to a final resolution of this issue over a
period time.
</P>
<P>
But, the U.S. has now instead decided to sell advanced arms and
equipment in large quantities in contrast to its pledge and basic
norms in international relations, Yang said, adding that this
faithless act is strongly opposed by the Chinese people and
condemned by those countries and people who uphold justice around
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier and two
members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded
in a Lebanese guerrilla attack in south Lebanon, the militia's
official radio Voice of the South reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an SLA communique as saying that the Israeli
soldier and two militiamen were hit by mortar shrapnels Sunday in
the vicinity of Beaufort Castle at the central sector of the
Israel-occupying border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
No groups has claimed responsibility for the attack, but
Israeli fighter-bombers consequently blasted suspected Hezbollah
guerrilla bases east of the southern port city of Tyre with six
air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties from the air raids which
set plantations ablaze and shattered window glass of many houses
in the missile-hit area.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces and SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Haze Covering Parts of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Several parts of Indonesia's
Central Kalimantan province have been covered by haze since the
start of the dry season in early July, according to information
collected from the regions concerned.
</P>
<P>
The haze is posing an obstacle to traffic in towns as well as
in the countryside, the Antara News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the haze has not yet spread evenly, it is already
restricting the vision of motorists including drivers of public
transport.
</P>
<P>
It has been established that the haze has been caused by forest
fires started by locals in their efforts to clear land.
</P>
<P>
Local people have started to worry that they will soon undergo
a recurrence of the haze problems that hit Central Kalimantan a
few years ago when there was a complete breakdown of air and river
transportation.
</P>
<P>
A community leader in Central Kalimantan, Curnain Lambung,
called on local administrations to inspect the areas where the
forest fires have begun as soon as possible and take measures to
ensure that the fires do not spread.
</P>
<P>
But so far the local authorities have yet to do anything about
the problem although they already know the cause of the haze,
Curnain was quoted by Antara as saying.

He said that the determination of the Chinese Government and
people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity
is unchangeable and that the Taiwan issue will surely be resolved
and China will completely be reunified.
</P>
<P>
China believes in certain principles in developing Sino-U.S.
relations, he said, and improved and expanded relations must be
based on the three joint communiques between China and the United
States and the principles of these communiques should not be
violated.
</P>
<P>
A country must practice what it preaches and honor its promise
before it can win the trust of the international community, Yang
said, and this is necessary for the healthy development of state-
to-state relations, especially between big powers.
</P>
<P>
China solemnly demands that the U.S. Government proceed from
the general interests of the Sino-U.S. relations and deal properly
with problems to that regard, he said, in particular, the U.S.
Government should strictly observe the three joint communiques and
its pledge on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. needs to fully understand the seriousness and danger
of selling arms to Taiwan and must correct its mistake through
concrete actions by canceling the arms sales, Yang said.

DHAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Brunei Darussalam, the tiny
oil-rich sultanate in Southeast Asia, has opened its diplomatic
mission in Bangladesh, the national news agency BSS reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brunei's high commission started functioning at a city hotel
Sunday. This is the first time that Brunei Darussalam has opened
its mission in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hamid ibn Abdullah, first secretary of Brunei, takes
charge of the high commission until a high commissioner is
appointed, the BSS said, quoting Foreign Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been maintaining a resident mission in Brunei's
capital Bandar Seri Begawan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad visited Brunei in May this
year, during which he held talks with leaders of the country about
opening the sultanate's mission in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Azad in early July, Brunei's Foreign Minister
Mohammed Bolkiah said that Brunei, which was desirous of
developing friendly relations and cooperation with Bangladesh, had
decided to set up its high commission in the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 Bangladeshi nationals are employed in different
sectors of Brunei's economy and leaders of the two Muslim
countries have agreed to foster greater cooperation between them
for mutual benefit, according to the BSS.

LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The dwindling purchasing power and
rising costs have stripped Zambian farmers of most of the profits
in the production of pork, diary and poultry.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report of Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) available Monday, farmers were unable to increase prices to
match the more than doubled costs of input due to declining
purchasing power on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Because of this dilemma, some farmers are leaving their
business, some small producers were forced to sell their farm
products on the street for somewhat higher profits.
</P>
<P>
The untested farm products has caused severe concerns for the
spreading of infectious diseases such as brucellosis and
tuberculosis in the country.

<HEADLINE> 200 Confirmed Dead in India's Railway Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 people have been
confirmed dead and some 400 injured early Monday morning in one of
the worst rail accidents in India.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred when a Delhi-bound mail train collided
head-on with an east-bound express in the wee hours Monday in
Gaisal of the Northern Siligury district of the West Bengal state.
</P>
<P>
While Indian railway officials here confirmed 128 deaths and
injuries to 153 others, reports quoted officials of the Border
Security Forces supervising rescue operations at the site as
saying that some 200 bodies had already been extricated from the
badly mangled remains of the two trains.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal Minister of State for Civil Defense Srikumar
Mukherjee, who was supervising rescue operations at the scene,
reportedly estimated that the toll might cross 500.
</P>
<P>
Local news media said earlier that at least 500 people were
feared killed and over 1,000 injured in the train mishap, which
killed four drivers of the two trains.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 last year, a south-bound express train rammed
into three derailed coaches near Khanna in Ludhiana district of
the Northwest Punjab state, killing some 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The worst train accident happened in August 1995 when 302
people were killed as a Delhi-bound express train rammed into a
stationary passenger train near Firozabad in North Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan expressed shock
Monday over the rail accident at Gaisal and extended his heartfelt
condolences to the families of the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported at the site that at
least 14 compartments beside the engines of both trains bore the
brunt of the collision and four compartments telescoped into each
other.
</P>
<P>
The victims of the mail train were mostly army men and border
security forces, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
A local railway police officer reportedly said that preliminary
information suggested that it was a case of a bomb blast, but
after seeing the actual position of the engine and compartments of
the trains, it seemed to be a case of head-on collision due to
signal failure.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Nitish Kumar, who was in the east state of
Bihar, rushed back to New Delhi and is scheduled to go to the site
of the accident soon.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Mathematician Solves 361-year-old Puzzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- By plain brainwork and without the
use of computers, world acclaimed Nigerian mathematician Prof.
Chike Obi has given scientific proof to a 361-year-old
mathematical puzzle known as Fermat's Last Theorem.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian daily, reported Monday that
the theorem, well known among mathematicians and other allied
professions, was enunciated by one of the two leading
mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century, Pierre de
Fermat, a French.
</P>
<P>
By far, the best known of Fermat's many theorems, it states
that the equation xn+yn=zn; where x,y,z, and n are positive
integers, has no solution if n is greater than two.
</P>
<P>
Fermat had, on this particular theorem which appeared in the
margin of Diophantus Arithmetic, stated: "I have discovered a
truly wonderful proof of this proposition, but the margin is too
small to contain it."
</P>
<P>
Two Western researchers had in 1994 solved the problem using
modern technological aid. But Nigeria's Obi, in a summary of his
seminal paper, used a method which "looks very much like the way
Fermat must have proved his theorem in the 17th century."
</P>
<P>
Obi's research, conducted at his Nanna Institute for Scientific
Studies based in Onitsha, Anambra State, has just been published
in the international journal "Algebras Groups and Geometries".
</P>
<P>
In this work, Obi presented an elementary proof of the theorem.
The science community, especially in Nigeria and other developing
countries, is agog with celebration that such scholarship is
coming from Africa.
</P>
<P>
Measures will shortly be put in place by the Nigeria Academy of
Sciences to popularize Obi's works and other breakthroughs in
science in Nigeria, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Another professor of mathematics, Jerome Ajayi Adepoju who
described Obi as "my senior colleague for many years," said the
simplicity of the method employed by the University of Lagos
emeritus professor stood out from what other mathematicians have
done. This, according to him, proved that Fermat, in his
simplistic way and using the technology of the 17th century, was
indeed right.
</P>
<P>
According to the scholar, the fact that Obi's method used the
principle adopted by Fermat in the 17th century makes it more
acceptable and a true reflection of Fermat's thinking at that
time.
</P>
<P>
Obi, 78, is an emeritus professor of mathematics at the
University of Lagos since 1985. Born on April 7, 1921 and
married with four children, he retired from academia to found the
Nanna Institute for Scientific Studies, Onitsha.
</P>
<P>
A Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science, the world renowned
 mathematics scholar, Obi won the Ecklund Prize from the
International Centre for Theoretical Physics for original work in
Differential Equations, and pioneered works in mathematics in
Africa. He had earned his doctoral degree in 1950, specializing
in Non-linear Differential Equations at the Pembrooke College,
University of Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
Besides his scholarly enterprise, Obi used to be a political
activist - with many publications on mathematics and the Nigerian
political system.

<HEADLINE> Mir's Main Computer Accidentally Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The main computer aboard Russia's
Mir space station was shut down accidentally last Friday,
prompting its crew to install a backup, analog computer, the
Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The computer replacement was originally scheduled for August 3
and was to take up to three days. As a result of the accident,
the work on this assignment was complete three days ahead of
schedule, Interfax said, quoting deputy mission controller Viktor
Blagov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blagov said the space station has enough energy, although the
computer shutdown stopped the functioning of the gyros, which keep
the solar panels aligned toward the sun.
</P>
<P>
The new computer, which will be started up on Tuesday, will
control the station after the three-member crew, two Russians and
a French, left Mir for earth at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Unless new sources of funding for the station are found before
the end of the year, the 13-year-old Mir will be decommissioned
and allowed to come back to Earth to sink in a designated area in
the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Eye Nigerian Telecom Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A United States telecom company has
started investing 100 million US dollars (1.05 billion naira) in
Nigeria's telecommunication sector, signifying the start of the
expected massive inflow of foreign investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
The American satellite and telecommunication carrier Satellite
Incorporated or IDM, signed a joint venture agreement with BT
limited, a Nigeria information and communication technology
provider at San Diego, California in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The first investment is coming at a time of growing interest in
Nigeria' s telecommunications industry by the international
community, said the Guardian, newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first investment has flowed into the economy with the
installation of a VSAT Hub at the Ikoyi, Lagos head office of BT
Limited.
</P>
<P>
This investment is coming on the heels of the recently
concluded national conference on the new telecommunications
policy sponsored by the Presidency and the Ministry of
Communications which recommended full-scale liberalization of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that foreign investment in the
telecommunication industry is expected to come in a flood when the
privatization of the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL)
is completed and full liberalization of the sector flagged off,
expectedly, early next year.

<HEADLINE> China Lodges Strong Protest Against U.S. Arms Sales To Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
this morning summoned James Moriarty, charge d'affaires ad interim
of the U.S. Embassy to his office and, on behalf of the Chinese
government, lodged a strong protest against the U.S. government's
announcement to sell a large number of advanced weapons and
equipment to Taiwan, according to China's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the U.S. government disregarded the strong
opposition and solemn representations of the Chinese government
and made the announcement recently. The weapons include E-2T early
warning planes and parts and equipment for F-16 fighters and are
valued at 550 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side needs to be aware of the seriousness and danger
of arms sales to Taiwan and must cancel arms sales to Taiwan and
take practical steps to correct this mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
This erroneous practice seriously violates the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, Yang said,
and is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and an
encroachment on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and
will further intensify tensions across the Taiwan straits, and
cause severe damage to Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people express strong indignation
over this, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Provides 8 Tamil MPs Special Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Eight Sri Lankan Tamil
parliamentarians have been provided special security from Monday
by the anti-terrorist unit of the police following intelligence
reports that the MPs are prime targets of Tamil rebels, informed
sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to intelligence reports, the eight MPs are said to be
actively canvassing support for the government's devolution
package which is expected to be presented to the House later this
month, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist unit of the police has also advised the MPs
on their routes they should take when leaving and returning home
and on how they should keep changing routes, they quoted police
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have
killed many Tamil MPs including Neelan Thiruchelvam, who was
assassinated Thursday, during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam, vice-president of the Tamil United Liberation
Front (TULF), was killed in a suicide bombing attack by the rebels
at a stone's throw from his home in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The bomber jumped off the back of a motor cyclist and onto
Thiruchelvam's car as it approached a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam was the 36th Tamil leader killed by the LTTE since
its first assassination of then Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappa in
1975.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has recently stepped up its intimidation against MPs
and public officials.
</P>
<P>
Police said intelligence reports suggested that the LTTE had
deployed a 10-member suicide squad in Colombo to assassinate
President Chandrika Kumaratunga who is believed to top the LTTE's
hit list, and several senior officials
</P>
<P>
The targets include three ministers in the cabinet, military
chiefs and a legislator from the moderate TULF, the Sunday Island
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and police have been on alert for the LTTE
rebel attacks during the whole of last month.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the Sri Lankan
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country since 1983. About 60,000 people have been killed in the
war.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Capture Key Northern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia Monday
captured the key northern Afghan city of Charikar after heavy
fighting with opposition Northern Alliance forces led by former
defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces have also recaptured the strategic Bagram
air base which is located about 60 kilometers north of capital
Kabul, AIP quoted independent sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 28 soldiers from the opposition side were killed and
many were wounded while the Taliban suffered five dead in the
fighting for Charikar, provincial capital of Parwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are also reported to have captured 130 opposition
fighters and seized a large quantity of arms and ammunitions in
Charikar.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghan sources, the Taliban forces are advancing
towards Jabul Saraj from Charikar. Jabul Saraj is strategically
important as it guards access to the Salang Highway that links
Kabul with northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban launched their summer offensive last
Wednesday, more than 1,000 people from both the warring Afghan
factions have been killed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Taliban were successful in pushing the Kabul
frontlines back 25 kilometers to the southern edge of Charikar and
Bagram air base.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's summer offensive came almost immediately after
the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent
attended by representatives from Afghanistan's six neighbors plus
Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Since Sunday, the British beef has returned to the shops and
dinner tables of Europe after the European Union lifted its
embargo imposed for "mad cow" scare three years ago. But some
consumers' associations in France said it was too early for the
return of British beef and expressed concern about possible "
savage export" of such products by Britain.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians remain skeptical about the announcement
made on Sunday by Israeli Prime Minister Ehub Barak that Israel
would start pulling out troops from the West Bank from October 1.
Barak also promised to respect the Wye Plantation agreements which
call for handing over authorities and a three-phase re-deployment
of troops by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The attack with a small bomb against a Serb Orthodox Church
under construction in central Pristina has spread fears among the
Serbs remaining in Kosovo. The exodus of Serbs from Kosovo is
continuing, as 450 Serbs of a village in the southeast part of the
province fled their homes recently after being threatened by
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
-- Nine years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on August 2,
1990, the hope of Iraqis for a lifting of economic sanctions
imposed by the United Nations Security Council at that time still
remains far from reality. The bombings of U.S. and British
warplanes continue mechanically in a latent war to impose the "no-
fly zones" while diplomats see no "scenario of exit of the crisis".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Keep Capital Controls: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue with
its selective capital controls imposed since September 1 last
year as long as newly emerging economies remain exposed to
destructive currency trading and manipulation by the hedge funds
and currency traders as seen in the present international
financial regime, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated calls for the removal of the restriction,
Mahathir said Malaysia will lift this policy if and when currency
trading is rendered less harmful to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
Until then the controls will remain in place and will be
defended and kept effective by whatever means that Malaysia has at
its disposal, Mahathir said in his article published by Japan's
Mainichi group of newspapers Monday, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing nobody any harm by our controls. Indeed, we are
doing a lot of good to ourselves and I venture to say, to our
trading partners, investors and even the world's economy. So I
hope we will be left to administer our own economy in our own way.
No one should tell us when we should lift the controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Malaysia's economy is growing again. We believe it is
due to the controls we have imposed," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that currency controls imposed by Malaysia were
not generally understood by the international community and that
to understand the measures taken, one must look at the root cause
of the financial turmoil which undermined the economy of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said the controls have apparently succeeded in bringing
about the recovery of the Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
Although many still condemn capital controls, others now say
that controls can solve the problems brought about by the rapid
devaluation of the currency by currency traders, and some even
recommend that other countries open to attacks by currency
speculators should adopt currency controls, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia is now in a sound financial position,
the economy is growing and many predict it will exceed the one
percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimated by the
government for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the controls, the local currency -- the ringgit was
pegged at 3.80 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that even though currencies of neighboring
countries have strengthened further against the greenback and
therefore against the ringgit, Malaysia does not want to change
the exchange rate because this will upset the business
transactions and profit forecasts.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will apply internal
audit checks to all registered cooperatives nationwide to ensure
efficient management of their finances.
</P>
<P>
This internal audit checks would be included in the Cooperative
Development Policy of the Land and Cooperative Development
Ministry which should be followed by all cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative Development Policy would be made known by the
end of the year, Land and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah
Gaddam said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
No proper records of their finances by some cooperatives led to
poor management of the cooperatives, he said after opening a
two-day seminar on "Doing Cooperative Business - Malaysian
Experiences &AMP; Global Opportunities".
</P>
<P>
Kasitah said, "With a concrete policy we hope the setting up of
a cooperative will give clear view of its objective and direction
apart from benefitting members."

<HEADLINE> No Communal, Religious Politics Allowed in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Politics harping on racial
and religious sentiments cannot be allowed to continue as they
could undermine the country's stability, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the people to reject all forms of communal
politics and groups using religion to achieve their objectives or
ambition to seize power in the country.
</P>
<P>
"All races and religion are represented in the present
Malaysian government and this need to be maintained," the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted him as telling
reporters after meeting members of The Young Presidents'
Organization here.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister's remarks came at a time when the
opposition is already campaigning for the next general elections
which are yet to be announced and are widely speculated to be held
next month.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the government was not only focusing attention to
preserving peace and stability, but also striving to improve
quality of education, tackle drug addiction and root out
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Saying the government viewed the corruption problem seriously
and was determined to check it from spreading, Abdullah called on
the people to cooperate to wipe out corrupt practices in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Flash Floods Hit Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Flash floods caused by continuous
heavy rains hit Metro Manila and nearby provinces Sunday and
Monday, killing 10 people, inundating 11 towns and suspending
schools and government work.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Office of Civil Defense, flash
floods caused landslide in the Cainta area of Manila Sunday night,
killing seven people of a family.
</P>
<P>
The report said three others were swept by rampaging waters and
more than 8,000 families have evacuated from their home.
</P>
<P>
Because of the widespread flooding and inclement weather in
Metro Manila, the Philippine government has suspended work in all
government offices effective 3:00 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the nearby Pampanga province, continuous rains since last
Friday destroyed a 40-meter dike of the Pampanga river and
inundated 11 towns as of Monday noon.
</P>
<P>
Floods and erosion in the province rendered some portions of
national and provincial roads impassable to all types of vehicles
and forced at least 100 persons to evacuate to safer places.
</P>
<P>
In Dagupan city in Pangasinan province, classes were suspended
in all public and private schools due to flash floods spawned by
two days of torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Monday that he is
prepared to order the release of calamity funds for areas
devastated by flash floods once the National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC) submits a full assessment on the extent of the
damage caused by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said he could not immediately declare a
state of calamity before the assessment has been submitted by the
NDCC to the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said both military and police personnel have been
placed on double alert for relief and rescue operations for the
victims of the floods.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said earlier that the military has sent out trucks and rubber
boats to assist families affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains, which the authorities claim were brought
about by the much-feared La Nina phenomenon, continued to pelt
Manila and nearby provinces during the past few days.

<HEADLINE> China Moving People From Scenic Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist
spot in the northwestern part of Hunan Province, is planning to
move some 9,000 people and a number of hotels in five years to
restore the ecological balance, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie's Wulingyuan scenic area has China's first state
forest park and the Tianzi Mountain and Suoxi Valley nature
reserves on a 369-sq.km. area. Wulingyuan was added to UNESCO's
World Heritage List in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The city of Zhangjiajie was established in 1988. It has had
more than 14 million tourists, with more than two million last
year, bringing 660 million yuan (about 80 million U.S. dollars) in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
But the growth in tourism and the daily waste caused by
individuals has affected the environment, so a cleanup is
necessary. The moving of people and waste will cost about 300
million yuan (about 36.2 million dollars), according to Liu Liwei,
the secretary of the Zhangjiajie Municipal Communist Party
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that Zhangjiajie has always given priority to
environmental protection and has limited construction. In recent
years, the city has turned down more than 50 applications for
projects that could pose a threat to the environment, worth 340
million yuan (about 41 million dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zhangjiajie has launched a campaign to replace coal and
wood with oil, gas, and electricity as fuel, and to build sewage
treatment facilities with a four-million-dollar loan from Japan
and about one million dollars of State investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie has also placed great importance on forest
protection and tree planting, Liu says, and to increase public
awareness of the ecology it has held five international forest
protection festivals since 1991. This September 21 to 27, the '99
China Eco-Tour International Forest Protection Festival will also
be held here.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Drops by 1.05 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia suffered a 1.05 percent
deflation or negative inflation in July, the country's fifth month
of deflation in a row, according to the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
The negative monthly inflation rate was primarily caused by a
stability in the prices of most basic food commodities, especially
rice, Chief of the BPS Sugito Suwito told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said a 0.13 percent decline in the prices of processed
foods, beverages, cigarettes and tobacco, a 1.59 percent drop in
the prices of clothing and a 3.46 percent drop in the foodstuffs
had contributed to the deflation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation of 0.18 percent in March, 0.68
percent in April, 0.28 percent in May and 0.34 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected an inflation target of 17
percent for the current fiscal year ending March next year, but
recently revised it to 10 percent following positive development
in the country's macroeconomic picture.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Exports Up, Coffee Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam exported more than 2.85
million tons of rice in the first seven months of this year, up 5
percent from the year-earlier period, Vietnam's English business
newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam's rice exports were busy in the first months
only. But this year Vietnam's rice shipments went steady in all
the first seven months, with July in particular seeing 450,000
tons carried abroad.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased volume of rice exports, the average price
of rice was lower than that in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam exported 315,470 tons of coffee beans worth
about 450 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of the
1998-1999 crop, down 3.8 percent and 10.4 percent respectively
compared with the last crop.
</P>
<P>
The reduced value of export resulted from falling world prices
which pushed down Vietnam's coffee export price from 1,455 U.S.
dollars per ton in the fourth quarter of last year to 1,100
dollars per ton early last month.
</P>
<P>
Both rice and coffee are Vietnam's major export commodities.

<HEADLINE> 8 Million Children Facing Malnutrition in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday expressed concern over the plight of more than 8 million
children under five years old who are facing malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
"We could not imagine our future leaders having poor nutrition
or facing malnutrition," the president said during a launch of the
national movement to fight malnutrition in Tangerang district,
some 40 kilometers west of here.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the problem is left unsolved, these children
will enter the country's workforce 20 years later without any
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Habibie claimed that in the past 20 years, there have been rare
cases of malnutrition in the country.
</P>
<P>
The problem, he said, only arose during the onslaught of the
economic crisis in mid-1997, which weakened the people's
purchasing power, and as a result of the people's poor knowledge
on the importance of proper nutrition in raising children.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said that he is thus launching the movement to fight
malnutrition to enable people to handle the problem through four
main strategies -- the empowerment of the family, an integrated
mother-and-child health care system, inter-sectoral cooperation,
and an increase in the provision and quality of medical services.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Faried Anfasa Moeloek reported that
malnutrition has affected more than 200 of the country's 320
districts.

</P>
<P>
Wang is just one of thousands of former Falun Gong
practitioners in China who have changed their minds since the
government declared the Falun Gong cult an illegal organization
more than a week ago and banned it. Recent figures from Shanxi
Province show more than 16,000 practitioners severing their ties
with the organization.

<P>
Key members of the organization, like Wang, woke up. Niu
Shuzhen, a former chief of a center in the city of Taiyuan, vowed
never to have anything to do with the organization.
</P>
<P>
A large number of former Falun Gong practitioners were drawn
into the organization because of its claim about curing disease.
But, in fact the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern city of Shenyang, 13 practitioners were
admitted to psychiatric hospital since December and doctors and

<HEADLINE> Telephone Charges Expected to Drop in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans may see a drastic
reduction in the cost of international telephone calls as a
proposed regional satellite becomes reality.
</P>
<P>
The cost will go down to 10 U.S. cents per minute from the
current rate of 60 cents once the joint satellite installations
project goes operational, the weekly East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Eritrea, Djibouti, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya
attended a sub-regional meeting on the project held recently in
Nairobi, which was sponsored by the Regional Satellite
Organization (RASCOM).
</P>
<P>
According to G.D. Adadja, Director General of Abidjan-based
RASCOM, the satellite project will be implemented by a joint
venture between RASCOM and an outside partner.
</P>
<P>
Adajda noted that the joint venture between RASCOM and Alcatel
is already underway in the first stage and the project is
implemented through the build, operate and transfer venture
company.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Cheserem, Director of Telcom Kenya, told the
participants that the satellite project would provide the
improved linkages and inter- connectivity, and bring all regions
of the continent with efficient and affordable telecommunication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The birth of Telcom Kenya reflects the restructuring of Kenya's
 telecommunication sector as stakeholders look upon the emerging
investment opportunities with considerable interest, Cheserem
said.

<HEADLINE> 14 Brotherhood Members Arrested in Egypt: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Security forces have
arrested 14 members of the country's largest Muslim fundamentalist
group mainly on charges of violating the secular constitution.
</P>
<P>
A report carried by Egypt's Al-Akhbar daily Monday said the
State Security Investigation forces arrested the 14 men Thursday
in Giza, who belonged to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Hesham Saraya of the State Security
Prosecution has ordered 13 of them be taken into custody and the
remaining one be released due to illness, the Arabic-language
newspaper said. It was not clear whether he would be charged.
</P>
<P>
The 14 men, most of whom are doctors, lawyers and engineers,
are also charged with propagating the ideas of the Muslim
Brotherhood and seeking to recruit new members, the pro-government
daily said.
</P>
<P>
These charges, including subverting the constitution, which
usually means advocating a theocratic Islamic government, are
punishable by up to 25 years in jail with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
The arrests are the latest in a largely effective four-year-old
crackdown by the Egyptian government on the Muslim Brotherhood and
other extremist Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
Although long banned, the Brotherhood was tolerated by the
government as it was a largely peaceful movement with considerable
influence among rural Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
The government began to arrest its leaders in 1994, accusing
them of supporting Muslim militants who have been fighting
security forces in their campaign to make Egypt a strict Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood advocates an Islamic state but denies
supporting the use of violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said on Sunday that
the Israeli government's intention to expand the budget deficit
is bound to increase economic instability. Frenkel also called on
the government to adopt a long-term plan to deal with inflation.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has agreed to a three-month "reassessment" period,
during which it will abstain from pressuring on Russia over
stopping the transfer of missile technology to Iran. Meanwhile,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to meet Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- In a vote that will enable Barak to expand the government
without limit, Israeli Knesset (parliament) confirmed the
amendment to the Basic Law on Government Sunday by a sizable
majority. And the Knesset will meet again for a special session
during the summer recess, most likely next Monday, to confirm the
appointment of the new ministers and deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Support Falun Gong Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese religious leaders have
shown their support for the campaign against Falun Gong and say
they will help maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
Memet Seylay, vice-president of the Islamic Association of
China, said that Falun Gong had to be banned and that Moslem
leaders in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region support the
decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the
Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
The true face of Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong have been exposed,
he said, and people now have a clear understanding of Li's true
motive, which is to defraud people of their money and undermine
social stability, but that they will fight against any behavior
that undermines social stability, ethnic unity, and national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Ming Zhiting, president of the China Daoist Association,
accuses Li of feudalism and spreading superstition under the guise
of teaching qigong and of taking advantage of people's desire to
stay healthy, he cheated many practitioners, causing some to go
insane, and has ruined many families,
</P>
<P>
And, when he got his followers to attack Party and government
headquarters and press organizations, Li violated the law and
caused serious damage to social stability, Ming said.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing Parish praises the Falun Gong ban
and calls it a "wise decision". Li and Falun Gong have interfered
in normal religious activities and ruined the image of legitimate
religions, he said, and the ban is the Party's and government's
way of protecting legitimate religious groups and normal religious
activities.

the only air base of the opposition forces, as the summer
offensive the militia launched entered the fifth day, news

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Grateful to China for Not Devaluing Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has expressed gratitude to the Chinese government
for not devaluing the Yuan (Renminbi) which he said saved East
Asian economies from a more severe financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the East Asian economies owed a lot to this
decision by Beijing, Mahathir said in his article published by
Japan's Mainichi group of newspapers Monday, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"Had the Yuan been freely convertible, there is no doubt that
the currency traders would have attacked it and plunged China and
East Asia in an even worse turmoil and recession," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it was not fair to expect China not to
devalue its currency forever since the devaluation of East Asian
currencies has effectively revalued upwards the Yuan and rendered
the country (China) less competitive.
</P>
<P>
"The Yuan can actually be devalued a little without affecting
the economies of the East Asian countries. But, I thank the
Chinese government for holding steadfastly to its promise not to
devalue the Yuan. China is a friend indeed, much more than some
other co-called friends," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
This is despite attempts by currency speculators to destabilize
the Chinese economy by attacking the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
(HKSE), he said.

<HEADLINE> China To Regulate Closed-End Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
and four other state departments issued guidelines on managing
closed-end loans today to help money-losing state-owned
enterprises get out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Rules on Management of Closed-end Loans provide
unified controls on qualifications, examination procedures,
management, and other aspects of closed-end loans, which target
state-owned industrial enterprises with serious losses that can
not get bank loans under normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end loans are meant to support products that have a
market share and are profitable and the enterprises will have to
guarantee that the loans are used for purchasing, production, and
sales.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end loans are commercial loans managed in a special
way and are not policy loans.

<HEADLINE> Oil Thieves Raid Ugandan Transformers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Manager Services Difon Okumu said here Sunday that
between 15 to 20 transformers have been burnt in Masaka District
alone by people who drain out the oil, the Monitor daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem had been tamed in the capital city,
yet it is rampant in remote districts.
</P>
<P>
Cyprian Omurangi, the electricity board's manager in the
eastern district of Mbale, has appealed to the thugs to end the
practice, saying that the general public should cooperate and wipe
out malicious and irresponsible consumers.
</P>
<P>
Over 12 homes in the district have been disconnected since the
crackdown exercise on illegal connections kicked off on July 15.
</P>
<P>
The operation has led to the recovery of 158 meters of service
cables, six single faced power meters and fuses, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The electricity board's Managing Director Paul Mare has
embarked on a crackdown exercise on illegal consumers in the
country to raise money for the company. In Kampala, arrests and
disconnections have been made to illegal consumers.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has an installed capacity of only 180 megawatts while
total estimated peak demand is 250 megawatts. This has resulted in
a power deficit of 70 megawatts leading to loadshedding which is a
constraint to investment and economic diversification.
</P>
<P>
While loadshedding in part due to a shortage of generation
capacity, it is also due to heavy technical and non-technical
losses on the distribution network and poor billing and
collection. The Ugandan power board collects revenues for only
half of power generated.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Sees Fast Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Tianjin in north
China had a GDP of 67.53 billion yuan in the first half of this
year, up 10.68 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show faster industrial growth as a major contributor
to the strong economic growth for the period. Added industrial
output value totaled 30.2 billion yuan in the first six months, an
increase of 13.2 percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The output value of state-owned enterprises increased 6.4
percent, while that of overseas-funded firms grew 16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports were up by a big margin during the first six
months, with exports worth three billion yuan, up 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the fast-paced growth to government
efforts to increase domestic demand, resulting in a big rise in
sales of electric wire, cable, tires, cement, integrated circuits,
metal products, mobile phones, mini-computers, automobiles, and
home appliances.

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Two men were sentenced today by
the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court for plotting to
subvert the state political power in November, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zha Jianguo and Gao Hongming were sentenced to nine and eight
years in prison, respectively, and both were deprived of political
rights for two years.

The court found Zha and Gao collaborated with Xu Wenli, who was
sentenced earlier according to law, in plotting various ways to
subvert the state political power during November, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that their behavior constituted a crime of
subverting the state political power and shall be punished in
accordance with Clause 1 of Article 105 of the Criminal Law of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Members of Zha and Gao's families were present at the court
during the trial and the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the press, relevant Chinese officials say that
Chinese citizens' rights of freedom of association are protected
by law, however, organizing and plotting subversion of the state
political power violates China's Constitution and laws and shall
be punished according to law.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Delegation Visits Syria for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Lebanese delegation
Monday left here for Damascus to make preparatory coordination
with Syria for the anticipated resumption of peace talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is made up of Lebanese Foreign Ministry Director
General Zafer al Hassan and Yahya Mahmassani, diplomatic advisor
of Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will discuss with senior Syrian officials the
likely agenda topics in talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which deploys 30,000 troops in Lebanon, have
been insisting that their negotiations with Israel be conducted
simultaneously and asking Israel to return their lands without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war and has been occupying part of south Lebanon since 1985
as a buffer zone to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to dispatch the delegation was reached in a
telephone conversation between Hoss, who is also holding the
portfolio of foreign minister, and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al Sharaa last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hoss has announced that a working team has been set up to
prepare Lebanon for the seemingly impending new round of talks
with Israel's new government under Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he would like to fully resume the peace talks
with Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the talks would probably be resumed after the Middle
East tour of United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
scheduled for this month.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lebanon's negotiating team will be formed when a
specific date is set for the negotiations.

XI'AN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Shaanxi Province has made
progress in repairing the Xiyue Temple, the province's largest
such project in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Work on the temple entrance, which was destroyed during the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was completed at the end of April and

watchtowers is going on and is expected to be completed this

spent millions of yuan on renovation since the project began in
1994. Shaanxi plans to spend 21 million yuan over the next three
years on 14 major buildings on the temple's main axis.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Indonesia's Batam Returns to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Batam,
Indonesia, returned to normal Monday after a series of clashes
which claimed dozens of lives and disrupted people's daily
activities, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The situation started to improve after the authorities deployed
some 300 security personnel to the region and Chief of the Batam
Authority Ismeth Abdullah instructed them to shoot-on-sight those
who prompted a new clash.
</P>
<P>
The communal clashes started last Thursday, following a dispute
over parking lots between two individuals from two different
ethnic groups. The clashes has led to 13 deaths and the flows of
refugees belonging to the two ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The unrest has caused local businessmen to feel reluctant to
continue their activities in the territory, said Asman Abnur,
chairman of the provincial Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Abnur said the riot has damaged the region's image as a safe
place to invest in.
</P>
<P>
"It takes a long time to return the image after it has been
promoted to the international market," he added.
</P>
<P>
The riots also caused ferry passengers arriving at Sekupang
International Port from Singapore to drop sharply to only 5 to 10
a day.
</P>
<P>
"Visitors prefer to enter the territory through other ports
which are far from the center of the city," an official of
Sekupang port Yanuar was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists have canceled their trip to Batam and are waiting
until the situation returns to normal.
</P>
<P>
Batam, just 35 km southeast of Singapore, is a special
industrial zone and also a popular tourist destination for
Singaporeans.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Establishing Website for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Education
Ministry is establishing an electronic website for schools
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the ministry said Monday that as part of
the New Zealand government's Information and Communication
Technologies Strategy, the establishment of the website "is a
very significant step in lifting education achievement."
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Howard Fancy said in the release that once
the initial development is done, probably in September, "the
content will come from people who already work in the field of
education. Teachers and principals will have a very important
role."
</P>
<P>
He urged teachers and principals to tell the ministry about
what it needs to know and to improve.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the content of the website will include
examples of good practice, materials for the seven Essential
Learning Areas of the New Zealand Curriculum and assistance with
professional development," Fancy said.
</P>
<P>
"Later on, probably within a year, we plan to develop the site
further, so it can be used by students," he added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Fighting Raging in Northern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Fighting has been raging in
northern Afghan provinces of Kunduz and Samangan in recent days as
the dominant Taliban militia advanced in Parwan province abutting
on the capital Kabul, Afghan opposition sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hussain Anwari, an opposition spokesman in Takhar province,
said the Taliban were using air support to push toward Takhar with
heavy fighting in the Khanabad district of Kunduz province.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also continuing in the Dar-i-Safi district of
Samangan province, Anwari said.
</P>
<P>
He said eight Taliban fighters were killed and 10 wounded when
opposition forces ambushed a helicopter that landed close to the
front.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, thousands of people were fleeing their homes
in Parwan province Monday, the main battle area in which the
Taliban pressed its offensive against the northern-based
opposition forces, news reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The student militia have captured several strategic points like
Nejrab, Bagram and Charikar in their four-day long offensive in
the province, with hundreds of soldiers from both sides killed,

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for Int'l Mechanism to Address Forestry Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday called for
an international arrangement or mechanism on forestry that covers
all types of forests to help address the inequitable situation in
the present treatment of different types of forests and overcome
the piecemeal manner in which forestry issues are now handled.
</P>
<P>
The approach to sustainable forest management must be balanced
covering all types of forests and not only tropical forests,
Malaysian Deputy Primary Industries Minister Hishammuddin Tun
Hussein said when opening here a four-day regional meeting on
sustainable forest management.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the present international arrangements
allowed rich temperate and boreal timber producers an open ended
schedule to implement sustainable forest management at the expense
of tropical timber producers.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the trade in tropical timber accounts for
only a small portion of total world trade had made the situation
untenable if not grossly unjust.
</P>
<P>
"Linking global warming with deforestation of tropical forests
alone is totally unjust as tropical forests cover only seven
percent of the earth's surface while countries in the developed
world account for the major share of the world's pollution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the solution to the two key problems of global warming
and environmental pollution cannot rest solely on the shoulders
of developing countries because the industrialized countries must
have the sincerity and political will to reduce the greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
While the objective of sustainable development is noble, the
way that it is being implemented as perceived and practiced by
some countries could be counter-productive, he said, adding
counter-productive unilateral measures against tropical timber
producing countries will aggravate the situation by rendering
tropical timber less valuable thus depriving Third World tropical
timber exporters of the revenues to implement sustainable forest
management.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that critical unsolved issues include the definition
of "forests" itself, Hishammuddin said Malaysia had proposed that
the definition of forests be more comprehensive and should include
land covered with tree species besides just forest species to
include monocultural areas such as oil palm and rubber
plantations.
</P>
<P>
In the West, certain areas with single tree species were
considered as forested areas while several single tree species in
plantations in tropical countries were not, he said.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the same recognition as given to rubber
plantations as forests by the Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) in its Forest Resources Assessment 2000 be also given to oil
palm plantations as they also perform similar functions as forest
species in areas of carbon sequestration, bio-diversity and the
provision of timber and non-timber products.
</P>
<P>
The regional meeting is part of a series which will later
provide inputs to the UN Conference for Sustainable Development
(UNCSD) in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains, Floods Claim Over 30 lives in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains since July 24 have
caused powerful floods to Vietnam's central provinces, killing
more than 30 people and making 43 others missing, local press
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 people are reported dead and 43 others missing in the
flooding which swept through Vietnam's central coastal province
Binh Thuan over the last six days. Property losses are estimated
at nearly 95 billion Vietnamese dong (6.5 million U.S. dollars),
according to Vietnam's flood prevention board.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain in the past few days, the worst in the last 20
years, has submerged around 7,500 houses and swept 178 other
houses in the province.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the floodwaters have drowned or swept away 2,400
cattle and poultry. Some 17,800 hectares of crops in the province
are under water, with crop-damage ranging from 30 percent to 100
percent. Ninety-four boats had also been sunk. Traffic on
Vietnam's National Highway 1 was halted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rain was measured at 490 mm in parts of the upper La Nga
River and this has been the main factor in the heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
In Lam Dong province, floods submerged 3,500 houses, 1,000
hectares of paddy fields and 500 hectares of cashew trees in Cat
Tien District. Two people are reported killed, and more than 4,000
families have been forced to leave their houses for higher areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the residents of Daknong District in Dac Lac
province have witnessed the worst flooding in 40 years, which has
killed one person, swept away five houses and three bailey
bridges, and disrupted traffic on Highway 14.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Surplus Increases in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's trade surplus for
the first half of this year rose by 50.6 percent over the same
period of 1998, the Statistics Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus increased to 33.7 billion ringgit (8.868 billion
U.S. dollars) in January-June compared with 22.4 billion ringgit
(5.894 billion dollars) a year earlier, according to statistics
released by the department.
</P>
<P>
The higher surplus was largely due to a 7.0-percent growth in
exports to 147.1 billion ringgit (38.71 billion dollars) from
137.4 billion ringgit (36.157 billion dollars) against a marginal
1.4-percent decline in imports to 113.4 billion ringgit (29.842
billion U.S. dollars) from 115.1 billion ringgit (30.289 billion
dollars), the department said.
</P>
<P>
However, the surplus in June, though the 20th consecutive month
for the country to chalk up a trade surplus since November 1997,
was 11.1 percent down to 5.4 billion ringgit (1.421 billion
dollars) from 6.1 billion ringgit (1.605 billion dollars) in the
same month last year due to a higher growth of 20.1 percent in
imports against a growth of 12 percent in exports, it said.

</P>
<P>
The incident, which left three passengers dead, occurred hours
after the ferry left the central island of Cebu for Masbate.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that navy and coast guard ships rescued 206
passengers and the 28 crew members.
</P>
<P>
The ferry boat was only four miles from its destination in
Cataingan when a fire broke out in the engine room.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said two naval vessels -- the DF 317 and PG 377
-- have been scouring the sea waters between Basilay and Bugtong
off Masbate Island for the missing passenger.
</P>
<P>
Timely arrival of rescuers from the navy, Coast Guard and
fishermen prevented a high fatality rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has ordered an investigation into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Hold Formal Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it was "highly optimistic" about opening formal peace
talks with the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) this
September.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Mercado, secretary of the Department of National
Defense, said negotiators from both sides are now finalizing
discussions on the identification of MILF camps in Mindanao island
as part of the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The tentative schedule for opening the peace talks is in
September. We expect everything to go smoothly, and we hope this
process will continue," Mercado said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the identification of MILF camps appears
to be the only "problematic area" being threshed out by the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed confidence that government negotiators can
resolve the issue in time for the opening of formal peace
negotiations next month.
</P>
<P>
"They are discussing problematic areas now. These particular
camps ostensibly are the ones where the forces of the MILF are,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF started exploratory negotiations in
late 1996 after the government forged a formal peace agreement
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), another major
rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has thrown his full support
behind the peace efforts, but made it clear that the government
will strictly abide by the constitution in entering into
negotiations with the secessionist group.

<HEADLINE> China Expecting Drop In Price Of Cotton As Fixed Prices Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China's State Development
Planning Commission, the price regulatory commission, said
recently that the government will no longer set the purchase price
of cotton and that this may lead to a drop in the price.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts predict that the price will fall by a big
margin as cotton surpluses grow and the price becomes tied to the
market.
</P>
<P>
China expects another good cotton harvest this year, which will
depress cotton sales because of stockpiles. And global cotton
production is expected to increase by about five percent on an
annual basis, but cotton consumption will grow only about 1.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The falling prices will affect low-quality cotton directly and
may cause cotton planters to improve the quality of their cotton,
Commission officials say.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China's advertisers did 5.3
billion U.S. dollars worth of business in 1998, a 45 percent
increase from 1997, in spite of the Asian financial meltdown,
according to an AC Nielsen survey.
</P>
<P>
China has become the second largest advertising market in the
Asian and Pacific region, after Japan, but, because of last year's
financial turmoil, business with the Republic of Korea, Thailand,
Malaysia was down around 20 percent, and with Singapore, about 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
A Nielsen analyst attributes the growth of Chinese advertising
business to expanded coverage and increased investment.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese advertisers also reported rapid growth last year,
with income from TV and newspaper advertisements alone worth 2.5
billion dollars, an increase of 19 percent. Hong Kong's
advertisers saw a 2 percent increase to 2.7 billion dollars worth.

<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 2 (Xinhua) -- With China's first
Arctic expedition completing a 12-day oceanic research in Bering
Sea early this morning, the Snow Dragon ship is sailing northward
to the Arctic Ocean for the next stage of investigation.
</P>
<P>
The survey in Bering Sea covered nearly 240,000 square
kilometers, including six sections and 42 station sites.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have carried out physical detection,
chemical, geological, isotopes, atmosphere, and carbon dioxide
sampling. They also collected plankton and studied fishery
resources in this region.
</P>
<P>
Qin Weijia, an assistant to the chief scientist, described the
research as very "successful", and said that it will help enrich
the knowledge of Chinese scientists about marine resources in
Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
This is the first comprehensive marine survey China has ever
done in this sea area since the dawn of history, he said, adding
that "the research on the exchange of water flows between the
Arctic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean may provide sufficient data
to the study of environmental effect and climate changes."
</P>
<P>
Success of the research showed that Chinese scientists had made
great progress in oceanic study since the beginning of China's
reform and opening-up two decades ago.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban in South China Sea Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Amid cracking of fireworks,
fishermen of Panyu in south China's Guangzhou City set sail for
ocean fishing from a dock at the estuary of the Pearl River at
midnight Saturday when the first fishing ban imposed on the South
China Sea area was lifted.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the first catch after the ban, Captain Li Weixiong
said that the catches in the coming weeks will be up 20 percent
over the same period last year. Li made a catch of some 2,000 kg
of fish in his boat's first catch yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The fish catch and income of Chinese farmers have been
decreasing in the past years. The Ministry of Agriculture
introduced the fishing ban in a hope to foster and rationally use
fishing resources, and ensure a sustainable growth of ocean
fishery, so as to protect the fishermen's long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
The fishing ban, which started on June 1, involved more than 30,
000 boats and one million fishermen, including some 1,800 boats
from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, only 0.41 per thousand of the fishing
vessels were found fishing illegally in the South China Sea,
according to an official who is in charge of the fishing ban in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The government has subsidized those fishermen who are in need
as a result of the fishing ban, the official said, adding that the
supply and prices of seafood remained stable during the period due
to the adequate store of seafood and pelagic fishing.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: E.Asia's Tourism Recovering From Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- After being severely hit by a
financial crisis, East Asia's tourism industry is beginning to
pick up, and the pace is expected to grow faster in the months
ahead with the regional economy continuously turning around.
</P>
<P>
As a major foreign exchange earner, the tourism industry
accounted for 10.3 percent of East Asian nations' gross domestic
product in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
However, since 70 percent of tourists come from within the
region, the outbreak of a regional financial crisis in mid-1997
affected badly the tourism industry in East Asia. The rising
commodity prices, the higher unemployment rate and the lower
living standard as a result of currency devaluations forced people
to cancel their travels abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report by the World Tourism
Organization, the economic crisis reduced the number of tourist
arrivals in East Asia by 1.2 percent to 87 million in 1998, with
the region's tourism receipts down by 3.8 percent to 74 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But since the beginning of this year, East Asia's economic
turnaround has prompted the recovery of the tourism industry. In
the crisis-hit East Asian countries, tourist arrivals rose
significantly.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, visitor arrivals grew by 17.9 percent year on
year in June, the biggest jump so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Singapore Tourism Board show that
574,800 visitors came to Singapore in June, bringing the total
number of visitor arrivals in the first half of this year to 3.33
million, up 8.9 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, tourist arrivals grew by 10 percent to 2.566
million in the first five months due to the economic recovery,
said the Tourism Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, according to the authority, remained one of the most
favorite destinations for South Koreans with 125,719 tourists
visiting Thailand in the first half of this year, a surge of 122
percent compared to the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, visitor receipts in the first half of the
year also were up by 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some analysts said, the industry's recovery
should not only be attributed to the brighter economic picture,
but also to promotion activities and a great stimulus by East
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Such an assessment seems to be reasonable. For example, the
"Amazing Thailand" campaign in the past two years has proved the
success of Thailand's tourism marketing strategy, which helped the
country become the first in Asia to show a recovery in the number
of foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the government invested 222 million pesos
(5.85 million dollars) in improving 12 tourism projects in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But East Asian countries are not satisfied with the growing
number of tourist arrivals, and they are trying in one way and
another to attract more foreign travelers.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is willing to relax its travel and visa requirements
to accommodate the needs of foreign tourists, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohammed said recently.
</P>
<P>
"We are very keen to have people stay a longer time in Malaysia
and for that we prepared to relax our visa requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would try to accommodate as much as possible the
needs of visitors including the South Korean tourists, as their
country had registered very rapid recovery after the financial
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the tourism department launched a
"Re-discovering the Philippines" campaign months ago, appealing to
the third and fourth generations of Filipinos abroad to come back
and "find their roots."
</P>
<P>
A Philippine mission left here Sunday for a two-week tour of
four major U.S. cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and
New York -- for promotion activities. They will offer tourists
lower rates for accommodations and travelling in their country.
</P>
<P>
With new marketing strategies and a recovering regional
economy, East Asian countries are optimistic about the growth in
the tourism industry this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand forecast 8.28 million tourist
arrivals for Thailand this year, compared to 7.7 million in 1998.

here, the seven who died in a landslide were from one family in
the Cainta area of the capital, and three others were apparently
swept by rampaging waters.
</P>
<P>
The family was inside their house when the landslide struck,
burying them alive, the OCD said.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains, which authorities claimed were brought about
by the much-feared La Nina phenomenon, continued to pelt Manila
and nearby provinces during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The OCD said flood waters in some areas of the city were 17.9
meters deep after days of big rains.
</P>
<P>
Many areas in the metropolis and nearby provinces have remained
underwater as of Monday morning, it said.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters have reached roof-deep in some parts of Marikina
and Cainta, and the OCD has deployed amphibious vehicles and
trucks to rescue stranded residents.
</P>
<P>
The OCD said that hundreds of people had to climb to the
rooftop of their houses because of the rising floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations are now in full swing, it said.

<HEADLINE> Riot Have No Impact on Foreign Investment in Indonesia' Batam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The recent rioting in Batam,
Indonesia, has had no impact on the interests of foreign investors
in developing their businesses in the area, head of the Batam
Authority Area Ismeth Abdullah said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no foreign investors who cancelled their
business activities. In fact, several investors have built new
factories with the total investment at 26 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the foreign investment in Batam
could reach 60 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
He also said Batam has a strategic position for various
industries and is close to Malaysia and Singapore for the market
destination.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the low-cost labor here (Batam) is also one of
the elements attracting foreign investors," he was quoted by the
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Batam, just 35 km southeast of Singapore, is a special
industrial zone and also a popular tourist destination for
Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
Batam now has 370 foreign industrial factories which have
absorbed 1.6 million employees, and for the next five years, the
area is projected to receive investment of 15 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes between migrant groups from Sumatera and Flores
in Batam since Thursday have claimed at least 13 lives. The
clashes occurred following a dispute over parking lots between two
individuals from the two groups.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the situation in Batam island
is now stable and under control, as the communal clashes there
ended following the signing of a peace agreement between the two
migrant communities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China National Petroleum (Group)
Corp (CNPC) will further solicit overseas capital for some
projects regarding oil exploration, refining and pipe laying.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for CNPC was quoted by Monday's China Daily as
saying that the company is carrying out project appraisals and
conducting negotiations with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC has been stressing the exploration of natural gas in
central China, looking for rich oil reserves in east China, and
trying to achieve significant discoveries when prospecting in west
China.
</P>
<P>
It has designated 24 oil refining facilities for technical
upgrading this year, and will complete the upgrading of some
reforming units and hydroprocessing lubricating oil and diesel
hydrogenating facilities, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, CNPC produced 53.4 million tons

<HEADLINE> Australia's Current Account Deficit Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite a well-performed
economy, Australians are deeply concerned over the country's
growing current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently, Australia's current
account deficit in 1998-99 stood at around 22.44 billion U.S.
dollars compared with 15.51 billion U.S. dollars in the previous
financial year. The figure for 1996-97 was about 11.88 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review said on Monday that the main
reason was the apparently increasing participation of foreign
investors in the Australian bond and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
It asked people to look at the earlier success of the
intriguing economic experiment in New Zealand in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, to see how huge foreign participation in an
economy can work to undermine it.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's economy was once at the top of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of high growth,
low inflation and strong international investor confidence, and it
resulted in a significant rise of foreign ownership of it's bonds
and stocks which reached to about two thirds of the market.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it was the high current account deficit that
forced the NZ dollar to plummet, and as a result, New Zealand fell
into a sharp recession.
</P>
<P>
The lessons from that experience should be salutary for palicy
makers and financial markets in Australia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Australian officials has stressed repeatedly in recent months
that the Australian economy has entered into the fast lane with
it's high growth rate of nearly 5 percent and low inflation of
under 1.5 percent as well as the lowest interest rate for 30
years.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee S.Lankan Rebels-Held Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Sri Lankan
civilians have fled the Tamil rebels-held Wanni in the country's
north, as the rebels and the army are locked in a dispute over a
safe land route for civilians in the area.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 civilians have sought refuge in the Mannar security
zone in Sri Lanka's northwest and have been accommodated at the
Pesalai refugee camp, said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, who are receiving a better deal at the hands of
the government, are now condemning the Tamil rebels for killing
members of their own Tamil community, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The army and the Tamil rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) have been discussing a new safe land route between
Wanni and government-controlled areas for transport of food as
well as movement of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have rejected the army's offer to set up a
"civilian safety zone" for fears the army could mount fresh
offensives against them.
</P>
<P>
The government has traditionally supplied food and other items
to civilians in rebel-held areas, while allowing them access to
government-controlled towns for trade and other activities.
</P>
<P>
An earlier route was closed in May when the army launched a
fresh offensive in its war against the Tamil rebels, who have been
fighting for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east for
minority Tamils since 1983.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Canadian Tests Positive for Banned Substance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada was stripped of
its Pan Am Games roller hockey gold medal here on Sunday after
goalkeeper Steve Vezina tested positive for two stimulants and an
anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
The gold now goes to the United States, the silver to Argentina
and the bronze to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Steve Vezina gave a positive result...we decided to withdraw
the gold medal from the winning team, Canada. We regret to do so
but we have to follow the rules." Mario Vazquez Rana, president of
the Pan American Sports Organization, said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Canada defeated the Americans 7-6 for the Games gold in a
thrilling
final last Tuesday. Vezina's goaltending was credited as a key
part of the victory.
</P>
<P>
Vezina was the lone Canadian roller hockey player tested
positive. Eduardo de Rose, the chief of the Games Medical
Commission, said Vezina's sample showed an excessively high level
of the steroid Nandrolone--16,000 parts per million compared to
the acceptable level of two parts per million.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot of steroids, this is not normal," Rose said.
</P>
<P>
Vezina, 24, plays a professional roller hockey for the Buffalo
Wings.
</P>
<P>
The drug test showed three banned substances--ephedrine, pseudo-
ephedrine and Nandrolone. The former two are stimulants used to
avoid fatigue and Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid that increases
muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
The officials said there were no medical reasons for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
The positive test is the lastest in a line of black eyes for
Canadian athletes on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Snowboarder Ross Rebagliati tested positive for marijuana at
the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan and was stripped of his
gold medal in the giant slalom. His medal was restored after the
Canadian team successfully appealed, arguing it was not a
performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
Rower Silken Laumann tested positive for a banned stimulant at
the 1995 Pan Am Games in Mar Del Plata, Argentina after taking the
wrong over-the-counter cold medicine. The positive drug test cost
her and her quad-sculls teammates their gold medals.
</P>
<P>
And Ben Johnson put doping on the map with his positive test at
the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
About six Pan Am athletes have tested positive at each Games
over the past 20 years, except at Caracas in 198, when 19 tested
positive.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Gold Medals Hope at SEA Games Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's swimming star
Joscelin Yeo has suffered an elbow injury which could jeopardise
her hopes of winning nine gold medals in the upcoming Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
Yeo, 20, bruised a nerve in her elbow during a weights training
session in the United States where she is presently studying and
training, the Straits Times daily said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The injury comes as a blow to Yeo, who has been in superb form
after smashing six national records in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
But despite the injury, she would still swim in the SEA Games
in Brunei beginning on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yeo has been entered in the 50 meters, 100 meters, 200 meters
and 400 meters free events, 100 meters and 200 meters breaststroke
events, 100 meters fly and 200 meters and 400 meters individual
medley events.
</P>
<P>
She will also participate in three relay events - 4x100m free,
4x200m free and 4x100m medley.
</P>
<P>
She won three individual gold medals at the last SEA Games in
Jakarta in 1997 and had swept seven gold medals in the same
competition four years ago.

<HEADLINE> Doping Incident Overshadows Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Doping phantom surfaced
at the 13th Pan Am Games here today when one member of the
Canadian men's gold-winning roller hockey team failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
Canada was stripped of its Pan Am gold medal Sunday after
goalkeeper Steve Vezina tested positive for two stimulants and an
anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
The gold now goes to the United States, the silver to Argentina
and the bronze to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Canada defeated the Americans 7-6 for the Games gold in a
thrilling
final last Tuesday. Vezina's goaltending was credited as a key
part of the victory.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo de Rose, the chief of the Games Medical Commission,
said Vezina's sample showed an excessively high level of the
steroid Nandrolone--16,000 parts per million compared to the
acceptable level of two parts per million.
</P>
<P>
The doping incident even more overshadowed a relatively
uneventful day whose sole highlight was Brazil beating Cuba for
women's volleyball gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Brazil came from one set down to score a 20-25, 25-22, 25-27,
25-22, 15-13 thrilling victory over their mighty opponents Cuba,
who were the defending Olympic and world champions.
</P>
<P>
In the baseball competition, Canada's amazing victorious stream
finally snapped when Cuba avenged a disgraceful group match defeat
by beating the host nation 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final will be between the United States and
Mexico later today with an Olympic berth at stake. The top two
finishers at the Games qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The United States still tops the medals table with 70 golds, 62
silvers and 41 bronzes, with Cuba and Canada second and third, on
33 and 30 golds respectively. Argentina placed fourth with 20
golds, followed by Brazil who has collected 10 golds.

<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Identical twins Bob and
Mike Bryan of the United States advanced into the medal round of
the Pan Am Games tennis competitions Sunday with a 6-2, 6-1
victory over Simon Evelyn and Shane Stone of Trinidad and Togago.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, the duo will face the winner of the match
between the team of Guillermo Coria and David Nalbanian of
Argentina and the team of Oscar Ortiz and Marco Osorio of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to get any medal other than gold," said Mike
Bryan.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be upset if we don't win the gold here," said Bob Bryan.
"That's what we came here for. We want the gold, bad."
</P>
<P>
In their two doubles matches at the Pan Am Games, the Bryans
have not lost a set or lost a service game. With two more
victories, the Bryans would become the first U.S. doubles team to
win the gold medal at the Pan Am Games since Luke Jensen and
Patrick McEnroe won the gold medal at the 1987 Pan Am Games in
Indianapolis, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have a couple more matches to go," said US coach Scott
McCain. "We got to take it one match at a time. We are not looking
passed anybody."
</P>
<P>
The Bryans are currently the No.13 ranked doubles team in the
ATP Tour doubles team rankings. Although the duo have yet to
represent the United States in Davis Cup play, they see their Pan
Am experience as a step in that direction and ultimately toward a
possible selection to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Plummets in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar received a total of 29.45
million U.S. dollars of foreign investment in fiscal 1998-99,
accounting for only 3.78 percent and 1.04 percent of that drawn in
1997-98 and 1996-97 respectively, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Economic Indicators published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization, there were only 10
investment projects during 1998-99 that came from eight countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
They are from Britain, China, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Of the investment, that in the manufacturing sector made up the
highest with 19.57 million dollars in 5 projects, followed by
fisheries with 5 million dollars in one project and mining with
4.88 million dollars in 4 projects.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Indicators show that the foreign investment in the
country in 1998-99 dropped to the lowest level as compared with
the past five fiscal years. The foreign investment hit a peak in
1996-97 with 2.814 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the steep drop in Myanmar's foreign
investment is the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
Brigadier-General Abel, Myanmar Minister at the Office of the
Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, admitted
recently that due to the effect of the crisis, the direct
investment in Myanmar from member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations fell by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar had drawn a total of
7.108 billion dollars of foreign investment from 24 countries and
regions up to the end of April this year since the country opened
to foreign investment and adopted a market-oriented economic
policy in late 1988.

ZHENGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has cut its population of the needy to 3.16 million in 1998 from
the 25 million in the late 1980s thanks to the efforts in the past
decade, according to local official sources.
</P>
<P>
In rural Henan, the number of the needy has declined to 4.16
percent of the total rural population from 35 percent in the past.
Living conditions have bettered notably in the province's 34 less
developed counties which received State aid.
</P>
<P>
Henan has allocated substantial poverty-relief funds to
upgrading infrastructure projects in poor area in recent years,
improving transportation conditions, power supply, water control
facilities, and communications service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Henan mobilized all the social sectors to help those
poor counties and villages. In 1998, the departments affiliated to
the provincial government donated or invested about 98.4 million
yuan to those areas, helped introduce investment of 305.94 million
yuan. These government departments also helped set up 105 primary
schools for them by using more than 305 million yuan from other
areas
</P>
<P>
Agrotechnicians and professors were invited to offer lectures
and consultation services regularly about fruit growth, scientific
farming, and animal husbandry, training nearly 300,000 people

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Rice Export Picks Up in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's rice export amounted to
123,000 tons in fiscal 1998-99, picking up from 28,300 tons in
1997-98 and 93,100 tons in 1996-97, according to the latest
Economic Indicators published by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The picking up of Myanmar's rice export in the year followed a
three consecutive years' drop in the export since 1994-95 when it
was 1.04 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's paddy production dropped steadily in the past
three fiscal years, falling from 18.19 million tons in 1994-95 to
17.95 million tons in 1995-96, to 17.67 million tons in 1996-97
and to 17.3 million tons in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar experienced a flash flood and drought in
some parts of the country in 1997-98, which was one of the main
reasons for the fall in its paddy production and rice export.
</P>
<P>
As part of its measures to boost the agricultural production,
the Myanmar government has, since the beginning of this year,
allowed private entrepreneurs to reclaim vacant, virgin, fallow
and wet lands in the country. Up to now, a total of 467,370
hectares of such lands have been reclaimed in six divisions and
states.
</P>
<P>
Another 291,600 hectares in the country's Mon and Kayin states
are being planned for reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and 35 percent of the export value.

<HEADLINE> Canada Stripped of Gold due to Doping Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian roller
hockey team was stripped of the gold they won on July 27 after one
of its member was tested positive for steroid, the Pan Ammerican
Sports Organization (PASO) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The doping tests of Steve Vezina resulted positive on both the
A and B samples.
</P>
<P>
In accordance to the Pan American Games Regulations, the PASO
Executive Committee decided to withdraw the gold medal from the
Canadian Team, who will have to hand them back openly to the
United States. The silver medal consequently went to Argentina and
the bronze medal to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
There were three different prohibited substances found in
Vezina's urine samples and the quantity was "very high", said
Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO medical commission.
</P>
<P>
The materials were mainly used to help athletes recover from
fatigue and increase their body power, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
After their 7-6 narrow victory over the United States in the
men's roller hockey final four days ago, eight members of the
Canadian team received doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Vezina, a 24-year-old profession, is now unavailable for any
comments and subject to sanctions from the International Hockey
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Don Mackenzie, president of the Winnipeg Games Organizatoin
Committee, said they were hugely disappointed and deeply regretful
about the doping offense.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the media to focus on the sports itself and the
outstanding performances of the Pan Am athletes.

<HEADLINE> End Finally in Sight to Anelka Saga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Asrenal football club manager
Arsena Wenger finally said goodbye to Nicolas Anelka and hello
again to the FA Charity Shield after Arsenal beat Manchester
United 2-1 at Wembley on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners' success was overshadowed by the news that they had
agreed the 22 million pounds sale of rebel striker Anelka to Real
Madrid. Wenger confirmed that Anelka's move to Spain is complete,
barring the final signatures on the contract and a routine medical
examination which should be done within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
And although Arsenal have had to sacrifice a principle in
selling him to the Spanish giants whom they had formally accused
of illegal poaching of the player just two months ago, the Gunners
boss admitted: "It is the best thing for everybody that it is all
over."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We have had an explanation from Real Madrid that has
satisfied the club. I wanted to keep the player and I'm
disappointed we could not sit down together and talk but in the
end he wants to go.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to let him join Real Madrid because the
transfer figure is a reasonable one and we don't want to be
responsible for killing the boy's career.
</P>
<P>
"It is a story that has lasted all summer and has always been
on a knife-edge. This club (Arsenal) would have survived if he had
not played but I'm not sure Anelka could have.
</P>
<P>
"Now we must forget all this and concentrate on the season
ahead. And that performance today showed we still have the right
spirit and don't have to depend on one man."
</P>
<P>
Anelka had originally claimed that Real Madrid were the only
club he wanted to join when he turned his back on Arsenal at the
end of last season despite having four years of his Highbury
contract still to run. But when the Gunners at first refused to
deal with the Spaniards, Lazio came on to the scene and one of the
most tedious transfer stories for years began to unfold. Finally,
the Italians pulled out, claiming that Arsenal's 22 million pounds
asking price was too high.
</P>
<P>
Now Real, despite massive debts, are believed to be raising the
money to buy the 20-year-old French international from a lucrative
Spanish television deal.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal vice chairman David Dein said: "It is a done deal
subject to Nicolas passing a medical. We've got to get on with our
lives. It has been a long and unpleasant saga."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- World number one American
Lindsay Davenport defeated fourth-ranked Venus Williams, her cocky
18-year-old compatriot 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 to win the Bank of the West
Classic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who won her second straight Bank of the West title.
</P>
<P>
Williams said: "I just made too many unforced errors at the
wrong times", "I didn't play as well. I feel I still have more
power than her but I had more unforced errors. She played well, I
played well. In the end, she was a little bit better."
</P>
<P>
Williams brought a 1-7 record against Davenport into the match
and promised to keep up with her bigger opponent from the forehand
side. Davenport has won the last four meetings.
</P>
<P>
Both players came out firing and played evenly until the
tiebreaker, engaging in fierce crosscourt rallies, eating up any
weak second serve and going down the line with authority whenever
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Davenport broke Williams to open the match, but Williams broke
back to 3-3 when Davenport mis-hit an inside-out forehand.
Williams held two sets points with Davenport serving at 4-5, but
the 1999 Wimbledon champion responded with a huge crosscourt
service winner and a service winner.
</P>
<P>
After that, Williams lost her focus. Davenport bore down and
played a consistent tiebreaker, while the Compton,California
native let fly four unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Williams had three break opportunities at 2-
4, but missed two return of serves and watched Davenport bang a
winner.

<HEADLINE> Positive Test Strips Canada of Gold Medal (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The gold medal for the
men's roller hockey champions was re-awarded today to the United
States after one member of the initial winners Canada failed a
drug test.
</P>
<P>
Canadian goalie Steve Vezina tested positive for three banned
substances, following the July 27 final against the United States,
over which Canada scored a narrow 7-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO)
regulations, the Executive Committee of PASO decided to strip the
gold medal of the entire Canadian team and give them to the United
States, and consequently hand the silver to Argentina and the
bronze to the original fourth-place finisher Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Two of the banned substances, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine,
are nervous system stimulants that assist in overcoming fatigue,
according to PASP Chief Medical Officer Eduardo de Rose. The third
substance, nandrolone, is an anabolic steroid used to increase
muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Olympic Association (COA) has sent a letter to the
PASO Medical Commission which stated there would be no dispute
over the positive test results.
</P>
<P>
The COA announced here today they deeply regret the incident
and the impact it has had on the sport of roller hockey and the
image of the Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the COA remains committed to drug-free
sports.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Mexico to Crash in Confederations Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will crash host Mexico
in Mexico City's Azteca Stadium on Wednesday in the final of the
eight-country Confederations Cup soccer tournament after the both
teams beat their respective rivals in the semi-final matches in
Guadalajara on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning Cup champions Brazil secured a birth in the final with
an 8-2 rout over the surprising Saudi Arabia while Mexico defeated
the United States 1-0 in Extra time.
</P>
<P>
Brazil appeared to be coasting to victory with two goals in the
opening 11 minutes, from defender Joao Carlos and 19-year-old
Ronaldo Assis.
</P>
<P>
But Marzouk al Otaibi, the four-goal hero in the 5-1 victory
over Egypt, led a spirited first-half fightback by Saudi Arabia
with two goals in nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
Brazil retained its composure with a quick reply through Ze
Roberto two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, in the 36th minute, Alex struck his third
goal of the tournament, heading in a cross from Ze Roberto.
</P>
<P>
As Guadalajara's Jalisco Stadium was struck by a second-half
torrential downpour, the Brazilian goal floodgates stayed opened.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Roni added a fifth goal, Ronaldinho, as the new
forward sensation is popularly known, sliding in for his second.
</P>
<P>
Alex then added his second before Ronaldinho fittingly
completed his hat-trick with a solo effort to close the Brazilian
scoring on the stroke of full-time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mexico took a sudden-death golden goal in Azteca
Stadium from striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco's at the seventh minute of
extra time to beat the United States in the day's other semi-final
match.
</P>
<P>
The Americans travel to Guadalajara to face the Saudis in the
match for the tournament's third-place spot on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Beats Agassi at Mercedes-Benz Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras used a victory
over defending champion Andre Agassi in an all-American affair to
celebrate his return to the world number one spot on Sunday at the
350,000 U.S. dollars Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Sampras blended a solid ground game with a powerful
serve that produced 11 aces to power past top seed Agassi 7-6 (7-3)
, 7-6 (7-1) in the 95-minute showdown.
</P>
<P>
Sampras earned his 59th career title and the 46,000 U.S.
dollars winner's share to cap a brilliant week when the 12-time
Grand Slam champion ousted Australian Patrick Rafter to reclaim
the world number one ranking on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
It ran his latest match winning streak to 17 including three
titles while improving his career edge to 15-10 over his longtime
rival.
</P>
<P>
Sampras officially was to take the number one ranking on Monday
when he would begin his record-setting 271st week on top,
eclipsing the mark Ivan Lendl held.
</P>
<P>
Though Agassi has won 17 of his last 19 matches including a
French Open crown, he has been denied twice by Sampras, in the
finals of Wimbledon Championships and Mercedes-Benz Cup.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Satisfied with Silver Performances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Former men's 100m world
record holder Donovan Bailey said here today he was satisfied with
the silver he won with the Canadian 4X100m relay team.
</P>
<P>
The defending Olympic champion blew out of the starting blocks
to give Canadian team a lightening-fast lead but anchor man
Trevino Betty couldn't catch up to Brazil as Canada had to settle
for silver last night at the University of Manitoba Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Bailey wrapped up a turbulent week in Winnipeg by doing what he
does best -- running faster with Glenroy Gilbert, Brad McCuaig and
Betty as a sellout crowd of close to 11,000 widely cheered them on.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a decent start when I passed both guys and handed
off to Glenroy, " Bailey said. "This is a stepping stone to the
world championships."
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of position, but it's OK. Maybe if I
anchored, it would have been different, maybe if Trevino led off
it would have been different. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
"But we're going to be just fine. We can't sit and worry about
one race. It's over now. There are bigger things this year."
</P>
<P>
It is over now for Bailey, as far as Winnipeg's concerned.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, whose record of 9.84 was squeezed down by American
Maurice Greene to 9.79 in June, refused an offer by Athletics
Canada to run the 100m because he wasn't asked initially.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Am Games poster boy, who was paid more than 200,000
Canadian dollars to promote the Games, also failed to show up in
the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted he did the right thing, and pointed to the
crowd's roaring approval of all four members of the Canadian team
as proof.
</P>
<P>
"I was always committed to the Games and I said I would come
here and do a good job and I did," he said.
