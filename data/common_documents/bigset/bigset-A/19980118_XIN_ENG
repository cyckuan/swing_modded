<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Rejects New Peace Blueprint On N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), rejected on Saturday the new
Anglo-Irish proposals which could hopefully pave the way to peace.
</P>
<P>
The proposals on new power-sharing arrangements in the province
were hailed this week as a breakthrough after months of
slow-moving negotiations between Northern Ireland's political
parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness accused
the British and Irish governments of bowing to pressure from
Unionists and insisted that Sinn Fein will stay with the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"This document has gone down very badly within Sinn Fein,"
McGuinness told BBC. "We have not accepted the document as a basis
for negotiation and we intend going to the talks to oppose the
document," he added.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Unionist deputy leader Peter Robinson accused Sinn
Fein of bluffing, saying "Sinn Fein is cleverly playing their
negotiating hand to extract more concessions and the talks will
continue to be the farce they always have been."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's opposition to the new peace blueprint will come as
a blow to the British and Irish governments which had hailed it as
a significant step forward in the search for peace in the
province.

<HEADLINE> 86 Kenyans Die in El Nino-Related Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 86 Kenyans have died
in floods in the last 24 hours caused by torrential rains which
have been hitting the eastern African country since November due
to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"The death toll now stands at 86, with Coast (province)
reporting 38, Nairobi eight, and other provinces 40," police said
in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The reported damage appeared to be the worst in recent years
in the country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were four children killed when their house
in Machokos district nearby Nairobi, was washed away and then
buried by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
In Garissa, North-Eastern Province, the Tana River burst its
banks, displacing 2,300 people.
</P>
<P>
"Garissa airstrip is under water and only helicopters can land
in Garissa. Mandera has reportedly 155 displaced families.
Further reports say that communication between the three
districts of Garissa, Mandera and Wajir is only possible by
aircraft," said the police statement.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-Mombasa highway, a major highway in the country,
was closed down last night after a 30-kilometer stretch was cut
off due to the raging floods.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpours since Wednesday evening have flooded the
already collapsing roads in many parts of Nairobi and submerged
houses in some middle-class neighborhoods and shacks in teeming
shanty towns for several hours.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also added to a deteriorating sanitary
situation in Nairobi, and initiated a fresh cholera outbreak in
western and eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi called for international help on
Thursday, adding that the government was starting emergency food
distribution to all areas under floods.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts said earlier this week that this year's long
rains season, which should start in Kenya in late March, may also
be replaced by a spell of drought.
</P>
<P>
Global forecast indicated that the El Nino weather phenomenon
has been on a downward trend worldwide since December and was
likely to end in May.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Iraq Ready to Resolve Disputes: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq Saturday voiced
readiness to resolve their remaining disputes and differences, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi stressed that
resolving the remaining disputes and differences between the two
neighbors would have positive effects on the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He further underlined that the two countries would need to show
political will and national inclination to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf, who arrived here Friday night for an official visit,
also expressed the will and political willingness of Iraq to
resolve disputes with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to improve relations between the two Muslim countries
and we wish to overcome our differences through peaceful
negotiations and in a friendly environment," said the Iraqi
minister.
</P>
<P>
Close relations and cooperation between the two countries will
lead to the establishment of regional peace and stability, besides
securing their national interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two ministers exchanged views on the
issue of prisoners of war, dating back to their brutal bloodshed
in 1980-88. Both agreed that the issue should be settled as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that al-Sahhaf's visit here coincided with the
rising tensions between Iraq and the United Nations Special
Commission over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad improved relations with Tehran in 1990 before the
U.S.-led coalition forces drove its occupation troops out of
Kuwait in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf was believed to have asked the Iranian government to
help in lifting the seven-year-old, crippling U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Swine Fever Forces Germany to Kill 77,000 Pigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A newly-found outbreak of swine
fever has forced authorities in four northern German states to
order the slaughter of about 77,000 pigs, German press reported at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The precautious measures were first taken by agricultural
authorities in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern after swine
fever was found at a large pig farm in the state. All the 62,000
pigs there have to be killed.
</P>
<P>
The farm had also sold pigs for breeding to farms in some other
German states, including North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and
Schleswig-Holstein. As a result, thousands of pigs would also have
to be killed in these states.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the agriculture ministry of Belgium on Friday also
moved to impose a temporary sales ban on 90 Belgian farms which
had imported pigs from Germany over the past 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Swine fever is a highly infectious virus disease which could
kill most of the infected pigs. But the virus which causes the
disease is not transmissable to human beings, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Christina Kaul, an expert of the European Union agriculture
commission, warned on Friday that Germany could face a EU ban on
its pork exports if it failed to put the epidemic under control.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Action on Anti-smoking Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged strong bipartisan legislation to keep the tobacco
industry out of the youth market and permit the regulation of
tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, newly released documents from a major cigarette
producer show a longstanding campaign to hook teen-agers and
create a new legion of lifetime smokers.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about politics. This is not about money; it is
about our children," the president said in his weekly radio
address. "The 1998 Congress should be remembered as the Congress
that passed comprehensive tobacco legislation, not the Congress
that passed up this historic opportunity to protect our children
and our future."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came two days after the release on Capitol
Hill of secret memos showing that R.J. Reynolds, the nation's
second-largest cigarette producer and marketer, developed and
sustained a direct advertising appeal to younger smokers --
teen-agers as young as 13.
</P>
<P>
"For years, one of our nation's biggest tobacco companies
appears to have singled out our children, carefully studying their
habits and pursuing a marketing strategy designed to prey on their
insecurities in order to get them to smoke," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Today I want to send a very different message to those who
would endanger our children: Young people are not the future of
the tobacco industry; they are the future of America," Clinton
said. "And we must take immediate, decisive action to protect
them."
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Republican-controlled Congress to take early
action on legislation he first proposed last September.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal requires development of a plan to reduce
teen-age smoking, with tough penalties for companies that don't
comply, affirm the full authority of the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
It includes measures to hold the tobacco industry accountable,
"especially for marketing tobacco to children."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua)-- Zambia's Human Rights Commission
(HRC) here today condemned the continued harassment of
journalists by police in the country, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
HBC chairperson Judge Lomber Chibesakunda was quoted as saying
that the press plays an important role in informing citizens
about their rights and freedoms, hence they should not be
hindered in the exercise of their profession.
</P>
<P>
Chibesakunda made these remarks at the launching of the first
Zambian journalists National Consultative Assembly which is aimed
at establishing a media driven Ethics and Complaints Commission
to monitor ethical violations among media practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Chibesakunda stressed that the continued harassment of
journalists would negate the positive role the press plays in
building an informed and democratic country.
</P>
<P>
She added that it is difficult for the HRC to operate without
the press as most of the abuses of the rights of citizens come
out in the press.
</P>
<P>
The HRC head described the relationship between the media and
her commission as that of partners, saying that recent skirmishes
between the police and journalists in the capital are
"deplorable".
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion earlier, Zambia's Media Liaison
Committee chairman Robby Makayi said that police's brutality
against the media should not be allowed to show its ugly head in
Zambia and should be crushed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier local reports said that police have been harassing
foreign and local journalists in covering the current
developments in Zambia, particularly the events relevant to the
detention of former president and opposition leader Kenneth
Kaunda and his on-going habeas corpus hearing in Lusaka High
Court.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Success of Washington Talks Hinges on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Saturday that the
success of U.S. President Bill Clinton's separate talks with him
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington
depends on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat said the PNA rejected
Israel's proposal on retaining large part of the Palestinian land
after its further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the hope that Clinton would press Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fulfill his commitments, which have
already been agreed upon, in a "precise and honest way."
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Clinton next Thursday following
Netanyahu's scheduled meeting with Clinton on Tuesday to discuss
ways to break the prolonged deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will present Clinton Israeli positions on the
further redeployment and guidelines on the permanent talks with
the PNA. Israeli Cabinet has adopted a document listing areas over
which Israel must keep control in the final settlement and
obligations it required the PNA to fulfill before any further
pullback can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The obligations include the PNA's waging a tougher fight
against terrorism, preventing incitement against Israel, revising
the Palestinian Charter, restricting police forces and
extraditing terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to retain vast segments of the West Bank,
including water sources, strategic roads, settlements and Jewish
holy sites. This means Israel will hand over only 40 percent of
the West Bank, far less than the 90 percent that the PNA hopes to
gain.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has already rejected the proposal and is urging the
U.S. government to press Netanyahu to agree to redeploy troop from
12 to 15 percent of West Bank in the overdue second-phase
pullback.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Clinton, Arafat is to present a list of
Israeli commitments unfulfilled and a comprehensive plan for
achieving final peace, including the idea of deploying
international peacekeepers in the so-called Israeli security zones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that Israeli Defense Minister
Yithzak Mordechai Saturday telephoned Martin Indyk, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Middle East Affairs and former U.S.
ambassador to Israel, asking him to help promote a cordial
atmosphere for the upcoming Netanyahu-Clinton summit.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said such atmosphere would help encourage the
advancement of the peace process, while preserving Israeli
security interests as laid down this week by the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousands of People Protest Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people held
demonstrations Saturday in Paris and a dozen other French cities
in protest against unemployments.
</P>
<P>
Police said 9,500 people joined the demonstration in Paris,
while organizers put at 20,000 the number of demonstrators, who
walked from the Republic Square in northcentral Paris to the
Nation Square in eastern Paris through the Bastille Square.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, led by the officials of the powerful
national union Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and
anti-unemployment associations, are obtaining support from 70
percent of the French people, according to latest polls.
</P>
<P>
They are asking for a raise of the monthly minimum social
welfare aid by 1,500 francs (250 U.S. dollars) and a social
welfare aid to the young unemployed under 25.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed are backed by the Communist Party, the Green
Party and some other parties which participate in the leftwing
majority of the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that one could smell the same
atmosphere in the streets of Paris as that of December 1995, when
French public transport workers paralyzed Paris in protesting the
social austerity plan of the former rightwing government.
</P>
<P>
The government has hinted that it could yield to the demand of
the protesters, now demonstrating in their sixth week, by revising
the law on social welfare aid this year.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Arab Tourism Company Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are considering to
set up a company to promote inter-Arab tourism, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed inter-Arab tourism company is designed to boost
tourism, work out proper steps to support Arab integration and
increase tourism revenues from Arab states.
</P>
<P>
A constituent committee under the Council of Arab Ministers of
Tourism will be set up to conduct feasibility study to form such a
company with an authorized capital of 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to establish the company was put forward during a
meeting of Arab tourism ministers on Wednesday and Thursday to
show support for Egypt after Islamic militants killed 58 foreign
tourists in the southern resort Luxor on November 17.
</P>
<P>
After the Luxor massacre, Egypt said it will have to rely more
on Arab countries, whose holiday-makers make up about 45 percent
of foreign visitors to Egypt, to make 1998 "the year of Arab
tourism."
</P>
<P>
The proposed inter-Arab tourism company will be a stock-holding
company jointly owned by Arab banks, financial institutions and
tourism companies.
</P>
<P>
It will be headquartered in a country with developed tourism
industry, such as Egypt, Tunisia or Morocco, and set up branches
in other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It will also have its own airline to provide chartered services
among Arab countries.

ADDIS ABABA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government

mission to revitalize the economy, Ethiopian Deputy Prime
Minister Kassu Ilala said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting to mark this year's Exporters' Day,

regions have decided to give priority for exporters and the
production of export items in land acquisition in rural as well
as urban centers.

the government is constructing additional universities and over
25 vocational training centers.

The government will work to its best level to help exporters
become competitive in the world market, he added.

<HEADLINE> PLO Urges Courageous Arab Stance in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Saturday appealed to Arab
nations to stand firmly behind the Palestinians and urged the
United States to put pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and courageous Arab stance as well as a clear and
unbiased U.S. position should be shown to save peace and the whole
region from tension and chaos," Farouq Kaddoumi, director of PLO
Political Department, told reporters after meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said their talks covered "everything pertaining to the
Palestinian issue and ways to confront the current peace crisis"
which has lasted for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the present stalemate in the Middle East peace
process on "Israeli intransigence and violation of all signed
agreements (with the Palestinians)."
</P>
<P>
He accused the Israeli government of "killing the peace" and
said the Palestinian side is committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said the United States as a co-sponsor of the peace
process should not be biased and should maintain the peace talks
based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the U.S. force Israel to accept the principle and
execute the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to meet with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat in Washington on Tuesday and
Thursday respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said the Palestinians reject all the maps and
suggestions made by Israel for the overdue troop pullback in the
West Bank, which he said would leave nothing for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Wednesday decided not to withdraw troops from ares of
"vital security interests" in the West Bank, including western and
eastern edges of the West Bank, areas surrounding Jerusalem,
strategic roads, settlements, military areas and water sources.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian rejection will be decisive and clear, and the
Arab world should stand strongly behind the Palestinian struggle
against Israel's intransigent anti-peace policy," Kaddoumi said.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official praised the Egyptian and Arab endorsement of
the Palestinian rights, underlining the importance of maintaining
Arab national security.

TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday voiced concern
over the slow pace of the peace process in Tajikistan and called
for a speedy implementation of the peace accord reached last June,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that Iran, as one of
guarantors of the inter-Tajik comprehensive peace accord, was
concerned about delayed implementation of the accord, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on Russia, another guarantor, to help expedite
the implementation of the accord to pave the way for the stability
in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the opportunists and those opposing the
peace accord would not find any room for further interference in
the peace process in Tajikistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Militia Claims Victory Over Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kamajor militia in Sierra
Leone has claimed a major victory in a big battle with forces of
the ruling military junta and captured the diamond rich Tongo
district southeast of the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
After three days of heavy fighting for the control of Tongo,
the junta forces withdrew from the diamond rich town they have
occupied for the past five months this afternoon, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the alleged victory mainly resulted from the cut-off
of the major highway leading to Tongo by the Kamajors, a group of
hunter militiamen who have been fighting for the restoration of
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The latest development followed a three-day visit to the
capital Freetown by a United Nations fact-finding team to assess
infrastructures for the deployment of UN military observers to
monitor the peace process in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, Francis Okello, the team leader and
the UN special envoy to Sierra Leone, called on all parties
concerned to redouble their efforts to achieve the goals of the
peace plan designed to end the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, signed last October in Conakry, Guinea,
the junta is to hand over power to Kabbah by April 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
The plan also demands immediate ceasefire, disarmament of
combatants across the country and delivery of international
relief goods.
</P>
<P>
As the disarmament and delivery of international aids have
been delayed, the junta said earlier that the April 22 deadline
has become unrealistic, plunging the peace process in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
So far no response to the UN team's visit has been heard from
the Economic Community of West African States, which demands the
junta should stick to the deadline.

<HEADLINE> 7-Up Adopts New Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A reformulated 7-Up is to be
launched soon by its British producer, Cadbury Schweppes, with the
aim of reviving the stagnant soda brand.
</P>
<P>
The new formula, with additional lemon-lime flavoring, is the
first change in the soda since it was introduced in 1929. Cadbury
Schweppes hopes the new 7-Up is expected to be on sale nationwide
by late January, according to a report of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The company is also starting a large marketing campaign,
dropping its 30-year-old slogan, "The Uncola," and adopting a
character called Slam,n Sam, who has lemon and a lime for eyes.
The aim is to appeal to 18- to 24-year-olds, the biggest consumers
of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that all this represents radical change for
7-Up, which had done little that was positive since Cadbury
Schweppes bought a stake in the Dr PeperSeven-Up company in 1986
and acquired outright ownership in 1995. The change comes after
7-Up lost big chunks of market share to Coca-Cola's Sprite. In
1997, Sprite had a 6.1 percent share of the 38 billion-U.S.-dollar
carbonated soft-drink market, as did Mountain Dew, made by
Pepsi-Cola, while 7-up had only 2.6 percent, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the new taste was not intrinsically
different but improved technology had made the lemon-lime flavor
more pronounced.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Transporters Deny Hauling Cargo to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian transporters
have refuted media reports that they were hauling cargo to
Burundi, which faces an economic embargo by several African
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chairman of the Burundi Peace Initiative,
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, they said the reports were
fabricated to vilify Tanzanian transporters.
</P>
<P>
Reports that Tanzanians were engaged in illegal haulage of
cargo to Burundi were published in the East African and Ugandan
Confidential recently.
</P>
<P>
The transporters, comprising members of Tanzanian Associations
of Owners of Trucks, Road Tankers and Buses, said they could not
have acted contrary to the embargo because of tight security
along the major routes to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Only daring drivers and adventurous transporters who risk
losing their lives and property would venture into Burundi, they
said.
</P>
<P>
If one was ready to take the risk, the troubles he had met
after crossing the border into Burundi would discourage him from
coming to the troubled country again, they contended.
</P>
<P>
The transporters say that the trucks reportedly bearing
Tanzanian registration numbers might be fake because all
Tanzanian trucks have names of their owners written on the doors
which make them easy to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The transporters have also sent several copies of the letter
to the Chief Mediator of Burundi Peace Initiative Julius Nyerere,
and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
East and central African states backed by OAU imposed
sanctions on Burundi soon after the Buyoya military junta ousted
the popularly elected government in July of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Teenage Pregnancy on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's teen-aged pregnancy has
begun to rise again after decades of decline, reaching levels not
seen since the 1970s, reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The trend represents a reversal of the sustained decline in the
pregnancy rate that had been going on for about three decades, the
reports cited Statistics Canada numbers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The results of a 20-year examination of teen pregnancy showed
that the rate has risen substantially since it reached its low
point in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Then, the rate was 41.1 pregnancies for every 1,000 women aged
15 to 19, which was a marked drop from the rate of 53.7 recorded
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The rate began to creep up since 1987. In 1994, it hit 48.8,
the highest level since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Canadian public-health officials are now forced to admit that
the country is in the midst of a full-scale reversal of the
decline, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
This has raised concerns about this phenomenon's cost to
taxpayers since many of the mothers and their children end up on
social assistance.
</P>
<P>
There is also concern over the potential of creating an
established underclass of children in the country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Tourism Earnings up 21% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned 390
million US Dollars from tourism in 1997, up 21.1 percent over the
previous year, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism.
</P>
<P>
A large chunk of Tanzania's tourism revenue comes from
wildlife viewing, the ministry's principal secretary Rose
Lugembe, told the Business Times.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's tourism revenue is expected to fall
this year due to the floods that have damaged roads to wildlife
parks, the paper quoted the official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
An administration manager with Savanna Tours, Arnold Kambona,
said the affected routes include those leading to Serengeti and
Manyara national parks, and some tour operators have refunded up
to 20 percent of their receipts due to forced cancellation of
trips.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's tourism booms in December and become even
prosperous during June and July. Torrential rains from the
beginning of last December has made tourism in most parts of
Tanzania in record slump.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania National Parks Authority and the Ngorongoro
Conservation Area Authority will soon jointly assess the degree
of the damage.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments predict the above average seasonal
rains linked to El Nino will not end until April.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the largest single earner of foreign exchange in
Tanzania, and provides about 30,000 jobs. Statistics data place
Tanzania in second place as a tourist destination in the East
African countries, with 326,000 tourist arrivals, as compared
with Kenya (700,000 tourists) and Uganda (250,000).
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanzania Tourist Board, tourist arrivals in
Tanzania rose by 10.5 percent, and receipts by 13.4 percent
during 1996, compared with the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Anthropologists Finds Human Fossils in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Anthropologists announced
that they have discovered several human fossils in Middle Awash
area, eastern part of Ethiopia that are believed to contribute
much evidence to the ongoing evolution by research.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency today,
anthropologists who gave a lecture at the national museum here
said they have found a human fossil aged over 4.4 million years
in an anthropological research they conducted for two years in
the Middle Awash area.
</P>
<P>
Berihane Assfaw, an anthropologist in the Middle Awash
research project noted that the fossil can indicate the period in
which the Homosapiens species was separated from the animal
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He said the exact age of the fossil and the fact that it is
similar with the Arkipetikes class will be proved in the future
in a laboratory test.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that another human fossil that can give
clues about the origin of Homosapiens was also discovered in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
He said the fossil was over 2.5 million years old.
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists have also managed to find a human skull aged
over 1,000,000 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
A human species called Australo Pitibis had disappeared and
been replaced by a species known as Home 1,000,000 years ago, he
said, adding that the Home species was dispersed throughout
Europe, Asia and Africa.

CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed and 25
injured Saturday in clashes between civilians and the police in
southern Egypt, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry source said that the inhabitants in the
southern resort Luxor staged a protest after the police began to
demolish their illegally-built houses near archeological sites on
the western bank of the Nile, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
They threw stones at the police, who opened fire in response,
MENA said, adding that four police officers were also injured in
the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The source said the inhabitants later thronged at a police
station, throwing stones at it and setting some cars ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The security forces managed to get the situation under control,
but the source did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Luxor, about 560 kilometers south of Cairo, is Egypt's largest
archeological city famous for its rich Pharaonic remains. Most of
its citizens depend on tourism to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians
in front of an ancient temple in Luxor on November 17, dealing a
paralyzing blow to the tourism industry, one of Egypt's main
foreign currency earners.

GUANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province in south China, is beginning to reap success
from a comprehensive program to reduce auto pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to an air quality check conducted in the city at the
end of 1997, the concentration of nitrogen and oxide was down by

The concentration of carbon monoxide stayed at the same level

sale and use of gasoline containing lead, requiring autos to
install emission-control devices and limiting auto horn noise.

The latest random check of 50,000 vehicles in the city shows

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air to Lose Routes After Switch by Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Debt-ridden Gulf Air may
lose some high-yielding routes after Qatar, one of its owners,
will drop it next month as its national carrier, the United Arab
Emirate's (UAE) Wam news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, which owns the regional carrier in equal shares with
Bahrain, Oman and the Abu Dhabi Emirate in the UAE, is set to
appoint privately-owned Qatar Airways as its official national
carrier in February, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of Asian governments prefer to deal with national
carriers of other countries in matters of traffic rights and this
means that Gulf Air may have to lose some of its high
revenue-yielding routes to Qatar Airways," Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari move, which was said to be announced "in the very
near future," would also add to the already stiff competition Gulf
Air faces from other emerging airlines in the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Airways and Oman Air have already dented some of Gulf
Air's monopoly routes like Doha-Bahrain, Muscat-Bahrain and
Doha-London.
</P>
<P>
Until the arrival of these airlines to the Gulf market two
years ago, Gulf Air had the exclusive right on these routes.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said Qatar will not withdraw its shares
in Gulf Air though it is to appoint the Qatar Airways as its
national carrier.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Manama-based Gulf Air has been struggling
with huge debts which were estimated at more than 920 million
dollars in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The debts were incurred by buying expensive wide-bodied
aircraft and opening unprofitable routes in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the regional airline sold six Boeing-747s and
closed some of the uneconomic routes as part of efforts to save
itself from the debt crisis.

CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in a trade
fair in Khartoum on February 17-28 as part of its recent moves to
upgrade trade and economic ties with Sudan, the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Chairman of the Exhibition and International
Markets Authority Mohamed al Sadad Airsa as saying that Egypt's
participation in this exhibition falls within the framework of
boosting bilateral cooperation and trade exchange between Egypt
and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian products to be on show include food, ready-made
clothes, building materials, ceramic products, pesticides,
medicines, carpets and agricultural equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Egyptian companies wishing to export to the
Sudanese markets held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss Egypt's
participation in the exhibition, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has in the past accused Sudan of supporting its Muslim
militants seeking to overthrow the secular Egyptian government and
install a purist Islamic state. It has also charged Khartoum with
sheltering gunmen trying to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Sudan denied the charges and criticized Egypt for letting
Sudan's opposition in exile operate from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors are also at odds over a border dispute, but
there have been signs of a tentative thaw in bilateral relations.

200m freestyle and 4x100m freestyle titles.
</P>
<P>
A naturalized Australian, Klim was born in Poland and raised
in India, where scorching heat first sent him diving into the
pool.
</P>
<P>
When Klim arrived in Melbourne, his swimming mates dubbed him
"Lumpy" because of the puppy fat still covering his body.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australian Grant Hackett splashed home first in the
men's 1,500m freestyle, timing 14:51.70.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old star was followed by Italian Emiliano
Brembilla and another Australian Daniel Kowalski.
</P>
<P>
Susie O'Neil also contributed a gold medal to Australia as she
led countywoman Petria Thomas to a 1-2 finish in the women's 200m
butterfly final.
</P>
<P>
O'Neil clocked 2:07.93, 1.15 seconds clear of Thomas and a
further 0.90 ahead of third-placed American Misty Hyman.
</P>
<P>
The United States snatched the other two swimming titles as
Olympic champion Amy van Dyken and Lenny Krauzelburg triumphed in
the women's 50m freestyle sprint and the men's 200m backstroke
final respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Dyken came home in 25.15 seconds, beating
silver medalist Sandra Voelker of Germany by 0.17 seconds.
Chinese Shan Ying was third in 25.36.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, a Russian-born American, timed 1:58.85 to take
the 200m backstroke final, while Germany's Ralf Braun finished
second with Canada's Mark Versfeld third.
</P>
<P>
In the diving competition, Russia swept the last two gold
medals as Dmitry Sautin and the combination of Irna Lashko and
Yulia Pakhalina won the men's platform and the women's 3m
synchronized diving respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day world championships will be remembered not only for
the birth of superstar Klim but also for these lackluster swims.
</P>
<P>
No world record was broken in the Perth Worlds, which only
witnessed eight championship marks bettered.
</P>
<P>
The United States consolidated its position as the world No. 1
power in aquatic sports, tallying 17 gold, six silver and nine
bronze medals to top the medal table.
</P>
<P>
Russia came second with a haul of 11 gold, three silver and
three bronze while Australia finished third in 7-8-10.
</P>
<P>
China placed fourth in 6-8-4.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Spain are now vying for the men's water polo
title.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls on Asian States to Build Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz has called on Asian nations to "build a system of
foreign exchange reserves in which these countries can draw upon
each other at a time of emergency."
</P>
<P>
Sartaj made the call here Sunday when he met with a six-member
delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Ma Wenpu,
deputy head of the International liaison Department of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
On the current Southeast Asian financial crisis, Sartaj said
that "many Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia
and South Korea, may have had some inefficiency in their internal
banking system, but the scale of the crisis cannot be explained
only by internal reasons."
</P>
<P>
He said that there seems to be "some international efforts to
undermine the great strength of these countries."
</P>
<P>
"I feel the Asian countries have to join forces to be able to
counter these efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to stand such pressure, these countries should not
only keep their banking and monetary system independent but also
promote more cooperation within the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a short run, we have to understand better what is
happening. But once the crisis is settled down, it would be
important to try to build a system of reserves, the Asian reserves
system, to help each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the proposed reserves system would help the Asian
countries reduce their dependence on the International Monetary
Fund and other sources in case of a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj Aziz, who is also general secretary of the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), also briefed the Chinese
guests about the long and luminous history of the PML-N and its
struggle for Pakistan's independence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PML-N, under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif,
has revived its great political traditions and now, with a
historic mandate to change, it is making all-out efforts to
translate the dreams of progress and prosperity into reality.

<HEADLINE> Henan Uses Overseas Loans for Construction Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province will direct more overseas loans to such sectors as
development of infrastructure and high technology, renovation of
old enterprises and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Overseas loans have become an important source of funding for
construction in Henan since the start of China's reform and
opening-up drive in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has signed contracts for the utilization
of overseas loans worth 2.62 billion U.S. dollars. The funds have
been used to build projects in infrastructure and raw materials,
such as the Zhengzhou International Airport and an ethylene
project.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the use of overseas loans has resulted in
the addition of three million program-controlled telephone lines
and 1.3 million kilowatts of installed power generating capacity
and the improvement of 11.4 million mu (about 760,000 hectares) of
low-yielding farmland.
</P>
<P>
At least six projects have been put on the agenda for the use
of future loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
with an estimated amount of more than 700 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> All Quake Victims Sheltered Against Bitter Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 11,000 makeshift
houses have sheltered all 44,000 victims in the area that was most
severely hit by a magnitude 6.2 earthquake Jan. 10 near
Zhangjiakou.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the houses -- composed of wood, asphalt
felt and plastic sheeting -- was completed in the Bashang area
north of Hebei Province. With a stove installed in the
20-square-meter house, the temperature indoors reaches about 10
degrees Centigrade while that outside dives to 30 degrees below
zero Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The 44,000 victims near the epicenter on the borders of
Zhangbei and Shangyi counties had been sheltered in 2,700 tents
and 600 sheds erected soon after the quake. However, a cold front
forecast to hit the area today made the camps and sheds inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 14 local farmers and more than 5,000 People's
Liberation Army soldiers have built the 11,000 simply equipped
houses, providing temporary homes for the 44,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 32 carriages of donated cotton-padded
clothes, quilts, tents, food and medicine and 103 carriages of
wood and asphalt felt have been transported to quake-affected
areas in Zhangbei, Shangyi, Kangbao and Wangquan counties.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake struck an area of more than 2,000 square
kilometers, affecting 471,000 people in 37 townships and 1,824
villages in the four counties.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province is taking the lead in the country's anti-drug trafficking
campaign by seizing 80 percent of the country's drug total each
year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the province last year confiscated
4,073.2 kilograms of heroin, up 51.8 percent over 1996, and
1,132.5 kilograms of opium, up 49.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed their achievement to the continuing
crackdown by the Chinese government and the campaign launched by
the province later in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The huge benefits and immense consumption market have caused an
increasing number of drug trafficking cases, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has spent 1.5 million yuan on the
anti-drug campaign. In addition, a 24-hour hot line has been
opened for tips from citizens.
</P>
<P>
To combat the spread of illicit drugs into China, police
checkpoints are closely examining vans and lorries.
</P>
<P>
Official sources show that police stopped a lorry trying to
cross the border in May and confiscated 230 kilograms of heroin
hidden in the fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
Border police and customs investigators in the province
uncovered a record 68 drug-trafficking cases last year, taking
into custody 8,000 suspected smugglers who were either sent to
prison or sentenced according to Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
Drug addicts are becoming a problem in Yunnan province.
According to official 1997 figures, 77.5 percent of the 8,277
reported cases of HIV/AIDS are drug users.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to enforce its policy of cracking down on
drug-related crimes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
China also intensified its drug education campaigns to increase
public awareness against the dangers of drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 18 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam's steel industry is
plagued by an increased production and a sluggish demand, Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam produced 981,000 tons of steel in 1997, a 14 percent
increase over 1996's output.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Vietnam Steel Corporation (VNSC) imported 80
million U.S. dollars worth of steel ingots, sheet steel and
specific-purpose steel while its export stood at 3.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
VNSC general director Ho Nghia Dung said that a large volume of
steel is lying in stock because of the stagnancy of big
infrastructure projects short of funds.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 170,000-200,000 tons of imported steel are also in
stock.
</P>
<P>
Steel factories, particularly joint ventures, are operating at
50-60 percent of their capacities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Vietnam's steel demand is estimated to be 2.35
million tons by 2000 and 6.38 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
From now to the year 2000, Vietnam's steel sector will focus on
solving the imbalance between its metallurgical and rolling
branches and giving priority to building steel ingot plants to
supply materials for local steel rolling mills.

<HEADLINE> 5 Indonesian Private Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Five private banks in Indonesia
have decided to merge into one in a bid to strengthen their
operation capacity, according to a press release available here
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Understanding on the merger was signed on
Saturday by the five banks, and the merger will officially take
place as soon as approvals are obtained from Bank Indonesia, the
central bank, the press release issued by Bank International
Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
The five banks are PT. Bank International Indonesia (BII), PT.
Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia (BDNI), PT. Bank Tiara Asia, PT.
Bank Sahid Gajah Perkasa (SGP) and PT. Bank Dewa Rutji (BDR).
</P>
<P>
The merged bank will have total assets of 50 trillion rupiah
(one U.S. dollar equals about 7,000 rupiah), total equity of 5
trillion rupiah, and will retain the name of Bank International
Indonesia, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The merger was undertaken in compliance with the government's
guidelines to accelerate reforms in the banking sector in order to
cope with the increasing globalization of financial services.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the Indonesian government
closed 16 insolvent private banks in a bid to make the banking
sector more healthy.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, the government also announced a plan to merge
four state banks into one and provide foreign banks of
international reputation with the opportunity to become
shareholding partners.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the merger of these five private banks
will establish a more competitive bank with a larger asset,
stronger capital base and improved liquidity in order to serve a
bigger customer base through an expanded branch network.
</P>
<P>
It will also achieve higher growth through synergy and improved
cost efficiency as well as broaden the bank's ownership and
increase its shareholder value over the medium to a long term.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has about 200 private banks and about 50 percent of
them are regarded as unhealthy banks with various financial
problems.

<HEADLINE> Macao To Start Satellite TV Within One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A satellite TV service is
expected to be launched within a year in Macao as the Universe
Satellite Television Company has been granted the right by the
Macao government.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Sunday by the Information Office of the
government said that the Universe company has won approval of the
right to provide satellite television service for 15 years in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release to be published on the
Government Gazette Monday, the satellite TV company will be
allowed to open six different channels. Macao now has only two
channels, one Chinese and one Portuguese, run by the Macao
Broadcast and Television Station.
</P>
<P>
The Macao-based Universe Satellite Television Company was
co-founded with capital from Macao, China's inland, Portugal and
Hong Kong. The registered capital totals 30 million patacas (about
3.75 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The press release said the company must start operation within
a year.
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing a satellite television service was
first discussed in 1993. The Universe company said in early 1996
that its planned project, which includes satellite television
service, a satellite ground station and the cable TV service, will
cost more than one billion Hong Kong dollars (about 129 million
US dollars).

Tongofield after a bloody battle with troops loyal to the
military government, said reports reaching here today.

but the government troops defending the town said there were
close to 1,000, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, finally, the Kamajors overpowered our troops and
drove them out of town, but skirmishes are still going on the
outskirts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Milton said army reinforcements were being sent from various
towns with orders to "take back Tongofield at any cost".
</P>
<P>
He said there had been "three days of bitter fighting" for the
town and that both sides had suffered many casualties.

taken to the eastern capital of Kenema, around 20 km away. they
said about 20 bodies had been brought from Tongofield, a figure
confirmed by hospital workers who said most of these seemed to be
civilians.

<P>
The Kamajor oppose the junta that toppled President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah in May 1997 and have launched repeated attacks
against the Sierra Leonean army and former rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who rallied to the coup.
</P>
<P>
Tongofield, which is Sierra Leone's second biggest diamond
town after Koidu, has been heavily guarded by troops since the

<HEADLINE> Tight Budget Expected For Singapore in 1998: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday that he expects this
year's budget for the government to be a tight one because
revenues would be less buoyant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local reporters after a community function marking
the upcoming Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new year, Lee said
the Finance Ministry has been discussing with other ministries to
see if they can scale down, defer or put off non-essential
projects which are going to be costly if allowed to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The projects included schools and computers for education, the
multi-billion-dollar new subway line project, and the reclamation
of the Jurong Island in the western part of Singapore to develop
the petroleum and petrochemical industries.
</P>
<P>
Asked how different the current economic problems are compared
with the 1985 recession, the Deputy Prime Minister said it is a
regional problem this time, more severe than the one 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that internally, the Singapore economy was
in better shape than it was in 1985, when costs were high and the
country was having an internal slowdown. Singapore was in a strong
competitive position now, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the region was facing a serious
predicament and it would take quite a long time to sort it out.
The problem is not just a cyclical one of businesses going down
and up. It is one of confidence and viability of banking and
financial systems, he explained.
</P>
<P>
When the financial system goes wrong, it is very hard to put it
back again and when the financial system is not right, it is very
difficult to get the rest of the economy right, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Police Confirm Iraqis Stabbed to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police confirmed on
Sunday that seven Iraqis, including charge d'affaires at the Iraqi
Embassy here and his wife, and an Egyptian, were stabbed to death
Saturday night in the capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, identified as Hikmet Al-Hijo, was the second in
command at the Iraqi Embassy and had been serving here for three
years, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The other five Iraqis were businessmen living in Amman and the
Egyptian was believed to be the bodyguard of the diplomat, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
The official Radio Jordan quoted a police source as saying that
an unidentified woman, who was injured, but survived the
assassination, said that the murders were carried out by four or
five men speaking with Iraqi accent.
</P>
<P>
No further details are available about the murder, the second
on Iraqi diplomats in a little more than two week's time. There
was no claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Last week two Iraqis were charged here with attempted murder
and nine others with complicity in the assassination attempt on
Rahim Taher, commercial councillor at the Iraqi Embassy on January
3.
</P>
<P>
They shot at the diplomat while he was starting his car in
front of his residence for work. The bullet missed him and his
son, but hit his car.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were confirmed to belong to one family,
and said they wanted to kill the diplomat because of "family and
financial disputes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday the Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement,
strongly condemning Saturday's assassination and asking the
Jordanian government to begin immediate investigation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also decided to send two officials to Amman to
help probe into the murder.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries deteriorated after Iraq
executed four Jordanians on charges of smuggling car parts into
Iraq on December 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordan recalled its charge d'affaires from Baghdad and
expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
However, ties improved a little bit in late December when Iraq
agreed to renew a contract to sell oil to Jordan at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Jordan used to be siding with Iraq before and during the Gulf
War. But after that, Jordan began to distance itself from Iraq in
order to end international alienation.
</P>
<P>
Normal ties have been maintained over the past years, as Iraq
provided Jordan with free or cut-rates crude oil and Jordan
exports food and medicine to Iraq under the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal.

<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China exported 34 aircraft to a
dozen countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Kenya in 1997,
according to sources from the China National Aero-Technology
Import and Export Corp.
</P>
<P>
The exports involve Yun-12, Yun-7 and Yun-8 airliners, as well
as aircraft for military use such as the K8 and FT-7.
</P>
<P>
The total imports and exports of the corporation surpassed 1.5
billion U.S. dollars last year, with exports reaching roughly 680
million U.S. dollars and imports reaching about 820 million
U.S. dollars, basically fulfilling the target set for 1997, said
Lou Shuirong, a corporate official.
</P>
<P>
Lou vows to continuously expand the export market of aviation
products so as to "put forward more China-made aircraft to Third
World countries in a faster and better manner." He said the export
of products for civilian use will be emphasized.

<HEADLINE> SMC Deal to Ease Philippine Currency Crisis: Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's plan
to allow First Pacific Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong to buy 35 percent of
San Miguel Corporation (SMC) is expected to boost the country's
dwindling foreign exchange reserves by 1.8 billion U.S. dollars,
Senator Ernesto Herrera said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the massive dollar infusion, plus the estimated 50
billion peso income government stands to realize from the buy-in,
is the main reason why President Fidel Ramos is pushing for the
deal," said Herrera, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
"My sources in the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the Central
Bank of the Philippines) informed me that the deal is so big it
could cause a sudden appreciation of the peso against the dollar
and burn speculators in the process," Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
Herrera said his sources told him that 100 percent of the 1.8
billion dollars which would be used by the First Pacific for the
purchase of the SMC shares would be sourced offshore.
</P>
<P>
"That's understandable. There's no way anyone can raise that
kind of money, whether in dollars or in pesos, from within the
country at this time," Herrera added.
</P>
<P>
The First Pacific Co. Ltd said on January 11 that it now owned
a two percent interest in San Miguel, the largest food and beer
conglomerate in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, and was
negotiating to further acquire a "substantial strategic
investment" in SMC.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, President Ramos confirmed that he had
authorized the Philippine Commission for Good Government to
negotiate the sale under its sequestration.
</P>
<P>
While the state collectively controls 60 percent of SMC, the
First Pacific Co. Ltd has signified interest to buy a 35 percent
stake in the food and beer giant.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Abolishes Foreign Exchange Cash Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- South African bankers
welcomed Friday's announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it was
abolishing with immediate effect cash holding limits for authorized
foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the announcement, South African banks with foreign
exchange licences were allowed to hold an aggregate of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
For now, there will be no restriction on such foreign exchange
holdings although institutions will still be subject to the usual
prudent restraints regarding the purpose and placement of foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
The latest government decision on foreign exchange is seen as a
step towards the further relaxation of South African exchange
controls.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that there are a number of sound
business reasons for the decision.
</P>
<P>
Local banks need to hold foreign currency offshore to facilitate
day-to-day transactions for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
With South Africa's re-emergency onto the world stage, it is
essential that local banks are able to compete on the same terms as
their international competitiors. The removal of the cash holding
limit levels the playing field, they said.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the South African Finance Ministry announced to
allow individuals to invest 200,000 Rand (about 40,000 U.S. Dollars)
abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy remains
the strongest in Southeast Asia due mainly to the government's
efficient management, according to U.S. Export-Import Bank
President James Harmo.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here Sunday, the Presidential
Office cited Harmo as saying that he was confident in the
Philippine economy and in the country's ability to weather the
current regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the U.S. banker made the assessment during
a recent call on Philippine President Fidel Ramos in Manila.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite impressed with the Ramos government doing the right
steps, especially in the management of foreign exchange," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, he said, no financial institution has
keeled over as a result of the currency crisis, and the country's
financial system remains sound and stable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis which had hit Southeast Asian nations since
last July, the Philippines' gross national product (GNP) grew by 6
percent in the first three quarters of 1997. The country's gross
domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.2 percent, with the service
sector leading the way with a 6.1 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly inflation rate in the Philippines last year
increased by 5.1 percent, still lower than the 8.4 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic outlook, "Asianomic Infofax," Credit
Lyonnais Securities Asia said that the Philippines is "the country
most likely to emerge from the current difficulties in Southeast
Asia."

<HEADLINE> Jumbo Aircraft Abandoned at Namibia's Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A Russian-built
Iluyshin-76 transport plant has been standing abandoned at the
Windhoek international airport since October 24 last year
following the disappearance of its captain and crew.
</P>
<P>
The plane has parked on the airport apron more than 80 days,
and nobody inquired about it, South African Press Association
today quoted the Windhoek Observer weekly newspaper as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the aircraft was a captain Alexander, who
soon after arrival in October, booked into the Safari Hotel in
Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Alexander apparently stayed in the hotel until December 17
when he paid his bill and left, and he never returned to the
plane, said the report. There has also been no trace of any of
the plane's crew, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Ilyushin-76 is one of the largest inter-continental
transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The abandoned aircraft appeared to belong to a South African
company, but this could not be confirmed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Windhoek airport management has asked the police to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the abandonment of the
plane.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan security forces
deployed in the north are being taught the Tamil language by
instructors of the Official Languages Department, the country's
national news agency, Lankapuvath, reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a total of 100 soldiers have gained
proficiency in the language of the minority Tamil people. Courses
are conducted for more soldiers now.
</P>
<P>
These courses were initiated by Army Commander in Jaffna Major

hearts and minds of the people in the north, where Tamil people
make the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who have undergone the courses say they are now able
to have easier dialogues with the Tamils. By speaking the Tamil
language, the soldiers can also have a deeper understanding of the
problems of the Tamil people in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that each member of the security forces who passed
Tamil language proficiency tests was paid an allowance of 300
Rupees (about 5 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Greek Terrorist Group Claims Responsibility for Arson Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The "May 15", an urban terrorist
group in Greece, Sunday claimed responsibility for the Saturday
night arson attack on a branch of the National Bank of Greece in
central Athens.
</P>
<P>
The midnight fire reportedly caused property losses to the bank.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified caller told the private "Skai" radio station
that they made the attack as a show of solidarity with the
newly-arrested terrorist, Nikos Maziotis, who is now facing
charges related to other terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Nikos Maziotis, 27, has been charged with possession of illegal
weapons, construction of explosives and attempting to set a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Greek police believe that Maziotis is the ringleader of the
group "Anarchist Urban Guerrillas," which had claimed itself
responsible for an abortive bomb attack at the Ministry of
Development last December.
</P>
<P>
Police are also investigating the possibility of Maziotis'
connection with the "Militant Guerrilla Formation," which is
suspected to be responsible for several bomb attacks since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In separate incidents Saturday night, petrol bombs were thrown
at a newspaper delivery truck parked on Evelpidon street, Kypseli
and at the entrance of a fashion design school near the Omonia
square.

NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of

4.83 percent the week before, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, based on wholesale price index (WPI), has been
shooting up in the past few weeks mainly on account of a sharp

2.2 percent in the last eight weeks since it touched an 11-year
low of 3.20 percent on November 8, 1997.
</P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
developed an anti-ship missile defense system to track an incoming
missile quickly, Defense Ministry Sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new defense system does not have the drawbacks of the
conventional systems and can save valuable seconds with more
precision, said researchers at a recently-held international
conference on cognitive systems here.
</P>
<P>
The new technology is based on "neuro-fuzzy" computer logic
which improves the prophetic qualities of a computer by learning
from experience.
</P>
<P>
The infra-red senser of the new system is able to search the
beacons arising from incoming missile in spite of the radiation
noises emanating from sun and other natural objects.

ABU DHABI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The workforce in the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states reached 5.5 million in 1996,
according to an official report available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 annual report, the GCC secretariat said that the
figure was almost the same level as it was before a wave of
expulsion of hundreds of thousands of foreign workers by the GCC
countries following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of that labor are foreigners and they are mainly
from Asian countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The workforce in the six GCC states, which include Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates,
was estimated at 5.84 million in 1990, however, it dropped to
4.96 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report gave no reason for the decline in 1991, but
following the Gulf War that year, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
expelled hundreds of thousands of expatriate workers from
countries deemed to have been sympathetic to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during the war.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait expelled more than 400,000 Palestinians and other

all-party group, including senior Conservatives, which would
launch a pro-European crusade in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Oxford University has delivered a snub to British
Prime Minister Tony Blair by refusing to award him an
honorary degree. Blair's name was considered by the
university's honorary degrees committee but his name was
not recommended to the university's parliament because the
+timing+ was wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- America's former ambassador to London has accused the
White House of leaking British secrets to the Irish
Republican Army in a disclosure which lays bare the extent
of the diplomatic row over President Bill Clinton's
attitude to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Independent On Sunday:

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Petroleum Prices Further Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's petroleum prices
rose further by 1,217 won (about 80 U.S. cents) per liter, up 82
won from zero hour Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second oil price rise this month.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's fuel prices will be completely liberalized from
next month as the final stage of deregulation, and oil companies
will be free to adjust their prices at any time without informing
the government as they previously did.
</P>
<P>
The nation began to loosen its control over oil prices in 1994
and has since gradually widened the scope of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
The complete deregulation also means that oil companies will be
able to offer whatever price they think fit, opening an era of
competition in the marketing of gasoline and other fuels.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which is in desperate need of foreign currency to
overcome its current financial crisis, entirely depends on oil
imports to meet fuel demand.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Calls for Observing Quota for Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has appealed
to Islamic countries to stick to their quotas as regards to
pilgrims to the holy city of Mecca and Medineh in the Kingdom
during the forthcoming Hajj season.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency monitored here reported Sunday that the
appeal was made during a meeting Saturday night between Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and ambassadors of Islamic
countries to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince was quoted as saying that sticking to the
one-per-thousand quota for each country would make it easier for
his country to provide better services for pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The quota was endorsed during a meeting of Islamic foreign
ministers in Jordan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 2 million Islamic pilgrims swarmed to Saudi
Arabia from various parts of the world to pay their annual Hajj
pilgrimages to Mecca and Madina in the last month of Islamic
calendar.
</P>
<P>
Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam. The journey to Mecca is
obligatory for every Muslim, male or female, who is fit and
financially able to bear the costs.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities usually start to prepare for the Islamic
holy season several months ahead to provide accommodations and
other services for the pilgrims and take security measures to
guard against any incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government announced earlier this month to ban the
use of gas cylinder by pilgrims during the season to prevent a
similar fire incident of last year that claimed the lives of
hundreds of people.

<P>
PERTH, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Irina Lashko, winner of the
women's 3-meter springboard on Saturday, combined with 1m
springboard gold medalist Yulia Pakhalina to win the 3m
synchronized diving final at the world swimming championships here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian duo, who have been pairing up for just two weeks,
nipped their Chinese rivals in the five-outing final for the
winning total of 282.30 points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Rao Lang and Li Rongjuan posted 276.18 points for the
silver medal while the American pair of Kathy Pesek and Tracy
Bonner got the bronze with 263.91.
</P>
<P>
"When Yulia and I started training together only two weeks ago
it was just good fun - but as we went on, we became very serious,"
said Lashko, 1996 Olympic silver medalist in the 3m springboard.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to become a team in such a short time, but we
did it. Whether or not you can work together comes down to feeling
- just feeling," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair led over Rao and Li by nearly eight points
coming into the final dive, in which the Chinese scored 65.70
against the Russians' 63.84, not enough to overcome the gap.

<HEADLINE> China's Integration into World Economy Beneficial to All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, January 17 (xinhua) -- China's integration into the
world economy is beneficial not only to itself, but also to the
rest of the world, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Long Yongtu said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the one-day conference on "China's Integration into
the World Economy," Long said the process for China to integrate
into the world economy has gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
The basic condition for it is China's steadfast implementation
of reform and opening-up policies, Long continued.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal of China's economic reform is to build up a
socialist market economy, which will ensure that the operational
systems of the economy in China and the world will be established
on the common basis of market economy, and that the process of
China's integration into the world economy will be irreversible.
</P>
<P>
China's continuing implementation of the opening-up policy will
turn it into a growingly important partner in the world trade and
investment market, and its integration into the world economy will
benefit other countries because of its economic strength and
market potential, Long said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China needs a favorable external environment
for the integration, which depends on the country's close
cooperation with the rest of the world, especially with its major
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
China is committed to abiding by common international rules and
gradually opening up its market, but that is not the goal by
itself, Long said. The goal is to establish a trade and economic
relationship on a long-standing and constructive basis, which
will ensure concrete economic and trade benefits for all the
parties.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of a series with similar topics, drew
some 200 attendants and dealt with questions such as challenges
from the new global prosperity and China's changing comparative
advantages.

<HEADLINE> 62 Processing Zone Projects Approved in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Export Processing
Zone Authority has approved 62 projects worth about 80 million
U.S. Dollars over the past year, Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 62 projects approved, 22 are already operational
and created over 5,000 jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although the remaining 40 projects were awaiting clearance
from concerned government departments, it is estimated that a
further 6,000 jobs will be created once they are approved later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The authority's Chairman Elias Ngugama and General Manager
Walter Chidhakwa Made the statements in a joint interviews with
the paper.
</P>
<P>
They said a lot could have been achieved if all systems were
responding quickly to the investment drive initiative.
</P>
<P>
Ngugama said that the time that it is taking for programs to
be implemented is so long that sometimes business is being lost
because some investors felt that they were better off investing
in other countries which had the same program than waste time
waiting.
</P>
<P>
''A lot must be done by all other players to ensure that
business is not unnecessarily lost. Although our investment
incentive is very attractive everyone must be aware of the fact
that there are other players entering the market in the region
who have perhaps better packages,'' said Ngugama.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zimbabwe had one of the best infrastructure and
human resource bases in the region which is a good motivation for
investors. However, the slow rate of making decisions tended to
dampen the whole initiative, he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Have Modest Rise in Spending:  Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is likely to
have higher economic growth and lower inflation, which should
boost private consumption expenditure in 1998, according to a
latest survey whose results available here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau for Market Research at University of South Africa,
which conducted the survey, predicted that modest increases in
salaries, disposable income and relatively high consumer debt,
"will give rise to a real increase of only 1.8 percent in private
consumption expenditure".
</P>
<P>
Beside, the bureau also expects the formal economy to increase
its market share relative to the informal sector. All of these
economic factors as well as lower interest rates, are expected to
give rise to higher formal retail sales.
</P>
<P>
The bureau forecasts South Africa's GDP growth of 2.2 percent
in 1998 against 1.8 percent in 1997, and expects El Nino weather
phenomenon to take its toll on the agricultural sector, whose GDP
will drop by 4.7 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
In non-agricultural sectors, however, GDP will grow by about
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also expects moderate increases in retail purchases
on the back of the limited growth potential of formal employment
opportunities, higher consumer indebtedness and an expected 1.9
percent real increase in salaries.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Says Security in Jaffna Satisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Army Commander in
Jaffna, Maj. Gen. Lionel Balagalle, said Sunday that with 11 days
to go before the local government elections there, the security
situation in the north is "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
The commander said Tamil political parties, which are in the
election fray, are conducting themselves properly without allowing
any room for violence.
</P>
<P>
Balagalle has issued a stern warning to all political parties
that the army would have to disarm the parties, which are allowed
to carry weapons for self-defense, if they do not behave properly.
</P>
<P>
Apart from petty complaints and counter complaints, Tamil
parties were extremely cooperative with the security forces,
Balagalle said.
</P>
<P>
Additional police forces have been brought in from the south to
strengthen security in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts, where
polls will be held on January 29.
</P>
<P>
In some isolated incidents in the region recently, rebels of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam threw grenades, put up their
own posters and made threats on candidates. But no major incidents
had been reported, according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
Both the police forces and the army are on high alert to
prevent any sabotages from the rebels, the commander said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Gong Zhichao overwhelmed the
world champion Ye Zhaoying to win the women's singles title at the
Yonex Japan Open badminton tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gong, who lost to Ye in the finals of the world championships
and the prestigious All-England last season, gained sweet revenge
with a splendid 11-1, 11-4 win over her Chinese compatriot.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that I defeated her in two games. I was able to
concentrate really well and play consistently without making
errors," said 20-year-old Gong.
</P>
<P>
"I knew that she (Ye) would hit the shuttle behind me to keep
me to the baseline, so I had to use underhand cross-court shots
at the net and it worked really well today," Gong added.
</P>
<P>
Ye only lamented: "I have nothing to say about the match."
</P>
<P>
It was Gong's fifth major title, which carries the winner's
check of 10,000 dollars, following her wins at the Asian
championships and Danish Open in 1996, and the Swedish and Chinese
Open last year.
</P>
<P>
In another all-Chinese women's doubles final, world champions
Gu Jun and Ge Fei defended their trophy to win 12,000 dollars
with ease thanks to the withdrawal of Tang Yongshu and Qin Yiyuan
with Qin having a fever.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles title went to the second-seeded South Korean
pair of Kim Dong-Moon and Ra Kyung-Min, who edged the top-seeded
Danish pair of Jens Eriksen and Marlene Thomsen 15-12, 15-9.

KATHMANDU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 3.8 million children
under the age of five throughout Nepal will be administered polio
drops on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As people go to work on Sundays, the government has decided to
close all the offices in the country except the central level ones
to make the National Vaccination Day a success.
</P>
<P>
On December 7, 1997, some 3.6 million children under the age of
five across the Himalayan kingdom were vaccinated against polio, a
disease which cripples children.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is the only country after Yemen in the world which has
yet to complete the polio immunization.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to eradicating polio from the
country by the year 2000 as called upon by the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the first national immunization program was
launched in 1996 with about 3.7 million children vaccinated.

BANGKOK -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said his country
can't beg others to come and help the way it wants, the Nation
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Nakhon Ratchasima, about 260
km northeast of Bangkok, Chuan said Thais should not take it for
granted that countries like the United States are going to step in
and bail Thailand out of its predicament, he said. The Thai
public, government officials, senators and the media have
expressed disappointment at the United States' failure to make a
direct financial contribution to help Thailand, even though
U.S. officials refer to Thailand as "an old and important ally."

PRAGUE -- The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary should further
step up military cooperation while readying themselves for joining
NATO, the top Czech soldier said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Their working together, said Jiri Nekovasil, General Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces, after meeting his Polish and Hungarian
counterparts Henryk Szumski and Vegh Ferenc, is all
necessary. During their talks, as reported by the Czech press, the
military leaders agreed that the armed forces of the three
would-be NATO members should be partners rather than competitors.

ROME -- A magnitude-4.1 earthquake jolted Sicily on Saturday,
and civil protection authorities reported no casualties and
serious damage.
</P>
<P>
The National Geophysics Institute in Rome said the epicenter of
the quake was in the sea off northwest Sicily. The tremor hit the
region, including its capital city of Palermo, at a time when the
two volcanos, Etna and Stromboli, were in an apparently unrelated
phase of violent activity. (Italy-Earthquake)

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Significant progress is being
made in the development of Myanmar's Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone,
regarded as the most successful one out of the five of its kind
established in the capital in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At least 142 mills and factories are under construction and 32
have gone into production in the 453-hectare zone, located in the
northwest of Yangon, according to a latest official report.
</P>
<P>
The Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone became the third
foreign-invested one after Thailand's Rojana Industrial Park Co
Ltd joined last April, pouring in 14 million U.S. dollars for the
infrastructure and development cost and using a 182-hectare land
area contributed by the Myanmar side.
</P>
<P>
The zone was initially developed by local entrepreneurs,
setting up such industries as food processing, textile,
engineering, electrical goods, chemical, forest products and
animal foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The development of the zone was later joined by multi-national
foreign firms including those from Britain, France, Japan,
Singapore and Thailand, as well as by Myanmar-foreign joint
ventures, leasing land in the zone and running dairy products,
galvanized iron sheet, and sanitary and garment factories.
</P>
<P>
Due to improvement of infrastructure in the zone, local
developers are applying for more industrial land, and at the same
time attracting more foreign entrepreneurs to invest in
export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
The other two foreign-invested industrial zones in the capital
are Mingaladon and Thanlyin-Kyauktan, which are being developed by
Japan's Mitsui and by Singapore's Sinmardev and Malaysia's Genting
Sayen Berhad respectively. The remaining two are wholly
local-invested.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Achievements Highly Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, January 17 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 200 government officials
and economists from China, the United States and Australia Saturday
spoke highly of the tremendous development of China's economy and
foreign trade since the country adopted the reform and opening-up
policy in late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
They were speaking at the one-day conference on China's
integration into the world economy, which was sponsored by the
United Nations Development Program and the Harvard Institute for
International Development (HIID).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, HIID Director Jeffrey Sachs
described China's integration into the world economy as a "great
breakthrough" in the development of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the average annual growth rate of some 13.5
percent in the period of 1980-1996, China's foreign trade played a
leading role in national economic development.
</P>
<P>
"It's also overwhelmingly positive to the world economy," the
director stressed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that remaining obstacles would be removed so that
China could become an official member of the World Trade
Organization at an earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Trade imbalance between China and the U.S. was the main topic
of the conference. Many participants said that they believed the
problem "is being played up without restraint" by some
U.S. interest groups, which are using highly overestimated
American trade deficits to create a misconception as if the
deficits were primarily deriving from closed Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Analizing the American statistics issued by the U.S. Census
Bureau, some Chinese economists said that the so-called trade
imbalance between the two countries is far from the realities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Merchandise deficit was reportedly less
than 20 billion U.S. dollars, not 39.5 billion dollars as the
bureau reported, Nicholas Lardy, a U.S. Brookings Institution
Senior Fellow, said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American economists said that they hope the
long-standing problem of the bilateral trade imbalance will be
resolved through better cooperation and more efforts by the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
The Boston conference was the first of a series of discussions
on China's integration into the world economy. The officials and
economists are going to Washington, San Francisco and Hawaii for
the same meeting next week.

<HEADLINE> Good Grain Harvest Reported In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei Province
harvested 27.46 million tons of grain last year, for the fourth
consecutive year of annual grain harvests above 25 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the increased grain output to efforts to
maintain the amount of acreage in grain and to increase per unit
yields.
</P>
<P>
Greater spending on agriculture was another reason for Hebei's
good harvest with more than five billion yuan having been spent
on water conservation projects in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Effort was also made to increase the use of new farming
techniques and to raise the technology level of farming.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cannot Beg for Help: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Thailand can't beg others to come and help the way it wants,
the Nation newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Nakhon Ratchasima, about 260
km northeast of Bangkok, Chuan said Thais should not take it for
granted that countries like the United States are going to step in
and bail Thailand out of its predicament, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries have their own priorities," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is appreciative of help extended to
Thailand by other countries and international organizations like
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which brokered a 17.2
billion US dollar bailout program for Thailand last August.
</P>
<P>
The Thai public, government officials, senators and the media
have expressed disappointment at the United States' failure to
make a direct financial contribution to help Thailand, even though
U.S. officials refer to Thailand as "an old and important ally."
</P>
<P>
During the past week, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth and
Defense Secretary William Cohen visited Thailand, but none of them
were committal to making financial assistance for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said the American visitors seemed to be only
concerned that American interests in Thailand and the region are
not harmed by the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Former Thai foreign minister Thanat Khoman said Saturday that
the reason behind the U.S. about-face attitude towards offering
help to Thailand is that it wants to protect its own economy.
</P>
<P>
He said many Thais could not understand why the U.S. failed to
help Thailand when it is struggling economically.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Washington attributes Thailand's economic
difficulties to failure of national financial policy,
mismanagement of private banking and finance companies,
incompetence and corruption of government officials.

<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Margherita Parini won her
first snowboard World Cup giant slalom of the season on Saturday
in San Candido, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Parini, who led by 0.16 seconds in the first run, extended her
lead to 4.34 seconds with her excellent second run to win the race
with a combined time of two minutes, 54.92 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Italian Dagmar Mair Unter Der Eggen was second in 2:59.26,
while France's Isabelle Blanc third in 2:59.38.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Yoshikawa became the first Japanese women world cup

</P>
<P>
In the men's halfpipe, Norwegian Roger Hjelmstadstuen took the
victory with 81.3 points, 2.4 ahead of compatriot Kim Christiansen
and another 0.3 of Sweden's Frefrik Sterner.
</P>
<P>
France's Karin Ruby was a disappointing 11th, but could keep

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Parliament members backing
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic elected Milorad Dodik as
prime minister on Sunday in the absence of opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Dodik, 47, leader of the Independent Social Democratic Party,
a small party with only two seats in the Bosnia Serb legislature,
was nominated by Plavsic after an earlier nominee was rejected.
</P>
<P>
He was supported by four parties: the Serb People's Alliance of
Plavsic with 15 seats, the Socialist Party with nine seats; and
two parties based in the Moslem-Croat Federation, the other half
of post-war Bosnia, with a total of 18 seats.
</P>
<P>
The group of 42 deputies voted for Dodik at the end of an
11-hour fruitless session, said media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
They also voted for the 20-member cabinet proposed by Dodik.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Serb Democratic Party and the Radical Party
walked out of the session before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Republika Srpska remains effectively split with two centers
of power: one grouped around Plavsic in Banja Luka, the other in
the regional capital of Pale.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic has the support of the West for her efforts to
implement the 1995 Dayton peace accords.

<HEADLINE> Exports Face Slower Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The growth of foreign trade,
one of the main engines of China's economic growth, will slacken in
1998, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for China to hit the official target for foreign
trade volume, but the growth rate will be lower than last year's
12.1 percent, the paper quoted a report by the editorial committee
of China's White Paper on Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons is the slowdown in the global economy,
leading to decreasing demand in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Another important reason for the sluggish growth is the
financial turmoil in neighboring countries, which will continue
to have a considerable impact on China's external commerce, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The most influential internal factor is that enterprises will
display less initiative in tapping the international market as the
reforms of most state enterprises will be in their most difficult
and crucial stage this year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the "appropriately tight" macroeconomic control
policy will to some extent limit the development of outward
investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the country's foreign trade will be bolstered by
reduced tariffs and more rapid reforms of its foreign trade
system, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year was the 19th consecutive year China's foreign trade
sector has achieved a high growth rate. But the rapid growth was a
"recovery phenomenon" on the back of the lackluster performance
in 1996, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Airlines' Possible Order Delays Trouble Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Some financially-strapped
Asian airlines may delay Boeing jetliner orders, and the delays
would greatly hurt the Seattle-based manufacturer, aerospace
analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines reportedly is negotiating to cancel
delivery of four Boeing 747-400s. Malaysia Airlines is planning to
delay delivery of 20 Boeing jetliners by up to five years.
Uncertainty also appears to cloud orders from South Korea's Korean
Air Lines and Asiana as well as Garuda of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said other airlines may delay orders rather than
cancel them, but the situation could become worse if the deferrals
or cancellations stretch out into the next century or too many
occur at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said last month that up to 60 deliveries might be
delayed over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 52 percent of Boeing 777 orders and 48 percent of
its 747 orders, its largest and most expensive jets, were from
Asian carriers, aerospace analysts estimated.
</P>
<P>
So far Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong has dropped options for 16
Boeing and nine Airbus airplanes, although it still plans to take
delivery of four Boeing jets this year and three in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, China's orders are not considered in
jeopardy, and two Japanese airlines which have substantial orders
with Boeing, namely Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, seem to
be in a strong financial position. Singapore Airlines also
reportedly has no plans to change its schedule of eight 777s and
one 747 to be delivered in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said deferrals are not all bad and may in a
way help Boeing with a crowded production line. This year 550
Boeing airplanes are scheduled for delivery worldwide, up from 375
last year. But the manufacturer's profit has been under pressure
due to costly production delays.

<HEADLINE> Poland: Stamps to Mark Discovery of Polonium, Radium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Polish woman of world renown,
Marie Curie will appear again on Polish stamps to commemorate her
discovery of two radioactive elements 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
One of the two elements, known as polonium, was specifically
named at the time to honor Marie's home country.
</P>
<P>
And as polonium, the other radioactive element, later named
radium, was also Marie's joint discovery with her husband Pierre
Curie, a French physicist and chemist.
</P>
<P>
For finding radioactivity, the Curies shared Nobel Prize for
Physics with another scientist in 1903; and for the two elements,
they won Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.
</P>
<P>
Over years, Marie has appeared on some 100 commemorative stamps
issued by 40 countries; and first of the kind was by Turkey in
1935 to mark an international women's conference.
</P>
<P>
This year, the 100th anniversary of polonium and radium's
discovery offers a better reason for Poland, as well as some other
countries, to depict the woman scientist on stamps.
</P>
<P>
As media reports go, some international events have been
scheduled to commemorate Marie, who died in 1934.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Might Cut Cabinet Portfolios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
considering reducing the cabinet strength from 32 ministers to 30
and appointing nine more deputy ministers, well-informed
government sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to reduce the number of ministries to make the
cabinet leaner and tighter in the long term," a source said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose is to cut administration cost, they said,
adding that by reducing the number of ministers and ministries and
attaching their responsibilities to remaining portfolios,
considerable savings can be made.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the portfolios likely to be axed are
the Forestry and Environment Ministry held by Nandimitra Ekanayake
and the Women's Affairs Ministry under Hema Ratnayake.
</P>
<P>
Additional deputy ministers are likely to be appointed after
the local government elections in the north of the country slated
for January 29.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Chandrika Kumaratunga is also considering
whether to appoint Batty Weerakoon, nominated by the Lanka Sama
Samaja Party (LSSP), to head the Science and Technology Ministry
following the death of its minister Bernard Soysa last December.
</P>
<P>
Weerakoon's nomination was ratified by the central committee of
the LSSP, also known as the Lanka Equal Society Party, on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Revise 1998/99 Draft Budget Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will soon revise
various macro indicators in the 1998/99 draft state budget in
compliance with the Letter of Intent it has signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last Thursday, a government
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The revised draft state budget must be immediately submitted
to the House of Representatives," National Development Planning
Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The revision of the draft state budget could be completed
before the general session of the People's Consultative Assembly
early in March, when a president and a vice president will be
elected, the official Antara News Agency Sunday quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The macro indicators that will be changed in the 1998/99 draft
budget include a new assumed exchange rate of 5,000 rupiah to the
U.S. dollar, a targeted annual inflation rate of 20 percent
instead of nine, an economic growth rate of zero percent instead
of four and phased-out oil subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"The zero growth does not mean that there is no growth but it
means that the government does not set a target of growth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar, who is also chairman of the National Development
Planning Agency, denied that the Letter of Intent was part of the
IMF's efforts to dictate Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform program signed by IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus and President Soeharto, Indonesia will conduct a
wide-ranging economic and financial reform, including reviewing
the 1998/99 budget, curtailing government financial support for
the national car project and scrapping some agriculture
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
"I need to affirm that the Indonesia-IMF package is not an
agreement but is a letter of intent which binds the two sides," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to invite the IMF to help resolve its
economic crisis was based on the body's experience in helping many
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, like other Southeast Asian countries, has been badly
hit by the monetary crisis since July last year. The rupiah has
devaluated by more than 200 percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the IMF agreed to provide 23 billion U.S. dollars
in loans to Indonesia to help overcome the country's monetary
crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Shift Export Orientations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 17 (Xinhua ) -- Faced with declining
markets in Asia, a growing number of U.S. companies in California
are gearing up to shift exports to Latin America, Europe and other
"more promising regions," according to a report in Saturday's Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
The report said the most attractive exports market for
U.S. companies in California appear to be in Latin American
countries, whose economies, with the exception of Brazil, are
expected to "grow more rapidly this year than any other region in
the world."
</P>
<P>
California companies last year shipped only about 2 percent of
its total goods in dollar value to the top five South American
markets, compared with almost 40 percent to the top five Asian
export nations.
</P>
<P>
But with sales to Asia likely to fall off 30 to 40 percent this
year, some export firms are planning to chase new markets.
</P>
<P>
Besides Latin America, the report said, Europe is regarded by
the Californian businessmen as promising new markets where they
can sell more products.
</P>
<P>
California's exports to Europe overall have been growing faster
than to Asia as of late, the report said, quoting some economists
as saying that Europe's modest economic growth is picking up
somewhat this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, believe that the shift for many California
exporters will be slow and risky because of higher shipping costs
to Europe, lack of certain foreign banks in Latin American
countries as well as other geographical and historical factors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, export companies based in California and the rest of
the United States are certain to confront tougher competition in
Latin American and European countries, as Asian countries bolster
their exports in a desperate bid to strengthen their battered
economies.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-Built Edible Oil Wharf Launched in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's first wharf to handle
edible oil shipping in the Thilawa Port development projects
opened on Saturday in the port in Yangon, the New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 198-meter-long wharf, built by the Myanmar Integrated Port
Services Pte Ltd of Singapore can handle 15,000-ton freighters, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Under a 25-year land lease contract reached with the Myanmar
Port Authority in July 1996, the Singaporean firm will undertake
the freight handling of edible oil and will also carry out
production in the wharf yard.
</P>
<P>
The Thilawa Port development projects have been carried out
since June 1995 to boost the existing handling capacity of the
Yangon Port in cooperation with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Two wharves in the Thilawa Port have been completed, including
the present one, and 15 others are still under construction. The
first container wharf was built by the C and P Holdings of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an edible oil industrial zone is being planned near
the Thilawa Port and is to be jointly implemented by the local
Myanmar Industrial Manufacturing Co Ltd and the Myanmar Edible Oil
Dealers' Association, according to an earlier official report.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar imported 65.25
million U.S. dollars worth of edible vegetable oil and other
hydrogenated oils in the 1996-97 fiscal year.

<P>
PRAGUE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic, Poland and
Hungary should further step up military cooperation while readying
themselves for joining NATO, the top Czech soldier said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Their working together, said Jiri Nekovasil, General Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces, after meeting his Polish and Hungarian
counterparts Henryk Szumski and Vegh Ferenc, is all necessary.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, as reported by the Czech press, the
military leaders agreed that the armed forces of the three
would-be NATO members should be partners rather than competitors.
</P>
<P>
For that end, they agreed on the formation of a joint group to
coordinate military activities, and on the joint procurement of
military equipment in future to cut drastically on costs.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were listed, at NATO's
summit in Madrid last July, as the first three candidates for the
Western military alliance's planned expansion into East Europe.
</P>
<P>
Military leaders of the three countries have been meeting on a
regular basis ever since the summit. And they are also expected to
gather in Poland in the middle of this year.

<HEADLINE> Former Military Firms Shine in Civilian Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Between 1,200 and 1,300
converted military factories had absorbed about 4.5 billion US
dollars in foreign investment by the end of last year, the
"Business Weekly" of "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Xie Mingbao, deputy director of the planning
department of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defence, as saying that military factories are
catching up with civilian enterprises in soliciting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that by the end of 1996, there were 1,000
former military firms using foreign capital for civilian
production, involving four billion US dollars in actual
investment. In 1993, only 300 foreign-funded firms had partners
from the military sector.
</P>
<P>
Partnerships with the military sector have garnered good
economic returns. A 1996 survey of 33 foreign-funded companies
working with former military firms revealed they had earned 415
million US dollars in profits from their original investment of
133 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even more foreign investment is needed to boost exports and
help ensure that civilian products from former military firms can
outshine those of other firms in a buyer's market, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Although the advantages of military firms lie with their
research strengths and skilled staff, many research results have
not found commercial application owing to lack of capital. Once
commercialized, these research results will generate great
economic and social benefits, according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is especially welcome in the ship-building,
automobile, computer and other high-tech sectors which demand mass
production and the strong research and technology input the former
military firms can supply, the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
Certain of these firms are especially keen to excel in the
development of software which is used in long-term weather and
earthquake forecasting, subterranean and oceanic resource
prospecting and nuclear energy utilization.
</P>
<P>
Former military firms are now capable of producing more than
15,000 kinds of products for civilian use, accounting for about 80
percent of the sector's total output and about one percent of
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Civilian production by military firms has grown at an average
of 20 percent a year since the late 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Calls for Political Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Saturday called on coalition parties to halt their
partisan turf rows and take national interests into full account.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Constantinescu stressed a government
shake-up would be decided only by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to hold a joint
meeting Wednesday, in which Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea would be
required to put his proposed economic reforms to a confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The president said Ciorbea's cabinet would have to resign if a
vote of no-confidence is passed against the reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet crisis erupted at the end of December when Ciorbea
sacked Transport Minister Traian Basescu for accusing the
government of "incompetence."
</P>
<P>
Within the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party, which is
responsible for nominating a new transport minister, said Basescu
was the most appropriate nominee and the prime minister should not
lose sight of his achievements.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciorbea categorically rejected on January 7 the
party's request for Basescu's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
With the dispute deepening, Ciorbea announced that his National
Peasants' Party would consider forming a minority government if
the Democratic Party optioned to quit.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, the Democratic Party officially asked Ciorbea
and his cabinet to step down, but the National Peasants' Party
brushed off the demand.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, as reported by the Romanian news agency, has
sparked big tumbles in the country's securities market and may
discourage foreign investors.

Talks on Mercosur-Canada Agreement Suspended
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- The talks on an agreement between the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) and Canada was suspended January 15 over
a dispute between a Canadian firm and a Brazilian one.
</P>
<P>
The problem started last December, when Bombardier, a Canadian
company, suspended the purchase of 24 Tucano planes from Embraer,
a Brazilian firm, for 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bombardier made the decision after Embraer defeated it in a
bidding to supply 67 planes worth more than one billion dollars to
the Eagle airline, of the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said
bilateral relations were not affected in general terms.

Mercosur Countries Increase Surveillance of "Triple Border"

<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Three of the four partners in the Southern

step up security measures in the "triple border."
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed recently by Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay,
proposes measures to control the movement of persons and goods.
</P>
<P>
The document also suggests signing an accord between their
central banks to detect irregular money operations and tighten up
air controls to neutralize clandestine landing strips.

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's foreign reserves as of last December
surpassed 51 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to the country's 10

</P>
<P>
Brazil's current account deficit was 33.8 billion dollars last
year, of which 6.34 billion came from trade, and 27.5 billion from
services, mainly the payment of interests and the remittance of
dividends and profits to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sets High GDP goal for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai municipal
government has planned another year of double-digit growth for the
country's biggest city, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The goal set for the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is
10 percent. Service sector is planned to account for 46 percent of
the GDP value, while manufacturing industry is projected to expand
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The target for GDP growth is a "high goal", because the city is
starting from a high base after the rapid development in the past
six years in a row, the paper quoted Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1997, the city has recorded increases in its GDP
between 12.7 and 14 percent. Last year, the GDP value topped 336
billion yuan (40.5 billion US dollars), up 12.7 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The targets for this year will take into consideration the aim
to create conditions for manufacturing enterprises to adjust
production to fit in with market developments, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The country's manufacturing industry is facing the challenge
of making prompt adjustments and updating operations to meet new
needs resulting from improved living standards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city government intends to undertake further
studies to identify new pillar industries, such as the biological,
environmental technology and new materials sectors, in order to
foster growth for sustained economic development into the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will begin deepening the channel at the mouth of the
Yangtze River early this year as a prelude to upgrading its
deep-water industry, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It will be one of the city's leading construction projects
along with the Pudong International Airport, Metro Line 2 and the
Info Port Project.

ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A magnitude-4.1 earthquake jolted
Sicily on Saturday, and civil protection authorities reported no

</P>
<P>
The National Geophysics Institute in Rome said the epicenter of

<HEADLINE> UEFA Chief to Run for FIFA Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENT, Belgium, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lennart Johansson,
president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
today officially announced his intention to run for the presidency
of the International Football Federation (FIFA).
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Swede's intention to succeed Brazilian
Joao Havelange as the chief of the governing body of the world's
most popular sport was made one day before the draw for the 2000
European Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
Havelange reigned FIFA for the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said at a press conference that his intention to run
for FIFA presidency is to further promote the spirit and
solidarity of the sport.
</P>
<P>
Lars-Ake Lagrell, chairman of the Swedish Football Association,
told the press that Johansson is the best candidate UEFA can
choose to replace Havelange.
</P>
<P>
Other members of a supporting board of Johansson also met the
press and they called for FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter to
resign immediately if he intends to challenge for the job of FIFA
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Egidius Braun, chairman of the German Football Association and
a UEFA vice-president, called for Blatter to resign if he was
serious about standing for the position which becomes vacant in
June when 82-year-old Havelange retires.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely known for at least two years that Johansson
aspires to take up the FIFA presidency.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, a Swiss national, has not officially declared his
candidature but Havelange gave the strongest hint that Blatter
intended to stand during a meeting in Madrid, Spain, this week.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for declaring a candidature is set for April 7 and
69-year-old Johansson is now the only announced candidate.

BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) - Iraqi President Saddam Hussein

<P>
Iraqi television reported Saturday that Saddam issued the call

Iraq should show an essential part of its people's
determination to fight in order that Iraq exists and remains as it
should be, the television quoted Saddam as saying.

"The president's letter also stressed the principle of free
volunteering for citizens in this jihad (holy struggle) which will

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crudes Basket Prices Keep Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan
basket of crudes and byproducts for export dropped five cents of a
dollar Friday, to be quoted at 12.70 dollars, after keeping itself
at 12.75 dollars during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Mines Ministry's figures show that the price of the
Venezuelan basket dropped 41 cents of a dollar per barrel between
the week just finished and the previous one, going from 13.18
dollars to 12.77 dollars.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the price of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) dropped 50 cents of a dollar per barrel
between the week just finished and the previous one, from 14.97
dollars to 14.47 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The price of the Venezuelan barrel of oil has dropped 4.37
dollars since the month of November of 1997 until now, as a
consequence of the financial crisis of some Asian countries, of
the warm winter, and of the resumption of Iraq's oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said that the producing
countries -- whether they are members of OPEC or not -- could
eventually reduce their output to combat the crisis and stop the
steady sliding of the prices.

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The sanctions on Iraq would
not be lifted unless Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fully complied
with U.N. resolutions of destroying weapons of mass destruction, a
U.S. official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told
CBS in an interview on Saturday that the United States was losing
patience with Iraq and insisted the international community take
steps, so that dismantling of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
could be ensured.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein said on Saturday that the Iraqi people and
leadership were "determined to launch a great Jihad (holy
struggle)" to remove the sanctions which has imposed on his
country for seven years after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A White House official also said that Iraq had not yet met its
obligations under the requirements of the U.N. resolutions. Iraq
"must heed the repeated unanimous call on it to end its defiance
and comply with the requirements," he said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Urged to Respect Rights of Egyptian Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday urged Qatar to respect the rights of Egyptian
workers in the country, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His remark came in the wake of a Qatari Interior Ministry move
to fire at least 152 Egyptians after tensions mounted between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian diplomats in Doha, the rest of the 5,000
Egyptians working in Qatar's public sector can expect their
dismissal by summer if relations between the two countries do not
improve.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters "Egyptian workers in Qatar should be
given due respect and their rights should be acknowledged."
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is keen on maintaining its relations "with
sisterly Qatar much the same as with all other Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
Any action that can bridge the gaps in any Arab-Arab
relationship is a positive and affirmative one, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is considering Qatar's actions toward its workers, Moussa
added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened as the two sides quarreled over alleged
Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Doha in February 1996,
and its opposition to a regional economic conference in the Qatari
capital Doha in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Their war of words led to the suspension of a meeting of the
eight-member Damascus Declaration states scheduled in Doha on
December 1-2, 1997, to which they belong.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's mediation in December between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak with Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
failed to produce concrete results.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 Egyptians are living in Qatar, whose foreign labor
accounts for two thirds of the countrys' entire residents.

<HEADLINE> Study Identifies Trigger of Cataract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A study by American scientists
suggests that poor communication between cells in the eye may
explain why the lenses of elderly people often turn hazy with
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, made by Norton Gilula and his colleagues of the
Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, may lead to
drugs that can stop cataracts forming, the New Scientist magazine
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Studying mice lacking the gene for an eye connexin protein,
researchers found that the centres of the mice's lenses started to
lose clarity two to three weeks after the experiments began.
</P>
<P>
The connexin protein forms channels in eye cells that allow
them to exchange chemical messages.
</P>
<P>
By the age of two months, 15 percent of the crystallin protein
in the lenses of the mutant mouse lacking the gene had aggregated.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that some chemical signal which normally passes
through the connexin channel can prevent crystallin aggregation,
