<HEADLINE> China, India Can Work Together in Next Century: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Indian
peoples will be able to work together in the next century for the
prosperity of their countries as well as for the revitalization of
world civilization and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made this remark while addressing
a gathering held by the Federation of the Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI) today.
</P>
<P>
"Our two peoples had once added a brilliant chapter to the
annals of the ancient human civilization with their work and
wisdom," said Jiang, who arrived here Thursday on a four-day state
visit, the first by a Chinese head of state since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as saying
"there will be no Asian century unless China and India are
developed".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president told representatives from India's
business community that as the populations of China and India
amount to 2.1 billion, the development of the two countries is
vital to the well-being of the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese and Indian peoples, both having fallen
prey to imperialist invasion and colonialist humiliation in the
past, know the importance of development and the value of peace.
</P>
<P>
"While the whole of Asia is working for a lasting peace and
economic development, a major task our two countries face now is
to enhance our friendship and promote our economic cooperation and
trade," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the gathering were some 200 Indian business
executives.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president cited as the most favorable conditions
for bilateral economic cooperation the eased international
situation and sustained, rapid growth of the economies in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said geographical proximity, vast land masses, rich
natural resources, large populations and huge markets are also
advantages for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The shared desire for a lasting friendship is a reliable
guarantee for the long-term cooperation between the two countries,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his current visit has laid a solid foundation and
opened broad prospects for the lasting friendship and common
prosperity of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between China and India increased 30 percent in
1995 to reach 1.162 billion U.S. dollars while the trade volume
already hit the 1-billion-dollar mark in the first eight months of
this year and is expected to post an all-time high by the year
end.
</P>
<P>
The meager 1-billion-dollar trade will, if the two countries
are determined, reach 5 billion dollars in the next five to six
years, FICCI President Deepak Banker said in his speech at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president predicted that apart from East Asia's
rapid growth for several years in a row, South Asia promises to be
another focus of high growth.
</P>
<P>
FICCI Vice-President K.K. Modi quoted an old Chinese saying
that "one becomes more wiser listening to another than reading
books for 10 years".
</P>
<P>
He described as inspiring Jiang's address which will inspire
Indian businessmen especially those who are dedicated to promoting
trade and economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The FICCI president said the gathering marks the confluence of
two great civilizations and two of the world's largest emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will transcend the mountains that separate us,
heightening what was once the forte of our two civilizations --
bilateral and global trade," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Tumor Hospital for Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a 13
million U.S. dollar tumor hospital near Kathmandu went underway
today.
</P>
<P>
The 100-bed tumor hospital, named after former Nepali prime
minister B. P. Koirala, will be completed in two years with a
grant of about 13 million U.S. dollars from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
After laying the foundation stone for the hospital, former
prime minister G. P. Koirala expressed his belief that the
hospital, the first of its kind in Nepal, will become one the best
ones in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Zhang Jiuhuan said that the hospital, to be
built in memory of renowned Nepali democratic leader and founder
of the Nepali Congress Party who died of cancer, will remain as a
symbol of the friendship between the peoples and governments of
China and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is the 24th infrastructure facility built with
China's assistance since 1955, when China and Nepal established
diplomatic ties. Other facilities include roads, bridges,
hydroelectric power stations and social service projects.
</P>
<P>
At a separate occasion, an agreement on a Buddhist temple
involving a total investment of 36 million yuan (4.33 million US
dollars) was signed here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Buddist Association of China (BAC)
will fund the construction of the temple at Laumbin, the
birthplace of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Pays Homage to Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today paid homage to India's famed doctor D.S. Kotnis
by extending greetings and presenting gifts to the doctor's next
of kin.
</P>
<P>
The greetings and presents were forwarded through the
Bombay-based Chinese Consulate-General.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kotnis, born in 1910, joined an Indian medical team which
came to China to help fighting the Japanese invaders in September
1938.
</P>
<P>
As the first director of the (Norman) Bethune International
Peace Hospital, Dr. Kotnis worked so hard that he fell ill and
later died of his illness in December 1942 at the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
Late Chairman Mao Zedong of China rated the death of Dr. Kotnis
as "a lost arm to the Chinese troop and a lost friend to the
Chinese nation".

<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe supports moves to
form a Southern African Development Community (SADC) timber
organization to improve efficiency in the industry, a cabinet
minister said today.
</P>
<P>
At the Zimbabwe College of Forestry and Forest Industries
Training Center joint graduation ceremony in Mutare of east
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira said the SADC timber organization would play a vital
role in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said to realize the industry's full potential, companies
from the SADC countries should go into joint ventures, focus on
improving product quality and expand on plantation forestry.
</P>
<P>
''The Zimbabwe government supports these efforts being made by
representatives of the industry and governments from the region
who met in Swaziland a few weeks ago to discuss the formation of
a SADC timber organization which will play a vital role in
addressing the industry's problems,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said there is great under-utilization of capacity
in forest resource and marketing in the region.

<HEADLINE> EC Appeals to Let Stranded Non-French Truckers Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
has appealed to French road haulage unions to allow non-French
hauliers to pass through the blockades to get back home before the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The drivers affected by the current truckers' strike in France
are in a very difficult situation, in some cases having now spent
more than 11 days in the blockades and many of them are without
food, money or warm conditions.
</P>
<P>
By late Thursday there were reportedly a total of 250 blockades
along the roads and highways of France.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the heads of the French Trade Unions last night,
EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock said that, although it was
not for him to express any view on the actions, its resons or its
justification, urgent action was needed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission, in a reply, late last night, the
Trade Unions indicated that UK hauliers were being released near
Calais and that non-French hauliers were also being allowed to
drive to Italy, the latter following Mr Kinnock's letter.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commissioner indicated that, once the dispute had been
resolved, he would be ready to examine possible improvements to
Community legislation that would address some of the root causes
of the problem.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Grows Up Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama is growing
up well, and has won the sincere support of Tibetans as a result
of his rapid progress in Buddhist studies and his extraordinary
wisdom and serenity, a senior Tibetan monk said today.
</P>
<P>
Sengqen Losang Gyaincain, honorary director of the Democratic
Management Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, which is the
residence for successive Panchen Lamas, made these remarks in a
written speech published in today's "Tibet Daily."
</P>
<P>
A famous living Buddha himself, Sengqen is also the vice
director of the Regional People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Today is the first anniversary of the enthronement of the 11th
Panchen Lama, Panchen Erdeni Losang Jizun Qamba Lhunzhub
Qoigyijabu, who was selected from three candidates by drawing lots
from a gold urn on November 29 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The healthy growth of the 11th Panchen Lama is a result of the
correct implementation of the Party's religious policies," said
Sengqen in his article, titled "A Successful Practice of the
Party's Religious Policies."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party and the government have shown great
concern for the young Panchen Lama, and provided assistance to the
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery to help raise and educate the boy.
</P>
<P>
"Within only half a year, the 11th Panchen Lama has fully
grasped the basic knowledge of Buddhism, and been able to display
to the religious believers his great wisdom and extraordinary
serenity," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the search team for the reincarnated soul boy of
the late 10th Panchen Lama, Sengqen also recalled in detail the
complete process of searching for soul boy candidates, drawing
lots, and enthroning the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Party's leadership, all these activities have
reflected the Party's religious policies, while showing full
respect to historical practice and religious protocols," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the assistance from the Party Central Committee and
the regional Party Committee during the six years of searching,
"we have been able to finish our work, despite all the disturbance
and sabotage from the Dalai Lama clique," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his lamasery is proud of being given the
historic mission of bringing up and teaching the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
"We have both the resolve and confidence to carry out this
glorious and arduous task to the satisfaction of all the Tibetan
people," he vowed.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the European
Union (EU) today signed a five-year 150 million U. S. Dollars
development aid package in favor of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be disbursed under the revised Lome IV
Convention which benefits countries in the African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) regions.
</P>
<P>
Signing on behalf of Zimbabwe was Acting Finance Minister
Emmerson Mnangagwe, while Director-general of the European
Commission Steffen Smidt inked on behalf of the EU in the
presence of representatives of EU member states and other invited
delegates.
</P>
<P>
Smidt said the funds will mainly benefit Zimbabwe's poor rural
population, with agricultural and water development projects
earmarked in particular.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Zimbabwe government for identifying need areas
requiring assistance in the rural areas, and hoped the EU and
Zimbabwe would sign another development program when the existing
one expires in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwe said the EU is now the biggest donor to Zimbabwe and
efforts will be made to develop sound and practical programs
which address real issues that affect the people of the country.

<HEADLINE> Rich-Poor Split Remains For WTO Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of World Trade
Organization (WTO) Thursday evening failed in their last attempt
to agree on a draft political declaration that will crown the
WTO's first ministerial meeting in Singapore next month, a WTO
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to trade officials, the most controversial issues --
labor standards, textiles, agriculture, investment rules and
competition policy -- had to be left for further negotiations
among ministers from WTO's 125 members when they meet on December
9-13 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is important because it will set directions for
world trade policies and negotiations into the next century.
</P>
<P>
But officials emerging from the preparatory meetings over the
past three days in Geneva said that the North-South split over the
politically-charged issues remained as wide as before though a
number of new proposals had been made.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries had been strongly opposed to any mention
of labor standards in the ministerial declaration, as urged by the
United States, the European Union and Norway.
</P>
<P>
They accused industrialized countries of using labor standards
as "protectionist measures" to minimize the competitive advantage
of low-wage countries.
</P>
<P>
India, Malaysia, Indonesia and a number of other developing
countries also opposed the inclusion of so-called "new issues"
such as investment and competition policies on the WTO's future
agenda. They said the world trade body should focus now on
implementing the Uruguay Round global trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
They were particularly angry at decisions by the U.S. and EU to
postpone to the last possible moment the lifting of quotas on
textile and clothing imports which were subject to a 10-year
phase-out under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.
</P>
<P>
Eager to strike a compromise, the WTO secretariat last night
submitted a new text on this issue which laid more emphasis on the
implementation of the WTO textiles accord.
</P>
<P>
The new language was accepted in principle by almost all
participants except the U.S. and Canada, who are pushing for more
market access on the part of the textile-exporting economies.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, which wants the WTO summit to take more concrete
steps to prepare the ground for planned negotiations on
agriculture by 1999, suggested on Wednesday evening a separate
paragraph in the draft ministerial declaration dealing
specifically with agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to trade officials, the new proposal was accepted by
some Latin American countries as well as Australia and Thailand,
but faced fierce opposition from Japan, South Korea, Switzerland
and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, if no consensus exists, no decision will be
taken. Therefore, all the hard nuts will be left for the
ministers to crack in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> US Personal Spending Up While Income Flat in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The personal spending in
the U.S. increased in October while the incomes were flat, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that personal consumption spending rose by
0.5 percent in October following a small 0.1 percent advance in
September.
</P>
<P>
The bigger-than-expected increase translated into a rise of
27.5 billion dollars at an annual rate in the month with 20.7
billion occurring in purchases of services.
</P>
<P>
Americans' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods rose
only at an annual rate of 6.8 billion dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in the U.S., which accounts for two-thirds of
total economic activity, was watched closely by economic analysts
to determine whether a sharp slowdown in economic growth occurred
in the third quarter will stabilize.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported on Tuesday that the economy rose
at an annual rate of just 2 percent from July through September,
far below the torrid 4.7 percent pace during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending rose by just 0.6 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter, the slowest pace in five years, following the
growth of a much faster 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter.
This slowdown in spending caused virtually all of the slowdown in
the economy over the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department also reported that personal income growth
was flat in October, the weakest showing since it was also changed
in July.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries actually decreased at an annual rate
of 8.9 billion dollars in October, following a gain of 28.2
billion in September. The October drop reflected a decline in
average weekly hours, which more than offset an increase of
employment during the month.
</P>
<P>
Disposable personal income, the amount of income left after
paying taxes, was also unchanged in October after having rising in
September.

<HEADLINE> Southern African News Agencies Face Hardship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- News agencies in the
southern African region have been urged to justify their
existence or close down.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was made today by Kgosunkwe Moesi, chief
information officer of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) at a media workshop in Windhoek, capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Moesi said the news agencies in the SADC region can no longer
receive support from donors for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said their only options are to either privatize or
integrate to become economically viable.
</P>
<P>
The SADC official suggested the news agencies adopt a new
regional dimension instead of their traditional national news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
He said the democratic environment prevailing in the region
today needs a more effective media which can promote social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by 12 member states of the
SADC.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks' Mortgage Lending Rises to 2.6bn Pounds in Oct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Britain lent 2.6
billion pounds (4.34 billion US dollars) in mortgages last month,
a rise of seven percent over September's figures, according to
figures released Friday by the British Bankers' Association (BBA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new approvals were also well up on September's
figures. Banks approved 41,310 loans, 11.7 percent higher on
September. The value of new approvals rose from 2.1 billion pounds
(3.5 billion US dollars) in September to 2.4 billion pounds (4
billion US dollars), an increase of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The banks' figures mirror those of the Building Societies
Association, which were released last week. Building societies
approved nearly four billion pounds (6.68 billion US dollars)
worth of home loans last month, the highest figure since the
Summer.
</P>
<P>
"Improving consumer confidence and the prospects for income
growth point to a further strengthening of the housing market in
the coming months, although increases in interest rates may be a
restraining factor," said Tim Sweeney, director-general of the
BBA.

But he said reform is the only way forward, since the Japanese
administration has "shown its limitations" in coping with the
demands of modern society.
</P>
<P>
He said the world is rapidly becoming a community in which
people, goods, money and information move freely, and that without
reforming itself, Japan will be left out of Global trends.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also promised more action on the deregulation front
as well as reforms in the monetary market in Tokyo in hopes that
it will surpass London and New York as the world's financial
center.
</P>
<P>
On diplomatic issues, Hashimoto pledged that Japan will strive
to strengthen its bilateral security alliance with the United
States, saying it is indispensable for Japan's safety.
</P>
<P>
He also said Japan will reinforce friendly relations with Asian
countries and contribute to regional frameworks such as the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.

<HEADLINE> Greek State Budget Presented to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
tabled in parliament an austerity budget for 1997 in the aftermath
of a nationwide strike and workers' protests against planned tax
break cuts and small salary and pension increases.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget, National Economy and Finance Minister
Yannos Papantoniou reiterated that no new taxes would be imposed
during 1997, apart from those already announced and contained in
the budget.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further tax law in 1997", Papantoniou said,
stressing that all the tax measures announced "refer exclusively
to the wealthy and high income brackets".
</P>
<P>
"The toughest budget in the last fifteen years", as the
minister put it, intends to save about a trillion drachmas (about
4.34 billion U.S. dollars) either through spending cuts or added
revenue, in order to trim the budget deficit by more than 40
percent and move Greece closer to participating in a single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget allocates 695.85 billion drachmas (about 3
billion U.S. dollars) for defense, an increase of 12.8 percent,
1.158 trillion drachmas (about 5 billion U.S. dollars) for
education, up 18.4 percent, 809.95 billion drachmas (about 3.5
billion dollars) for health and social welfare, 1.015 trillion
drachmas (4.4 billion dollars) for social security, up 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.286 trillion drachmas (about 5.6 billion dollars)
has been set aside for subsidies and a further 575.4 billion
drachmas (2.5 billion dollars) for consumer expenditures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a reserve of 100 billion drachmas (435 million
dollars) has been formed for extraordinary expenses.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue of the general budget is 9.532 trillion
drachmas (41.44 billion dollars), an increase of 17.5 percent over
1996, of which the regular budget will account for 8.715 trillion
drachmas (37.9 billion dollars), marking an increase of 15.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will begin a five-day debate on the budget on
Tuesday, December 17, culminating in a vote on Saturday, December
21.

<HEADLINE> German Lower House Approves Reduced 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The lower house of the German
parliament today approved the 1997 budget which is reduced by 2.5
percent in order to meet the standards for joining the European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
Total spending for 1997 is budgeted at 440 billion marks (293
billion U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
New borrowings next year are planned at 53.3 billion marks
(35.5 billion dollars), a drop of 20.0 billion marks (13.3 billion
dollars) from this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the departments will economize in 1997. The
expenditures of the Ministries of Finance, Transport and Economics
will be cut by 19 percent, 12.7 percent and 10.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget for the Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs will rise by 2.6 percent from this year, to 127.8 billion
marks (85.1 billion dollars) under the pressure of increasing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure for payment of the national debt interest will
amount to 86.0 billion marks (57.3 billion dollars), ranking
second behind spending on the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The third largest expenditure in the budget goes to defense
with 46.3 billion marks (30.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Theo Waigel, financial minister, said the budget, which was
approved by 336 votes from the ruling parties against 313 votes
from the opposition, is in line with the economic development, and
will promote it.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party, the main opposition, strongly
criticized the budget for harming the economy and decided to
resist its adoption in the upper house and to refuse any austerity
measures.

MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov said today all the Russian troops would be
withdrawn from Chechnya, complying with the orders of President
Boris Yeltsin, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an enlarged leadership meeting of the interior

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
today met commander of the U.N. multi-national force in Zaire
General Maurice Baril and discussed with him how to send relief
aid to stranded Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told Baril that his government welcomes the U.N.
force to carry out humanitarian operations from Uganda and will
give the force any modest support possible, Radio Uganda reported
today from Uganda's northern district of Gulu where they met.
</P>
<P>
Baril wemt to Rwanda and then to eastern Zaire to inspect the
refugees situation, trying to enlist support from the rebels in
Zaire when his U.N. air force airdrops relief aid to refugees
trapped in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the United States, the Canadian General said earlier
that he intends to have his headquarters based in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni asked Baril to concentrate the U.N. work
on the humanitarian aid and avoid being drawn into some internal
problems in the region, as Rwanda opposes sending a U.N. force to
Zaire, saying it is now irrelevant as the majority of refugees
have returned to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Baril informed Museveni that his operation in Zaire is simple
and quick, noting that it is in the interest of everybody
involved.
</P>
<P>
He said he has already met Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame,
government officials of Kinshasa and Zaire's rebel leader Laurent
Kabila and informed them about the mandate and limitation of his
U.N. multi-national force.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Win Promise of Decree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- French truckers today won a
promise by the government to issue two decrees before December 15,
which would mainly order a reduction of their weekly working time.
</P>
<P>
The union delegates of truckers today signed an agreement on an
earlier agreement reached with their bosses over early retirement
at age 55, better terms of sick leave and travel payment,
strengthening of union rights, and banning of foreign trucks on
French highways on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government mediator Robert Cros promised that the
government would issue "within a few hours" a decree on the
elimination of a law which said that the 40th and 41st weekly hour
payments do not cover short distance truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
The decree would also eliminate a law which allows the bosses
pay a trucker only 92 percent of the normal hourly payment when
the latter is in a state of "no rest, no driving."
</P>
<P>
Cros said that the government would issue a second decree on
the reduction of weekly working time by December 15.
</P>
<P>
Both decrees are supposed to be signed by the two sides of the
labor conflict, which shook France and affected neighboring
countries over the past 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The unions expressed satisfaction after winning today's promise
from the government, but said that it was for the truckers to
decide whether and when to lift the blocks they placed on the
roads across the country over the past 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The bosses also agreed to pay the truckers a bonus of 3,000
francs (600 U.S. dollars), which will be funded before March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among delegates of five national unions, only the delegate of
the Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) did not give his
signature on the package of agreements today, which was also
signed by the delegates of four unions of the bosses of trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
The truckers are reportedly lifting some of the 250 blocks on
the road across France today, which have caused serious gas
shortages, food supply problems and big economic losses to many
trades in France.

PHNOM PENH, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh today appealed at a rally here to his
people to collaborate in the fight against AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to appeal to all people to join the government in
efforts to fight AIDS," the prime minister told the rally, which
was held to mark the World AIDS Day on December 1 and to increase
general awareness to the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has 1,000 AIDS patients and 90,000 to 120,000 people
who are affected with HIV, said Cambodian Minister of Health Chhea
Thang at the rally.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are very gloomy for the future our Cambodian
nation and new generation," said Chhea Thang.
</P>

The minister attributed the situation to people's lack of
understanding about the disease and insufficient attention to the
matter.
</P>

Paul Matthews, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in
Cambodia, warned that 30,000 people in Cambodia are expected to
die from AIDS and several thousands of AIDS cases are estimated to

<HEADLINE> UK Mothers with Full-time Jobs Triple since 1983: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- British women's lifestyles have
changed strikingly over the past decade, with many more mothers
going out to work, according to the General Household Survey
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out through interviews with 18,000 adults
in 10,000 households by government statisticians, showed that
between 1973 and 1983, the proportion of women with children under
five working full-time fell from seven percent to five percent
while the proportion working part-time was unchanged at 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures increased sharply over the next decade.
Since 1983, the proportion of women with children under five
working full-time has increased threefold, from five percent to 16
percent, while the proportion working part-time has almost
doubled, from 18 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
The shift has been less dramatic for all women with dependent
children, with the proportion working full-time falling from 17
percent in 1973 to 14 percent in 1983 before rising to 22 percent
now, the survey said.

adopted by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, said the document.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more Jewish
settlements, complain that the Jewish settlements have broken up
the territories between their main cities and diminished their
chances of establishing an independent state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum reviewed the Israeli policy regarding Jerusalem,
settlements, confiscation of Palestinian lands, and pushing
Jewish immigrants in Jerusalem to the holy city of Judaize.
</P>
<P>
It also noted the fact that Israel has earmarked a huge budget
for the settlement policy, while leaving Jerusalem suffering from
deterioration in all utilities and services.
</P>
<P>
It shows that Israel has adopted an extremist policy against
the Palestinians and the Syrians in the occupied lands, the
memorandum concluded.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Mubarak's Criticism on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today rejected Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's criticism on his policy of expanding the Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that
the right way to peace is for the Jews and Arabs to live side by
side.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an urgent message sent by Mubarak early
this week which warned that Israel's policy of expanding
settlements in the Palestinian territories could destroy trust
between Israelis and Arabs, and could lead to the end of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Mubarak
sent the message to Netanyahu after the hardline Israeli leader
paid his first visit Tuesday to two Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Netanyahu promised that the growth of
settlements would continue. He defended his position by saying
that the Jewish communities has the same right to thrive as the
Arab communities did.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Palestinians and "some Israelis" to
understand peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The issue of expanding settlements is one of the explosive
disputes between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government lifted in August a freeze imposed by
the previous Labor government on expanding the settlements, and
has already approved plans of building thousands of new houses
in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Likely to Make Another U-Turn on BSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
likely to make another U-turn over its BSE or mad cow disease
dispute with the European Union (EU) by agreeing to re-start the
selective slaughter program.
</P>
<P>
In a move which would be welcomed by farmers, British
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg was expected to urge his cabinet
colleagues to approve the additional slaughter of those animals
most at risk of contracting mad cow disease, according to
government sources.
</P>
<P>
A British government official, who asked not to be named, said
that Hogg had another change of mind and felt the cull must go
ahead in a bid to obtain an overall lifting of the trade embargo
against British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, our refusal to carry out the cull in full is causing
bad odor in Europe. Things have clearly changed since September,
because the selective cull is now very popular in parliament and
with farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major agreed at the Florence EU
Summit in June that Britain would slaughter 147,000 cattle and in
return the EU would lift the global British beef ban imposed in
March.
</P>
<P>
But in September, the British government ordered an immediate
halt to the slaughter program following a study by Oxford
University scientists that suggested that the disease would
naturally disappear from national herd by 2001.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Premier Ntsu
Mokhehle today said a new independent electoral commission will
be established to take charge of the kingdom's general election
in 1998, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Maseru, capital of the country,
Mokhehle said the electoral process will include registration of
voters, voter education, preparation for elections, regular
consultations with political parties and the conducting of the
poll.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said a new electoral law is being drafted and
arrangements are being made to establish the commission early
next year.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the commission was made after
recommendations from the National Forum, held in Maseru in 1995,
following consultations between the government and leaders of
political parties, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government hoped that the establishment of
the commission will enhance the principle of free and fair
elections and thus give democracy a greater chance in Lesotho,
said Mokhehle.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects British Foreign Secretary's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides today rejected a statement by his British
counterpart Malcolm Rifkind that Cyprus' accession to the European
Union (EU) would be very difficult if the country is not reunited.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that "this type of statements do
not help at all. I am not questioning the motives behind the
statement but I believe such comments give the Turkish Cypriot
side the wrong message."
</P>
<P>
"Any statement designed to cast doubt on the conclusion of
Cyprus' accession process hampers the peace effort for a
settlement (to the Cyprus problem)," Michaelides pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece. A self-claimed
republic was set up in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who is due to arrive here for talks on Cyprus
problem in mid-December, told the House of Commons Wednesday
that "without a united Cyprus, the problems of accession to
the EU will be extremely difficult and very difficult to
realize."
</P>
<P>
He also called on leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities
leaders on the island to show "real political will" to settle the
problem, observing that some real progress is possible.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said Cyprus considers its accession course "a
leverage for a Cyprus solution." And Cyprus "had not asked anyone
to outline in public the outcome of this course," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, he added, will continue to make efforts to facilitate
accession negotiations, which are expected to start at least a
year later.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Black and Asian people in
Britain are overtaking the white community in terms of gaining
educational qualifications, according to an official survey
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The General Household Survey, based on interviews with 18,000
adults in 10,000 households, showed that proportionally more white
adults now have no qualification than those from minority groups
as a whole and a higher percentage of blacks and Asians have
degrees and A levels than do whites.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that among white adults aged 16 to 69, 10
percent have degrees, whereas among all minority groups the figure
was 11 percent, including 12 percent among the Indian community
and 16 percent among "other" groups such as the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Twelve percent of white adults have A levels compared with 14
percent of all minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 31 percent of white and 29 percent of all minority
groups are shown to have no qualifications, while the black
community had the lowest rate of no qualifications apart from the
"other" category.

<HEADLINE> Irish Firms Get Military Export Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 34 licenses for the
export of military goods have been issued by the Irish Department
of Trade to two Irish companies up to now this year.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed by the campaigning group AFrI (Action from
Ireland) in its latest report on the involvement of Irish firms in
the international arms trade.
</P>
<P>
In July AFrI reported that armored vehicle technology,
military avionics, radar equipment and gun turret components were
among the items produced and exported by Irish firms.
</P>
<P>
AFrI says that the export of military goods from Ireland is not
subject to European controls.
</P>
<P>
Under the Control of Exports Act, "all military goods require a
license, regardless of destination, and all applications are
automatically referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs".
</P>
<P>
The latest report includes a letter to AFrI from the
Department of Trade which says that up to October 11th the
Department granted 578 dual use licenses and 68 military licenses.
</P>
<P>
The letter went on: "Of the 68 military licenses, six were for
the export of privately-owned shot-guns, 28 concerned exports to
our UN peacekeeping forces or goods for temporary export by the
Department of Defense, while the remainder represents licenses
issued to two separate Irish companies -- the names of these
companies cannot of course be disclosed for confidential reasons."
</P>
<P>
However the AFrI report names one of them as the Cork-based
firm, Moog. It says that in the early 1990s Moog became involved
in developing an electric drive aiming system for an upgraded
version of an air defense gun for a Singapore firm, Allied
Ordnance Singapore(AOS).
</P>
<P>
The general manager of Moog, Thomas Moriarty, confirmed
recently that his firm had sold "an electric component which is
part of an air defense gun" developed by ASO.
</P>
<P>
The second Irish company named in the AFrI report, a
Shannon-based firm which it says manufactures "military airforce
equipment".
</P>
<P>
The Irish government is flouting some of the eight EU
guidelines on the export of military goods: those covering the
internal situation in that country, the preservation of regional
peace, and the risk that the equipment will be diverted or
re-exported under undesirable conditions, the AFrI report says.

<HEADLINE> Irish People Vote to Tighten Bail Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Irish people have voted
overwhelmingly in favor of a change to the country's constitution
to tighten laws on bail in a referendum, according to press
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Final figures from the counting of votes in the nation-wide
poll showed that 75 percent of electors backed the move with 25
percent against.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's proposal, various courts across the
country would be empowered to refuse bail to anyone charged with a
serious crime if police believed the suspect might commit another
offense while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Irish government, political parties and
the general public all agreed to make it harder for suspects to be
awarded bail as part of national campaign to stamp out crime,
especially drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that the number of offenses committed
by bailed suspects has doubled in Ireland to more that 5,000 over
the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Reports of Refusing Hijacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has refuted
reports that it had refused the hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane
that crashed off the Comoro Islands last Saturday to land at the
Dar es Salaam International Airport (DIA).
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued today by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Co-operation, and Ministry of
Communications and Transport, said that the reports carried by
local and foreign press are " false and misleading ".
</P>
<P>
The statement said DIA's control tower was informed by its
Nairobi airport counterpart of the hijack at around 12:17 p.m.
last Saturday and that the plane flying from Addis Ababa to
Nairobi was proceeding to Austrialia routing overhead Mombassa.
</P>
<P>
DIA then alerted all neighbourhood airports of Beira, Nampula,
Pemba, Johannesburg, Mahe, Seychelles, Mauritius and Tananarive
to prepare for a possible landig at the airport.
</P>
<P>
"A close communication was maintained with Nairobi area
control center to gather information on the ill-fated aircraft,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that after this initial communication with the Dar es
Salaam control center, the plane was never heard again. Efforts
were made to communicate with it on all available frequencies but
to no avail, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, landing information was given to
the hijacked plane by the Dar es Salaam control center but never
acknowledged probably because of communication break-down.
</P>
<P>
There was no further communication from the aircraft but
emergency services were kept on the alert at DIA until the sad
news were received at around 17:46 p.m. that the plane crashed
into sea after it ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that reports which allege Tanzania's refusal to
let the hijacked plane to land are " totally baseless and untrue,"
the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A military delegation from the
Niger Republic is currently in Liberia on a reconnaissance visit
to have the country's troops join the peacekeeping operations
soon.
</P>
<P>
Niger is one of the west African countries that pledged
additional troops to strengthen the sub-regional peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG for the implementation of a peace accord in
war-torn Liberia, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has held discussions with ECOMOG to obtain all
necessary operational information required for the deployment of
the Niger troops in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Once the delegation returns to Niger with the necessary
technical details, the troops would arrive to join in the efforts
to achieve lasting peace in that country, the report revealed,
quoting delegation sources.
</P>
<P>
There are about 12,000 ECOMOG soldiers operating in Liberia at
present, and ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu has said
the force needs additional troops to deploy outside the Liberian
capital of Monrovia for effectively monitoring the disarmament of
the factions across that country.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament of Liberia's 60,000 combatants started a week ago
and more than 1,500 fighters have since turned into their weapons
to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament process will last till January 31, 1997 to
pave the way for that country's elections scheduled next May.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll from AIDS Reaches 293 in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The latest Irish statistics
show that a total of 1,689 people has tested positive for HIV, 549
have AIDS and 293 have died.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, from the Department of Health, show that
intravenous (IV) drug users comprise the largest group of people
testing positive for HIV antibodies in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released following the introduction on
thursday by the Health Minister Brian O'shea, of a video, an
accompanying booklet and a set of guidelines about HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The video, booklet and guidelines, which are to mark Ireland's
participation in World AIDS Day on December 1st, are all aimed at
those in drug awareness education.
</P>
<P>
The Department statistics also show that the number of actual
AIDS cases confirmed during the same period increased by 35,
bringing the total number of AIDS cases in Ireland now to 549.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IV drug user group accounts for the largest
number of cases, or 42 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
While the homosexuals and bisexuals account for 189 cases, or
34 percent and heterosexuals for 64 (12 percent). The balance of
63 (12 percent) is made up of haemophiliacs, children and others.
</P>
<P>
Sharen Oye, executive director of Dublin Aids Alliance,
commenting on the statistics on thursday, said: "There is no room
for complacency in our responses, there's a definite need to
continue with education and preventive programs."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the IV drug users become infected because
they share needles. It was known that almost 47 percent of those
who have died with AIDS so far come from the IV drug user group.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to remember that the statistics don't
reveal the true picture of the AIDS," Sharen Oye added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that it was a hundred years of
Zionist settlements, instead of a U.N. partition resolution that
created the basis of the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted on November 29, 1947
Resolution 181 partitioning Palestine into a Jewish state with an
area of 14,900 square kilometers, and an Arab state covering an
area of over 11,500 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, Jerusalem with an area of 176
square kilometers, would be under an international
administration. The resolution was adopted by 33-13 with 10
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu was quoted by Israel Radio as noting that the
resolution on partitioning Palestine gave recognition to the
right of the Jewish people to their own state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the same Arabs who rejected the
resolution 49 years ago now want to set the clock back.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and his cabinet colleagues today dedicated
their weekly session to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Communication Minister Limor Livnat presented the cabinet with
a new edition of the book Jewish State 100 years after its
publication. She also showed the cabinet a special stamp and a
telephone card her ministry issued to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
During four major Arab-Israeli wars since its establishment,
Israel occupied all the areas belonging to the Arab state, to be
established under the U.N. resolution, and other Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
At its 19th special session held in Algiers, Algeria, on
November 15, 1988, the Palestinian National Council announced
its Declaration of Independence to accept U.N. Resolution 181.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador: No Danger of War for Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to Beirut
Richard Jones today ruled out the possibility of an eruption of
war in the Middle East, saying Washington does not consider the
current situation a tense one.
</P>
<P>
Jones called on the Lebanese President Ilias Hurrawi and Prime
Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri today and the discussion dealt with the
bilateral relations and the situation in the region particularly
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters after the two meetings, Jones said there
is much media talk about tension in the region, but no one in
Washington believes it.
</P>
<P>
Several peace partners hinted at the resumption of the Mideast
peace talks early next year but the United States focus now on the
Hebron talks, he said, pointing out that any progress in the
latter talks would give momentum to the peace process as a whole.
</P>
<P>
As for the situation on the Syrian-Israeli borders, Jones said
he does not notice a definite escalation. There is nothing in the
area that indicates a tendency towards a crisis, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with "The Lebanon Friends Conference," due in
Washington on December 16, Jones said the conference would lead to
very good results as the U.S. hopes that the conference would be
able to fulfill the aims of the April understanding between Israel
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador noted that 30 countries agreed to attend
the conference and the U.S. is still trying to convince more
countries to take part.
</P>
<P>
The conference will probe the possibility of raising funds to
finance some development projects in Lebanon that amount to about
5 billion U.S. dollars during the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the April understanding a consultation committee should
be set up to rehabilitate Lebanon that underwent devastating
consequences of the Israeli air attacks early this year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon agreed with representatives of the European Union and
the U.S. to change the name of the committee to "The Lebanon
Friends Conference."

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Haiti Mission Until December 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council renewed the U.N. Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) until
December 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Council President Nugroho Wisnumurti told reporters that this
is just a technical extension and that before December 5, the
council is expected to come up with a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources familiar with the Security Council said that
there were disagreements among the 15 member countries over the
length and strength of the mission, which now has 600 troops and
300 civilian police.
</P>
<P>
Some believed that the security situation there has been
dramatically improved and that the time is ripe to cut down the
force and shorten its mandate.
</P>
<P>
Chinese U.N. Envoy Qin Huasun said that the Chinese government
supports the peace process of Haiti, and welcome the improvement
in its security situation. He hoped that under the spirit of
cooperation, a formula can be found acceptable to all parties.
</P>
<P>
The UNSMIH was established on June 28 with the mandate to help
Haiti consolidate the gains already made in professionalizing the
Haitian National Police and in maintaining a secure and stable
environment conducive to the continued training efforts of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
It is also mandated to coordinate UN-system action to promote
institution-building, national reconciliation and economic
rehabilitation in the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Reaffirms Support for Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
should be a vocal critic of those who want to derail the Peace
Accord in the Middle East, President of the U.N. General Assembly
Razali Ismail said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Assembly to commemorate the
International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, he
said that the question of Palestine remains the most intractable
conflict situation in the United Nations' history.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are arguably the final group of people whose
struggle for a homeland continues to be denied, though they came
tantalizingly close with the Peace Accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community must continue to support the land
for peace initiative, using Security Council resolutions 242 and
338, he said.
</P>
<P>
The viability of a Palestinian homeland is now progressively
being diminished by policies of continued closure, repression and
restricted movement that denies the rights of Palestinian people,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the human rights situation in the occupied
territories continues to deteriorate. Palestinians are being
intimidated and physically abused," he said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of illegal settlements, the delay in the
redeployment of troops from the West Bank city of Hebron and the
decision to open an entrance to a tunnel in the vicinity of East
Jerusalem have led to an escalation of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the UN General Assembly reiterated that the UN
has a permanent responsibility with respect to the question of
Palestine, until the question is resolved in fairness and honor
for all, and in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter
and the relevant UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Peace must be given a chance to take root and to flourish, but
peace can only be meaningful and durable if the Palestinians are
part of that peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Benefit From HIPC Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is one of some
sub-Saharan African countries that will benefit from the Heavily
Indebted Poorest Countries (HIPC) Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Trust Fund was established by the World Bank's Board with
an initial capital of 500 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Accroding to the World Bank November report issued here today, the
fund will be managed by the International Development Association
(IDA) to provide debt relief to heavily indebted nations including
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the HIPC Trust Fund, a country must demonstrate
commitment to both economic reform programs and structural, social
policy reforms, including improvement of basic health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
The trust fund is reported as a key step in implementing the debt
initiaive endorsed by the Development Committee at its September 30,
1996 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The trust fund proposed by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) was agreed by governments around the world to
reduce to sustainable levels the debt burden of the HIPC and enable
them to focus their energies on achieving sustainable development and
reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said that a preliminary assessment of
debt burdens of the 41 HIPC in the world indicated that 20
countries have debt levels that constitute a hindrance to growth
and poverty alleviation even when those countries pursue sound
policies.
</P>
<P>
The report cited Tanzania as being among some sub-Sahara African
countries with debt levels which hamper the economic growth and
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Other sub-Sahara African countries are Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a tripatite analysis by the World Bank,
IMF and officials from the debtor countries will provide the basis to
determine whether a country's debt burden is unsustainable even after
current debt relief mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the level of sustainable debt would be
defined on a country-by-country basis within the range of 200 to 250
percent for the debt-export ration and 20 to 25 percent for the
service-export debt ratio.  enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S. Surge of Reconnaissance Flights Over DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
conducted about 150 air reconnaissances over the Democratic
People' Republic of Korea (DPRK) so far this month, the Korean
Central News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United States used high-altitude, strategic U-2 spy planes
to conduct about 30 reconnaissance flights and employed the RC-12
tactical spy plane for some 70 reconnaissance flights, the agency
quoted the DPRK military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 days of this month when the joint
U.S.-South Korean military exercise, code named Foal Eagle, was in
full swing, the U.S. air force stepped-up its air reconnaissance
flights over the DPRK, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The flights showed that the United States has not reduced its
activities that would heighten the tension on the Korean
Peninsula, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Shortage Acute In Sarajevo, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The current supply of gas in
Bosnia can meet only halfway the requirement in the winter season,
an expert said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tony James of the British Oversea Development Agency which has
been assisting restoration of gas supply in Bosnia, said that the
gas supply of 58,000 cubic meters per hour is needed to cope with
the freezing winter in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But the gas, which comes in pipeline from Russia, arrives in
Bosnia at only 30,000 cubic meters per hour, because the Bosnian
government is overdue in payment and can not afford to order more.
</P>
<P>
From April 1992 to October 1996, Bosnia owed Russia a total of
121 million U.S. dollars in overdue payment and a further 47
million U.S. dollars is needed to pay for the gas supply from
November this year to April 1997, James said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the measures to solve the gas shortage problem, the
British expert recommended that the Bosnian government impose fees
on industrial and commercial users for the gas consumption which
is currently free of charge.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that gas supply in half of Sarajevo region be
cut off every 24 hours, a practice the city government has already
adopted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of
Health and Child Welfare Tsungirirai Hungwe today urged the
remaining striking junior doctors and nurses to reapply and help
the government restore paralyzed health services.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said money was not the only motive for those in the
nursing profession and that those still on strike should consider
saving human lives.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said, ''I cannot say we as the government has not made
any mistakes and now I am beginning to think that the nurses and
junior doctors are being influenced by other external forces
because their true grievances are being looked into."
</P>
<P>
"I know their needs and I am appealing to them as my
colleagues not to follow other people's agendas and to back to
work,'' Hungwe said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister's appeal comes in the wake of reports by
the public service commission that health services were slowly
getting back to normal as more nurses appealed to be re-employed
after they were dismissed for ignoring calls for them to return
to work while their grievances were being discussed.

years and his visit to China two years ago was extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
Those visits showed the close ties between Pakistan and China,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said the time-tested, all-weather friendship between
Pakistan and China would not be affected by any changes in the
government as the relationship was built upon the basis of state
to state and people to people.
</P>
<P>
On economy and trade, the president said that he expected a
much higher level of economic cooperation between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said there was great potential for cooperation in
agriculture between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said Pakistan had made some breakthroughs in
agricultural scientific studies and it had advanced technology in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
The two countries could strengthen their cooperation in these
fields as both countries have agriculture-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Leghari pointed out that the private sector was growing fast
both in Pakistan and China, and it should have a better place in
bilateral cooperation as it had only a limited share in the trade
between the two countries so far.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade, which showed a favorable trend towards
China, the president said there was room for enhancement both in
value and volume.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan could provide raw material such as cotton to China and
the four-country transit trade from Pakistan via China to Central
Asian countries also provided an excellent opportunity for
bilateral trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the role of Pak-China friendship in the region, the
president said it would play a positive role in the volatile
region, which is witnessing civil war in Afghanistan and facing
the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will start a four-day state visit
to Pakistan on Sunday on the third leg of his Asia tour, which had
earlier brought him to the Philippines and India.

<HEADLINE> Partnership Uplifts Sino-Indian Ties: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said today the Sino-Indian relationship has been
lifted one level up.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark while answering questions raised by the
Indian national newspaper, The Hindu, in a written form.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the bilateral relations will be like in the next
century, Jiang who is here on a four-day state visit, the first by
a Chinese head of state since the two countries established
diplomatic relations in 1950, said a consensus of significance was
reached during his current visit as leaders of the two countries
agreed to forge a 21st-century-oriented constructive and
cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
The partnership will be based, Jiang added, on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely, mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the fundamental interest of our two peoples for China
and India to expand consensus, enhance trust, bolster friendship
and strengthen cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Though bilateral relations have experienced vicissitude, the
Sino-Indian ties have been improving in recent years thanks to
joint efforts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The relations are expected to improve as the two countries just
signed an agreement on confidence building in the military field
along the line of actual control in the China-India border areas.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement will prove conducive to the peace
and stability along the Sino-Indian borders which measure more
than 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Indian border issue is a historical one, Jiang said.
"So long as the two sides join in their efforts, the border issue
will get a fair and reasonable settlement."
</P>
<P>
On the question what China and India can do in their post-Cold
War cooperation, the Chinese president said as the two largest
developing countries in the world, they face a broad range of
fields to cooperate in, be it politics, trade, economy, science,
technology or culture.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can, Jiang stressed, swap experience,
complement each other and promote mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and India share many similar views. The Chinese
president cited as an example both countries' emphasis on the
rights to survive and develop.
</P>
<P>
When answering the question whether China has any perception
for increasing Sino-Indian trade in the future, Jiang said the
1.1-billion-U.S.-dollar trade volume between the two countries
posted last year is incompatible with their geographical
advantage, market capacity, economic strength and technological
know-how.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries need to tap more into their trading
potentials," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is scheduled to leave here on Sunday for
Islamabad, Pakistan, to continue his South Asia visit which will
also take him to Nepal.

<HEADLINE> More Soybean Food for Chinese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A national program offering
protein-rich soybean food to improve the health of the nation is
underway, a Chinese nutritionist said today.
</P>
<P>
The program will reach urban and rural residents, with special
emphasis on middle and primary school students, said Lu Liangshu,
director of the National Food and Nutrition Information Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to improve the nation's health condition by
providing more soybean food items, which are abundant in quality
protein that contains a large amount of amino acid and can be
easily absorbed by the body.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that only a small proportion of Chinese people get
quality protein in their diets, especially rural residents, and
that their overall health may suffer from the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
A single kilogram of soybean contains 400 grams of protein.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of
Public Health, the State Education Commission and other
organizations have formed a leading group to conduct the program,
which started in August.

<HEADLINE> Striking Nurses Urged to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of
Health and Child Welfare Tsungirirai Hungwe today urged the
remaining striking junior doctors and nurses to reapply and help
the government restore paralyzed health services.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said money was not the only motive for those in the
nursing profession and that those still on strike should consider
saving human lives.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said, ''I cannot say we as the government has not made
any mistakes and now I am beginning to think that the nurses and
junior doctors are being influenced by other external forces
because their true grievances are being looked into."
</P>
<P>
"I know their needs and I am appealing to them as my
colleagues not to follow other people's agendas and to back to
work,'' Hungwe said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister's appeal comes in the wake of reports by
the public service commission that health services were slowly
getting back to normal as more nurses appealed to be re-employed
after they were dismissed for ignoring calls for them to return
to work while their grievances were being discussed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Explains Cause of Parkinson's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
confirmed in his study the prevalent theory that a major feature
of Parkinson's disease is a shortage of the signal molecule
dopamine in the brain and this shortage results from dopamine's
own destructive activity, according to a latest report of
Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted on human nerve cells by Prof. Rabi
Simantov of the Molecular Genetics Department of the Weizmann
Institute and reported in Neuroscience, may also explain why
L-dopa, a drug commonly used against Parkinson's, often ceases
to be effective after a while.
</P>
<P>
Dopamine is a chemical messenger that allows brain cells to
communicate by relaying electrical signals between their nerve
endings. The quantity of such essential messengers affects the
quality of cell communication: too little slows and weakens
it. However, too much can amplify the cellular signal to a level
that causes abnormal behavior and the death of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
Simantov showed that this is precisely what can happen with
human dopamine-producing cells. He demonstrated in tissue culture
that an abnormal increase in the amount of dopamine in the
spaces between the cells causes these cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
This finding supports the notion that in Parkinson's disease, a
continued and uncontrolled rise in the amount of dopamine may
gradually lead to the death of dopamine-producing cells. This,
in turn, reduces the amount of dopamine in the brain and
significantly weakens the cellular communication signals.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the effects of L-dopa may wear off if the drug,
which the body converts into dopamine, causes the death of
dopamine-producing cells.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that clarification of these cellular
processes points the way to the development of new methods to
block the development of Parkinson's disease.

HOHHOT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An 800-year-old wall stretching
some 5,000 km has been found in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The newly-identified wall was built during 1123-1198 by the
Nuzhen people, a nomadic tribe who established the Jin Dynasty
(1115-1234). It extends from the western bank of the Nenjiang
River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province to the city of
Baotou in southern Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The clay wall, called the "Trench of Jin," features watch
towers, fortresses, and trenches along its outside.
</P>
<P>
China has a 2,000-year history of wall-building, and boasts a
total of 40,000 kms of walls in 16 provinces and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 kms of the walls were found in Inner Mongolia; the
Trench of Jin is the longest.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue Rules on Investment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China will soon issue a set of
rules dealing with the management of investment funds, a senior
securities official revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, told a seminar that the standardization of investment
funds will be at the top of the financial authorities' work agenda
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Great efforts will be made to standardize investment funds
in accordance with the rules to be issued," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China will
give priority to open-end investment funds and will strictly
control the listing of close-end funds, the chairman said, adding
that investment funds must be invested mainly in securities.
</P>
<P>
China's current funds, which were set up in the absence of a
nationally-unified code of legislation, are flawed and not
standardized in many ways, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The size of the investment funds is limited, and a large
proportion of money is invested in industries, while not enough is
invested in securities, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Latest official data show that China had set up 75 funds by
October, raising capital of 7.3 billion yuan (about 880 million US
dollars). Twenty-two of the funds, with a market capitalization of
9.2 billion yuan, have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premiers on Higher Education for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice premiers Li
Lanqing and Jiang Chunyun have urged China's agricultural colleges
to deepen educational reforms, and better serve the country's 900
million farmers by providing easier access to talent and new
technology.
</P>
<P>
Li and Jiang made the call Saturday at a forum in Beijing,
which was attended by delegates to a three-day national conference
on exchanging experience in agriculture and forestry education.
</P>
<P>
While conducting research and training high-level personnel,
agricultural colleges should directly serve rural economic growth
by promoting advanced science and technology, and improving the
general quality of the farmers, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Most of their graduates should go to the countryside and work
in the forefront of the rural economic construction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he promised that the State Council, China's cabinet,
will increase the financial input in higher education for
agriculture and forestry, to help these schools improve their
education quality and management efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said that science and education should
play an essential role in the country's attempts to invigorate the
agricultural sector and boost the rural economy during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"We must see clearly that there is still a large gap between
China and some developed countries in agriculture and forestry
higher education," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural scientists and technicians account for
just 0.1 percent of its agricultural population, while only 13.6
percent of the country's forestry employees are science and
technology personnel.
</P>
<P>
These figures in countries with highly developed agriculture
and forestry sectors have respectively reached 0.5 percent and 30
percent, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government will regard the improvement
of agricultural higher education as a major step in strengthening
the country's agriculture, on which it has always placed much
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
China now has 71 colleges and universities that specialize in
agriculture and forestry. Forty-seven of them attended the current
conference, the fourth of its kind since 1949.

<HEADLINE> Partnership Uplifts Sino-Indian Ties: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said today the Sino-Indian relationship has been
lifted one level up.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark while answering questions raised by the
Indian national newspaper, Hindvasi, in a written form.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the bilateral relations will be like in the next
century, Jiang who is here on a four-day state visit, the first by
a Chinese head of state since the two countries established
diplomatic relations in 1950, said a consensus of significance was
reached during his current visit as leaders of the two countries
agreed to forge a 21st-century-oriented constructive and
cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
The partnership will be based, Jiang added, on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely, mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the fundamental interest of our two peoples for China
and India to expand consensus, enhance trust, bolster friendship
and strengthen cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Though bilateral relations have experienced vicissitude, the
Sino-Indian ties have been improving in recent years thanks to
joint efforts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The relations are expected to improve as the two countries just
signed an agreement on confidence building in the military field
along the line of actual control in the China-India border areas.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement will prove conducive to the peace
and stability along the Sino-Indian borders which measure more
than 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Indian border issue is a historical one, Jiang said.
"So long as the two sides join in their efforts, the border issue
will get a fair and reasonable settlement."
</P>
<P>
On the question what China and India can do in their post-Cold
War cooperation, the Chinese president said as the two largest
developing countries in the world, they face a broad range of
fields to cooperate in, be it politics, trade, economy, science,
technology or culture.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can, Jiang stressed, swap experience,
complement each other and promote mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and India share many similar views. The Chinese
president cited as an example both countries' emphasis on the
rights to survive and develop.
</P>
<P>
When answering the question whether China has any perception
for increasing Sino-Indian trade in the future, Jiang said the
1.1-billion-U.S.-dollar trade volume between the two countries
posted last year is incompatible with their geographical
advantage, market capacity, economic strength and technological
know-how.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries need to tap more into their trading
potentials," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is scheduled to leave here on Sunday for
Islamabad, Pakistan, to continue his South Asia visit which will
also take him to Nepal.

HOHHOT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Northern China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has planned to make bottled water from a local
spring that local residents say tastes like beer.
</P>
<P>
The spring, located in Xilin Gol League, attracts many herdsmen
from all over the region who believe that the unique-tasting
spring water can cure diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chemical tests conducted on the water show that it contains
many trace elements and a great amount of carbon dioxide, which

<P>
NICOSIA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Lisbon, Portugal, to attend a
conference of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), which is slated to begin on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Larnaca Airport before his
departure, President Clerides said that during his stay he will
meet with his Portuguese counterpart Jorge Fernando Branco De
Sampaio and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet with the U.S. delegation at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether pressure will be exercised on the Greek
Cypriot side on the Cyprus problem by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind, President Clerides said that he will not accept
any pressure.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind is expected to visit the island in mid-December for
talks with President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
In statements in the House of Commons earlier this week,
Rifkind said his visit was designed to promote U.N.-led efforts
to "end the long-standing division of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also stressed that progress has to be
made concerning the issue of persons missing since the 1974
Turkish invasion of the island, if initiatives toward a solution
of the Cyprus problem will prove positive.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. will launch a peace initiative
early next year in an effort to seek settlement on the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
Cyprus and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

HANGZHOU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance
Company of China (PICC) is expected to pay 3.7 billion yuan in
compensation to customers in 1996, because of the heavy flood
damage in China this past summer.
</P>
<P>
Severe flooding has caused huge property losses, more than 200
billion yuan worth, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
PICC Property is the largest property insurer in China and now
covers 85 percent of the domestic market. The company has played
an important role in helping disaster-stricken individuals and
groups.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned insurance firm has adopted a series of measures
to reduce losses to clients and to the state. Payment will be made
only if policy holders abide strictly by the rules, according to
company officials.
</P>
<P>
To meet the different needs of its clients, PICC set up three
big branches in July of this year: PICC Property, PICC Life, and
PICC Reinsurance.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens New Cross-River Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A new tunnel opened today in
Shanghai that will simplify travel across the Huangpu River, a
Yangtze River tributary that passes through the middle of China's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
Built at a cost of 860 million yuan (about 100 million US
dollars), the city's third river tunnel is 2,207 meters long and
nearly eight meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities claimed that the tunnel, which was completed
in less than three years, has set a new record for the
construction time of large tunnels in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's traditional downtown area is on the west bank of the
Huangpu River. The region east of the river, widely known as
"Pudong," has become a new development area as part of the
country's accelerated economic development along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In addition to ferry transport and river tunnels, the city has
also built two cable-suspension bridges, the Nanpu Bridge and the
Yangpu Bridge, in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, trans-river traffic has increased in recent years, and
the current daily traffic flow on the Nanpu Bridge, which was
designed to handle 50,000 vehicles, has reached more than 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams frequently occur at the entrance of an old
cross-river tunnel that originates in the prosperous commercial
district in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Local traffic administrators said that the opening of the new
tunnel, which is near and parallel to the existing one, will help
double the cross-river transport capacity in this part of the
city.

<HEADLINE> China to Straight out Health Food Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Health authorities are almost
set to drive thousands of health foods from the country's shop
shelves in a move to bring the industry under good control.
</P>
<P>
This will probably bring the number of health foods available
in the market down to as few as 30, compared to the 3,000
currently available.
</P>
<P>
Even the figure of 3,000 registered health foods is low,
compared to the 20,000 which experts say are on sale, mostly
unregistered products.
</P>
<P>
The China Consumers Journal quoted an official from the
Ministry of Public Health (MPH) as saying that people will
probably only have 30 kinds of health food to choose from next
year.
</P>
<P>
The clampdown is part of the country's efforts to control its
health food market, where products of insufficient standards have
been running rampant over the past years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China published new regulations governing the management of
health foods in March, and put them into effect on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The MPH will set up a 17-member special committee to study the
functions of existing health foods, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, all health food products must
pass strict experiments before being authorized production by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is reportedly to announce 30 kinds of qualified
health food in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China introduced its first set of regulations on health food
just over a year ago shortly after the new Food Hygiene Law took
effect.

However, some Chinese senior antique appraisers said they doubt

</P>

</P>
<P>
The real estate concerns are expected to reap profits and taxes

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Industrial Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's industrial output
increased by 10.8 percent in October this year compared with the
same period a year earlier, the National Statistical Office (NSO)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that South Korea's monthly industrial
output registered a two-digit expansion over the same period of
the previous year since January when it grew 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSO attributed the robust increase in industrial output to
increased sales of automobiles, office automation equipment and
chemicals, both at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Legislation for Property Rights Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China will step up the pace to
create a legal framework and a supervisory system for the transfer
of property rights, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at facilitating economic restructuring of the
state-owned sector and promoting the development of the
state-owned economy, said Zhang Youcai, vice minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
To take full advantage of the positive role of enterprise
alliance, mergers, takeovers, auctions and bankruptcies under the
guidance of the country's macro economic planning is an important
feature of the economic restructuring of the state-owned sector,
Zhang said at a meeting on the management of state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
He said that property rights transfers, which have been on the
rise in recent years, have contributed to the reorganization in
the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
However, delayed legislation for the property rights market has
slowed the restructuring process and resulted in a loss of state
assets, noted Zhang, who is also director-general of the State
Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
Starting now, greater efforts must be made to accelerate the
legislation process and check up on the intermediary agencies for
property rights transfers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that measures should also be taken to enhance
supervision for transfer of state-owned property rights in
enterprises, in order to ensure a smooth restructuring in the
state-owned sector.

have found jobs, and 80 percent have found relief from poverty.
</P>
<P>
To improve protection of the disabled, enterprises in 11 cities

<HEADLINE> Genes Found To Relate to Anxiety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The journal Science has
reported for the first time that genes play a role in making
people worried.
</P>
<P>
While earlier work suggested that anxiety-related personality
traits had a strong genetic component, none of the relevant genes
had been identified.
</P>
<P>
Dr Klaus-Peter Lesch and Dr Armin Heils and their colleagues at
the University of Wurzburg, Germany, working with the American
National Institute of Mental Health, found recently that variants
of genes could lead to different colors of eyes and hair as well
as different levels of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
The team studied the role of genes among two groups totaling
505 people. The results showed that the variation of genes on
different levels of anxiety could be discerned in about four
percent.
</P>
<P>
The findings could prove useful in helping guide treatment for
anxiety disorders. Popular drugs currently used for the disorders,
such as Prozac, interact with the serotonin transporter.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chernobyl nuclear power plant
started to reduce the power of its first reactor at 08:30 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reactor was to be completely shut down by 22:00 today, the
National Energy Dispatching Center announced.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma pledged on Friday that the
first reactor would never be used again.
</P>
<P>
The close-down of the reactor was decided by a memorandum
signed in April between Ukraine and the G-7 Group. Under the
memorandum, the G-7 Group promised that the West would offer
Ukraine technical and financial support to shut down the plant
totally by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 Group pledged the former Soviet republic three billion
U.S. dollars for the Chernobyl project, which included eliminating
the possibility of another disaster like the 1986 explosion, and
the closing down of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The fourth reactor of the plant exploded in 1986, sending a
radioactive cloud across much of Europe. It is now enclosed in a
concrete sarcophagus. A second reactor was closed after a fire in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The National Nuclear Energy Committee declared on Friday that
Ukraine would restart the second reactor by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Hall for Chinese Patriot Built in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Construction work started here
today for a memorial hall of a 19th-century Chinese hero, Lin
Zexu, whose ban on opium trade touched off the historic Opium Wars
between China and Britain in 1840-1842.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by a local charity foundation, the memorial hall is
being built near Lam Fong Temple, which was Lin's temporary office
when he inspected Macao as the Imperial Commissioner in September
1839.
</P>
<P>
The hall, which will cover some 10,000 square meters and cost 3
million patacas (about 379,750 U.S. dollars), is scheduled to be
completed by July 1, 1997, when China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony today, President of the Macao Chamber of Commerce
Ma Man Kei said that Lin is greatly respected by Macao
compatriots for his heroic patriotism in the Opium Wars -- a
historical turning point marking the start of China's modern
history.
</P>
<P>
"To build a memorial hall in the place he had stayed indicates
the great respect Macao residents have for him and their love of
the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the memorial hall will be a perfect place for
arousing patriotism. It will also be a spot of sightseeing in
Macao," he added.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mountains to Get Rich with Green Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 30 (Xinhua)-- Farmers in Jingshan County in
Hubei Province have found ways to lead a lot better life, as they
are thriving on a "green campaign" of the government.
</P>
<P>
In drawing up a five year plan covering 1996-2000, the Ministry
of Forestry has decided on the development of forestry as a
potential path to prosperity to China's vast mountainous areas,
which mostly remain poor.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to build up a fairly complete system of
forestry ecology and industry by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Fujian,
all targeted for the "green programs", have designed their
respective blueprints, and a "green industry" is emerging in their
mountainous areas, which are fastly becoming a source of wealth
for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi set itself the goal of "building a green Jiangxi on the
mountains", and peasants in Anhui are expected to get half of
their income from the development of forestry.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, in central China, has set the goal of planting 10
million mu (667,000 hectares) of trees, so that roughly every
peasant in Hubei will have one mu (0.0667 hectares) of green
land. In fact, some farmers in the province have got rich, and
even become millionaires, just by planting trees.
</P>
<P>
At present, rural areas, especially those in the mountains, are
making full use of the off-season for farming to step up pace with
their "green programs".

SHANGHAI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- International electronic
firms are edging their way into the Chinese market of broadcasting
technology and equipment which has been rising with a thriving
television industry.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing television institutions in China have produced
great demand for TV broadcast equipment. Statistics show that
there are more than 3,000 television stations, large and small,
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition among the TV stations has prompted
broadcasters to introduce new and advanced equipment to improve
program making techniques.
</P>
<P>
During the recent five-day Sixth Shanghai Television Festival,
China's TV institutions bought broadcasting and TV equipment worth
7.21 million US dollars from foreign companies from Japan,
Germany, Italy, the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
They also reached agreements on buying electronic equipment
worth 5.76 million US dollars from foreign firms. The business
volume was the highest compared with previous TV festivals held in
the city.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Guoxiang, deputy director of the Shanghai
Broadcasting, Film and Television Bureau, digital and computer

<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Instant noodles caused a stir
in the eating habits of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Now people wanting to throw a special treat for visitors to
their homes have turned to instant banquets.
</P>
<P>
With just one telephone call, Beijing residents can provide a
mouth watering feast for their guests at home, freeing themselves
from lengthy food preparation in the household kitchen.
</P>
<P>
Food companies will deliver their favorite dishes ready cooked
directly to their doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
Since Likang Roast Duck Restaurant in Beijing kicked off its
duck delivery service, food delivery businesses have thrived.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing residents relishing the novel service, restaurants
have seen their turnovers doubled.
</P>
<P>
Shrewd business people have come to realize that delivery
businesses can bring considerable profits. They do not even have
to go the expense of having to open shops. They just deliver the
piping hot food directly to people's homes, reducing the cost of
their service.
</P>
<P>
A restaurant owner said, "I deliver food to people's homes. It
means I have expanded my restaurant to their homes."
</P>
<P>
Delivery businesses have also spread quickly to daily goods,
tickets, books, and even laboring services.
</P>
<P>
The strenuous labor of house moving can be done by one of the
city's 217 removal companies. Normally, the moving charge is
around 200 yuan, about one-third of the monthly income of most
Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
Store customers are increasingly receiving the goods they want
at home. Wangfujing Department Store and Scitech Plaza deliver
more than 95 percent of large items, like furniture and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
One florist in downtown Beijing said 60 percent of his flowers
are ordered over the phone.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing TV Station plays a role of something like a
go-between. It links consumers and stores or factories through a

<HEADLINE> Boiled Eggs a Recipe for Tourism Success on Chinese Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Tourists visiting a Chinese
mountain can tuck into a rare treat - eggs boiled with piping hot
spring water.
</P>
<P>
The delicacy comes courtesy of one of the country's best known
volcanos - and the eggs boiled are completely different from the
home boiled variety.
</P>
<P>
Many other Chinese scenic resorts boast hot springs - but few
can rival Changbai Mountains, where tourists can boil eggs.
</P>
<P>
The hot springs are a gentle reminder of the mountain's
chequered past - as a fire-spitting volcano. Thankfully it last
erupted 280 years ago - remaining silent since then.
</P>
<P>
The ice-capped mountain, draped with snow on its upper reaches,
is still officially classified as an active volcano, despite no
earth rumblings since the early 1700s.
</P>
<P>
Snow and ice world, located in northeast China's Jilin
Province, has been promoted as an ideal winter resort.
</P>
<P>
Among all its neighbours in the Changbai range, Julong Springs,
covering over 1,000 square meters, is the most famous.
</P>
<P>
An official at Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve said as many
as ten hot springs are concentrated in the limited area.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature is 60 degrees Celsius, and the hottest
is 82 degrees - hot enough to allow eggs to be boiled in 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The boiled eggs are different from those boiled in the
traditional way. People can not explain why the yolk is hard while
the egg white is still watery, or why they have an unusual mineral
taste when eaten.
</P>
<P>
Some hotels around hot springs also provide tourists with
spring water bathing, claimed by many to cure or help arthritis
and skin ailments.
</P>
<P>
An open-air hot spring bath pool often comes as a surprise for
bathers, with its warm waters mingling with cold current. This is
because some of the water course originated from the much colder
Tianchi Lake at the top of the mountain, before flowing through
the hot springs.

<HEADLINE> China Emphasizes Management of Military-linked Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Enhancing the management of
state-owned assets in the military system is an important task in
the logistical construction of the army, a senior military
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
State-owned assets in the military system are a material and
technical guarantee for the buildup of the army, and are a major
component of the army's combat effectiveness, said Shen Binyi,
deputy director of the General Logistics Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The safety, completeness and effective use of such assets have
a direct bearing on the development of the army, and on the
success of military operations, he explained.
</P>
<P>
For a fairly long period of time, assets in the military system
were sometimes left idle, wasted, damaged or lost as a result of a
planned economy, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have started the work to better manage assets in the
military system, though a little late," he said.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Crime Rate Drops in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's juvenile crime
rates declined in the first 10 months this year as the government
vows to continue its efforts to check juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on reducing juvenile delinquency here today, Home
Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said 1,753 youths were arrested for
juvenile offenses in Singapore in January-October this year, down
20 percent from 2,187 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of students arrested for juvenile crimes also
dropped from 1,905 to 1,491.
</P>
<P>
Wong noted that the biggest drop was in shoplifting and other
minor crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister pointed out that juvenile crime was still
a serious problem in the country. In contrast to the declining
overall crime rates, juvenile delinquency rose in the first half
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The number of juveniles arrested doubled from 1,205 in 1990 to
2,589 in 1995. In addition to the increase in absolute numbers,
more juveniles were getting involved in more serious crimes such
as rioting, extortion, vandalism and causing hurt with weapons,
said Wong.
</P>
<P>
The number of girls committing offenses also rose while
juvenile delinquents were getting younger, with the majority aged
14 to 15 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must press on to further reduce juvenile crime rates. This
is a continuing process which we should never let up on," Wong
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced a package of new and enhanced measures to cope
with the problem, including appointing discipline masters as
Honorary Voluntary Special Constabulary officer to strengthen the
school-police network to better monitor delinquent behavior.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Premier Denies Involvement in Vlakplaas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle has dismissed as "blatant lies" South African media
reports alleging he was involved in former security police
activities at the Vlakplaas base near Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement issued in Maseru on Friday,
Mokhehle denied statements by former South African police
informant Joe Mamasela and confessed police killer Dirk Coetzee
that Lesotho Liberation Army members were trained and worked at
Vlakplaas, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Mamasela alleged that Mokhehle was a Vlakplaas member, but was
not used by the apartheid regime's security police against South
Africans. Coetzee confirmed this, claiminging he had cooked meals
for Mokhehle at Vlakplaas, said the source.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the opposition Basotho National Party urged the
Prime Minister to come clean on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said on Friday that he left Lesotho in 1974 and lived
in exile in Botswana and Zambia until the authorities prevented
him from continuing fight against "the dictatorial regime of the
former Prime Minister Chief Leabua Johathan".
</P>
<P>
He later underwent an eye surgery in Johannesburg, and was
thereafter refused entry to Botswana at the border.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said he stayed on an Afrikaner farmer's farm near
Botswana and South African border before moving to another farm
near Pretoria, unawaring that the two farms were security police
bases, and one of them called Vlakplaas.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP Sustains Healthy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross national
product (GNP) registered an increase of 7.1 percent for the first
three quarters of this year, though it slowed down to 6.8 percent
during the third quarter, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Socio-economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said that the country's GNP growth slowed
down in the July-September quarter due to sluggish performance of
certain industries, such as the mining sector and utilities
sector.
</P>
<P>
Industry sector performance declined slightly to 6.8 percent
from last year's 7.2 percent due primarily to contraction of the
mining sector, with only chromium mining, stone quarrying, clay
and sand pits managing to grow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that construction and manufacturing picked up at 12
percent and 6.3 percent in the third quarter, while utilities,
comprising electricity, gas and water sectors, dropped to 6.7
percent from 18.6 percent in the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as the nation's GNP, which measures a
country's economic output, including income from abroad, grew by
7.6 percent in the second quarter and 7 percent in the first
quarter, it sustained a 7.1 percent growth in the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's domestic production, or gross
domestic product (GDP), accelerated to a healthy 5.9 percent
growth in the third quarter from last year's 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, exports and investments continued to lead
the growth, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that real exports rose by 20.6 percent in the third
quarter, and investors' strong confidence in the Philippines led
to a 16.7 percent surge in fixed capital formation in the period.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Challenges Chiluba's Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Zambian opposition
parties have once again challenged President Frederick Chiluba's
nationality in a bid to seek his removal.
</P>
<P>
The United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Agenda for
Zambia (AZ) and the National Congress (NC) filed on Friday their
petitions in the Supreme Court challenging Chiluba's nationality.
</P>
<P>
Several days before the November 18 elections, four opposition
parties including the UNIP led by former president Kenneth Kaunda
filed a petition against Chiluba's nomination, claiming that his
father is Zairean. Chiluba has been categorically denied the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court threw out the petition on the ground,
saying the petition is premature because the electoral act
requires that petitions against a nomination of a particular
candidate be filed to the Supreme Court with 14 days after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has won his re-election and been sworn in as new
president of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and some other opposition parties boycotted the
elections in protest against the government insistence that the
elections be held under the constitution amendment, which was
signed into law by Chiluba and bars in fact Kaunda from running
for the presidency because his parents are foreign immigrants.

late 1980s. Figures released Friday showed prices rising faster
than at any time since the last boom in 1989, and City analysts

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bank Withdraws Hold on Loans Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the central
bank of the country, has withdrawn a restriction on bank lending
against share certificates imposed earlier this month, trying to
boost this country's bearish stock market over the last few days,
local sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest central bank decision followed a major slide in
share prices in both Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges that
resulted in sporadic violence by the retail traders causing forced
closure of the markets for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
After enjoying a comfortable rise for the past few months, the
two main bourse plunged into crises with the key index of Dhaka
stock exchange (DSE) fell by 264.67 points to 3,033.37 during the
last trading week.
</P>
<P>
Some market operators attributed the sudden fluctuation to the
government's decision to stop providing loans against scrips and
continuous warning about the risk of stock market. Both traders
and brokers had demanded withdrawal of the central bank's
restriction.
</P>
<P>
A DSE official, however, said that the restriction had little
impact on the capital market as lending against shares amounted to
only 12.5 million US dollars as against average daily transactions
of more than 5 million dollars in the stock exchanges during past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of the restriction would, therefore, have little
impact on the bearish-trend market, he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Table Reconstruction Plan at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon will present an
ambitious reconstruction scheme to a donors forum in Washington
next month, but political and bureaucratic constraints may slow
down the drive to get substantial aids, according to Lebanese
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's Daily Star, citing the foreign minister, said in
today's issue that the government has prepared a "long-term
strategy" report to present to the "conference of Lebanon's
friends" to be held in the U.S. capital on December 16.
</P>
<P>
He said that although he was not much optimistic about
immediate financial benefits, the one-day meeting will provide a
sound opportunity for Lebanon to remind the world of its plight as
it is struggling to rise from the ashes of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main objectives of the conference is to underline
that the destruction in Lebanon is an international responsibility
because a great deal of it was the result of other peoples' wars
on our soil," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited about 30 countries and
leading Arab and international lending institutions to the
conference, the date and venue of which were announced in October
when Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri visited Washington.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the conference have shifted into high gear in
recent days. U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones discussed the agenda of
the meeting in separate talks Friday with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi and Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an international conference in support of Lebanon
was first raised in April when the United States brokered an end
to a 16-day Israeli blitz against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz cautioned that he and Hariri, who will lead the Lebanese
team to Washington, were expecting to face some difficulties in
getting immediate funding for the projects they plan to propose,
partly due to the political climate in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much room for optimism in the shadow of political
stagnation in the Middle East," Boueiz said, noting that the
deadlock in Israel's peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon
leaves potential donors reluctant to make financial commitments.
</P>
<P>
There are "technical" obstacles too, he said, "some of the
countries taking part in the meeting have complicated bureaucratic
restraints on extending loans and donations."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the five-year development and reconstruction
plan, which the Lebanese government estimated to cost five billion
dollars, is "flexible."
</P>
<P>
He anticipated some countries would opt for soft or long-term
loans, while others "with less complicated bureaucratic
constraints, such as some of the richer Arab countries, may
prefer donations."
</P>
<P>
Jones announced Friday that the U.S. was using its good offices
with the countries invited to the conference to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is going to be a very good turnout and a good
level," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We want the conference to be as successful as possible," he
said. "We want it to accomplish the objectives laid out in the
April 26 understanding," a reference to the U.S.-mediated
cease-fire agreement that ended a 16-day Israeli military operation
in south Lebanon.

AMMAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat said here today that the Palestinian-Israeli talks
on the repeatedly-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the West
Bank town of Hebron had achieved no real progress.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who arrived here on his way to the
United Arab Emirates, said no practical or tangible progress had
been made on the ground because of the rejection by the Israeli
side to implement what had been agreed upon, a reference to the
Oslo accord which the Palestinians signed with the previous Labor
government headed by former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was greeted by Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti at
the King Hussein Bridge where they discussed the latest
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, especially
the Israeli redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti visited the Palestinian self-rule areas Thursday and

PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The world will mark its 9th AIDS Day on Sunday, in a year
when 3.1 million people have been infected with the disease and
five million had been killed by it. But 1996 also saw the
emergence of an effective treatment for AIDS -- the tritherapy
treatment which mixes several kinds of pills for treating the
disease.
</P>
<P>
-- The 12-day conflict between French truckers and their
employers ended Friday with a government decree cutting the
working time for truckers. The truckers also won other
concessions, including early retirement, better terms for sick
leave and travel payment, stronger union rights and a bonus of
3,000 francs.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Normacy began appearing on the roads across France after
truckers and their employers signed a compromise agreement on

<HEADLINE> Iran Bans Use of Foreign Words to Name Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran has banned the use of
foreign words to name public places as part of efforts to curb
western cultural inroads in the country, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
English daily Iran News reported that the High Council of the
Cultural Revolution ordered Wednesday that towns, streets and
other public places be named only after Iranian and Islamic
personalities.
</P>
<P>
The order allows use of the names of soldiers killed during the
 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the pro-western Shah and
during the 1980-88 war against Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Private companies and shops must also refrain from using
foreign names unless they have authorization, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities may allow the use of foreign words
if they serve Iran's policies of encouraging "cultural, scientific
and political links" with friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
The council has commissioned a special body to ensure the
implementation of the new regulations and submit an annual
report on its findings.
</P>
<P>
The regulations legalize a trend against the use of foreign
words to name public places since the Islamic Revolution in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Many businesses have since been forced to adopt new names
and most streets have been renamed after fallen soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament has also passed a law to ban the use of
foreign words in Persian, including words such as computer, fax
and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
But, Arabic words are accepted as it is the language of
the Moslem holy book Koran.

Approximately 90 percent of some 110 companies which took part

<HEADLINE> Solidarity Day With Palestinians Marked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Information Center
has held a meeting here to mark the international day of
solidarity with the Palestinian people, urging the new Israeli
government to implement the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
In his speech last night, Palestinian Minister of Social
Welfare Suleiman al Najjab said despite attempts to torpedo the
peace process by the Israeli government, his people were devoted
to a peaceful solution to the Palestinian crisis which has been
going on for decades.
</P>
<P>
Najjab, who is also a Palestine Liberation Organization
central committee member, accused the Israeli government of
unwillingness "to build on what had already been achieved."
</P>
<P>
"What it seems to be doing is to dismantle everything that had
been agreed on and in this way, it is very difficult to achieve
peace," he charged.
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in a statement read on his behalf
by Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh, said the
situation facing peace in the Middle East is critical and called
for urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''If it continues, it will destroy the whole process
and the hopes and will destroy achievedments which had been
realized, because of the stalling of the new Israeli government
to implement the agreement of the declaration of principles, and
all the agreements that followed it beside the policy of the new
government to encourage and support settlements, and its
continuous hostile and provocative exercises of the economic
siege and continued closure of the Palestinian areas against our
people.''
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Chairman of the Zimbabwe-Palestine
Solidarity Committee David Karimanzira said Zimbabweans believed
that the success of the peace process depended on the willingness
and full commitment of the parties involved to fulfill
obligations spelt out in agreements signed between them.
</P>
<P>
''The progress made so far in the peace process, should
undoubtedly serve as true inspiration to the negotiating parties
to continue cooperating,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli Arms Firms Find Lucrative Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of highly
skilled Brazilian weapons scientists who worked for Iraq till
the very beginning of the Gulf War are now cooperating with
Israeli arms developers and manufacturers, according to the
English magazine, The Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who set up a company called Mectron after
they returned from Iraq in 1991, are finalizing a joint bid
with Rafael, Israel's arms development authority, and the Elbit
electronics concern, to supply the Brazilian government with 100
air-to-ground laser-guided bombs. The deal is worth some 10
million U.S. dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Four other bids have been submitted, but "the joint bid
between Rafael, Elbit and Mectron is the favorite to win the
contract," a top Brazilian air force officer was quoted as telling
the Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage the Israeli-Brazilian cooperation, since
Israeli military equipment is of very high quality," said Luciano
Casales, the army's commanding officer for central Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American country maintained close commercial ties
with Arab countries -- mainly Iraq and Libya -- until the
end of the 1980s. But in the last few years, its military
chiefs have sided with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Brazilian air force bought several
Israeli-made Python air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Israeli arms company, Tadiran, sold the
Brazilian army 23 million dollars worth of war simulation and
communications scrambling equipment.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the pending Rafael/Elbit/Mectron deal, Israel is
expected to have a good chance of winning a contract of 300
million dollars to upgrade dozens of Brazil's U.S.-made F-5 jet
fighters.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) expects pressure on interest rates to ease early next year
as the government reduces its domestic borrowing, Bank Governor
Micah Cheserem said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted him as saying that the
government is also expected to collect enough money to meet its
budget, thus bringing down the need of borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem made the remarks on Friday but the paper did not say
where he gave the speech.
</P>
<P>
The governor pointed out that Minister for Finance Musalia
Mudavadi has already announced the government's intention to
reduce domestic borrowing by 143 million U.S. Dollars by the end
of the year as a strategy for lowering interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the high interest rates and the high stock of
Treasury Bills was the price Kenyans have to pay for the fiscal
mismanagement in the 1992/93 year.
</P>
<P>
The bank official disclosed that the CBK would keep the cash
ratio rule to ensure commercial banks do not generate excess
money which is required to deposit with the monetary authority
without interest.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authority has also introduced other strategies to
influence the trend in interest rates, including limiting
government's borrowing by law, licensing more commercial banks
and encouraging large corporations to borrow abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing resident representative of the International Monetary
Fund Walter Mahler said on Thursday that he also expected the
interest rates in Kenya to reduce marginally as a result of an
anticipated weakening of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to monthly Economic Review issued by the CBK last
month, the monthly average interbank rate remained at 18.6
percent in September this year while the lending rate for
commercial banks was at 28.0 percent in August.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 100,000 laid-off
workers in north China's Hebei Province are expected to find jobs
by the end of the year, thanks to a re-employment plan recently
implemented by the provincial government.

He said that the provincial government has decided to allocate
150 million yuan to promote the new jobs project.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel to Implement Direct Transport System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel would
replace the current back-to-back system of transport for goods
moving between the two countries with a direct door-to-door
system, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jordan Times, Israeli embassy spokesman
Shalom Tourgeman, said that the new system could be operational
sometime next month, but he pointed out that the change would not
apply to vehicles delivering goods to the Palestinian self-rule
territories.
</P>
<P>
However, Tourgeman stressed Israel would retain the right to
inspect vehicles at the border, adding that his country was
"confident in (Jordan's) security procedures."
</P>
<P>
A sub-committee of the Jordanian-Israeli joint transport
committee took the decision last week to replace the inefficient
back-to-back system of transport after months of complaints from
Jordanian exporters.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the transport agreement in June,
Jordanian businessmen complained that the back-to-back system -- a
 measure insisted upon by Israel when signing the transport
accord - was an obstacle to bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The system requires that consignments of goods moving from
Jordan to Israel or the Palestinian self-areas be unloaded from
Jordanian vehicles, inspected by Israeli security and reloaded
onto Israeli or Palestinian vehicles before continuing towards
their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials and businessmen claimed that Jordanian
vehicles would have been delayed for hours and, in some cases,
days, although the security check was not supposed to take
more than a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
The system also brought exporters considerable added expenses,
including a crossing fee, a per ton unloading and reloading
fee, and fines imposed on export companies whose vehicles were
delayed at the border, all of which made Jordanian products
less competitive, they said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israeli Minister of Finance Dan Meridor
said that he expected substantial improvement in the flow of
goods between Jordan and Israel as soon as Israel installs
U.S.-supplied security equipment at the crossing.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, which includes a drive-through weapons and
explosive detector, would enable a vehicle to be screened in
less than 15 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Solution Found For Mutton Smell and Low Quality Chicken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An additive which can get rid
of the smell of mutton and improve the taste of chicken has been
developed by Chinese Scientists.
</P>
<P>
The additive, named "936M", and made from more than ten
Chinese medicinal herbs, is the result of four years' research
by scientists at the Yunnan Provincial Institute for Veterinary
Sciences and other institutes.
</P>
<P>
According to experiments, if 20 grams of the additive are added
to the food of goats daily for 40 days running, the strong smell
of mutton is eliminated when cooking.
</P>
<P>
A report provided by experts at Kunming Medicine College and
Beijing Agriculture University, shows that 14 of the 18
amino-acids in chickens increase when fed with food containing the
new additive.
</P>
<P>
With the development of intensive chicken-farming, many
consumers complain that the taste of chicken is not as good as
before.
</P>
<P>
"This new additive will make it possible for people to enjoy
better-tasting mutton and chicken," said one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
"Tests shows that this additive fits in with the state's
hygienic standards for food, completely without any negative
influences on human health," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Speed up Settlement of Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad have agreed to speed
up the settlement of their island dispute.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the two leaders meeting on Friday
at President Soeharto's residence, State Secretary Moerdiono said
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that each side would appoint an official
of ministerial rank to speed up the process of submitting their
dispute over the Sipadan and Ligitan islands to the International
Court of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a follow-up to the accord they had arrived at
when they met in Kuala Lumpur last October, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries claim sovereignty over the two small islands
which lie between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the
Indonesian province of East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old dispute flared in 1991 after Malaysia began
promoting the islands as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Malaysian prime minister also said his
country had no objection to Indonesia's plan to build a gas
pipeline to Thailand, even though the line had to cross the
Malaysian sea.
</P>

Mahathir arrived on Friday to attend the first ASEAN informal
summit to be held here on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Oil Flow to Raise Hope of Reviving Economy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The decision of the Turkish
government to expand gasoline imports from Iraq by trucks has
raised hopes for an economic revival in the east and southeast
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government said earlier that Iraq was ready to
open the taps to allow 450,000 barrels of oil to flow to
Turkey daily if the United Nations gives the green light.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said earlier this
week that the oil flow would soon start through Kirkuk-Yumurtalik
and through Iraq's southern Mina al-Bakr pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Economic circles in Turkey agree that the government decision
on increasing the gasoline import will not only revive the
regions' economy but may also bring about a solution to many
social problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Southeastern Anatolia Exporters Union
Abdulkadir Cikmaz said it was a great improvement that the
government has allowed the import of gasoline through all the
border points.
</P>
<P>
Gaziantep Trade Chamber Chairman Mehmet Aslan said that he
found the government's Iraq policy more realistic and brave
compared to the past, adding that the government's decision would
contribute to the region's economy as well as gaining dynamism
in relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iraq's Ambassador to U.N. Nizar Hamdoon said
that Baghdad had dropped all its previous objections to
U.S.-drafted U.N. conditions that had made the opening of the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline impossible.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said: "All the aspects of the memorandum of
understanding have been discussed and they have been agreed
upon."
</P>
<P>
The initial agreement for the implementation was hammered out
by the U.N. in May, but the projected pumping of 800,000
barrels of crude oil through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline was
delayed due to Iraqi objection.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Makes Known Its Policy on SPLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has announced its
policy toward the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting
Khartoum, saying it only backs it morally but does not provide it
with arms, "the Monitor" paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya told a parliamentary meeting
on Friday that Uganda will not order SPLA leader John Garang
arrested as demanded by the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
''By arresting Garang, that would mean that the objectives of
Tourabi's National Islamic Front (NIF) have been achieved. The
NIF wants to get rid of Garang so that they can wipe out the
fighters and the blacks in southern Sudan,'' Kategaya said.
</P>
<P>
Ketegaya admitted that Uganda supports Garang's SPLA. But the
support is only moral not physical, because Sudan has a policy
which is not acceptable to Uganda, Ketegaya, who doubles as first
deputy premier, said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Khartoum of having a policy of forcefully spreading
Islam to the entire region and having made sure that Uganda does
not succeed in its programs.
</P>
<P>
''If we allow this policy of theirs to be implemented, then I
can assure you Uganda would be next on the menu,'' said Ketegaya.
</P>
<P>
Uganda cannot remain indifferent to the plight of the people
in southern Sudan because it is looking after 450,000 refugees
from there, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Ketegaya denied that Uganda was involved in fighting
Sudan through the SPLA, stressing that the support from Uganda is
purely moral and not physical.
</P>
<P>
''We don't have resources to give them arms,'' he pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa has renewed his determination to stamp out corruption and
called for full public support, which he said is still lacking.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the first anniversary of his
administration broadcast live over Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam
on Friday evening, Mkapa said the war against corruption would
not succeed without the participation of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the public knew corrupt officials and had
specific cases of bribery, which they should submit to the law
enforcing agencies instead of merely complaining about th vice.
</P>
<P>
The president said without evidence, corrupt public servants
could not be prosecuted and punished.
</P>
<P>
Explaining that the final report of the commission he
appointed under former premier Joseph Warioba would be submitted
next week, Mpaka said the findings would be published as
promised, to show the government's anger at the social vice.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has retired a number of officials
suspected of corruption, but added that this was not punitive
enough.
</P>
<P>
He noted that suspects identified by the Warioba report would
be thoroughly investigated.
</P>
<P>
The report would also be used to plug loopholes in the legal
system, which were being exploited by corrupt elements, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president commended tax payers for heeding the
government's call to pay due taxes which had increased the
nation's monthly income.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian health communities and
family planning providers are urged to continue responding to the
people to facilitate them with family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Katele Kalumba, member of parliament
and chairman for health of the ruling Movement for Multiparty
Democracy, when he launched a new national family planning logo
in Lusaka on Friday.
</P>
<P>
kalumba said that Zambian families need more information and
services to help them plan their offspring. He noted that one of
the primary barriers to using family planning is lack of
knowledge about where to obtain the services, counselling and
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
Other barriers, Kalumba noted, are the long-standing cultural
tradition against postponing the birth of the first child and
limiting family size in the country.
</P>
<P>
To check the fast population growth, the Zambian Ministry of
Health and other health communities are implementing a
comprehensive family planning program which includes the
standards and guidelines of national planning.

NAIROBI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The newly-built Eldoret
International Airport has received its first aeroplane which did
a test run from Nairobi to the airport in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard reported today that the special
aviation lab-aircraft successfully landed at the airport on
Friday afternoon 54 minutes after taking off from the Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi was among hundreds of people who

<P>
The Kenyan leader pointed out that by initiating the project,
the government has opened the entire western Kenyan region to the

<P>
Moi noted that the airport which is to be officially
commissioned soon, would ease transport costs of goods and
agricultural produce, especially horticulture to foreign markets.

<P>
The president urged farmers in western Kenya to grow more
horticultural crops as there are good markets for them in foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CPO physical market ended easier this week despite volatile
trading and heavy selling pressure towards the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Lacking fresh leads, the market also registered lower gains due
to bearish export data released by cargo surveyor Societe Generale
de Surveillance (SGS).
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Pakistan were reported to be seeking 10,000 tons of
palm oil and 6,000 tons of Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD)
palm oil, which were way below market expectation.
</P>
<P>
December South closed five ringgit (about two U.S. dollars)
higher at 1,215 ringgit (about 486 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended
firmer this week with prices touching its four-month high on
Wednesday at 15.26 ringgit (about 6.1 U.S. dollars) per kilogram,
due to huge demand from smelters.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM took a cue from the strong London Metal Exchange
(LME), which saw improved sentiment for all metals, led by a rise
in copper prices.
</P>
<P>
Extending the previous week's gain, the market ended 11 sen
(about 4.4 U.S. cents) better at 15.07 ringgit (about 6.03 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Backed by a firmer ringgit against the U.S. dollar this week,
European and Japanese investors, apart from locals, were seen
dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
This week's accumulated turnover increased to 608 tons from 520
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
But the Malaysian rubber market closed mixed this week with
players sidelined and cautious following the forecast of
continuing wet weather for December.
</P>
<P>
December RSS One fell two sen (about 0.8 U.S. cent) to 317.50
sen (about 127 U.S. cents) per kilogram while SMR 20 shed two sen
(about 0.8 U.S. cent) to 305.50 sen (about 122.2 U.S. cents) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The market continued its bearishness for most part of the week,
in line with the lackluster movement in overseas rubber markets.
</P>
<P>
The market moved in a very narrow range with prices mainly
determined by the return of scattered buying and the rainy season
in Malaysia and neighboring rubber producing countries of Thailand
and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Has A History of Over 4,000 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- a team of archaeologists from
Chengdu and a university in southwest China's Sichuan Province
have unearthed ruins of an ancient city dating back more than
4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The site is located in the village of Zhishu, in Wenjiang
County, which is under the administration of Chengdu, the Sichuan
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has proved that Chengdu's history can be traced
back more than 1,000 years earlier than ancient written materials
indicate.
</P>
<P>
The Zhishu ruins, surrounded by a five-sided wall, cover an
area of 320,000 square meters. The longest section of the wall, on
the southern side, is 600 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also discovered numerous cultural relics such as
pots and stone tools.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Distillery Makes First Fermented-Milk Drink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Fermented milk is an essential
part of Mongolian herdsmen's hospitality when welcoming guests,
but until very recently, the drink was made at home by housewives,
using mare's or cow's milk.
</P>
<P>
These days however, people can enjoy this traditional drink
without having to make it themselves, thanks to several years of
effort by a local distillery in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The Hexigten Banner Milk-Distillery, the first in the country
to produce large quantities of the drink, can now produce 60 tons
of "Tianjiao" (Heaven's Pride) brand alcohol a year.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of abundant milk in this grassland region,
the distillery has developed its own technology to brew the liquor
using traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
According to local experts, the Mongolian drink is rich in
nutrients and has a very low alcohol content, at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The distillery is now selling its products in other parts of
the country, from Beijing to Heilongjiang, Hebei and Zhejiang
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The drink is even expected to enter the Japanese market in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Foreign Cooperation In Agro-Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has increased crop outputs a great deal by using
foreign agro-technology and management methods, according to the
region's office for inviting overseas intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 Xinjiang has invited more than 1,100 agronomists and
management personnel from over a dozen of countries, such as
Canada, Japan, Germany, Israel, and the United States to give
technical assistance, and to develop cooperative research and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Xinjiang sent more than 1,800
technicians and management personnel for further study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cotton became a pillar industry in Xinjiang after the region
introduced high-quality cotton varieties and advanced cultivation
methods from the U.S, Israel, and the Commonwealth of Independent
States and increased areas under cultivation, since the early
1990s, making the region China's major high-quality cotton
production center.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of dry-land rice growing techniques from Japan
and the development of rice suited to dry saline-alkali soil has
helped Xinjiang increase its rice output by 153 million kilograms
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The region no longer needed to import flour for its bread
industry after it introduced a Canadian spring wheat variety.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists here say they believe that the foreign experts and
promotion of foreign cooperation have encouraged Xinjiang's
modernization drive and have brought changes to its traditional
agricultural production methods.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Market (KLSE) ended this week firmer.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Maybank's disposal of its stake in Kwong Yik Bank to Rashid
Hussain Ltd. for 2.16 billion ringgit (about 864 million US
dollars) this week was expected to give financial stocks a boost

expected to have a positive impact on the CI which is expected to

stocks.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic News Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are the
major economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the
past few days:
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay earned 340.83 million U.S. dollars from
its meat exports between January 1 and November 17 this year, a 31
percent increase over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meat sales abroad increased by 48 percent to 194,872 metric tons
in volume during that period.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombian imports during the first 10
months of this year were worth about 1.4 billion dollars, an
amount less than that spent in purchases abroad during the same
period of 1995, said the Foreign Trade Institute.
</P>
<P>
Acquisitions abroad registered a drop of 16.8 percent in
October, which implies the lowest index for this year.
</P>
<P>
One of the most noticeable drops is that registered in imports
of capital goods, which reached 7.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- The Brazilian soybean harvest for the 1996-97
season would be 24.98 million tons, a 12.2 percent increase over
the 1995-96 season, said the National Supplies Company today.
</P>
<P>
The company said the increase in the soybean output was due to
an expansion of cultivated areas and to the augment of
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 soybean harvest will not surpass the unprecedented
production of 25.14 million tons obtained in the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- The number of cattle in Costa Rica has reduced
since 1994, which would force the country to become an importer of
beef instead of an importer in 1998, said Alberto Jose Amador,
president of the Costa Rican Federation of Cattle Raisers Chambers.
</P>
<P>
Cattle went from 1.9 million heads in 1994 to 1.6 million now,
an almost 16 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
Amador said the present number of cattle would not be enough to
satisfy the domestic demand of beef after 1998.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Sweden donated Nicaragua 7.5 million dollars to
support the Central American country's balance of payments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Ambassador to Nicaragua Eivor Halkjaer said the
donation would be applied exclusively to assist Nicaragua to pay
its debt to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government has so far assisted Nicaragua with 600
million dollars since 1982, and more than half of the total amount
was disbursed during the government of Violeta Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panama has received this year 31.3 million
dollars for the registering of shipping, which surpassed by 1.8
million dollars budgeted for the period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,699 ships amounting to a total of 103.5 million
gross tons have gained Panamanian registry. The country registered
475 more ships with 10.5 million gross tons this year.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chilean wine manufacturers received 228.9 million
dollars for their exports during the first 10 months of this year,
a 64.4 percent increase over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Wines Exporters Association said that the volume
sold abroad reached 147.1 million liters, a 46.2 percent increase
over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Spanish businessmen would invest 6 billion
dollars in the next four years in Argentina, said Josep Pique, the
Spanish industry and energy minister now visiting the South
American country.
</P>
<P>
Pique said the Spanish government planned to promote a new wave
of investments in Argentina, mainly in small and medium-scale
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Spanish investments in the Argentine service sector during
1991-1995 reached 5.564 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Thirty-five of the 58 airports in Mexico would
be privatized during the first quarter of 1997, after a standard
regulatory system was put in force, said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Elias Ayub, director of Airports and Auxiliary
Services, said the strategy for the privatization of airports was
being worked out at the moment. "Packages" that would include
several airports could be put on the auction block for public
bidding, he said.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Come up With Decision on U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the
United Nations Security Council today urged the African countries
to come up as soon as possible a decision on candidates for the
post of the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been deadlocked on the issue since
November 19 when the United States cast a negative vote in a
resolution giving incumbent U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
In a closed-door meeting, some members were of the view that
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) should decide soon if they
would stick to Boutros-Ghali in light of the U.S. veto or submit
other names.
</P>
<P>
They asked Security Council President Nugroho Wisnumurti to
convey the message to Cameroon, which holds the presidency of OAU.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun said that since there are more than 50 countries in Africa,
a certain amount of time is needed for consultation. The Council
should comprehend the difficulties encountered by the Africans, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Officials Bid Farewell to Thai Caretaker PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Thai government house
officials bade farewell to Banharn Silpa-Archa Friday on his last
day of duty as the country's 21st prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 officials queued up in front of the prime minister's
office building to offer him roses.
</P>
<P>
Banharn thanked government house staff for their cooperation
and assistance, and asked them to help the new government work for
the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
Constitutionally, Banharn's term as caretaker prime minister
continues until the new cabinet is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, was officially announced on Friday night and is
expected to be sworn in before the king on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Banharn wound up business in the government house on Friday
because of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Standing in the queue was a woman reporter, who gave Banharn a
bunch of "koy" leaves, which are commonly used by Thai housewives
to clean eels before cooking.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai nation) Party has been given the
nickname because its members are thought of as being so slick that
they cannot get caught easily.
</P>
<P>
"Koy leaves represent cleanliness. So nobody could refer to the
Chart Thai Party as one of eels again," the reporter, Yuwadee
Tunyasiri, explained.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, no eels are left in our party now because
all of them have already moved to other parties," Banharn, before
leaving the government house, said, referring to the mass
defection of Chart Thai Party MPs to other parties during the
leadup to the November 17 general election.
</P>
<P>
In the July 2, 1995 election, his party won 92 of the 391 seats
in the Lower House, the most among all parties. In the election
two weeks ago, however, his party won only 39 seats.
</P>
<P>
During his 14 months in office as prime minister, from July
1995 to September 27 this year, when he dissolved parliament, his
six-party coalition government underwent two no-confidence votes,
three reshuffles and six cabinet personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
His government was unpopular for a poor image because of
alleged corruption, inefficiency, inappropriate appointments, and
without vision.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Thailand's economy also faced an all-round
slowdown. Exports could be zero growth this year, as against 24
percent growth in 1995. Economic growth rate is predicted to be at
6 percent, the lowest in the last decade, which witnessed growth
rates between 8 and 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
What Banharn could feel proud of is the fact that he presided
over or participated in several important and even
once-in-a-life-time events which just happened to take place
during the period.
</P>
<P>
These events included the United Nations 50th anniversary (New
York, September 1995), the fifth ASEAN summit (Bangkok, December),
the Southeast Asian games (Chiang Mai, December), the Asia-Europe
meeting (Bangkok, March 1996), visit to China (March), the golden
jubilee of the Thai king's accession to the throne (1996), and
state visits by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom
(October-November) and by U.S. President Bill Clinton (November).

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman
Herzog left here today for home after paying a six-day state visit
to Nepal at the invitation of King Birendra.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the conclusion of his visit, the German president
told a press conference here Friday that Germany will continue its
development assistance to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The German government will not cut down its grant assistance to
Nepal in the coming years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Nepal's second largest donor country after Japan, is
cooperating in power generation, conservation of cultural
heritage, strengthening of local bodies, management training and
development projects with annual assistance of about 60 million US
dollars, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nepal, the German president met with Nepali
King Birendra, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also visited some historic and religious places and
inspected German-aided projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the German president also went on a sightseeing tour
to view Mount Everest on the Nepal-China border by a special
flight.
</P>
<P>
President Herzog arrived in Nepal on November 25 just after his
one-week state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra, Prime Minister Deuba, ministers, opposition
leaders and senior government officials saw the German president

<HEADLINE> 13 Killed, 13 Missing in Philippine Flash Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people have died
while 13 others were still missing and feared dead in flash floods
and landslides caused by heavy rains in southern Philippines in
the past few days, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said 13 persons died and nine others were
unaccounted for after several houses were buried by landslides in
the town of Pandan in Catanduanes province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial disaster coordinating council has requested the
National Police and the Air Force to rush helicopters to the
island province to ferry much-needed foodstuffs and medicine to
the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Alcantara, chairman of the council, said there were a total of
106 landslides along the national road leading to the towns of
Pandan and Caramoran. The two towns have been isolated for days
because of the inaccessible road and rough seas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Iligan city in Lanao del Sur province, four children were
missing in a flash flood that swept through the city, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The flash flood destroyed an undetermined number of houses,
leaving about 90 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Many mountains in the country have been denuded by years of
uncontrolled logging, which makes even ordinary rains a possible
source of flash floods and mudslides, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Enjoys Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria enjoyed a foreign trade
surplus of 166 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of
this year, Commerce and Foreign Economic Cooperation Minister
Atanas Paparizov said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite a drop in exports, the country could still expect a
favorable balance of international payments, Paparizov told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria exported some 3.388 billion dollars' worth of goods
from January to September this year, against imports of 3.122
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in exports was mainly caused by a ban on grain
export, the foot and mouth disease among some sheep in the
country, and a decline in exports of ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
Of the exports, 40.3 percent went to the European Union and 19
percent to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia accounted for nearly 30 percent of Bulgaria's imports in
the first nine months of the year and left the East European
nation with a 300 million dollars bilateral trade deficit.

COLOMBO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan leading Tamil
political parties are opposed to the government's decision to hold
local elections in the north in December, according to political
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Friday, Five Tamil parties, including
Tamil United liberation Organization (TELO), Eelam People's

Democratic Party (EPDP), took a collective decision to oppose the
government's bid to hold local government polls in the North, the

</P>
<P>
They said that the Tamil United liberation Front (TULF) also
expressed its opposition, and urged the government "not to hold
the elections in the North now."

These parties believed that normalcy has not been restored and
the civil war still exists in the north with hundreds of thousands
of registered voters displaced, and not living in their homes, the

The government has decided to hold elections to all local
authorities in Northern province, except in Mulaitivu district.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President Urges Splitting Parties to Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro today expressed her concern about the internal
crisis in the legislative power of Nicaragua and urged the
splitting parties to arrive at an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving a bad example to the world and to Nicaraguan
society with the division of the parliament. I urge you to
dialogue and to try to arrive at an agreement to have more harmony
inside that power of the state," said the president to National
Assembly deputies today after receiving a recognition of the
Central America Council of Social Integration that is meeting in
Managua.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's institutional conflict started November 22
when Arnoldo Aleman, candidate of the Liberal Alliance, was
proclaimed president-elect of of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The plenum of the National Assembly split into two sides: the
Liberal, which dominates the parliamentary directive board, and
the Sandinista Front, which has the support of the majority of the
92 deputies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52 deputies who sessioned that same night without
being convoked by the directive board approved the reform to the
bylaw of the Central Bank of Nicaragua and the bylaw of the
Justice Procuratorship.
</P>
<P>
Under those laws, the heads of both institutions will be
appointed by the parliament and not by the executive power.
</P>
<P>
The crisis became acute on Thursday when First Vice-president
of the Assembly Adolfo Jarquin, and First Secretary Jaime Bonilla
were dismissed. Jarquin's position was assumed by Sandinista
deputy Doris Tijerino, who had been performing as third
vice-president.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Returns From Africa Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso Thursday returned from a five-day visit to Angola
and South Africa, bringing home the two African countries'
commitments to stronger political and economic links with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This was Cardoso's first tour of the African continent since
January 1, 1995, when he assumed the presidency and the first
visit ever to South Africa by a Brazilian president.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Angola, Cardoso met his Angolan
counterpart Jose Eduardo dos Santos and praised the Angolan
government and people for their untiring efforts toward peace and
democracy in their country.
</P>
<P>
And Brazil has agreed to provide assistance worth 200,000
U.S. dollars to bolster Angola's national reconciliation program.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 peace accord to end two decades of civil war in
Angola, generals of the former guerrilla group UNITA were
integrated into the national army but political rapprochement has
yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also signed three agreements on economic and
scientific cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also traveled to the Bie province, central Angola,
where more than 1,000 Brazilian soldiers of the United Nations
peacekeeping force are based.
</P>
<P>
He said he was proud of the contribution made by the Brazilian
soldiers in the zone and said Brazil will send more troops to the
three conflict-ridden countries of Zaire, Burundi, and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to South Africa, Cardoso held talks
with President Nelson Mandela about similarities in their
countries: both are consolidating the democratic process and
seeking better lives for their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Their conversations culminated in the signing of three
agreements on cultural matters, air services, and anti-drug war.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president said commerce, investments, cooperation
and dialogues will benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said: "Let us work together. Let us do it now. Let us
build a bridge over the Atlantic."
</P>
<P>
Brazilian entrepreneurs who were accompanying Cardoso met their
South African colleagues and talked about potentials for more
cooperation in air transportation, mineral exploitation, and
energy industry.

<HEADLINE> 400 Loving-Heart Families in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- College students in Shanghai
have shown that they have hearts of gold - by helping needy
children. Their efforts have brought warmth to the lives of 400
families in the city.
</P>
<P>
During this year's Red Cross Day, Shanghai Red Cross Society
and the city's education commission held activities with "loving
heart in the communities" as a theme.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months students from 28 colleges have helped
children in one-parent families, and children from low-paid
families of laid-off workers, and the disabled in 40 neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
They help the children with their studies and in daily life,
and give them instructions in thinking and behaviour like their
elder brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Normal School of East China have embraced 38
families with their "Loving Heart Families" campaign in
neighbouring Caoyang Street, and helped the children, who had
difficulties in their studies.
</P>
<P>
College students have also used their professional knowledge to
provide local residents medical treatment, knowledge on law and
advice on legal affairs.

COLOMBO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 35 Tamil rebels were
arrested on Friday in Vavuniya district in Northern province,

The reports said that the rebels had infiltrated the district.
They disguised themselves as civilians from other areas freed by
the military in the north, who were allowed to come into the
district.
</P>
<P>
It was possible to arrest these rebels because the security
forces had been alerted, the reports noted.
</P>

The reports added that investigations are continuing in the
areas by special units of the three armed services.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Record-Breaking Warm November in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Winter is usually long and cold
in Moscow. But this year the Muscovites are undergoing an
extraordinarily warm November.
</P>
<P>
The first snowfall normally occurred in Moscow before November
and even October. In other words, Moscow used to be snow-covered
in Novembers.
</P>
<P>
Though the Muscovites saw a snowfall on Wednesday, the air
temperature in the city this month exceeded the average level by
5.8 degrees centigrade. Even at night the temperature did not fall
below zero.
</P>
<P>
Experts here confirm that this is the warmest November in
Moscow since 1731, when the then specialists began keeping
records. The previous record was set in 1938, the year in which
the temperature was 4.8 degrees above average.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Yakovlev, an expert of a Russian Meteorilogy and
Environmental Monitoring Agency, said earlier this week that "this
positive temperature abnomally is a product of general circulation
processes in the atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Naturally, with the warm weather, the snow that would have
covered the ground of the city is now conspicuously absent.
According to Yakovlev, though flurries often occur earlier, by
around October 28 - November 1, the covering snow that signals the
Moscow winter has come to stay. The earliest recorded long-term
cover in Moscow was September 29, the latest until this year was
November 26. "We see the current season (this November) has set a
record in this category as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
But while some may think any delay of the inevitable Moscow
winter is a blessed thing, the balminess has its price.
</P>
<P>
"High humidity increases the possibility of developing colds,
and the low atmospheric pressure troubles people suffering from
cardiovascular disorders," said Irina Perrin, a doctor at the
European Medical Center in Moscow, adding: "In weather like this,
people with migraines often suffer attacks."
</P>
<P>
Such a warm weather may have a negative effect also on winter
crops and fruit trees, according to experts of the Russian
Ministry of Agriculture and Food.
</P>
<P>
However, the warm weather gives some advantages, the experts
said, noting, for example, that it considerably eases municipal
services worries concerning central heating fuel as well as the
state of the city's roads.
</P>
<P>
Though some experts have predicted there is a 70-80 percent
chance that the unusual warm temperature will remain above
freezing well into December, many residents, Muscovites and
foreigners temporarily living here, are adopting a wait-and-see
attitude.

<HEADLINE> Minister on Opening China's Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China has opened its domestic
telecommunications equipment market to foreign investment. But it
will not give the green light to the full opening of the telecom
services market in the foreseeable future, said Wu Jichuan,
minister of posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The minister made this remark in Beijing at a recent meeting
with Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of European Union Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News," a
Beijing-based newspaper run by the ministry, Wu said that the
conditions for a full open service market "are not yet mature"
because China's telecom growth largely relies on the government's
preferential policies, and the development of the east and west
regions is still unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
Another big obstacle to a free-market dream is that China's
telecommunications business is not yet separated from the postal
service. At present the two sectors keep a balance in development
by regularly subsidizing each other.

<HEADLINE> More HIV Positive Cases Detected in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 113 Singaporeans
were tested positive for human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) in
the first ten months of this year in Singapore, more than the 111
for the whole year 1995, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that among them were 14 women, the largest number
detected since the first case was diagnosed here in 1985. Six of
the 14 were infected by their husbands, while three were
prostitutes or former prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
A Health Ministry official was quoted as revealing that most of
the cases involved heterosexual males, as most of them were in the
20 to 39 age group. In the meantime, however, the number of
HIV-positive men aged 40 and above had also risen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, only three were detected in this age group. But in the
first ten months of this year, there were 43.
</P>
<P>
As of October 31 this year, a total of 532 Singaporeans were
infected, with 87 of them having developed full-blown Aids
(Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome). Another 177 had died and
one was a child who got the virus from the mother, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Appoints Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected President Emil
Constantinescu tonight appointed Bucharest Mayor Victor Ciorbea as
the prime minister to head the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, 42, was nominated by the Democratic Convention of
Romania (DCR), which won the general elections on November 3 and
was hence authorized to form the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Under Romania's law, the appointment has yet to be approved by
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, of the National Peasants' Party, was elected mayor of
Bucharest in June this year. He graduated from the university in
1979 and joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Constantinescu took the oath as the new
president, replacing former President Ion Iliescu, who had held
the office since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu was elected president after two rounds of
voting, in which his DCR joined forces with the Social Democratic
Union and the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Economy Still on Negative Growth Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's economy continued to
slide on the negative growth track in the first nine months of
this year but the pace of decline was slowing down, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross industrial output in the first three
quarters dropped by 4.3 percent, compared with 17.7 percent during
the same period of last year, Economic Minister Vasili Gureev told
a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of Ukraine's factories have seen a decline
in production. Among them, one third registered a 50 percent slip
from January to September, Gureev said.
</P>
<P>
Blaming loopholes in the tax system, he said that the state
coffer gained 3 billion grivna (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars)
less than expected during the period, and that 40 percent of the
cash was circulating in the so-called "gray economy."
</P>
<P>
As a result, the state budget lost 5 billion grivna (2.7
billion dollars) in the first three quarters, and the budget
deficit shot up to about 2.5 billion grivna (1.3 billion dollars),
said the economic minister.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the continued economic decline, he
noted, was the overstock of industrial products, notably in the
light industry with 190 million grivna (100 million dollars), and
chemical industry with 9.5 million grivna (50 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's debt crisis worsened as well, with the internal
debts reaching 41.4 billion grivna (22.1 billion dollars) and
foreign debts soaring to 64.5 billion grivna (34.4 billion
dollars), he said.

<P>
The documents will describe the actions for a sustainable
development in such areas as economy, society, education, health,
biodiversity, agriculture and environment.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at making specific proposals for the

Declaration of Rio, approved by countries attending the 1992
United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development held
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Treaty Exhibition Hall Under Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- East China's Nanjing municipal
government is spending over three million yuan extending the
exhibition hall of the "Nanjing Treaty" Exhibition Hall at Jinghai
temple.
</P>
<P>
The temple is the site where the first unequal treaty in
Chinese history -- the Nanjing Treaty -- was negotiated August,
1842. The treaty yielded Hong Kong to British rule.
</P>
<P>
The city's government rebuilt the temple in 1986 and has made
it an important patriotism education site to enhance the people's
awareness of what is considered a national disgrace in the past.
</P>
<P>
With the extension the hall plans to exhibit over 1050 unequal
treaties imposed on China by foreign invaders from 1842 to 1949.
</P>
<P>
The extension is also aimed at marking China's resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
More historic materials will be added after the extension is
finished, said the director, adding that it is scheduled to be
completed next May.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Premier Wishes Upcoming OSCE Summit Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said today he hoped the upcoming Lisbon European
summit set out to build a new pan-European security mechanism
could be a success amid mutual trust and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Guterres made the statement after meeting visiting Luxembourg
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
</P>
<P>
Guterres also expressed belief that the summit, bringing
together leaders from North America and all of Europe, will help
lay the principles and criteria for the new security framework
across Europe.
</P>
<P>
The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) aims to agree at the meeting next Monday and Tuesday
on a security model for closer links between countries that were
previously on different sides of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
But reports said the European Union (EU) members and the United
States still appeared to have many differences over the European
security mechanism and the role of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
And Russia so far has made no comments on labeling the OSCE as
the "21st century model of European security."
</P>
<P>
Since its birth in 1975 in Helsinki as an East-West forum for
discussing issues from democracy to economics, the European
security body has played a key role in bringing about arms
reductions, organizing ballots and giving early warnings of
looming ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet bloc.

BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's economy for the fourth
quarter of this year will see a moderate growth over the third
quarter, a survey by the State Economic and Trade Commission
shows.
</P>
<P>
Economists at the commission said the industrial output during

<P>
The survey also predicts that commodity prices will rise
moderately during the period, along with more active sales as the

Macro-economic policy, marketing promotion campaigns and income
growth will mainly contribute to the active market sales for the
fourth quarter this year, economists at the commission explained.
</P>
<P>
The scale of fixed-asset investments will have no sharp changes
during the four-month period, the survey says, but the export

UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian today urged Israel and the Palestinians to achieve
concrete results in their talks so that the peace process will
return to the track of healthy development at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on the question of
Palestine, he said that an early, just and reasonable settlement
of the Palestinian question is a key link in the efforts to
achieve peace, stability and development in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"The half-a-century history of the Middle East question,
particularly the developments in the peace process in recent
years, have fully demonstrated that countries in the region can
only enjoy true security when there is comprehensive and fair
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while the world economy is entering a new period
of growth, the Middle East economy is being seriously hampered by
the unstable situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the region with a population of more than
300 million accounts for less than 1 percent of the world's total,
the lowest among all regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community, especially the
developed countries, to support and assist the Palestine to
develop its economy in the self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Russian-French Ties at New Level, Premier Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, who paid an official visit to France earlier this
week, said today that the Russian-French relations had entered
into a new level.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the results of his French tour before reporters
here, Chernomyrdin stressed that the agreements signed during this
visit will give "a new impetus" to bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Russian-French relations of privileged partnership -- this is
the way the presidents of our countries define them -- will be
well and comprehensively balanced and multi-faceted," the premier
said. "A bright confirmation of this is the memorandum settling
mutual financial and property claims."
</P>
<P>
This document was signed in "full accordance with the spirit
and letter of the 1992 Russian-French Treaty," Chernomyrdin said.
He underlined he discussed not only Tsarist-era debts with his
French counterpart, Alain Juppe. "This is only a part of the
issue," he said. "It has been resolved, like many other questions
on the whole complex mutual liabilities and claims that arose
before May, 1945."
</P>
<P>
According to him, from the French side, this is chiefly the
unpaid Russian bonds of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Everything done on the basis of the money from these loans has
worked for many decades in Russia and for Russia, he remarked.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Chernomyrdin promised in
Paris to pay 400 million U.S. dollars to France within several
years. The sum is a tiny fraction of the total debt estimated
today at 200 billion dollars from bonds bought by hundreds of
thousands of French small investors, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
As for Russian claims, this is mainly the redemption of the
damage inflicted by the foreign intervention in 1918-1922,
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
All this was included in the total balance, he said. "We have
calculated everything. It came out that we owe 400 million U.S.
dollars." "So, we will pay. Not immediately, all at once, but over
a period of years."
</P>
<P>
Having signed this memorandum, Russia won in terms of
confidence between the two countries, in the confidence of French
business in Russia, Chernomyrdin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the last obstacles to widening Russian-French
financial cooperation have been removed. Now Russian and French
banks can work directly with each other. French banks and various
funds will buy our bonds, which is a new influx of capital in
Russia, a strengthening of the budget and resolution of many
problems, above all social, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had agreed on "a methodology for calculating
interest for rescheduling the debt for 25 years that will save
over 100 million dollars a year."
</P>
<P>
The results of these talks in Paris have brought Russia up to
becoming a full member of the Paris Club of creditors,
Chernomyrdin said, adding that "this is the most direct way toward
the return of debts to us." "They (the debts) are not small, over
130 billion dollars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Premier also told reporters that he also held a
six-hour meeting with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus in
Paris during the visit. The issues that worried the IMF, which
thinks how to provide Russia with loans, have been virtually
removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his one-day stay in Poland following the French
tour, Chernomyrdin recalled an intergovernmental agreement to
create a trans-European system of gas mainlines, signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The system will be able to export over 50 billion cubic meters
of Siberian gas to Western Europe annually, he said, describing it
as the start of the deep integration of the Russian gas industry
into the European market.

<HEADLINE> Duma Urges Yeltsin to Reconsider Troop Pullout from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian Parliament, called on president Boris Yeltsin
Friday to reconsider the issue of the complete withdrawal of
Russian troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency session, the Duma deputies discussed the
situation in Chechnya and, in particular, Yeltsin's decree on the
final pullout from Chechnya and an agreement signed by Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and head of the Chechen coalition
government Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
The deputies approved a draft resolution "On ensuring Russia's
territorial integrity and security in the context of the measures
taken by the president and the government with regard to the
situation in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by 241 deputies with 40 votes against
and one abstention. To pass the decision needed 226 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Duma leaders instructed parliament factions and committees
to finalize the draft resolution taking into consideration the
proposals and observations made by lawmakers and government
officials at the session. The reworked draft resolution will be
put to the vote at the Duma's next session on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree on the troop withdrawal and the
Chernomyrdin-Maskhadov agreement on Russian-Chechen relations mark
"a continuation of unilateral concession to the nationalist forces
in Chechnya," the Duma said in the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The decree and the agreement "do not correspond with
constitutional requiments on Russia's territorial integrity,
defense and security," the Duma added.
</P>
<P>
The two documents also "contribute to a further strengthening
of separatism in Chechnya and its secession from Russia," the Duma
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also spoke out in favour of holding joint
parliamentary hearings on the situation in Chechnya together with
the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe, both president Yeltsin and premier
Chernomyrdin will find it hard to agree to the Duma's draft
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Int'l Community Voices Support for Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The international
community today reiterated support for the aspirations and
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and condemned
Israel's violation of the peace accord, according to a UN meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the International Day of Solidarity With the
Palestinian People, Razail Ismail, president of the UN General
Assembly, said that this year's observance should be an occasion
to denounce the forces threatening to derail the long awaited
peace accord in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The viability of a Palestinian homeland was now being
progressively diminished by policies of continued closure,
repression and restricted movement that denied the rights of the
Palestinian people, he said. Meanwhile, the human rights situation
in the occupied territories continued to deteriorate, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Peace must be given a chance to take root and to flourish, but
peace can only be meaningful and durable if the Palestinians are
part of that peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali renewed again the
firm commitment of the United Nations in support of the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He urged Palestine and Israel to abide by agreements already
reached, and make tangible progress towards a comprehensive, just
and lasting settlement based on Security Council resolutions 242
and 338.
</P>
<P>
"But the proposed construction of new settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza poses a serious threat to the continuation of the
peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti, president of the
Security Council for November, said that despite numerous setbacks
in the peace process, the council emphasized the urgent need to
implement the agreements reached so far, and therefore attached
great importance to continued negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people needed much assistance during a
difficult transition period, he said. In that regard, he added,
the council welcomed and further encouraged the multifaceted
assistance extended the Palestinians by the international donor
community and other members of the UN family.
</P>
<P>
"The council will spare no effort to see to it that a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace is brought to the region of
the Middle East for the benefit of all parties concerned,
including the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Andelfo Garcia of Colombia, speaking on behalf of the Movement
of Non-Aligned Countries, read out a message from Colombian
President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
The nations of the Non-Aligned Movement were watching the
dialogue between the Israeli government and the Palestinians with
hope and concern, the messsage said. The Non-Aligned Movement
hoped to see concrete acts emerge regarding implementation of the
agreements between the parties, in particular withdrawal by Israel
from Hebron as an urgently needed first step towards a definitive
peace agreement, which would include the status of Jerusalem,
legal settlements and refugees, it said.
</P>
<P>
Said Kamal, under-secretary-general for Palestine affairs in
the League of Arab States, said that Israel was changing the
provisions of the accords under the pretext of safeguarding its
security, and was thereby taking the negotiations back to their
starting point, back to an era of tension and violence.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli embargo against the occupied territories was
stifling and had resulted in grave suffering for the Palestinian
population, he said. The League of Arab States considered all
Israeli actions aimed at changing the nature of Jerusalem invalid,
as was Israel's decision to revoke its settlement-freeze policy in
flagrant violation of international law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conditions of the Palestinian people had now reached a
degree of gravity that called on the international community to
seek to put the peace process back on track, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the League of Arab States had been in the
forefont of the move to promote land for peace, the right of
Palestinian people to return, the establishment of Jerusalem as
capital of an independent Palestinian State, withdrawal from
Lebanon, and a return to the 1967 frontiers, as called for in the
Madrid agreements.

<HEADLINE> IRA to Reject Britain's Plan: Sinn Fein leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrilla group will reject outright Britain's latest plan to
establish peace in Northern Ireland, a leader of the IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein warned today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Britain's television, Martin McGuinness dampened
hopes of a cease-fire after Prime Minister John Major put forward
Thursday a new proposal for getting the IRA to lay down its
arms and for Sinn Fein to join all-party talks on the future of
the British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that those of us who wish to put in place a peaceful
environment would have very little case indeed to go to the IRA
with Major's proposals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major said in his statement that the IRA must declare a
"convincing and unequivocal" cease-fire, which Sinn Fein would
verify in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams accused John Major of widening the
gap over the Northern Ireland peace process by laying down new
conditions. He called for "real talks without preconditions as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Northern Irish police discovered a large bomb in
a hay trailer abandoned near Armagh city. The trailer was about
half a mile from a British army base.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a bomb was planted outside police headquarters in
Northern Ireland's second city of Londonderry. The army defused it
after receiving a warning.

<HEADLINE> US Justice Department Rejects Special Probe of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
today rejected a third request to immediately turn over to an
independent counsel an inquiry into Democratic fund-raising,
particularly by and from people with links to wealthy foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"There is no specific, credible evidence at this time that any
individual covered by the provisions of the Independent Counsel
Act has committed any federal crime," wrote Mark Richard, deputy
assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal
division.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in response to an October 29 request by
Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, and four House
committee chairmen. McCain had made one earlier request for the
appointment of an independent counsel, and the nonpartisan
watchdog group Common Cause had made another.
</P>
<P>
The decision does not preclude the department from taking steps
in the future to appoint an independent counsel. A Justice
Department task force already is conducting a wide-ranging review
of political fund-raising in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
"If at any time during our continued review of your allegations
we obtain specific and credible information that a covered
individual has committed an offense, we will follow the procedures
set forth in the Independent Counsel Act," Richard wrote.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, "The Justice
Department has made its decision for the reasons indicated."
</P>
<P>
"The White House will continue to answer questions related to
financial contributions forthrightly, as the president has
directed," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCain called the decision "further proof that congressional
hearings may need to be held to investigate these serious
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"It is my strong belief that the facts before us meet the test
when other independent counsels have been called for in the past,"
McCain said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
McCain had asked the Justice Department to look into a 250,000
dollar contribution the Democrats returned to a Korean
corporation, into a Democratic fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in
California and into the activities of Democratic fund-raiser John
Huang.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said there were eight allegations, but
it said it found no grounds at this time for a prosecutor to look
into their actions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UAE Sees Great Educational Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Backed up by the economic
and trade prosperity, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made big
strides on the way of its educational development.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, a country which depends much on foreign professionals,
now has successfully pooled an increasing number of its own
well-trained technicians and professionals.
</P>
<P>
The statistics of the Ministry of Education showed that the
number of government-run schools in the Gulf state rose to 640
this year from 74 in 1971 in addition to 300 private schools. The
number of students at present has reached 500,000, or 15 times
more than that in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The number of teachers, technicians and administrative
personnel in the public schools reached 26,550, among whom 8,850
are locals.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has launched several projects to
develop education and achieve an all-round balance in knowledge
and skills of the students in a bid to develop their strong points
and promote their morality.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the UAE has achieved a remarkable progress in
eradicating adult illiteracy since the founding of the country
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
It ran 139 centers for nationwide illiteracy eradication and
the number of students in these centers for this year reached
25,000, thus lowering the illiteracy rate in the country with a
population of more than 2 million from 56.5 percent in 1975 to
16.8 percent in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The government has also promoted the special education programs
to help the mentally or physically disabled people and integrated
them in the public education program.
</P>
<P>
The development in the national education is attributed to the
policy adopted by the government which considers the human
resources as a real treasure and a hope for national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
As a fact, The government has fulfilled many of its targets
such as defining the national education system.
</P>
<P>
It includes the two-year kindergarten stage, the nine-year
elementary education of the primary and preparatory phase, and
the three-year high-school phase.
</P>
<P>
The technical school includes the commercial, agricultural and
industrial specializations and each of which involves
sub-specializations.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks Fund for Programs in Former Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
calling for 555 million dollars in 1997 for its humanitarian
programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Although a year has passed since the signing of the Dayton
Peace Agreement, many obstacles still remain in finding lasting
solutions for the more than 2 million refugees and displaced
persons affected by the conflict, according to the UN Department
of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations humanitarian program for 1997 is designed to
meet the objectives of the two-year stabilization period
established following the September elections in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations organizations will gradually phase down
their relief assistance programs during this period, helping
individuals and communities to become self-sufficient and local
institutions to take over full responsibility for the most
vulnerable members of their populations.
</P>
<P>
The appeal gives details of humanitarian efforts which need to
be made throughout the region in 1997, and concentrates on four
main objectives.
</P>
<P>
These are: to accelerate the search for solutions, on a
regional basis, for the repatriation, return and local integration
of refugees and displaced persons; to gradually phase down general
humanitarian relief assistance through improved targeting of
vulnerable groups; to increase support for capacity-building of
governmental and non-governmental institutions, in order to
decrease dependency on external aid; and to step up humanitarian
demining activities, crucial for return and assistance programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac today
won a present of a 12th century terracotta statuette from his
friends on his 64th birthday, reported Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
The statuette, which is in the form of an animal, is originally
from the bank of River Niger in Mali and was made during the time
of Djenne Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The friends of the French president gave him on his birthday
last year a statuette from Colombia, which was made by the Maya
Indians before the arrival of European colonialists in South
America.
</P>
<P>
Dominique de Villepin, secretary general of the Elysee
presidential palace, said that the animal statuette had its feet
on the land, a symbol of strength, protection and dignity
according to ancient African culture.
</P>
<P>
Born on November 19, 1932, and fathered by Francois Chirac and
mothered by Marie-Louise Valette, President Chirac celebrated his
birthday in the Elysee palace for the second time today after his
election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The president is known for his passion for primitive cultures,
and has ordered the building of a museum of primitive cultures in
Paris.

NEW YORK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose as
interest rates sank today, capping one of the best months ever for
the Dow Jones industrials and lifting the Nasdaq market to another
high.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.36 to 6,521.70,
bringing November's stunning advance to 492.32 points, or nearly
8.2 percent. The gain easily beat the Dow's previous one-month
record of 319 in November 1995, but in the percentage-gain was far
short of the 40.2 percent advance the Dow achieved in April 1933.
</P>
<P>
Once again, stocks were supported by bonds, which rallied after
two reports that reinforced the belief of a moderating economy and
the continued strength of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
fell to 6.35 percent. The last time the yield finished that low
was 6.33 percent on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported this morning that personal
consumption spending rose by 0.5 percent in October and personal
income growth was flat in October.

<HEADLINE> War Crime Tribunal Passes 1st Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Tribunal
for War Crime in former Yugoslavia today handed down its first
sentence, jailing for 10 years a young Bosnian Croat involved in
the massacre committed when the Bosnia Serbs captured the
UN-enclave Srebrenica in July last year.
</P>
<P>
According to radio reports monitored here, Bosnian Croat Drazen
Erdemovic, who was in the Serb army at that time, was arrested in
March in Yugoslavia after he had confessed killing about 70
Bosnian Moslems as member of an execution squad in the massacre in
which about 1,200 Moslems were alleged to be killed.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic declared that he was forced to do the murder by the
Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He was transferred to the Hague at the request by the UN-tribunal
this year.
</P>
<P>
The statements by Erdemovic were of great importance to the
tribunal prosecutor, who saw the Bosnian Croat in the first
instance as witness in the accusations against former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and former army chief Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
Erdemovic was accused in May because the murder he committed
according to the tribunal could not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
After passing the sentence, the judge said that what had played
a role was the young age of Erdemovic and the fact that he he had
cooperated with the prosecutor in collecting evidence for the
murders after the capture of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
A tribunal spokesman called this sentence "a landmark" since it
was the first sentence handed down by the UN war crime tribunal
for former Yugoslavia and the first war crime sentence handed down
by an international court in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The UN tribunal has indicted more than 70 suspects but so far
only a few had been detained.
</P>
<P>
In February or March next year, the tribunal will pronounce the
judgement in proceedings against Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic.
