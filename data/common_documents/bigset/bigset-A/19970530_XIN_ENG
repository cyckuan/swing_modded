<P>
NEW DELHI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and seven
others injured in India's Madhya Pradesh today when police opened
fire on a group of workers who attacked the police station, Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
A local police spokesman told PTI that the workers were enraged
at police failure to arrest killers of Ramesh Tiwari, a labor
leader of a cement factory in Satna district of Madya Pradesh.
Tiwari was murdered last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said around 2,000 workers belonging to the cement factory
attacked the police station there to demand the arrest of those
who had murdered Tiwari.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, police first fired tear gas in an attempt to
disperse the workers but later opened fire.
</P>
<P>
Later, curfew was imposed in the area where the cement factory
is located.
</P>
<P>
The situation there was reported to be tense but under control,
PTI said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo will
hold its general elections in April, 1999, President Laurent Kabila
announced after taking his oath here today.
</P>
<P>
"This date will be honored," said the new president in addressing a
grand swearing-in ceremony attended by an audience of about 60,000
people at Kinshasa's largest stadium this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kabila added that a new constitution of the republic will come

</P>
<P>
The president, who had formed his transitional government earlier
this week, said it is impossible to hold an immediate election.

"We have to be prepared, both morally and materially. There must be
a transitional period of two years before we are prepared," he
stressed, adding that the transition program was "made by ourselves,
not under any outside influences."
</P>
<P>
Kabila, whose troops captured capital Kinshasa to topple
former Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko on May 17, said he would

<HEADLINE> UK Govt Considers Option of Buying out Lottery Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British Heritage Secretary Chris
Smoth said today the Labor government may consider buying out the
Camelot lottery consortium or slapping a windfall tax on it.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Smith said the government might
consider buying out Camelot or slapping a windfall tax on its
profits as option. But he added the buyout could be expensive.
</P>
<P>
The move was sparked off by reports that the Camelot's ten
executives rose their pay and bonuses by nearly 40 percent to 2.3
million pound (3.6 million U.S. dollars) last year while National
Lottery ticket sales are sliding.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair was outraged Wednesday by the pay
rise reports and the Camelot chairman Tim Holley was summoned by
the government to explain why his executives have been give
enormous pay rises.
</P>
<P>
Camelot, owned by a consortium of five British and foreign
companies, said the total raised for good causes such as
charities, sports and the arts dropped to 2.1 billion U.S. dollars
in the year to March from 2.3 billion dollars 12 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to say very clearly the very key message that the
national lottery is for prizewinners and the good causes. It is
not for profiteering. I am very angry indeed," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said: "The cost of buying it out might be excessive to
the public purse. We will of course look at all options."
</P>
<P>
The lottery, launched in November 1994, attracts 30 million
Britons every week who are attracted by get-rich jackpots that can
top 16 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> UAE Invests 8 Billion Dollars in Oil in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
pumped more than 8 billion U.S. dollars into its oil sector, the
country's main source of income, during 1993-1996 period,
according to an annual report released today by UAE's Planning
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The funds accounted for one fifth of the country's total
public and private investments of nearly 42 billion dollars
during the period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sources here said that the bulk of the capital
invested in energy was used to maintain and develop existing
onshore and offshore oil fields to boost production capacity and
meet growing global demand for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that such projects had boosted the UAE's
sustainable oil production capacity from around 2.3 million
barrels per day (bpd) in 1993 to 2.6 million bpd in 1995. The
UAE's oil production capacity is set to reach 3 million bpd
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world. Its
oil output quota awarded by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is set at some 2.2 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Dong Retires from Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A high fever caused by a
flu has forced the withdraw of China's world number one Dong
Jiong from the ongoing World Badminton Championships here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team manager Zhou Jincan said, "It would do him no good
if he dragged on. You cannot beat a flu overnight to recover fully
for a top-level match like this."
</P>
<P>
Sue Ashton, the International Badminton chief press officer for
the tournament, said Dong's withdraw would disappoint many
spectators.
</P>
<P>
"The news disappoints me and also the spectators here," she
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
World Championships Referee Torsten Berg said, "It is not good
for the championships... But anyway you have other Chinese men's
singles players here and they also have chance."
</P>
<P>
China's Sun Jun will meet Indonesia's Budi Santoso and fellow
countryman Luo Yigang faces Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the news of Dong's sickness Wednesday night,
Olympic champion Hoyer-Larsen said, "It is a bad news. It is bad
for the championships because Dong is one of the best players her
</P>
<P>
All-England Open men's singles champion Dong started to have a
fever running as high as 39.8 degrees Centigrade since Tuesday
night, which totally wiped out his hope to win his very first
world title,
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Dong, one of the heavy favorites for the world title
here, was due to face tenth-seeded Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of
Denmark in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Stuer-Lauridsen, who has never beat Dong since the Singapore
Open in 1994, was given a walkover and entered the quarter-finals
to meet the winner of the match between Malaysia's Ong Ewe Hock
and Heryanto Arbi of Indoensiae."
</P>
<P>
At last championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1995,
injury-haunted Dong was stopped by Joko Suprianto of Indonesia in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
He lost to Hoyer-Larsen in the final at last year's Olympic
Games in Atlanta, the United States, but won the World Cup last
December.

<HEADLINE> Six Member States of OAU Under Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU) member countries under sanctions for non-payment
of subscriptions has dropped from 18 at the beginning of the year to
six by today.
</P>
<P>
OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash today told a news conference that
membership fee arrears had also been reduced from about 60 million
US dollars to slightly over 35 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The six countries under sanctions, which means they will not take
part in any decision-making or vote, are the Central African
Republic, Chad, Comoros, Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and
Principe.
</P>
<P>
''The other 12 countries, including former Zaire, now Democratic
Republic of Congo, have had sanctions lifted because they have either
paid up in full or partially or had given us payment schedules, like
the Seychelles which will pay 25,000 US dollars every month until
they clear the arrears,'' said Dagash.
</P>
<P>
However, Dagash said since the introduction of sanctions on
defaulting members, many countries were paying their contribution on
time, significantly improving the continental body's financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 30 heads of state and government were
expected to attend the June 2-4 summit, but both Dagash and
Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge could not say which
ones would come.
</P>
<P>
''For security reasons, we will only know just before they
arrive,'' said Mudenge. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Swazi Deputy Prime Minister
Sishayi Nxumalo today called for an urgent referendum in his country
on whether people want to retain the present non-party system or
change to multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Broadcasting Association quoted Nxumalo as saying
in Mbabane that people's views should be sought now to avoid what he
refers to as a bloody conflict in Swaziland, a tiny kingdom with less
than one million population.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo cites Zaire as an example of what can happen if leaders
fail to consult the people on their political views.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi leader accused the opposition, including trade unions, of
sabotaging the current non-party arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo was responding to a call by former Prime Minister Obed
Dlamini for a meeting of traditional leaders, political parties and
other civic groups.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini is calling the meeting to review Swaziland's current
political system, which he described as sick.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only country in Southern Africa which continues to
shut its doors tightly against multi-party system.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourism brochures' description of
Swaziland as "the Switzerland of Africa" was given credibility
last night when snow fell for the first time in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Up to 150 millimetre snow was measured on the north-eastern
part, including the capital, Mbabane, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Children who had never seen snow scooped up handfulls gazing in
wonder, and engaging in snowball fights which they had seen before
only in pictures.
</P>
<P>
Icy roads and fog made driving hazardous since last night and
garages did a brisk trade attending to vehicles stranded by the
roadside.
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning some primary schools closed because of no heating.
Intermittent electricity failures caused problems for shops, offices
and factories.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture said it feared stock losses as
temperatures fell bellow the freezing point, and advised farmers
to herd their animals at night.

<HEADLINE> West Countries Pledge Peacekeeping Assistance to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Britain and France
have pledged to assist African countries in building their
peacekeeping and conflict resolution capacities but the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) said it will accept the offer as long as there
are no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists in Harare today, OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash
said the three western countries adopted a common position recently
to assist Africa in setting up effective mechanisms for peacekeeping
and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said African countries were prepared to receive the assistance
and could produce military personnel to constitute a continental
peacekeeping force once the funds were made available.
</P>
<P>
However, Dagash was quick in pointing out that there must be no
strings attached to any form of assistance African countries received
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
''We accept the offer by these countries but nobody should tell us
how we should use the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the final decision on the offer for assistance would be
made by the OAU's Council of Ministers once some aspects of the
proposed assistance had been made clear, especially that dealing with
the logistics of peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of a peacekeeping force for Africa
should be viewed as complementing the efforts of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we accept it is the responsibility of the Security
Council to maintain peace in the world but we need an African
peacekeeping force to complement the efforts of the world body.''

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Defends Plans to Revalue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Faced with blunt criticism from the
German central bank, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel today
went out to defend his plan to revalue upwards the bank's gold
reserves in order to enable Germany to qualify for the single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
Waigel told reporters Thursday that not a single mark from the
revaluation would be funneled into the debt-burdened federal
budget but would go instead into a fund to draw down a debt of 350
billion marks (207 billion U.S. dollars) left over by former East
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The plan unveiled earlier this month by Waigel has met a storm
of protest and provoked public split with the central bank
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued late Wednesday, the German central bank,
Bundesbank, said that Waigel's plan would interfere in its
accounting practices and thus compromising its independence.
</P>
<P>
The bank also warned that revaluing the reserves risked the
credibility of both the central bank and the future single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Waigel insisted that the option did enjoy Bundesbank's support,
the difference existed only on the timetable.
</P>
<P>
The German government wants to materialize the plan within this
year while the Bundesbank agrees only to revalue its reserves in
1999 as part of the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest criticism came Thursday from Rudolf Scharping,
parliamentary leader of Bonn's main opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD), who demanded that Waigel should step down.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government's behavior endangers that what we most
urgently need: international credibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite growing international concern over the German row, the
European Commission Thursday reportedly denied that the German
events would pose a danger to the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
But according to a spokesman for Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the
European Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, the
Commission had asked Bonn for details of the revaluation plan for
closer study.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Troops Leaving Bosnia on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today he expected U.S. troops to leave Bosnia on
schedule in June 1998, but great efforts must be made to stabilize
the country in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
"If we work like crazy in the next 13 months, do I believe we
can fulfill our mission," he told a news conference with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
"But I think we're going to have to make some very tough
decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't play around with this, we can't just sort of hang
around and then disappear in a year and expect the Dayton process
to go forward," Clinton added. "We have a lot of work to do in the
next year."
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 8,500 peacekeeping troops in Bosnia
as part of the NATO-led stabilization force.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said talks between Clinton and Blair
included the implementation of key civilian elements of the Dayton
accords covering such issues as resettlement of refugees.

JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first gas well in
West Cape Province started delivering gas today.
</P>
<P>
The gas well is situated near Mossel Bay, some 350 km east of Cape

The huge investment sponsored by Mossgas, a company that is
exploiting gas fields in the province, is forecast to yield a net
return of three billion Rands (682 million dollars), according to
sources closed to the project.
</P>
<P>
"The flow rates of gas and condensate from this well exceed our
expectations and were confident that the other three wells, which
will be completed over the next three months, will yield equally
good results," Mossgas's Chief Exectuive David Day said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Democratic Congo's President Urges National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of audience sang the
new national athem of "stand up, Congolese" to hail Laurent Kabila as
he was sworn in as the new president of the Democratic Republic of
Congo in capital Kinshasa this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I, L. D. Kabila, president of the republic, swear fedality to the
nation and obedience to the legal provisions of the transitional
authority," said Kabila in taking his oath in Kinshasa's largest
stadium hosting 60,000 people and five foreign heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by presidents of five neighboring
countries, including Jose Eduard dos Santos of Angola, Yoweri Moseveni
of Uganda, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda,
and Piere Buyoya of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the grand ceremony, Kabila called for
national unity and reconciliation, saying it is key to create a stable
and peaceful environment after the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"A corrupted Zaire has collapsed. A new Congo has stood up. We need
unity and teamwork to build a new country," said Kabila, whose troops
of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo
(ADFL) took over capital Kinshasa to topple former Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The president said the ultimate task of the new transitional
government and the Congolese people is national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
He promised to build a new telecommunication and transport network
in the central African country, which has for yearS been tormented by
bad roads and lack of viable telecommunication systems.
</P>
<P>
"These problems have been neglected for so long under the old
regime. Now it is the time to reverse the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also promised to create new jobs and wage a fight
againt unemployment in the country which was rated by the United
Nations among the least developed countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the former
Zaire was only 110 US dollars, the second lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila, who renamed his country the Democratic
Republic of Congo, also vowed to abolish the local currency
Zaire, which has been tormenting the people with a rocketing
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kabila announced a two-year transitional period before
the general elections are held.
</P>
<P>
"We will hold the general elections in April 1999. A new
constitution of the republic will come into being in October 1998. And
these promises will be honored," said Kabila, who dismissed the
possibility to hold an immediate presidential election, citing lack
of preparationS.
</P>
<P>
"The nation has to be prepared, both morally and materially, for
the election. That's why we need a two-year transition period," he
explained. enditem

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Reject Israel's Secret Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
rejected the so-called secret map on final settlement formulated
by Israel, in which the Palestinians will get back only 40
percent of the territories.
</P>
<P>
According to a detailed map published by today's Hebrew daily
Haaretz, Israel will retain control over 60 percent of the
Palestinian territories, including Greater Jerusalem, Jordan
Valley, settlements and strategic roads.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the secret map will be presented by Israel to
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in future permanent
talks. But Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu swiftly
denied the report, saying he has indeed a map in his mind, but not
the one on the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Palestinian officials strongly criticized Israel
for taking another unilateral step in formulating the final
settlement even before the two sides begin the talks on it.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser to PNA President Yasser Arafat, denounced
Israeli government for sending a negative message to the
Palestinians that direct talks are not worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
Jibil Rajoub, head of Palestinian Security Services in West
Bank, told reporters in Ramallah that the Palestinian side
rejects any conditions imposed by Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all the occupied Palestinian land of West
Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem "should be given back to the
Palestinians in order to establish an independent state." "This
is the only condition, this is the only way, this is the only
option to have peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub was among several Palestinian officials who attended a
meeting today held between Arafat and visiting Israeli lawmaker
Shlomo Ben-Ami, one of Israeli opposition Labor party's
leadership candidates.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said Arafat is skeptical about the report on the
so-called secret map and prudently refrained from making comments.
</P>
<P>
"He (Arafat) doesn't want to make declarations that can be
interpreted in a negative way. His attitude is rather skeptical
to this, but he was not outspoken about it," Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat considered it too early to present his own map now and
believed that the final-status talks will not begin before
outstanding issues related to the Oslo accords are implemented,
Ben-Ami added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel and the PNA should begin the
final-status talks last May and conclude them by May 1999. The PNA
hoped to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its
capital, which was rejected by the current Israeli government led
by Likud party.
</P>
<P>
The previous Labor government first began the final-status
talks with the PNA a year ago, but the talks have since been
frozen due to the Likud's rise to power in the Israeli elections a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rajoub issued a strong warning to Israel against
the continuing deadlock in the peace process. He said if Israel
continues its policies of refusing to implement the already signed
agreements, violence can break out.
</P>
<P>
"I think all options are open, including violence, and
including confrontation," Rajoub said.

killed in the coup last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations-chartered boat that has carried 97 people to
Conakry is expected to make a second trip today.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Revive Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Minister for Industries
and Trade, William Shija said today that the government plans to
revive all textile mills in the country within one year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of textile manufactures here, Shija said
he would use the manufacturers recommendations in drawing up a
martial plan for the revival of the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that was in recognition of the significant
contribution of the industry to the country's exchequer revenue.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the collapsing of the local textile industry
was a result of various factors including poor management
particularly in public factories, heavy indebtedness and lack of
working capital.
</P>
<P>
He told the manufacturers that the government was committed to
reviving the industry and he was optimistic that by June next
year all textile factories would be fully revived.
</P>
<P>
"We want to wear our own clothes," he said calling for closer
co-operation by the manufacturers so as to attain the goal.
</P>
<P>
Shija said the government was currently preparing a program on
the implementation of the industrial policy as part of efforts to
revive the entire industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that while approaching the 21st century,
the country was still exporting raw cotton citing 500,000 bales
exported last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is shameful to do that at this time when we are
approaching the century of science and technology," he said
adding that the government was also planning to ban the exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the meeting, the manufacturers mentioned
higher tax rates and uncontrollled importation of finished
textiles as the major reasons for the collapsing of the industry.
</P>
<P>
They recommended for the reduction of sales tax from the
current 30 percent to 5 percent and called for steps to ensure
fair competition in the local market.
</P>
<P>
The production manager of the Ubungo Spinning Mill in Dar es
Salaam, Johnrianney Ndyamukama, asked the government to declare
the textile a national industry and recommended for controlled
prices of cotton and accelerating privatisation of the
state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that all dead factories should be exempted
of all types of taxes for a given time to enable them pick up and
the government should inherit all heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
In early 80s, Tanzania had 35 textile manufacturing units with

CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's tourism industry had a good
time in the first quarter of this year, with the tourists' number
standing at 931,000, or a 13.4 percent rise over the same period
in 1996, said Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency quoted the minister as saying
tourist traffic to Egypt, the number of tourist nights and hotels'
occupancy was at a record high last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists in 1996 was recorded at 4 million and
tourist nights at 24 million.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the successful, highly energetic and
world-wide Egyptian tourist media campaigns and to the increasing
tourist attractions in Egypt, the diversification of the Egyptian
tourist markets and the amelioration of services offered to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism revenues have become the country's second main source
of foreign currency, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton
called on the Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas here this
afternoon to "lay down their guns for good" in an effort to give a
fresh impetus to the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Clinton said: "You can't say we'll talk
and shoot -- we'll talk when we're happy and shoot when (we) are
not."
</P>
<P>
"Every political process in the world is a struggle for
principled compromise, which means when it's over, no one is 100
percent happy," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, on a one-day visit to Britain, stressed that efforts
to achieve a lasting peace in Northern Ireland could only succeed
"if there's an unequivocal ceasefire, in deed and in word. Again,
I urge the IRA to lay down their guns for good."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Blair thanked the U.S. government for its
efforts to end the Northern Ireland conflict and voiced optimism
that a solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has played, and I have no doubt, will
continue to play a helpful role. I believe it's possible that we
can move this process forward but it's got to be done with care,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland is
due to resume in Belfast on June 3, but British government has
made it clear that Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA, will not
be allowed to join the talks unless the IRA guerrillas call a
credible ceasefire.

KINSHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of Angola, Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia attended the swearing-in ceremony of
Laurent Kabila as President of the new-born Democratic Congo
today with warm expectations of better ties between them.
</P>
<P>
Their attendance was seen as the most-needed support for
Kabila who is facing hard tasks of national reconciliation as
well as political and socio-economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more border problems between Angola and
Zaire," predicted Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, saying
brotherhood and friendly relationship would be established
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"With your swearing-in as the president of this great nation,
we have reasons to hope for peace and stability in this region,"
he said when making the first speech to congratulate Kabila at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni urged to end hostilities
between the Anglophonic and Francophone peoples in Africa, noting
that instead of animosity, brotherhood is needed for bettering
ties among central-southern African states.
</P>
<P>
"We are brothers. We are neighbors in the region. Therefore we
need regional integration instead of confrontation," said
Museveni, drawing a big applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
He said as Kabila now is in power, there will be no border
restrictions between Uganda and Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
"I hope someday I can drive from Kampala to Kinshasa without
any problems," said Museveni, while urging the construction of a
sound road system connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba called on the
people in the Democratic Congo to be united around Kabila and
make huge efforts to realize national reconciliation and
reconstruct the war-damaged economy.
</P>
<P>
Current Burundian leader Major Pierre Buyoya also sent his
congratulation to Kabila, noting now is time to revitalize the
prospect of the economic community of the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Launch Debate on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO foreign ministers
formally launched on Thursday the debate on which candidate
countries should be invited to join the alliance in the first
wave, when they meet here to lay the groundwork for NATO's
landmark summit in Madrid on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting held in the Portugese resort town of Sintra, the
ministers agreed that NATO's door should remain open after the
first wave.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend to our Heads of State and Government to make
explicit our commitment that the Alliance remains open to the
accession of any other European state," the ministers said in a
Communique issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the ministers' discussion, differences emerged on the
scope of the group of countries which will receive the invitation
to join the alliance in the first wave at the Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO sources, the United States, together with
Iceland, expressed its preference for a smaller enlargement,
allowing only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the three
strong favorites, to be the first new members since Spain joined
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
But France and Italy, with the back of other southern member
states, were pressing hard to embrace Romania and Slovenia in the
first group.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Germany and several other countries had not made up
their mind on this issue but intended to support the U.S.' idea,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO officials stressed that no decision had been
taken on the name list.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the first formal discussion on enlargement
candidates. There were still many to come in the coming 40 days
before Madrid," U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that NATO Secretary General Javier Solana had
been looking for guidance to find consensus on a number of
countries by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"He also wants to visit the capitals of aspiring members to
inform them formally of the decision," a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was called by Mr Solana as "very
productive", the ministers also tackled the tricky issue of whether
to invite the leaders of all applicant countries to Madrid or only
the leaders of those set to be invited to join.
</P>
<P>
They also approved to set up a new Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council to replace the existing six-year old North Atlantic
Co-operation Council.
</P>
<P>
This new Council, which will comprise the 16 NATO members and
27 partner countries, is aimed to promote political consultations
and military cooperations between NATO and its partners and to get
partners more involved in NATO's PfP(Partnership for Peace)
activities.
</P>
<P>
In the margins of the meeting, the ministers also initialed a
security pact with Ukraine, giving that country a special status
above those of partnership, but not going as far as the deal with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The accord enables the two sides to set up a NATO-Ukraine
Commission for their consultations on European security and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also reviewed an overhall of alliance' command
structures to make it more flexible and allow it to carry out more
varied missions such as the current peacekeeping mission in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Africa Moves to Enhance Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- African ministers met here today
and decided to form a council of ministers for the proposed
African Economic Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the efforts by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to put prominent attention to economic issues and
will contribute to the establishment of a continental common
market, OAU's spokesman Ibrahim Dagash told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Council of Ministers has traditionally laid emphasis
on political and social issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said the
OAU ministers have examined the operations of regional economic
groupings such as the Southern African Development Community, the
Common Market for East and Southern Africa and the Economic
Community for West African States.
</P>
<P>
The ministers held talks in the past two days to hammer out
the agenda for OAU's 33rd summit scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the OAU has reviewed the economic integration and
linkages among regional groupings for the development of the
entire continent.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations to be made by the council of ministers may
result in the signing of documents for the establishment of a
continental economic body at OAU's forthcoming summit, said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary that we sign a document establishing a
linkage of various regional economic groupings," Mudenge said.

<HEADLINE> British Minister Calls for Effective Moves for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior British official in
newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government urged
here this evening the world community to take "effective moves" to
push the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz in Beirut, Derek Fatchett, the British Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs, denied any intention of the European Union
(EU) to compete with the United States in the peace process in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
But the EU and the U.S. "should coordinate and use their
resources in an effective way in order to help activating the
peace process," the British minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett arrived here this afternoon from Damascus, the capital
of Syria, on the last leg of his Middle East tour, which had
already taken him to Jordan, Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Middle East trip was aimed at finding out
about the situation of the peace process in the region and
"talking with our Middle East partners on the ways for the EU to
help advancing the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The British official reiterated the necessity to achieve
progress in order to give the people hope and expectation for the
future.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister stressed that he hoped the EU to
play an effective role in the Middle East peace process
"especially after the U.S. has stopped playing its role."
</P>
<P>
"Of course we did not look at the (EU's) role as one
contesting with that of the U.S., but complementary and supporting
for the U.S.' role," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz added that he briefed the British official the negativity
resulting from the positions of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett also held talks here this evening respectively with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri. He is scheduled to return home Friday morning.

CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Kuwait have signed an agreement on a loan
of 10 million Kuwaiti dinars (33 million U.S. dollars) for water
purifying projects in Beirut, the Daily Star published in the
Lebanese capital reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed Wednesday, added to 60 million
dinars (200 million dollars) the total loans Kuwait has so far
extended for electricity, community, transport and water projects
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- International oil demand during the second half
of this year will decrease in comparison with 1996 due to expected
low demand from Asia and moderate temperatures during the coming
winter, an oil expert claimed.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the oil demand might also be attributed to the
slowness of refinery operations in international companies, Kuwait
News Agency today quoted Fareed Mohamadi, a senior executive at
Kuwaiti Petroleum Finance Company, as telling a seminar here last
night.
</P>
<P>
Oil demand increased in 1996 due to a surge in refining
capabilities in Asia, alterations in the U.S. stock and cold
winter in northern part of the globe. High demand pushed the oil
prices to rise by about 3 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohamadi attributed an increase in oil supply in
international markets to an expansion of oil supply from Latin
America, the North Sea in addition to Iraq's return to the oil
market.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
production has steadily grown over the past years and is projected
to climb by two million barrels per day to around 45 million
barrels per day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) pumped more than 8
billion U.S. dollars into its oil sector, the country's main
source of income, during 1993-1996 period, according to an annual
report released today by UAE's Planning Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The funds accounted for one fifth of the country's total
public and private investments of nearly 42 billion dollars
during the period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sources here said that the bulk of the capital
invested in energy was used to maintain and develop existing
onshore and offshore oil fields to boost production capacity and
meet growing global demand for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that such projects had boosted the UAE's
sustainable oil production capacity from around 2.3 million
barrels per day (bpd) in 1993 to 2.6 million bpd in 1995. The
UAE's oil production capacity is set to reach 3 million bpd
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world. Its
oil output quota awarded by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is set at some 2.2 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's tourism industry had a good time in the first

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan Warlord Wants Peace With Former Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghan northern warlord Rashid
Dostum said here today that he wanted to make peace with a former
right-hand aide whose betrayal directly led to the warlord's
military setback.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make peace with General Abdul Malik," Dostum was
quoted as saying by the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would be delighted if the Turkish government
could mediate between himself and Malik, who defected to the
Taliban, the religious militia that captured the Dostum stronghold
of Mazar-i-Sharif last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The ousted Afghan warlord, an ethnic Uzbek, fled to Ankara by a
civilian aircraft on May 25 following a short stay in
Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the Stad Hotel last
Sunday, Dostum had vowed to continue the fighting against the
Islamic Taliban in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He, however, denied that he had received military and
financial assistance, but political support, from Turkey,
</P>
<P>
Dostum also stated that he had no intention of seeking
political asylum from the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The defection of Abdul Malik was the immediate cause for the
fall of the stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif, which brought virtually
whole Afghanistan under the control of the fundamentalist group.
</P>
<P>
Since he fled to Ankara, Dostum has been visited by some
Turkish government officials and party personages, but Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller have
not indicated so far that they will meet the ousted Afghan
warlord.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going to
evacuate Americans in Sierra Leone Friday morning because of
sporadic gunfire in the capital of Freetown, the Pentagon said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The situation (in Freetown) is not stable at all. There is a
good deal of sporadic gunfire," Pentagon spokesman Army Col.
Richard Bridges told reporters.
</P>
<P>
About 250 American citizens will be helicoptered Friday to the
helicopter ship Kearsarge, now riding about 20 miles (32km)

<HEADLINE> Political Uncertainty in France, Gold Dispute in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The political uncertainty caused by
the legislative election result in France and the dispute between
the German government and the Bundesbank over a reevaluation of
the German gold reserves has brought new uncertainty to the plan
of the single European currency euro.
</P>
<P>
After suffering a humiliating setback in the first round of the
legislative elections last Sunday, the French center-right
majority has for the first time indicated that France might not
make more sacrifices to meet the criteria set by the Maastricht
treaty to cut the public deficit to below 3 percent of its gross
domestic product to qualify for the euro.
</P>
<P>
Three days from the next round of the legislative elections,
the French center-right coalition of Rally for the Republic and
Union for French Democracy has moved a step closer to the position
of the opposition Socialist Party by bending its position on the
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Former National Assembly President Philippe Seguin, who is most
likely to be the next prime minister if the center-right maintains
its majority in parliament, said this week that it would be a
"masochism" if the Maastricht treaty criteria impose an "organized
restriction" on public spending in France.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Sarkozy, a Gaullist parliament member and former
minister, said today that France does not have to reject the euro
if it cannot attain the objective of cutting the public deficit to
below 3 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quarrel in Germany between the government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and ther Bundesbank over a government plan
to reevaluate the gold reserves of the German central bank has
also cast a shadow over the plan of launching the euro.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced on May 17 that
the government plans to increase the circulation of 15 billion
marks (about 8 billion U.S. dollars) in order to reduce the public
deficit to below 3 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank rejected the government plan and warned that the
move would result in a loss in trust in the stability of the
future European currency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rise of the French Socialist Party in the first
round of the legislative elections has strengthened the voice of
leftist forces in Europe which are opposed to launching the single
currency at all social costs.
</P>
<P>
French Socialist Party chief Lionel Jospin, who would be
France's next prime minister if his party and its leftist allies
won the second round of the legislative elections next Sunday,
criticized as a "trick" the German government's plan to use the
country's gold reserves to do its book-keeping.
</P>
<P>
In a symbolic European action, Jospin and German
Social-Democrat leader Oskar Lafontaine Wednesday launched a joint
appeal for the inclusion of a social clause into the Maastricht
treaty on European construction.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Calls Oklahoma Bombing Defendant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Timothy McVeigh bombed the
federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 in the United States,
said the prosecution at his trial in Denver, Colorado, today.
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, prosecutor Larry Mackey said evidence
clearly proved McVeigh was responsible for the April 19, 1995
blast at the Alfred P. Murrah building that killed 168 people and
wounded more than 500 others.
</P>
<P>
Mackey said defendant Timothy McVeigh had committed "a crime of
ghastly proportions."
</P>
<P>
"Who could do such a thing?" news reports quoted Mackey as
saying. "The answer is clear. Tim McVeigh did it."
</P>
<P>
McVeigh sat without moving as Mackey began what was planned as
a three-hour closing argument today, describing how McVeigh taught
himself to build bombs and enlisted the help of co-defendant Terry
Nichols, who will be tried later, and unindicted co-conspirator
Michael Fortier, who testified for the prosecution that McVeigh
had told him of the bombing plan in advance.
</P>
<P>
Later, he said McVeigh "very carefully, very deliberately
selected his target, the Murrah Federal Building."
</P>
<P>
Mackey held up the T-shirt McVeigh was wearing when he was
arrested. The shirt bore a picture of Abraham Lincoln and a legend
quoting Lincoln as saying the tree of liberty periodically needs
to be refreshed "with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
</P>
<P>
Testimony during the trial showed McVeigh hated the federal
government and was especially upset with the government handling
of the Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Texas.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Management of Globalized Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today launched a
new policy study report, urging developing countries to meet the
challenges in managing recent surges in private capital flows.
</P>
<P>
The 406-page report, entitled "Private Capital Flows to
Developing Countries: The Road to Financial Integration,"
indicated that while lower global interest rates provided an
important impetus to the surge in private capital flows to
developing countries in the early 1990s, these flows have entered
a new phase, reflecting structural forces that are leading to
progressive financial integration of developing countries into
world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank chief economist and the senior
vice president who was the chairman of the U.S. Council of
Economic Advisories to President Bill Clinton, told a press
conference held for the report launching, "We are at a critical
time in the history of economic development. Developing countries
have taken the first step toward long-term economic growth by
implementing important economic reforms and opening their markets
to global competition. And the global economy is responding to
these changes."
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the accomplishments of recent years take root,
these countries must maintain macroeconomic vigilance and take the
next step of strengthening the network of financial institutions
that support economic activity," Stiglitz added.
</P>
<P>
The report said there can be no doubt that developing countries
have entered a new age of globalized private capital.
</P>
<P>
In line with the World Bank data, net private capital flows to
developing countries exceeded 240 billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
and the figure could be 265 billion dollars if South Korea is
included. The flows are nearly six times greater than they were at
the beginning of the 1990s, and almost four times more than the
peak reached during the 1978-82 commercial bank lending boom.
</P>
<P>
Private capital flows now dwarf official flows in terms of
relative importance. They are now five times the size of official
flows. It is noticeable that only five years ago official flows to
developing countries were larger than private flows.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are now a much important destination for
global private capital. Their share of global FDI (foreign direct
investment) flows is now almost 40 percent, compared with 15
percent in 1990, and their share of global portfolio equity flows
is now almost 30 percent, as against some 2 percent before the
start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that the importance of private flows has
also increased markedly in the economies of developing countries,
from 4.1 percent of domestic investment in 1990 to nearly 20
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There has been a remarkable broadening in the composition of
private capital flows. Whereas traditional commercial bank lending
used to account for more than 65 percent of all private flows, FDI
has now emerged as the most important component of private flows,
and starting from a negligible level in 1989, portfolio flows --
both bonds and equities -- have increased sharply to topping over
a third of total private capital flows.
</P>
<P>
Private capital flows to developing countries have proved to be
surprisingly resilient. Despite the increases in U.S. interest
rates in 1994 and the Mexican financial crisis in 1995, private
flows increase a further 55 percent during the last three years,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Financial integration is expected to deepen further and
encompass a growing number of countries, the World Bank report
noted. Given the continuing decline in investment risks, the
higher expected rates of return, opportunities for portfolio
diversification, and the growing interest of investors in emerging
markets, net private capital flows to developing countries are
likely to be sustained at the high levels of the 1990s. But there
are likely to be sizable year-to-year fluctuations and large
variations across countries.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Ambassador Asks US Troop Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's ambassador to
Washington said today that he had handed a petition to the U.S.
State Department, urging the United States to dispatch troops to
his country so that an elected government, toppled by a military
coup on the weekend, could be restored.
</P>
<P>
At a rally of about 50 banner-waving Sierra Leonean
demonstrators, Ambassador John Leigh said the petition called on
Washington "to work with other nations and international
organizations to act decisively to end the crisis, by force of
arms if necessary."
</P>
<P>
Leigh said he wanted 1,200 marines aboard the Navy helicopter
ship Kearsage, which is 32km offshore from the West African
country to evacuate Americans from the capital of Freetown, to
support West African peace forces "to bring in law and order" and
end a "reign of terror" by the coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Nigeria has sent troops to bolster a contingent of
the peace-keeping force already in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Leigh said he had already spoken to U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State George Moose about the situation in his country and planned
to hold further talks later today.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Washington was "very supportive, but American
policy right now is to first of all secure the safety of American
citizens in Freetown."

<HEADLINE> Child Malnutrition, Prevalent in Iraq: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The malnutrition rate among
children under five years of age has reached as high as 25 percent
in central/south Iraq today, compared with 9.2 percent in 1991,
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
In a release on the nutrition status survey conducted by the
Iraqi Ministry of Health, the UNICEF and the World Food Program,
the UN agency reported that the survey was made in 87 primary
health care centers in 15 governorates in central/south Iraq
during the three-day period of the National Polio Immunization
Days from April 12 to 14. A sample of 15,000 children was also
examined to assess their nutritional status.
</P>
<P>
Findings from the study highlight the alarming level of chronic
malnutrition (low height for age) among children under five which
has reached an average of 27.5 percent. The survey also shows the
following results:
</P>
<P>
-- every governorate in central/south Iraq has a rate of
chronic malnutrition of at least 20 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- the children most at risk are under two years old;
</P>
<P>
-- the level of malnutrition is similar for boys and girls; and
</P>
<P>
-- there is little or no difference between urban and rural
areas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on JLG's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) plays
the only role of "liaison" and does not have any monitoring
function.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from reporters here this afternoon,
Ambassador Zhao Jihua, Chinese senior representative on the JLG,
said that he did not agree with the word "monitoring" used by the
British side to describe the JLG's function.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the function of the JLG. The Joint Declaration
clearly states that throughout its existence the JLG is not an
organ of power, but an organ of liaison," he said.
</P>
<P>
When the Sino-British Joint Declaration was still under
discussion, he noted, the British side insisted on using the term
"liaison" to name the group, because it was believed that the
only role the group plays is "liaison". The Chinese side agreed
with the proposal and the group was named as a group of liaison.
</P>
<P>
"Now difference has arisen between the two sides over this
question, but I don't think this is an urgent issue at this
stage. Before the transition of Hong Kong we should concentrate
our efforts on discussing and resolving urgent issues concerning
Hong Kong's transition and the transfer of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After July 1, 1997 we will have plenty of time to discuss this
question," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Chinese government's position that the issue
of Hong Kong before July 1, 1997 is something between the Chinese
and British governments, and the two governments should hold
consultations on related Hong Kong issues through the JLG, while
after July 1, 1997 Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative
Region of China, and the Chinese central government will practise
the policy of high-degree autonomy for the HKSAR in accordance
with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"After July 1, 1997 Hong Kong affairs will be internal affairs
of China, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere in the
internal affairs of China," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Muster Ousted at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Former French Open champion Thomas
Muster clashed out of the current grand slam tournament Friday
after lossing to world's 66th-ranked player, Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten ousted the fifth-seeded Austrian in five sets, 6-7
(3-7), 6-1, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, to advance to the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Muster, the 1995 champion, dominated clay court tennis in both
1995 and 1996, losing only five matches on the surface.
</P>
<P>
Friday's loss was Muster's seventh on clay this year. He had
struggled in his first two rounds here, winning one in five sets
and one in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, No. 4 Goran Ivanisevic lost in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
On Friday's other games, defending champion Steffi Graf
overcame a slow start to advance to the fourth round with a 7-6
(7-4), 6-1 victory over Magui Serna of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the No. 2 seed, looked sluggish in the first set and made
17 unforced errors, netting balls and often hitting long.
</P>
<P>
But she recovered to win the tiebreaker with a couple of
blazing forehand winners. She then rolled through the second set,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
In other action, the men's 15th seed, Marc Rosset of
Switzerland, defeated Frenchman Lionel Roux in four sets, 6-3,
5-7, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez beat
Caroline Dhenin of France, 6-2, 6-1, and 11th seed Amanda Coetzer
of South Africa defeated Meike Babel of Germany, 6-4, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets Porto Mayor in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORTO, Portugal, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan met today with Fernando Gomes, the mayor of Porto,
Portugal's second largest city and major port and industrial
center.
</P>
<P>
Gomes extended welcome to Li, chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
who is on a five-day official goodwill visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Gomes said the CPPCC delegation comes at a time when Macao
will return to its motherland in about two and a half years. The
visit is of great significance for promoting friendly relations
and cooperation between Portugal and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have signed a joint declaration to the
effect that China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Li said since his arrival in the city he has been deeply
impressed by the friendly sentiments shown by the local people.
</P>
<P>
He said China's Shanghai city has established sister
relationship with Porto, Portugal's industrial center, which is
famous for its cork, wine and ship-building industries, and
renowned historical sites. This will help promote Sino-Portuguese
friendship and cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Li viewed some workshops of the Amorim
Group, the world's leading supplier of cork, the outer bark of the
cork oak. Portugal produced over half of the cork goods in the
world. After the meeting, Li visited a Ramos Pinto wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon Thursday,
and is scheduled to leave for Greece Saturday. He is on a
three-nation European tour, which also covers Germany.

<HEADLINE> Liberals Set to Win Canada's June 2 Election, Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Liberal Party is poised
to win Canada's June 2 national election, according to polls
published today.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal support appears to have stabilized at 39 percent of
decided voters after a steady erosion since the campaign began 33
days ago, suggests a Globe and Mail/Environics Research Group
poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was taken from May 25 to 28, found the
Progressive Conservative Party got the support of 20 percent of
decided voters, the Reform Party 19 percent, the New Democratic
Party 11 percent and the Bloc Quebecois 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
A computerized projection based on the poll would give the
Liberal Party 179 seats in the 301-seat House of Commons, enabling
it to form a majority government for the second time.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party would have 55 seats and thus snatch the
Official Opposition status away from the separatist Bloc
Quebecois, which would get 42 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Conservative Party would increase its
parliamentary seats from two to 16 and the New Democratic Party
maintain its nine seats.
</P>
<P>
A Southam New/CTV poll also predicts a Liberal victory in
Monday's election.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Liberals' bid to form a second consecutive majority now
"hangs by the slimmest of threads," said the poll, which was
conducted by the Angus Reid Group from May 22 to 27.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll shows Liberal support among decided voters has
tumbled to 36 percent, six points down from a similar poll in
early May.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals is followed by the Progressive Conservative Party
at 24 percent, the Reform Party at 19 percent, the New Democratic
Party at 11 percent and the Bloc Quebecois at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggests the Reform Party is headed for official
Opposition status, but the resurgent Bloc Quebecois campaign could
again frustrate the Reform with a late charge.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a photo finish both in terms of whether the
Liberals get a majority and whether the Reform becomes official
opposition," pollster Angus Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Canada could have a House of Commons divided like never before.
For the first time in Canadian parliamentary history, each region
of the country could be represented by a different party, the poll
shows.
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Conservative Party, based on the growing
popularity of its leader Jean Charest, is ahead in Atlantic
Canada. And the Bloc Quebecois has recovered its lead in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Ontario remains the ruling Liberals' only stronghold, while
Western Canada has firmly embraced its political offspring the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to wake up after the election and see
something we've never seen before in this country: Four regions of
Canada represented by four parties," the pollster noted.

ULAN BATOR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's President-elect
Nachagyn Bagbandy today pledged to continue the country's open
foreign policy and make efforts to improve its international
status.
</P>
<P>
"As the head of state, I will strive to develop and consolidate
the nation's foreign policy, and to improve Mongolia's
international status," Bagbandy told the Great Hural (parliament)
after it confirmed his qualifications for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said he would make efforts to create favorable environment
in the country for foreign investment, and to guarantee national
independence and security through political and diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
This was Bagbandy's first open speech on the nation's domestic
and foreign policies since his election in the May 18 presidential
election. He will be sworn in on June 20, in accordance with a
decision the parliament made today.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, he said Mongolia would move on the road of
reform beginning in 1990, to realize genuine democracy and market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that each step of the reform process should be
aimed at reducing poverty and unemployment, promoting production
and maintaining social order.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy, 47, of the People's Revolutionary Party, won the
presidential election by defeating incumbent President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, of the ruling Democratic Union Coalition
of the National Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party.
</P>

<P>
CHANGSHA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Provincial People's Congress of central-south China's Hunan
Province recently approved a local code, or the "Hunan Provincial
Administrative Regulations on Tourism", to put an end to unlawful
activities in the business.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will take effect on June 1, 1997, according to
Zhang Jimin, director of the Provincial Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Similar codes have been adopted by the provincial governments
of Hainan, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's code focuses on environmental protection, cultural
relics and scenic resorts and spots, and defines the rights and
responsibilities of tourists. Moreover, it also deals with travel
agencies and administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has had a tourism boom over recent years, and had
received more than 229,000 visitors from overseas in the past five
years, and earned foreign exchange earnings of some 100 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 major tourism development zones in the province.

<HEADLINE> UK Junior Doctors Dissatisfied with Working Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- More and more university graduates
of medical science do not want to work in Britain as doctors
because of poor working conditions, a research report warned today.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Lambert, a statistician at Oxford University, and his
colleagues surveyed 2,600 medical graduates who have been trained
since 1993 and asked them whether they planned to practice in
Britain, about 25 percent answered no.
</P>
<P>
Long hours and heavy workload of junior doctors in Britain
could be partly to blame for the graduates' reluctance to work,
said Lambert and his colleagues in the British Medical Journal
(BMJ) published today.
</P>
<P>
"Although early intentions do not inevitably correspond with
future careers, the doctors' responses show an increased lack of
commitment to a medical career in the United Kingdom," the report
warned.
</P>
<P>
"This is not before time; without sustained improvement the
risk of doctors disappearing from medicine is real. Many are
highly critical and disaffected," the report added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today
released a State Council decision to revise the former provisional
regulation on information networks hooked up with international

<P>
More criteria are required to be met for local units with
access to the international computer networks.
</P>
<P>
All such units to engage in business activities related to
international networking now must apply for a license. In their
application, these organizations should provide data on the nature

<HEADLINE> Cancer: Number Two Killer in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Cancer is the second most common
cause of death in Cyprus, Health Minister Christos Solomis said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference on comprehensive care
entitled "Focus on Cancer Pain," Solomis said cancer is the second
killer only to cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
Solomis told the conference that in Cyprus 1,600 new cases are
registered every year, which give an incidence of 220 cases per
100,000 population.
</P>
<P>
"In males the most common forms are cancers of the large
bowel, the urinary bladder and the lung; and in females, those
of the breast, the cervix, uterus and the large bowel," said
the Minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these forms "are closely related with the
lifestyles of the Cypriots, mainly their smoking habits, their
incorrect nutrition and extensive exposure to the sun."
</P>
<P>
The Minister pointed out that the fight against cancer must be
given high priority on every country's health agenda. In Cyprus,
according to Solomis, the National Cancer Control Committee has
created a program giving particular emphasis on the priority
areas, focusing on legislative action, public information
programs and educational programs for health professionals.
</P>
<P>
He said the treatment offered to cancer patients in the
country is considered to be of a high standard and all fields of
clinical oncology, in general, are well developed and quite
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with the completion of constructions
and functioning of the new oncology center, where diagnostic and
therapeutic services will be offered, clinical services on the
island will be further improved, the Cypriot Minister said.

here today that the two sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison

Hong Kong's handover ceremony, while noting that there still
remain a number of problems unresolved.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing following a three-day meeting of the JLG,
Zhao Jihua, head of the Chinese team on the group, said that "most
handover ceremony-related issues are of universal concern not only
for the Hong Kong community but also for the rest of the world."

"On the question of handover ceremony, I think we have laid
down a basic arrangement and I should say, generally speaking, we
have got a deal," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we're confident to say that there will be a

During detailed discussions, Zhao said, "we've generally
completed our work in regards to the scope of international guests
to be invited, the lay-out of the venue of the handover ceremony,
and the program of the handover ceremony."
</P>
<P>
However, he went on to say, "there still remain much work to be
done for both sides in the next some 30 days." Both sides should
continue their efforts in dealing with the remaining problems such
as the transfer of government, including the transfer of archives
and government assets, and deal with the subject of Vietnamese
refugees and boat people held up in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhao expressed the hope that the British side will adopt "a
positive and cooperative approach" in consultations with the
Chinese side over these matters, so as to find solutions to all

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's parliament approved a
list of ministers for the reshuffled cabinet overnight following a
lengthy debate, said reports reaching from Skoplje said today.
</P>
<P>
The list was put together by Macedonian Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski after consultation with leaders of the three parties
in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 15 ministers were renamed in this reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski was replaced by Defense
Minister Blagoy Handziski, whose post went to Lazar Kitanovski, a
leading official of the Socialist Democratic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy Bekir Zuta was succeeded by Boris
Rikalovski, a foreign trade company representative, while Justice
Minister Vlado Popovski was moved to head the National
Intelligence Agency with his post being occupied by Gjorgji
Spasov, former Ambassador to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all the three deputy prime ministers were removed
and their successors, most likely ministers representing three
parties, will be chosen during the first session of the new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the parliament, Crvenkovski said the new cabinet
will not change the policies of its predecessor's, continue the
reform and work hard to solve the country's long existing social,
economic and ethnic problems.
</P>
<P>
This was the second big cabinet shakeup since it was set up in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
This year, a financial scandal in the second largest city of
Bitolla prompted the opposition parties to stage repeated protests
in demand of a cabinet dismissal and an earlier parliament
election.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The GSM digital mobile phone
network opened for service this Thursday in the 18 stations of
Beijing's No. 2 subway line.
</P>
<P>
This means that Beijing Telecommunication's GSM (global system
for mobile communication) subscribers can contact the outside
world in the subway stations, using the system's roaming function.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Subway Mobile Telephone Network, which was jointly
set up by the Beijing Telecommunications Administration and the
Beijing Subway Company, is the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tests for the network began last year. A final plan will be
implemented in two phases -- the first phase is to open the
network in stations, and the second in cars and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's operations show that the roaming function can also
be used in parts of the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's GSM system was launched in April of 1995. So far, its
capacity has reached half a million, and the number of subscribers
has risen to 240,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Security Body Formed Between NATO and Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council (EAPC) was formed between NATO and its partner
countries here today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 16 NATO members and its 27 partners held
the first conference of EAPC which aims at boosting political
dialogues and military cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The EAPC was made up of the 16 NATO allies and the 27 members
of the alliance's Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme of
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The council combines NATO's military cooperation program and a
forum for political dialogue with non-NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
It is a successor to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council
(NACC) which was created after the end of the Cold War to fill the
security vacuum in the central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The new body will enable NATO's partner countries to develop a
direct political relationship individually or in small groups with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to open a new chapter," NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana told the opening session of the EAPC conference
today.
</P>
<P>
The EAPC would be equipped to boost cooperation on a range of
issues, including arms control, non-proliferation, anti-terrorism,
disaster relief, and a "full range of peace support operations,"
like the current mission in Bosnia, United Sates Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright echoed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
NATO, which will take in several central and eastern
European countries at its summit in Madrid in July, expects EAPC
to help prevent or solve schisms between countries which win
membership and those which do not.
</P>
<P>
The EAPC, which will develop areas for joint consultation and
action and plan joint military exercises, is also intended to keep
close links between countries seeking NATO membership and others,
like Ukraine, which seek only closer ties.

<HEADLINE> Minor Planet Named after Chinese American Physicist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A minor planet discovered by
Chinese scientists has been officially named after Chinese
American physicist and Nobel Laureate Tsung-Dao Lee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the top scientific
research body in the country, held a naming ceremony at the Great
Hall of the People today to name minor planet No. 3443
"Leetsungdao."
</P>
<P>
During his acceptance speech, Lee showed the audience a picture
of his three-week old grandchild, who is seen showing three
fingers on one hand and four on the other. Lee said that he has a
special fondness for the number 3443.
</P>
<P>
CAS President Zhou Guangzhao awarded an honorary certificate
and an inscribed copper plate to Tsung-Dao Lee, who made a special
trip to Beijing from the United States to attend today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Leetsungdao" was discovered on September 26, 1979 by
scientists from the Purple Mountain Observatory based in Nanjing,
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province. The Minor Planet Center
recognized the discovery of Chinese scientists by numbering the
minor planet 3443 in May, 1986. The Center also authorized the
Chinese Observatory rights of discovery and naming.
</P>
<P>
Lu Benkui, head of the Observatory, said that to name minor
planet No. 3443 after Lee is in recognition of Lee's achievements
in physics.
</P>
<P>
Lee, born in 1926, is a famous theoretical physicist who won
Nobel Prize with his partner Chen Ning Yang in 1957 for their
discovery of parity and other symmetry violations in weak
interactions in 1956. Both Lee and Yang were CAS foreign
academicians.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, Lee established the field of
nontopological solitons and discovered a large class of new
astronomical solutions of general relativity, called soliton stars.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao said in his speech that "no one has ever done as
much as Lee to keep China in close touch with the world in the
field of science and technology." Zhou spoke highly of Lee's
support to China's science and education advancement.
</P>
<P>
"Leetsungdao" revolves around the sun in an elliptical
orbit. It takes "Leetsungdao" 3.70 years to finish one circuit
around the sun. The average distance between "Leetsungdao" and the
sun is 359 million kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Mountain Observatory named another minor planet it
discovered after Chen Ning Yang on May 25 in Nanjing.

MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Russian nuclear submarine, which
had been in anchorage for four years, sank overnight at the base
of Petropavlovsk in Kamchaka, in the Russian far east, Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, demobilized in 1992, began taking in water after
being damaged during a docking manoeuvre. It is now lying at a
depth of 18 to 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said the "radioactive" part of the
submarine's reactor had been removed and the sinking would pose no
danger to inhabitants in the immediate region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Private Entrepreneurs In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of private
entrepreneurs in Shanxi, a province known for its historic sites,
attracted by the idea that tourism can make them rich, are turning
to tourism to make a living.
</P>
<P>
The city of Yongji, on the Yellow River in southern
Shanxi, has many historical sites, but many of
them lay in disrepair because the local government was too
financially-strapped to restore them.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the city decided to seek private help by
offering preferential terms to business people investing in
tourism for project approval, water, electricity, and
telecommunications, and tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
One private businessman, Zhang Mengji of Yongji City, spent
700,000 yuan (about 84,000 US dollars) to restore some of the most
valuable historical sites at the Wangguanyu Scenic Area, where the
poet Sikong Tu of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) went to live in
seclusion in his later years. Since it opened to the public a year
ago, it has been visited by over 100,000 visitors and brought in
300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his successful move, Li Shuangxi, another private
investor, put two million yuan into refurbishing Wangu Temple,
which was built during the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
In Xinzhou City in northern Shanxi, many private entrepreneurs
are active in investment, taking advantage of the city's
geographical position next to Wutai Mountain, one of the four
largest Buddhist shrines in China.

<HEADLINE> Leading Air-Conditioner Maker Benefits from Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A debt-ridden and small-sized
freezer maker has suddenly been turned into China's biggest
air-conditioner supplier with fixed assets of three billion yuan
(361 million US dollars) and 11 billion yuan (1.33 billion US
dollars) in annual output value.
</P>
<P>
The Chunlan Group's legendary experience is cited as a sterling
example of the on-going structure reform in China's state-owned
sector.
</P>
<P>
Tao Jianxing, president of the 7,000-strong company in Taizhou
of northern Jiangsu Province, attributed the success of the
Chunlan Group to the sweeping readjustment in management style and
production methods which began in mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Taking lead in the state-owned sector to adopt the
market-oriented enterprise system, Chunlan expanded its production
scale, capital, and benefits by 600 times, 700 times and 500
times, respectively, over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to economists here, the economic miracle of Chunlan
was chiefly based on an efficient system for decision making and a
strict management style. Through the ten years' efforts in
streamlining corporate administration, the group now has a
top-level administrative board of 18 people, including the
president and chief financial official, who can make major
decisions in a short time,
</P>
<P>
The group's strict management and supervision over working
activities and the flow of materials helped cut down the average
cost of raw materials and components by over three percent in
1996, when a drastic price hike emerged in the domestic market for
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Chunlan's powerful sales network is regarded another leading
cause behind rocketing growth. Chunlan has weaved a nation-wide
sales network supported by 13 branch companies, 10,000 sales
stations, and a rapidly expanding overseas market.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the heavy input in structure readjustment, Tao
said, the group will further expand its investment in
technological research and development in coming years. An R&AMP;D
center involving an investment of 1.3 billion yuan (156.6 million
US dollars) and a post-doctorate work area went into operation
this year, both specializing in the research of artificial
intelligence and electronic technology, and tracing the latest
breakthroughs in frontier technologies.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chunlan is listed among the country's 1,000
large-sized state-owned enterprises blessed with priority in
receiving the financial support from the central government, and
it is also the major profit-maker under the favor of the provincial
administration of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guozhong, deputy secretary general of the provincial
government, said that Jiangsu province will encourage the state-owned
sectors to learn from Chunlan Group, to find the most effective
means to make up their deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the Chunlan Group shows that the lasting
development of an enterprise, regardless of its ownership, should
be based on an advanced management system.

<HEADLINE> 71 Cities, 3 Provinces Ban Smoking in Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smoking in public has
been outlawed in 71 major Chinese cities and three provinces,
according the Chinese Association on Smoking &AMP; Health.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the number of cities and province banning smoking
at public places will go higher soon because the whole country is
promoting an anti-smoking drive," Han Changlin, vice-president of
the association, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The smoking bans of these places mainly cover public
transportation facilities, schools, cinemas, theaters, meeting
halls, hospitals, department stores, museums, stadiums, and so on.
</P>
<P>
Many big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing municipalities, and Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an and other
cities took similar measures after Changzhi of north China's
Shanxi Province initiated the no-smoking law in November, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The local legislative bodies passed regulations, or city
governments published orders, to prohibit tobacco use in public.
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, and Shandong also enacted the
smoking bans.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent to step up anti-smoking measures, since smoking
and second-hand smoking have become a serious public health hazard
in China," Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Health officials and experts said to ban smoking in public
places should play a leading role in the anti-tobacco campaign in
the country.
</P>
<P>
China has some 350 million smokers and more than 400 million
passive smokers, and the rate of teenage smoking is still on rise.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of lung cancer cases resulted from smoking,
according to a study conducted by the Cancer Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Lung cancer is the
number one cancer killer in Chinese cities with a population of
more than one million,
</P>
<P>
"Death toll related to tobacco use will climb to two million
annually by the year 2020, from some 500,000 at present, if we
don't take actions immediately," Minister Chen warned.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities in charge of health and transportation have
jointly prohibited tobacco from passenger trains, ships, planes,
buses, subways, taxi cabs, ferry boats, cable cars, and waiting
rooms at railway stations, airports, and seaports, from May 1.
</P>
<P>
The action is a strong support to the country's endevours to
create a clean and no-smoking environment for the Chinese people,
the health officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kilns of "Porcelain of Unknown Origin" Found in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Kilns for making a type of porcelain
previously thought to have no known place of origin have been
found in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Clark porcelain was a Chinese product smuggled by
a Portuguese merchant ship in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The
ship was seized by a Holland company and the porcelain on board
lost to individual owners in southeastern Asia, Japan, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Not knowing exactly where the porcelain was made, foreigners
named it after the ship that found it, the "Clark."
</P>
<P>
Different from other exported Chinese porcelain, Clark
porcelain is designed in wide borders, inside which are patterns
such as the double phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Clark porcelain falls into a variety of categories, such as
millet-color-glazed, blue and white, three colors painted on a
plain body, or colorful painted pieces.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 such pieces of porcelain have been found in kiln
remains in Pinghe and Hua'an counties in the southern part of
Fujian, proving that the Clark porcelain was made there, according
to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The porcelain is now on display in the city of Xiamen in the
southernmost part of the province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Sudanese First Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work jointly
with Arab and African countries, including the Sudan, to develop a
friendly cooperative relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This will contribute to the establishment of a prosperous,
stable and peaceful world in the next century, President Jiang
Zemin told visiting Sudanese First Vice-President El-Zobair
Mohamed Saleh here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed El-Zobair to China, saying that his current
visit will make a positive contribution to the existing bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
China and the Sudan both have ancient civilizations and enjoy
mutual friendship, Jiang said. bilateral links in various fields
including politics, economy and culture have developed in a
comprehensive way since the two countries set up diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the world today is moving toward multi-polarization,
and that the era of one or two superpowers deciding world affairs
is past.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is in opposition to hegemonism and power
politics, Jiang pointed out that China holds that each country has
the right to choose a social system and development road catering
to its own conditions, and decide its own foreign policy, while
not interfering in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Stating that African countries are an important force in the
international arena, Jiang said the Chinese government has
always attatched importance to Africa, treasured Sino-African
friendship, and spared no effort in safeguarding the just rights
and interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
With a new century on the threshold, Jiang said, China is ready
to make concerted efforts with African countries and other
developing countries to promote the establishment of a new, fair
and rational international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, Jiang said, the Chinese government has
solved the issue in accordance with the concept of "one country,
two systems" set forth by Deng Xiaoping, which has wiped out the
disgrace suffered by the Chinese people for the past 100-plus
years.
</P>
<P>
Strictly abiding by the Basic Law, China will implement the
concept of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a
high-degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, Jiang said, adding that the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China supports the Sudanese government's stance on
the settlement of its Southern issue through peace talks, and
China welcomes and supports the peace pact signed recently between
the Sudanese government and four southern organizations, which is
in conformity with the Sudanese people's aspiration for peace.
</P>
<P>
Extending his congratulations on Hong Kong's upcoming return to
the motherland, El-Zobair said that the Sudan firmly supports
China's "one China" principle, under which Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Sudan supports all efforts from China
to reunify the country.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Jiang on the peace pact signed not long ago for the
settlement of its Southern issue, El-Zobair said that the Sudanese
government prefers a peaceful solution be found for international
and regional disputes for the sake of regional stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, El-Zobair conveyed Sudanese President Omar
Hassan Ahmed El-Bashir's greetings to Jiang, who asked El-Zobair
to convey his regards to El-Bashir.

<HEADLINE> Zhao Jihua Urges Full Repatriation of Viets in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese side on the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group today urged the British side to
take effective measures to find a satisfactory solution to the
question of Vietnamese boat people and refugees in Hong Kong in
the remaining days before the handover.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Zhao Jihua, Chinese senior representative on the
JLG, told a press conference today that the British side should
work out a solution to the question of Vietnamese boat people and
not to leave any burden on the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the subject of Vietnamese refugees and boat people
held up in Hong Kong were seriously discussed at the three-day
40th plenary session of the JLG which ended here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the Hong Kong government has made some
efforts and achieved some progress in repatriating the Vietnamese
boat people in the last few years, the Chinese side at this stage
is not sure if these boat people will be completely repatriated
before the handover and not sure whether or not there will be a
burden on the future Hong Kong SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese boat people is a frequently discussed subject
in the agenda of the JLG, and at this plenary session we again
expressed our concern over this issue to the British side," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the root cause for the presence of Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong is the British policy of making Hong Kong a
first port of asylum, so in view of this the Chinese side have
once again urged the British side to continue to strictly fulfill
their unshirkable responsibilities to repatriate all the
Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhao urged the British side to take the lead in accepting and
resettling the Vietnamese refugees held up here in Hong Kong. He
also urged the British side to "work out specific arrangements
with the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees to repay
the debt it (the United Nations) owed to the Hong Kong
government".

<P>
SHENYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province has built an extensive health care network with 4.46
hospital beds and 1.88 doctors for every 1,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in the province has increased to 72, the

<HEADLINE> Uhuru Park Meeting in Nairobi Declared Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today issued
a statement, declaring the intended Uhuru Park meeting on May 31
is illegal and warning people not to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the conveners of the meeting had
neither sought nor been given any licence and it is therefore
illegal for any person to attend such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the meeting was clearly intended to
disrupt public order and peace in Nairobi or other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the meeting is, it noted, "to challenge the
government and spark off incidents which would be blamed on the
government."
</P>
<P>
The statement also reminded members of the diplomatic corps
accredited to Nairobi not to show partisanship on Kenya's
political affairs or interfere in Kenya's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the commitment of the Kenyan government to
protecting Kenyans and their property by "the full force of the
law".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the opposition National Convention
Assembly was to hold a public meeting at the Uhuru Park in
Nairobi tomorrow as a follow-up to an aborted one the organizers
tried to hold at Kamukunji Ground early this month.
</P>
<P>
The first major event was the Limuru convention held last
month by a group of NGO bosses, opposition politicians and church
leaders who issued an ultimatum to the government to effect a
"minimum constitutional reforms".
</P>
<P>
Leaders of opposition Ford Kenya, Ford Asili, the Democratic
Party and the National Democratic Party have said that tomorrow's
meeting must go on and asked Kenyan police to provide security.
</P>
<P>
At the Parliament Buildings, 18 members of parliament led by
opposition Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki yesterday
announced their total support for "urgent demands for
constitutional reforms".
</P>
<P>
These MPs supported the efforts being undertaken by the
National Convention Executive Committee to demand constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that there might be a bloody confrontation
between unemployed young people and the Kenyan police at the
Uhuru Park tomorrow.

<P>
FREETOWN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- United States marines Friday
ignored a ban imposed by the new military government of Sierra
Leone banning all internal flights in the country and evacuated
about 400 American diplomats and citizens to nearby Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 helicopter shuttle flights were made to the American
frigate anchored off the coast of Sierra Leone. The operation
lasted some four hours and went off without a hitch, Commander
William Helland said.
</P>
<P>
The American Embassy here has also closed down temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presence of over 1,000 troops, mainly
Nigerians, from the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
in neighbouring Liberia, is creating added tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said they fear the troops will attack
to bring down the military government. ''This is responsible for
the mass exodus of foreigners leaving the country,'' an army
official said.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian jet flew over Freetown Thursday evening and sent
ripples of panic in the capital. The government has now lifted
the curfew.
</P>
<P>
In another development, State Radio on Friday broadcast a
statement by a group of Nigerians resident in Sierra Leone saying
they are ''opposed to any form of intervention in the country.''
</P>
<P>
''Nigeria has no justification to attempt to restore democracy in
another country when they don't have democracy in their own back
yard,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reaffirms Commitment to Import U.S. Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has assured the
United States that its commitment to import U.S. pork will be
carried out, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo
Siazon gave the assurance to U.S. Ambassador to Manila Thomas
Hubbard Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government earlier made a commitment to import
some 16,000 metric tons of pork from the U.S. this year, which
will be increased gradually to 54,000 metric tons by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippines imported only 3,500 metric tons of
U.S. pork, prompting Washington to complain to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) that the Philippines has reneged on its
commitment to liberalize trade under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the country imports
less-than-committed amount of U.S. pork because of its higher cost
compared to local pork.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Urges Breakthrough in Reform Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator has urged
local officials in central China's Henan Province to seize the
current favorable opportunities and take bolder steps to
accelerate the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of Chinese Communist Party, and
chairman of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress
(NPC), the law-making body, made the remarks in his inspection to
Henan.
</P>
<P>
"Every locality should give full play to its unique advantages
and rely on the local people to strive for better achievements in
China's moderization drive," he told the cadres.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the gap between China's developed east
region and underdeveloped central and west areas has various
reasons behind. "It takes a relatively long time and arduous
efforts to resolve the problem," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the time is now ripe for the vast central and
west areas to do their utmost in this regard, for "both the
current international and domestic situations are now favorable
for China," he said, adding that, "the central government will
also strengthen its support for the development of the central and
west areas."
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he was very much impressed by the achievements made
in Henan in the last seven years since his last visit in 1990. The
province has quadrupled its gross domestic product ahead of the
schedule and its economic status among all the provincial bodies
has also risen markedly, "proving that the efforts made by the
government and the people have been paid off."
</P>
<P>
As chairman of China's top legislative body, he said he
appreciated the efforts made by the Henan Provincial People's
Congress in enacting local regulations and enhancing supervision
over the governments' work.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that governments at different levels should
"respect and protect the democratic rights of deputies of the
people's congresses and their standing committees at different
levels, and provide services and create conditions for them to
exercise their powers in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
During his tour from the 24th to 29th of this month, Qiao
visited several cities, some key water conservancy projects and
some township enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The International
Badminton Federation (IBF) has set up the Television and Marketing
Committee to exploit the market potential of the sport, its
president said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
IBF president Lu Shengrong told Xinhua that the committee,
established at the annual general meeting here, will be in charge
of develop the television coverage and marketing of the sport.
</P>
<P>
The IBF has decided to scrap the World Cup and stage several
"spectaculars" at major metropolitans around the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the sport of badminton has seen a major boost since it
became an Olympic event in 1992, with IBF members almost doubled
and IBF events shooting up to 25.
</P>
<P>
"But what we need now is quality after we have got quantity,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular events will set the stage for only a small number
of world's best singles players or doubles pairs to clash with each
other.
</P>
<P>
"We need more television coverage because presently there is few
live broadcasts and promotion is sluggish," she added.
</P>
<P>
One of next year's event would be in Sydney, Australia and
Rome, Italy, with other possibilities being Cape Town in South
Africa or the island state of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
In light of the future progress of the sport, the IBF will add a
mixed team event to the world junior championships.
</P>
<P>
"The young players should have a chance to compete as a team
and improve their skills," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the event would be different from the present division
system in Sudirman Cup to allow the youngsters from every part of
the world have the chance to win the world title.

<HEADLINE> Gene Responsible for Hole-in-Heart Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- British researchers have
identified a gene behind an inherited condition that can lead to
babies being born with a hole in the heart, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Holes in the heart are among the common abnormalities in
newborn babies. They are usually between the receiving chambers of
the heart and usually require cardiac surgery for being cured.
</P>
<P>
In adults, the faulty gene can produce abnormal heart rhythms.
Both sexes can be equally affected by the condition and if a
person inherits the gene then their children have at least fifty
percent chances of being affected.
</P>
<P>
Professor David Brook and his team from the Human Molecular
Genetics Department at Nottingham University in U.K. made this
discovery, PTI quoted a news release here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team found this out while carrying out research into what
is known as holt-oram syndrome (HOS), a gene abnormality that
influence development of the heart and affects between one in
10,000 to 50,000 persons in U.K. alone.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia-NATO Deal, a Document to Face 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The security deal reached by NATO
and Russia on Tuesday is an important document to face the 21st
century, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said here today.
</P>
<P>
The document, known as the Founding Act of Mutual Relations,
Cooperation and Security, has taken "Russia's legitimate interests
into account," he added in a nationwide radio address, and has
reduced the negative consequences of NATO's expansion to the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the pact, NATO has clearly promised not to
move nuclear weapons into the territory of its new members, nor
build new nuclear weapon arsenals and rebuild those left by the
former Warsaw Pact nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, NATO has agreed not to station new troops
near the Russian border, and agreed to give Russia an equal voice
on the European security issue through the Permanent Joint Council.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill response, also an effort to enhance trust between
NATO and Russia, Yeltsin said he has decided not to target Russian
missiles at NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
But he reaffirmed his opposition to NATO expansion, saying an
European security system could be established through developing
and consolidating the European Security and Cooperation
Organization. NATO eastward expansion would sharply hinder this
positive process and therefore threat Russia's security, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK's Economy Expects Better After Handover (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is now very
well and it will be better in future, said Stephen Ip, secretary
for economic services.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ip said that as an
official in charge of economic services involving shipping
business, civil aviation, telecommunications, energy, tourism and
agriculture and fisheries, he is confident of Hong Kong's economic
development after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"Taking shipping business as an example," he said, "Hong Kong
has been the world's leading port in container throughput for
five consecutive years."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) handling
capacity rose from 1.2 million in 1978 to 13.5 million in 1996,
and the annual growth rate of the cargo vessels calling at Hong
Kong in the past decade increased 8.6 percent."
</P>
<P>
"More than 430 shipping companies and shipping agents set up
their regional headquarters in Hong Kong, one of the major free
ports in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for air cargo output, he said, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal
at Kai Tak Airport handled about 1.49 million tons last year,
which made Hong Kong the world's second busiest airport in air
cargo handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
A graduate from the University of Hong Kong, the 46-year-old Ip
has worked in the Hong Kong government for 24 years. During this
period, he witnessed high-rate development in HK.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rapid growth of Hong Kong's shipping business
and other services is based on fair market competition,
first-class infrastructural facilities and high efficiency in
management and high-quality services.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the advantages inside Hong Kong, the rapid
economic growth of south China is also very important to Hong
Kong's economy, said Ip, secretary for economic services of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
He said, "The fast growth rate in south China is conspicuous in
recent years and Hong Kong has played a pivotal role in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's port authority has a good working relationship
with the Shenzhen port authority. We exchange information on port
cargo forecasts and this helps to improve coordination on port
development planning."

"There is also considerable scope for Hong Kong terminal
operators to build up strategic links with emerging river ports in
the Pearl River Delta," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and China's inland areas should learn from each
others' strong points to offset their weaknesses, he noted, adding
that in the sectors of communications and telecommunications,
there are plenty of opportunities for development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should develop in a coordinate way so as to avoid
unnecessary competition for the sake of the long-term economic
growth of both Hong Kong and China's inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong's transitional period, contacts and exchanges
between the Hong Kong government officials and their counterparts
on the China's inland areas are increasing," he said. "This is
necessary and helpful to the development of the two sides."
</P>
<P>
"Personally speaking, I have benefited from the increasing
exchanges, that is, I can speak Putonghua (Mandarin) now," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Ip spoke in fluent Putonghua in a
Cantonese-like tone which made the reporters easier to talk with
him.
</P>
<P>
Ip said, "Of course, Putonghua speaking will facilitate my
exchanges with officials at the provincial and central levels on
the mainland."
</P>
<P>
"Once I have a chance to meet the mainland officials, I will
try to speak Putonghua although it is a bit difficult for me," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the major progress in his learning Putonghua
was made in April 1996 when he was at Qinghua University attending
a five-week course for high-ranking civil servants of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"As a branch chief at Hong Kong government, it is unavoidable
for me to work long hours and sacrifice my leisure time with my
family members," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I like to meet people of various sectors, from ordinary
fishermen to farmers, from managers to magnates," he added.
"Talking with them is really a pleasure to me."
</P>
<P>
He said that he enjoys jazz music, movies and traveling on
holidays. "But this year, I am afraid I can't spare time to
travel, as there is a lot of work awaiting all of us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Aspirin Appears to Be Helpful for Treating Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Studies in 37 countries have shown
aspirin as an effective emergency treatment for strokes triggered
by blocked arteries, Chinese and British scientists said today.
</P>
<P>
Before the two new studies, said Dr. Chen Zhengming from the
University of Oxford, "doctors had been afraid that giving stroke
patients aspirin too early might make strokes worse."
</P>
<P>
However, said Dr. Chen, who coordinated the research work with
Professor Liu Lisheng of Beijing Fuwai Hospital in China, "our
studies show aspirin does five times more good than harm."
</P>
<P>
Released by the British Medical Research Council today, the two
studies involved about 40,000 patients in nearly 1,000 hospitals
-- about half of them in China and the rest in 36 other countries.
</P>
<P>
Improvements resulted from aspirin use were evident for
patients who showed no sign of bleeding in the brain.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, giving aspirin in the first 48 hours and
continuing with it for up to 14 days made a "small but worthwhile
improvement" in patients' chances for survival after six months.
</P>
<P>
The common pain-killer appeared to reduce the mortality by 11
percent, or a reduction of about 10 deaths, or recurrent strokes,
for every 1,000 patients during the first few weeks of treatment.
</P>
<P>
"If a million stroke patients a year get aspirin in hospital
because of these results, then 10,000 will be protected from
disaster," Dr. Chen told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Sandercock of the University of Edinburgh, who
coordinated the studies in other countries, said: "aspirin should
generally be given as soon as doctors find that blocked arteries
have caused a stroke, and continue for years afterwards."
</P>
<P>
But the findings, published by the medical journal The Lancet,
have been greeted with caution.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Stroke Association advised people not to give aspirin
to likely stroke patients because the drug was seen to be helpful
only in strokes caused by blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
It could be harmful to use aspirin among patients who have
brain hemorrhages, because the drug would encourage bleeding, said
a spokesman of the association.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes "ASEAN 10" to Be Realized in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today his country hopes Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar will be able to join the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia views July as an acceptable date and hopes the three
countries will be accepted into ASEAN as soon as possible as they
have fulfilled the requirement, Alatas told a news conference on
his arrival here to attend the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Informal
Meeting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He hoped tomorrow's meeting will reach a consensus because
ASEAN always work on consensus.
</P>
<P>
"We work on a consensus that the three countries will enter
ASEAN this year but whether it will be July or December, that I
don't know yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian minister said Indonesia's position on the entry
of the three countries into ASEAN was made "very clear since the
very beginning".
</P>
<P>
Indonesia believes that there should be no obstacles in
accepting them as members, and ASEAN as a whole felt that all
three countries were ready for admission into the regional
grouping, he said.
</P>
<P>

Meeting tomorrow would discuss the ASEAN secretary-general's
report on the criteria for Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar's admission
into ASEAN, which will be the main reference point in the
discussions.
</P>
<P>

decide on the entry of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into the
regional grouping.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Pumps Last Barrel of Oil Under Oil-for-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq declared today that it has
pumped its last barrel of oil for export as of today under the
oil-for-food deal signed with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
This declaration was made by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid at a news conference held at the Iraqi Oil Ministry to
commemorate the country's nationalization of oil on June 1, 1972.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that since the implementation of the Memorandum of
Understanding with the United Nations on December 10, 1996, Iraq
has pumped a total of 120 million barrels of oil for export.
</P>
<P>
The M.O.U., which is known as the "oil-for-food" deal, allows
Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months
to buy back medicine and other goods urgently needed in the
country which is hard hit by stringent U.N. sanctions after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister said the amount of oil exported under
the supervision of the U.N. only met the demands of 33 customers
out of a total of 51 buyers that have already signed contracts
with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's export capacity of oil at present is 3.5 million
barrels per day, or at the same level as before the 1991 Gulf War,
according to the oil minister.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have the capacity of producing four times the
amount of oil allowed for us to export in accordance with the
M.O.U.," said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq is now seeking to reach its target
production of 6 billion barrels per day soon.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua if Iraq wants to renew the deal for
another six months, Rashid replied that it is up to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's position that Baghdad has fulfilled all its
obligations under the U.N. resolutions on Iraq, urging that the
sanctions should be lifted completely and immediately so as to end
the suffering of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific to Seek Compensation from Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.
official said here that it would seek compensation from the
manufacturers of the engines which forced the airline to ground
recently all of its Airbus A300-300 craft.
</P>
<P>
The airline's image had suffered "limited damage" because of
the defects of the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines on the craft and
consequent grounding of the fleet, Cathay Pacific Airways Chairman
Peter Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
The engines shut down several times in mid-air recently,
forcing the airline to ground the fleet for safety reasons. And
aviation analysts said that it could cause a loss of 1-2 percent
in net profits, predicted at about four billion HK dollars (5.13
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say whether demands would be for lost
business or whether its claims would be confined to costs incurred
because of the grounding, English-language newspaper Hong Kong
Standard reported here today.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give an accurate figure about the compensation,
saying "it was too early" to do so.
</P>
<P>
Having its image hurt though, the airline would boost its
advertising efforts rather than cutting down ticket prices to lure
back passengers when the Airbus A300-300s are airborne again, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Complains of Jumbo Jet Engine Shutdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. complained that the
company had experienced "several single-engine shutdowns recently"
involving Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 747 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The engines are different to the suspect Rolls-Royce Trent 700s
which led to the grounding of Cathay Pacific's Airbus A300 fleet,
according to local English-language newspaper South China Morning
Post here today.
</P>
<P>
But Kwan Chuk-fai, Cathay's manager of corporate
communications, could not comment how many engines were involved
and when the problems occurred.
</P>
<P>
Kwan said the Boeing 747 incidents had not been related to any
single problem, unlike the case of the Trent 700s on the airline's
Airbus A300 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific is only one of the very few airlines which use
Rolls-Royce RB211-524H engines on the four-engine Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
But Kwan stressed that there was "absolutely no danger to
passengers". "Boeing 747s do of course have four engines and can
operate satisfactorily on three."
</P>
<P>
"We are entirely satisfied with the management of our RB211
engines," he stressed.

CHANGSHA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of divorces
in China have left a larger number of children improperly cared

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Confers with Sudanese First Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to increase
exchanges and consultations with the Sudan on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence for greater friendly
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo made the remark, during his
meeting with El-Zobair Mohamed Saleh, Sudanese first
vice-president at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China and the Sudan have enjoyed friendly relations,
and the bilateral cooperation in politics, economy, and culture
has been fruitful with the joint efforts since their forging
of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
China and the Sudan, both developing nations, have had the same
historical sufferings, and face the common task of safeguarding
independence and sovereignty, and pursuing development, Wu said,
adding that they sympathize and support each other in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China always upholds the peaceful settlement of disputes
between countries through dialogue and consultations, and it
disapproves of sanctions or threats of sanction, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wu said, China is against either sanctions or making
such sanctions heavier against the Sudan for the above-mentioned
reasons, adding that China opposes terrorism in any form, but also
opposes the interference into other countries' internal affairs,
limiting and halting the economic development of developing
countries with the excuse of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that China has advocated that each country has right
to choose its practical political system and road of development
in accordance with its specific national condition.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have taken a tortuous way to seek its own
road for development after independence, and it is the perennial
task for these countries to achieve national stability,
concentrating on the economic development and increasing the
living standards of their people, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
China supports the position of the Sudanese government to
resolve the problem of its south part through peaceful
negotiations, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China welcomed and appreciated the peace agreement,
signed recently by the Sudanese government with several
organizations from southern Sudan, which is in conformity with the
peaceful aspiration of the Sudanese people, and China wishes them
a success in their great cause of national building and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral economic and trade cooperation have witnessed a
stable growth through the joint efforts in recent years, and the
Chinese government wishes to further tap such fields on the basis
of equality, mutual benefit, and seeking efficiency, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Zobair extended congratulations on behalf of the Sudanese
government and people on Hong Kong's upcoming return to the
motherland, believing that it constitutes an important step
towards the peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Zobair spoke highly of China's independent foreign policy of
peace, and expressed his pleasure to see the continuous
advancement of bilateral relations on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Zobair gave a briefing about the efforts made by
the Sudanese government for peaceful settlement of the southern
Sudan problem, regarding the peaceful settlement of the issue as
not only conducive to the stability and development of the Sudan,
but also contributing to the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, they attended a signing ceremony of the
summary for the fourth session of the mixed committee of economy,
trade, and technology between the governments of China and the
Sudan, agreement for economic and technical cooperation, agreement
for encouraging and mutual protection of investment, and other
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Zobair arrived here Thursday afternoon for a working visit to
China as guest of Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Currency Ringgit Appreciates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's currency ringgit
(RM) recorded an across-the-board appreciation against all the
major currencies during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter 1997, the ringgit appreciated by 13.2
percent against the Swiss franc, 9.7 percent against the Deutsche
Mark, 8.7 percent against the Japanese Yen, 2.5 percent against
the Singapore dollar, 1.7 percent against the pound sterling and
1.4 percent against the US dollar, the Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
Against the composite basket (January 2, 1991 = 100), the
ringgit appreciated by 3.1 percent, the bank said in its report
"Economic and Financial Development in the First Quarter of 1997"
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said market sentiment for the ringgit improved
significantly in the first quarter this year due mainly to
enhanced prospects for the economy following the improvement in
the trade account for 1996 and early 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the ringgit registered a mixed performance in April
and in mid-May, the bank said, adding but the pressure on the
ringgit was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit, associated with the development in Thailand, was
caused to close lower at US$1 = RM2.5245 on May 14 against
RM2.5090 as at end-April), but It recovered to an intra-day high
of US$1=RM2.4795 on May 16, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, during the period from April 1 to May
28, the ringgit remained relatively stable against the Deutsche
Mark but depreciated against the other major currencies with 1.3
percent depreciation against the pound sterling, 1.5 percent
against the US dollar, 2.4 percent against the Singapore dollar,
3.5 percent against the Swiss franc and 7.1 percent against the
Japanese Yen.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the ringgit recorded a depreciation of 2.5
percent against the composite basket during the April 1 to May 28
period, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said interest rates were relatively stable in the
first quarter this year with the daily weighted average interbank
rates for the one to six months maturities virtually unchanged at
7.30 percent to 7.38 percent in March compared with 7.30 to 7.35
percent in December 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Sudanese First Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The current visit of Sudanese First
Vice-President El-Zobair Mohamed Saleh to China will help expand
and deepen the bilateral relations, Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with El-Zobair, Rong said since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the Sudan, the
governments and leaders of the two countries have been carefully
nurturing the bilateral friendship, which has a long history.
</P>
<P>
This friendship and cooperation have grown smoothly on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, Rong added.
</P>
<P>
In international affairs, Rong said, China and the Sudan
sympathize and support each other.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Government has always adhered to the principled
stand of "one China," and does not establish any official
relations with Taiwan, and opposes Taiwan's attempt to join the
United Nations, he said, adding that China and the Sudan enjoy
broad mutual understanding on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciates the Sudan's support to China on the Taiwan and
human rights issues," Rong stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rong said China backs the Sudanese Government's position of a
peaceful solution to the Southern issue. "We welcome and support
the recent signing of a peace pact between the Sudanese Government
and southern organizations, which was in line with the aspiration
for peace of the Sudanese people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rong said the Chinese Government believes the implementation of
the peace pact will promote the peaceful solution of the southern
issue, and is in the interests of the Sudan's ethnic harmony and
national stability, and therefore, will help safeguard the
nation's growth and the people's happy life in a peaceful
environment.
</P>
<P>
El-Zobair said the Sudan and China have maintained friendship
and cooperation since the 1950s, and the Sudanese Government will
not forget China's support and help to the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudanese Government resolutely adheres to the
principled stand of "one China" and does not forge any official
ties with the Taiwan authorities, and it stands for all the
efforts towards the reunification made by the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
El-Zobair also expressed his appreciation and admiration for
China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which
adheres to its principled stand in international affairs and
supports the just cause of the developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese first vice-president said he hopes to see further
development of the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries which are based on equality, mutual respect, and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Rong gave a banquet for El-Zobair and his
party.

<HEADLINE> Staff Training Planned In Demonstration Nature Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 900 staff from China's ten
selected demonstration nature reserves will receive systematic
specialized training appropriate to their current work, according
to a newly formulated plan by the Ministry of Forestry (MOF).
</P>
<P>
"The initial trainings have been started, and the establishment
of a nation-wide training network is now underway," said an
official from the MOF.
</P>
<P>
The training will be jointly conducted by MOF and the World
Bank, which is the agent of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF). The official added that the training will end around the
year 2000, with the expected investment totalling 2.4 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The training is part of a cooperation between MOF and GEF to
construct ten demonstration nature reserves in China so as to
improve China's level of nature reserve management as well as to
provide experience to both the rest of nature reserves in China
and the world," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Yongfan, deputy-director of the Department of
Forest and Wildlife Protection under MOF, because nearly all the
nature reserves are located in remote and hard-to-reach areas,
most of their staff have little formal background in biodiversity
protection.
</P>
<P>
At present China's forestry departments at all levels
administrate more than 570 nature reserves, and the total number
of nature reserves will be probably reach 1,000 by the first
decade of the next century, he added, explaining the urgent need
to enhance the training work right now.
</P>
<P>
The ten demonstration nature reserves include five national
nature reserves in the Qinling mountains in northwest China's
Shaanxi province, where more than 220 giant pandas live.
</P>
<P>
"The key step of the training program is to train sub-trainers
and establish a training network across the country," said Susan
Shen, a senior ecologist from the World Bank who is in charge of
this GEF-funded project.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the training will help staff at the grass-root level
to accept advanced nature reserve management ideas and methods,
thus improving the ability and effectiveness of sustainable
biodiversity protection.
</P>
<P>
Also showing satisfaction with the cooperation with MOF, Shen
said the MOF was regarded as "one of the best cooperating partners
of the World Bank."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Head of Japan's Leading Security Company Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo prosecutors today arrested
Hideo Sakamaki, former president of Nomura Securities Co., on
suspicion of his involvement of in his brokerage's payoffs to a
"sokaiya" corporate racketeer, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Sakamaki, 61, is suspected of conspiring with Nomura's several
managing directors in paying some 38.5 million Japanese yen (about
30,000 U.S. dollars) to sokaiya Ryuichi Koike, 54, from January to
June 1995, when he was the company's president, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage, is believed to have paid the
money to Kojin Building Co., a real estate firm run by Koike's
younger brother, in the form of profits from special stock deals
not available to ordinary investors to compensate the Koike
brothers for investment losses, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Commercial Code bans payments to sokaiya, who buy
shares in companies to gain access to their shareholders' meetings
which they threaten to disrupt unless they are paid off.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Securities and Exchange Law bans security
companies from compensating clients for investment losses and from
conducting stock deals on their own discretion on behalf of
investors.
</P>
<P>
Nomura Securities allegedly paid the money to ensure that its
annual shareholders' meeting in June 1995 would not be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Sakamaki, who has been sent to the Tokyo Detention House, will
also be questioned about Nomura's so-called VIP accounts allegedly
designed to give special treatment to politicians, bureaucrats and
other influential people, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's second largest commercial bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
(DKB), has also been shaken by the payoff scandal.
</P>
<P>
DKB and its non-bank affiliate Daiwa Shinyo are accused of
giving some 30 billion yen (about 0.26 billion dollars) in loans
to Kojin Building since the 1980s. Part of the money is believed
to have been used by Ryuichi Koike to buy shares of Nomura and
three other leading brokerages.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said the arrest of Sakamaki will jolt Japan's security
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is not important whether or not he was arrested. What
matters is that the leader of a top-ranking company has caused a
problem like this," Hashimoto told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Strives to Lower Population Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is striving to reduce its
annual population growth rate to 1.5-1.6 percent so as to achieve
the goal of zero growth by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Committee for Population and Family
Planning (NCPFP) estimated that even if the target is achieved,
Vietnam would have a population of 81 million by the turn of the
century, press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's current population stoods at 76 million.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the decisive role played by population issues in
economic growth, the Vietnamese government has exerted great
efforts to prevent a population boom.
</P>
<P>
The funds allocated to the national population and family
planning program have been increasing, with 262 billion Vietnamese
dong (about 23.6 million U.S. dollars) to be granted this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 program is aimed at boosting the dissemination of
family planning information and raising the quality of family
planning services.
</P>
<P>
But the high rate of abortion in the country has already drawn
much concern in society, as it not only badly affects reproductive
health but also causes the death of many women.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the NCPFP, over 1.4 million
abortions were carried out last year among the country's 19
million women in the child-bearing age group.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Complains of Jumbo Jet Engine Shutdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. complained that the
company had experienced "several single-engine shutdowns recently"
 involving Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 747 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The engines are different to the suspect Rolls-Royce Trent 700s
 which led to the grounding of Cathay Pacific's Airbus A300 fleet,
 according to local English-language newspaper South China Morning
 Post here today.
</P>
<P>
But Kwan Chuk-fai, Cathay's manager of corporate
communications, did not say how many engines were involved and
when the problems occurred.
</P>
<P>
Kwan said the Boeing 747 incidents had not been related to any
single problem, unlike the case of the Trent 700s on the airline's
 Airbus A300 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific is only one of the very few airlines which use
Rolls-Royce RB211-524H engines on the four-engine Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
But Kwan stressed that there was "absolutely no danger to
passengers". "Boeing 747s do of course have four engines and can
operate satisfactorily on three."
</P>
<P>
"We are entirely satisfied with the management of our RB211
engines," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific to Seek Compensation for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd. official said here that it would seek compensation from the
manufacturers of the engines which forced the airline to ground
recently all of its Airbus A300-300 craft.
</P>
<P>
The airline's image had suffered "limited damage" because of
the defects of the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines on the craft and
consequent grounding of the fleet, Cathay Pacific Airways Chairman
 Peter Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
The engines shut down several times in mid-air recently,
forcing the airline to ground the fleet for safety reasons. And
aviation analysts said that it could cause a loss of 1-2 percent
of net profits, predicted at about four billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say whether demands would be for lost
business or whether its claims would be confined to costs incurred
 because of the grounding, English-language newspaper Hong Kong
Standard reported here today.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give an accurate figure about the compensation,
saying "it was too early" to do so.
</P>
<P>
Having its image hurt though, the airline would boost its
advertising efforts rather than cutting down ticket prices to lure
 back passengers when the Airbus A300-300s are airborne again, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government on Thursday
officially took a stand on last Sunday's coup in Sierra Leone which
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The Punch newspaper today quoted a presidency statement as saying
that the government condemned the coup and declared the country's
support for Kabbah as Sierra Leone's president.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has maintained silent over the development in Sierra Leone
since the coup.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been making underground diplomatic moves towards
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, A A. Abubakar has
been in Freetown since Wednesday, heading a delegation for talks with
the new military authorities over the restoration of power to the
elected government toppled in the coup.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Sierra Leonean military administration has
appealed to the international community for more time to correct
mistakes of Kabbah's government before returning the country to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Give us (about) 18 months to return the country to a democracy
because we do not come to take power to hang on to it,"
Paul Koroma, the new leader, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Koroma also reiterated that the
military decided to intervene when the civilian government deviated
from its democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
The military, as custodians of law, could not fold its arm to watch
such decadence, he added.

<HEADLINE> African Ambassadors For New OAU Premises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- African ambassadors have
recommended here construction of a modern and functional
headquarters for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis
Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors expressed the wish during the 66th ordinary
session of the OAU Ministers' Council that was just concluded
here before the OAU summit due to be held next week, according to
OAU officials here today.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors agreed on the need for a more dynamic and
aggressive communication strategy that adequately reflects and
projects activities of the OAU in Africa and the international
community at large.
</P>
<P>
"As we embark on this project, there is need to revisit the
headquarters agreement with a view to adjusting it to the new
realities and to the requirements of the smooth and effective
functioning of the organization," one official said.
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the OAU has operated from temporary
premises in Addis Ababa, which are now inadequate. The OAU has
been perceived for a long time as a club of governments and it is
time that its secretariat should be provided with capacity for
interaction with civil society in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors to the meeting are of the view that it should
open up to the grass-root organizations on the continent, hence
the need of a new headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Germany Helps Kenya Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The German government has agreed
to provide grants and loans to Kenya to reduce the country's
poverty, especially in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here on Thursday, a total of 44
million U.S. Dollars will be channelled to various projects in
Kenya in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Out of the amount, more than 25 million Dollars are grants
while the rest is loans to be repaid in 40 years with 10 years
grace period at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Thomas Albert, leader of the
visiting German delegation, said that development of Kenya's
rural areas should be given first priority since majority of
Kenyans lived there.
</P>
<P>
The German official pointed out that his government will
concentrate its bilateral aid on the critical sectors of Kenya's
economy, including agriculture, rural development, roads, energy,
water and sanitation, small towns development and health.

strengthen the East African Co-operation for the benefit of the
countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> FAO Vows to Curb Widespread Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jacqeus Diouf, Director General of
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has
stressed the need to mobilize public and private sectors to join
efforts in curbing widespread hunger in the world.
</P>
<P>
The problem of widespread hunger cannot be eliminated through
government action alone, and there is also need to mobilize
public and private sector commitment, Diouf told reporters on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Diouf was here attending the on-going meeting of African
ministers which preceded next week's 33rd summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Diouf said the majority of people who have food problems are
in the developing world where the situation is worsened by
growing population.
</P>
<P>
In many developing countries, Diouf said, the lack of advanced
agricultural techniques add to the shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
The FAO has recently introduced the "telefood" program aimed
at helping people who have the will but not the means to overcome
poverty and food insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said the FAO is not putting any money for the "telefood"
program, therefore people involved, especially farmers must look
for sponsors in their respective countries and use the money to
buy the needed resources for food production instead focusing it
for administration purposes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, heads of state and government leaders from 186
countries gathered in Rome, Italy for the world food summit
convened by the FAO. Participants pledged their political will
and national commitment to the continuing efforts to eradicate
hunger in all countries.
</P>
<P>
They decided to reduce at least by half the number of
chronically undernourished people in the world by the year 2030.
Such people now number more than 800 million.
</P>
<P>
Under the "telefood" program, the 174 FAO member countries
would be compelled to have agricultural programs frequently
broadcasted in their countries so that people have the latest
information on food trends and how best they could work to
maximize food production.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Improve Telecom Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed to
install optical fiber cables between the two neighbors to ease the
pressure of the growing telecommunications traffic, official
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between telecom authorities of the
two countries this week, digital telephone links will be
established in the near future to replace the existing co-axial
cable links between Nepal and India, Nepal Telecom Corporation
(NTC) said today in a press release.
</P>
<P>
A coordination meeting between the state-run NTC and the Indian
Telecommunications Department, which concluded here Wednesday, has
discussed measures to promote transborder telecom services, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Direct digital telephone calls will be possible between
Kathmandu and major Indian cities like Delhi, Calcutta, Patna and
Madras after the implementation of the recent agreement, it added.
</P>
<P>
The dialing circuits capacity between Nepal and India will
increase at least fourfold after the optical fiber link is set up,
the NTC said.

<HEADLINE> Third PLA Advance Team Arrives in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The third 90-strong advance
contingent of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison
in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
arrived here this noon, to join the first and second advance
parties already in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The third, or the final, advance team including 17 field
officers, 44 junior officers and 29 soldiers, riding 12 military
vehicles, passed Hong Kong's Lok Ma Chau Border Control Point at
about 13:00 on their way to Cassino Lines.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be deployed in six military barracks --
the Prince of Wales Barracks, Stanley Fort, Callipoli Lines,
Cassino Lines, Osborn Barracks and Boham Towers.
</P>
<P>
All together, 196 advance PLA personnel are now in Hong Kong,
with Major General Zhou Borong, deputy commander of the future PLA
HKSAR Garrison, as their top commander until Hong Kong's return to
its motherland, China, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The PLA advance troops consisting of one major general, 58
field officers, 75 junior officers, three administrative staff and
59 soldiers are assigned here to make practical preparations for
the future PLA garrison to take over the responsibility for the
defense of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The first party of 40 led by Major General Zhou came on April
21 and are stationed in the Prince of Wales Barracks and
Stonecutters Island barracks. The second team of 66 which arrived
on May 19 are staying in the Prince of Wales Barracks, Gun Club
Hill Barracks, Sek Kong Camp and Stonecutters Island Barracks.
</P>
<P>
In April, the two sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) reached agreement on the entry of the first batch of PLA
HKSAR garrison's advance troops into Hong Kong. One month later,
both sides agreed on the entry of the second and third advance
parties.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the PLA garrison to be stationed in Hong Kong
was completed in early 1996. Made up of ground, naval and air
forces, and with strict political, military and disciplinary
training, the garrison will be officially stationed in Hong Kong
at zero hour on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The garrison, formed in accordance with the PLA missions
stipulated in China's Constitution and the relevant stipulation of
the Basic Law, would take the responsibility for the defense of
the HKSAR, safeguard state sovereignty, reunification and
territorial integrity and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wool prices rose
sharply across the board at auction this week, with underlying
strength of the market expected to continue, the Australian
council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The key eastern market indicator ended the week at 700
Australian cents (536 US cents) per kg clean, up 25 Australian
cents (19 US cents) from the previous sales two weeks ago. The
Australian Associated Press said today in a report.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator finished 29 Australian cents (22
US cents) higher at 658 Australian cents (504 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said in its weekly report that a total of 100,582 bales
were offered at auction, with a pass-in rate of 7 percent at the
Sydney, Melbourne and Freemantle sales.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety said the week's trade had been dominated by
Japanese buyers and was stimulated by expectations the wool supply
would be restricted over the rest of the selling season.
</P>
<P>
The strength in the market was due to strong demand and the
fall of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and Japanese
yen in recent weeks, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Wool supply will be limited over coming weeks, with next
week's offering particularly small and this has encouraged
competition in the market," it said in its weekly report.
</P>
<P>
"These factors are expected to continue in the short term and,
therefore, the wool market outlook is for further price increases
next week and a generally positive trend over the rest of the
season."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Grows 8.2 Percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by 8.2 percent in the first quarter of 1997,
the Central Bank announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth was the same as in the preceding quarter but
slightly slower than the 8.3 percent recorded in the corresponding
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its "Economic and Financial Developments in
the First Quarter of 1997" that the first quarter growth momentum
was sustained mainly by sustained domestic activity in the
manufacturing, construction and services sectors, while export
demand recovered since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing grew by 12.9 percent from 12.5 percent in the
previous quarter in comparison with 13.9 percent in the same
quarter last year, construction 14 percent against 16 percent in
the previous quarter and 11 percent in the corresponding quarter
last year, agriculture 2.6 percent against 2.8 percent and 3.2
percent and services 9 percent against 9.6 percent and 8.7 percent
respectively, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing, both export-oriented industries -- which
expanded by 11.4 percent and domestic market-oriented industries
by 14.6 percent -- provided the stimulus to growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
As for the export-oriented industries, output of the
electronics industry continued to expand strongly by 22.9 percent,
reflecting an improvement in the global demand for semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
Within the domestic market-oriented industries, strong growth
was recorded by industries producing chemicals and chemical
products (22.6 percent), fabricated metal products (17.4 percent),
transport equipment (13.6 percent) and construction-related
products (13.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
It said the higher agricultural output was due to the higher
production of crude palm oil and a turnaround in cocoa output.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank also said that private consumption expanded
further, albeit at a more moderate pace, while private investment
continued to be strong.
</P>
<P>
In the external sector, the trade account turned to record a
large surplus of 2 billion ringgit (about 800 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, loan approvals remained high during the
quarter, amounting to 50.2 billion ringgit (about 20.08 billion
dollars) against 50.8 billion ringgit (about 20.32 billion
dollars) in the previous quarter, of which about half was granted
to the broad property and finance, insurance and business service
sectors, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The net international reserves held by the Central Bank
increased by 2.1 billion ringgit (about 840 million dollars)
during the first quarter to 72.2 billion ringgit (about 28.88
billion dollars) at the end of March, sufficient to finance 4.7
months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
However, as at May 15, Malaysia's external reserves declined to
71.1 billion ringgit (about 28.44 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai-Myanmar Troops' Standoff Settles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The week-long standoff between Thai
and Myanmar troops on a flood-created islet has been temporarily
settled after Thai soldiers were told that the Thai prime minister
had allowed Myanmar to dredge the Moei river as part of a deal.
</P>
<P>
After talks Thursday at the border, both sides agreed to move
their troops out of the Khok Chang Perak area, the dredging site,
according to a report from Tak province, 430 kilometers north of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Tension grew earlier last week when the Myanmar side began
dredging work at the river to restore its original course and
ignored Thai border units' warning to stop.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, both sides dispatched reinforcements to the area.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Army
Commander-in-Chief General Chettha Thanajaro, who made an official
visit to Yangon earlier this month, gave the Myanmar military the
go-ahead to dredge the Moei river to restore its original course.
</P>
<P>
The border river changed its course two years ago as a result
of major flooding and created an islet which was previously land
on the Myanmar side.
</P>
<P>
Thailand claims the new islet in accordance with a border
treaty signed 129 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister's agreement to the dredging was part of
a deal in exchange for Myanmar's agreement to open the Friendship
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
But the Thai army units at the border Tak province were not
aware of the deal reached upon at the top level.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will discuss the disputed area further in
future, according to Thai Foreign Ministry sources.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Free From Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for Argentina's beef
exports have been given a boost today after the International
Epizootical Bureau (OIE) declared the country free of
foot-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
The contagious disease has cost the country's cattle industry
between 849 million and 1.1 billion U.S. dollars a year over the
last few years and has hit exports badly. Argentina is a major
beef exporter.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Sola, minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries
and Food, who is attending the 65th OIE General Session in Paris,
said today that representatives from the 143 OIE member countries
unanimously approved Argentina's request to be declared free of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth is a contagious disease affecting cattle and
other cloven-footed animals characterized by ulcers around the
hooves and mouth.
</P>
<P>
"This recognition crowns the efforts of Argentine cattle
producers and is a proof of the collective capacity to transform
an adverse circumstance," said Sola.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine authorities started the war against the disease
and no new case has been registered in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Raising Livestock Benefits Farmers in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xining, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northwest China's Qinghai
Province have increased their incomes by raising livestock as part
of a government-backed livestock campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 farmers in the province's eastern part are
competing with herdsmen in the western pastoral areas by getting
involved in livestock-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
The province provides preferential policies encouraging rural
areas to develop animal husbandry and has helped set up 144
livestock breeding centers. More than 40,000 households, or 11.4
percent of the local rural households, are raising livestock.
</P>
<P>
As a result, livestock raising has become a major part of
agricultural production and has changed the way farmers make a
living.
</P>
<P>
Earnings last year from livestock accounted for more than 22
percent of the total income, and farmers are able to eat much more
meat, milk, and eggs per capita.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai has also spread the use of livestock raising techniques
as part of the campaign, so that 21.3 percent of rural households
have begun to raise pigs.

<P>
ROME, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian economic think-tank, Isco,
has predicted that the country's economic growth will rise by 2.1
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
But it warned the deficit would have to be controlled to keep
it under three percent, the criteria stipulated by the Maastricht
Treaty for European Union nations joining the single currency, the
Euro, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Isco forecast that inflation would rise two percent and
employment 0.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figures were somewhat different from those reported in the
government's economic planning document which is now in the final
stage of review.
</P>
<P>
According to union representatives who saw the government
figures, the report puts the gross domestic product (GDP) at 2.1
percent, inflation at 1.8, employment up 0.5, and the deficit/GDP
ratio at 2.8.
</P>
<P>
"Short term prospects are very encouraging despite persistent
uncertainties," Isco said, pointing to "a generally positive
scenario" for Italy's 1997 and 1998 economy.
</P>
<P>
Wages would rise 4.2 percent this year and 3.4 percent next
year, Isco predicted. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Overcrowding in Italy's prisons is
making it impossible to guarantee medical care and the situation
has become explosive, a leading Italian prison doctor said today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Francesco Ceraudo, president of the prison Doctors'
Association, told his association's annual conference in Palinuro,
that more than 50,000 prisoners are held in institutions with bed
spaces for only 32,500.
</P>
<P>
"Thus six or seven people are crowded into little cells, and in
some prisons they even put mattresses on the floor," Ceraudo said.
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions it is impossible to guarantee the minimum
medical care" for the prison population, of which 35 percent were
drug addicts, 6,000 HIV positive inmates and 2,500 suffering from
psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
This caused an increase of prison suicides, hunger strikes and
assaults. "It is a bomb which could explode at any moment,"
Ceraudo warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Multipurpose use of resources will
effectively balance China's high-speed economic growth and
environmental protection, according to a seminar held here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar suggested changing the idea that
economic development goes before environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need to turn waste materials into products
and money through comprehensive utilization of resources that will
save energy and improve the eco-system simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wule, vice-minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, told the seminar that China's GNP (the value of
goods and services produced) has increased more than 10 times, but
consumption of mineral resources has risen over 40 times, since
New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of useful resources were discarded as wastes,
resulting in great economic losses that would not have occurred if
they had been recycled, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China must formulate a strategy on utilizing resources in a
comprehensive way to promote the shift in economic growth from an
extensive operation to an intensive operation.
</P>
<P>
A law on multipurpose use of resources should be formulated as
soon as possible, and the State should also give priority to the
work in terms of funding and policy support, experts said.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces New Medical Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- About 65 percent of enterprises in
Weihai, a port city in east China's Shandong province, have joined
a new medical insurance system which combines individual medical
accounts with social funding.
</P>
<P>
Weihai is one of China's pilot cities for the new system. The
city has required all employees in the units run by the provincial
and central governments as well as those in local enterprises to
join up.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, enterprises should grant an amount which is
equivallent to nine percent of each employee's wages to form a
social medical fund, while individual employees are required to
put in one percent of their monthly income into the medical
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Medical expenses for minor illnesses are paid out of the
individual accounts, while the social fund takes care of the major
costs of serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
As of April, all employees in state-run enterprises in the city
were able to use special magnetic cards or certificates to pay for
their medicare treatment instead of paying cash.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the State Council first implemented the measures in
Zhenjiang, in east China's Jiangsu province and in Jiujiang, east
China's Jiangxi province.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped the system will be expanded to more than 50 cities
in China by the end of this year, the official said.

</P>
<P>
Business World

6.1-percent growth in the first quarter despite a slowdown in
manufacturing and disappointing export performance.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. complaint against the Philippines' failure to
comply with its pork and poultry market access commitments under

<P>
-- The country's net oil import bill increased 23.5 percent to

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Taps Huge Potential of Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
is striving hard to tap various kinds of resources in the Qaidam
Basin, in a bid to speed up local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin, with a total area of 250,000 sq km, is
regarded as the treasure basin of the country. To date, 39 kinds
of minerals have been discovered there, with potential economic
returns estimated at 15 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Following 40 years of development, a large number of key
enterprises and infrastructure facilities have been built in the
basin, involving production of petroleum, the salt chemical
industry, nonferrous metals and building materials.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a number of scientific research findings have
been scored and data concerning minerals and hydrogeological
acquired.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 15 salt lakes and mines have been developed in
the basin area, including 50 salt projects. And a dozen salt-based
enterprises have formed a combined annual crude salt and
potassium chloride production capacity of 1.5 million tons and
350,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A local source noted that the basin is rich in oil and gas
reserves, with 16 oil fields and six gas fields discovered here.
</P>
<P>
Three oil projects have already been completed here. They
include an oil field with annual crude output of 1.2 million tons,
a 436-km oil pipeline and and an oil refinery with an annual
capacity of one million tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the basin has large coal reserves and an annual
coal production capacity of 500,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Big Oil Field Discovered in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two oil companies, Shell Australia
and Culturs Petroleum NL, have confirmed the existence of one of
Australia's biggest offshore oil discoveries, revealing that the
Cornea field is now estimated to contain up to 2,665 million
barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
The massive Cornea discovery, which potentially exceeds the
largest of the Bass Strait oil finds, is the latest in a string of
oil and gas discoveries in the biggest offshore exploration boom
in the nation's history, the Australian Financial Review reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Cornea discovery lies about 150 km off the West Australian
coast and about 650 km west of the city of Darwin. The field was
discovered late last year amid tight security over the information
flow from the drilling rig.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the amount of oil likely to be produced from the
field is yet to be determined, but typical recovery rates in the
north-west of Australia are between 30 to 40 percent of the total
oil in place.
</P>
<P>
With Cornea estimated to contain from 617 million to 2,665
million barrels, this means it could rank alongside the biggest of
the Bass Strait oil discoveries.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 exploration and appraisal wells and 2,100 km of
seismic surveys are now planned over the Cornea discovery in the
next year, forming a significant part of a billion Australian
dollar (766 million U.S. dollars) drilling rush across the entire
north-west.
</P>
<P>
Australia's offshore waters in the arc from North West Cape to
Darwin now rank in the world's top three exploration destinations,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Cornea, the drilling boom in the past three
years has exposed several billion barrels of oil in finds.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia to Become Key Thermal Power Base in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China will complete work on a thermal power base with
a combined generating capacity of 10 million kw by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The base is designed to provide for other Chinese provinces
with 25 billion kwh of electricity annually then, making the
region a key power producer in China.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has verified coal reserve of 31.5 billion tons,
ranking sixth in China. The newly-opened Lingwu Coalfield has
verified reserves of 27.3 billion tons, equivalent to the combined
coal reserves in the three provinces in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The current generating capacity of the Ningxia Power Grid is
two million kw. It will be connected with the national power grid
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission has designated the third phase
expansion of the Qingtongxia Power Plant as a key national project
during the 1996-2000 period. The plant is designed to have a
combined capacity of 3.6 million kw by the early next century.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project at the Shizuishan Power Plant, with a
designed capacity of 1.2 million kw, has obtained approval from
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia plans to add a total generating capacity of 900,000 kw
to 1.2 million kw in the 1996-2000 period, said a local official

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Quanzhou in east China's Fujian
province will step up efforts to build itself into a modern port
city in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 19 wharfs, with a designed annual handling
capacity of more than 12 million tons in total. In 1996, the
wharfs handled more than eight million tons of cargo, ranking the
18th in the country, said Qiu Guangzhong, secretary of Quanzhou
City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Quanzhou will focus on the construction of a
number of port projects, including Xiaocuo, a major port handling
oil tanks . By 2010, Quanzhou will build up an international
container transfer port and three ports that cater to trade with
Taiwan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of ports of entry will also provide a sound
opportunity for expansion of tourism.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city's Jinjiang Airport and Zhangping-Quanzhou
railway line have gone into operation. An expressway from Quanzhou
to Xiamen, another port city in the province will open for service
within the year, the official said.

KIEV, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has welcomed the accord
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia,
describing it as "a vital step" for Moscow in normalizing
relations with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine supports Russia in establishing cooperation with NATO,
and the cooperation is a key element to guarantee the stability
and security of the entire European continent, the Ukrainian
Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO signed the Founding Act on Mutual Relations,
Cooperation and Security in Paris Tuesday.

The act allows NATO to expand into Central and Eastern Europe
without hurting Russia's interests.

<P>
The act pushes NATO and Russia towards wider cooperation, not
towards creation of new spheres of influence or new division
lines, and it should not affect interests of a third country, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine hopes to sign a special partnership agreement with NATO
during a NATO summit in Madrid this Summer.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Opposes Interference in Zaire's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today called for a rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis
in Zaire through dialogue and the convening of an international
conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council also reaffirmed its
previous calling for rapid agreement on peaceful transitional
arrangement leading to the holding of democratic and free
elections with the participation of all parties.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by China, one of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, the council stressed in the statement that
during the transitional process it opposes any interferences in
Zaire's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Council," said the statement, "respects the legitimate
national aspirations of the people of the Democratic Republic of
Congo to achieve peace, national reconciliation and progress in
the political, economic and social fields to the benefit of all,
and opposes any interference in its internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The council reaffirmed the national sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of that country and called for the
withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
It also called for protection and security for all refugees
and displaced persons and facilitation of access to humanitarian
assistance.

<HEADLINE> US Responds Cautiously to Yeltsin's Pledge on Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today responded cautiously to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's offer not to aim nuclear weapons at the countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony for the Founding Act between NATO and
Russia in Paris Tuesday, Yeltsin told 16 NATO leaders that Russia
will remove all the nuclear warheads of the weapons which are
aimed at NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
"It remains unclear to me, based on the reports that I've seen,
exactly what President Yeltsin had in mind," Cohen told a press
conference at the U.S. Strategic Command Offutt Air Force Base in
Omaha, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
"It may be simply a reaffirmation of the policy that was
announced previously that Russia would no longer target American
either cities or facilities," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be very cautious here. I think it's
important that we establish as good as a relationship as possible
with our Russian counterparts," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
After Yeltsin made the pledge, U.S. President Bill Clinton
reportedly favored some type of reciprocal gesture.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said the U.S. will not take any immediate action. "I
don't think we should see any immediate reaction or take
precipitous action."
</P>
<P>
"I would urge caution here, that we not make grand gestures
before we know what the facts are," Cohen stressed.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Financing for Projects in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved a
loan and credits totaling 149.8 million U.S. dollars equivalent to
support projects in four African countries.
</P>
<P>
A credit of some 23.8 million dollars equivalent will be used
for Madagascar's private sector development and capacity building
project. The project will support implementation over 1997-2002 of
the economic policy reform program.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of some 46 million dollars equivalent is
provided for the South Africa industrial competitiveness and job
creation project. The project would support the government's
development goals of greater economic, export and employment
growth by accelerating the space at which South African firms
adjust to the ongoing trade liberalization to compete more
effectively in global markets.
</P>
<P>
A third credit of about 20 million dollars equivalent is
earmarked for Niger's urban infrastructure rehabilitation project.
The project will assist the government in reducing poverty in
urban areas, providing municipalities with skills to develop and
manage their infrastructure and promoting local engineering firms
and contractors.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending wing of
the World Bank for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the bank also okayed a 60 million dollar loan to
assist the Tunisian government in improving service levels of
urban sewerage up to average level of potable water service,
promoting efficient reuse of effluent from sewerage treatment
plans for agricultural purposes.

<HEADLINE> US Rejects Military Intervention in Sierra Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States today rejected
an appeal from Sierra Leone's ambassador to send troops to the
West African country to help oust coup leaders who toppled an
elected government over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's Ambassador John Leigh earlier sent a petition to
the State Department urging U.S. marines on board the Navy
helicopter ship Kearsarge, which is on standby to evacuate American
citizens from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, to intervene in the
crisis caused by the military coup.
</P>
<P>
Leigh told a rally of Sierra Leonean demonstrators in
Washington that the United States could "work with other nations
and international organizations to act decisively to end the
crisis, by force of arms if necessary."
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman John Dinger said that the role
of the Kearsarge is to "evacuate American citizens only."
</P>
<P>
"Personnel from the Kearsarge will have no role beyond that,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dinger said the U.S. charge d'affaires in Freetown had
contacted the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council set up by the
coup leaders and reiterated U.S. demands that it surrender power
immediately to the elected government.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Prices Near All-Time Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- New York's coffee futures prices
today moved within striking distance of all-time highs on the
possibility of frost in Brazil and reports of poor crops in
smaller coffee-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Green, arabica coffee for July delivery to the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange in New York rose 19.25 cents to 3.148 U.S.
dollars a pound after soaring as high as 3.18 U.S. dollars a
pound. Coffee futures now are at their highest since April 1977
and threaten to surpass an all-time high of 3.375 U.S. dollars
touched that same month.
</P>
<P>
Colombia, which combines with Brazil to produce 45 percent of
the world's coffee crop, is expected in October to begin
harvesting a below-par crop for a second year because of heavy
rains and labor problems.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's production also has been significantly lower in recent
years following severe frosts in 1994 that damaged coffee trees,
which generally take about three years before they can again
produce good yields.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's production this year could be 18 million bags, one
group estimated, far below the normal 27 million bags. Each bag
weighs 132 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nicaragua and Tanzania reported drought in both
countries' most fertile coffee-growing regions.

<HEADLINE> Bosnians Clear Way for Donors' Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Council of Ministers
today adopted the customs law, thus paving the way for holding an
international conference on financial assistance to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The customs law is part of a package of the so-called "quick
start" legislation which the United States and its allies ask the
Bosnian parties to adopt before the donors' conference could be
held.
</P>
<P>
"The whole packet for quick start has been adopted now, and we
will send it to the Bosnian parliament for approval," said Haris
Silajdzic, co-chairman of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Silajdzic predicted that the donors' conference, which has
already been delayed several times due to the stalemate in
adopting the package, could now be held as early as in June.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the foreign ministers of NATO countries will
decide on the date of the conference while meeting in Sintra,
Portugal, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the customs law has been agreed upon by the Bosnian
parties, the agreement is only valid for six months, after which
it will be discussed again, said Silajdzic.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Texas Tornadoes Placed at 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Authorities ended the search
today for 23 people previously unaccounted for after a devastating
tornado in Jarrell, Texas, concluding that those considered
missing had turned up alive or were among the unidentified bodies.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from Tuesday's tornado was placed at 28. Many of
the victims remained unidentified at the medical examiner's office
in Austin because their body parts had been scattered by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
The revised figure resulted from a double count of bodies and
people simply turning up, an official said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 homes were demolished when the twister smashed through
the Double Creek Estates subdivision in this town 40 miles north
of Austin.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, hundreds of rescue workers combed the area trying
to find people, dead or alive. They found neither.
</P>
<P>
It was the state's worst since May 22, 1987, when 30 people
died and 162 were injured in the West Texas town of Saragosa.
