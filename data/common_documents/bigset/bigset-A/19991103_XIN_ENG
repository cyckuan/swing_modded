HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) (C A United Nations official said
here Tuesday that the world body has sent experts to countries
which are supplying arms to Angolan rebels and persuade them to
stop such deals.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Panel Chairman on Angola Sanctions Anders Mollander told
a press conference, "we are finding out how UNITA has re-armed
itself, what arms they have and give recommendations which will
make it difficult for UNITA to continue the war."
</P>
<P>
The panel would focus on UNITA's sources of revenue and its
finances and the sources of military support to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The panel was established by the Security Council in July
following UNITA's violations of U.N. sanctions regarding to arms
and related material, petroleum, diamonds and financial assets.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sanctions were imposed in 1993 after UNITA leader

<HEADLINE> SADC States Urged to Enact Policies on Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) states should enact policies
on strengthening community-based natural resources management
projects, a SADC official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The policies should include a land tenure system recognizing
that land belongs to the communities who could use it for projects
to well manage the natural resources, SADC natural resources
advisor Steve Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Natural resources have a potential to contribute millions of
dollars to the gross domestic product (GDP) but are failing to do
so because there are no strategies to maximize their potential,
the SADC official said.
</P>
<P>
There is need for the region to integrate community-based
projects like the Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous
Resources for the communities to learn from others' experiences,
the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Johnson as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least four countries, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa and
Zambia, are already working together and discussing with the other
countries for cooperation "because that is the only way our
communities can progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that it is through cooperation between communities
and the private sector that SADC communities could realize maximum
profits from their projects.
</P>
<P>
A recent SADC meeting linked to community-based projects also
stressed that natural resources programs should be treated as the
best way to stimulate rural development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts Hungarian Statement on Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday expressed
bewilderment and serious concern over Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orban's announcement that U.S. nuclear arms could be
deployed in his country "in a critical situation."
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin described
the statement as "a direct violation of the Russia-NATO Founding
Act," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The document specified that "NATO countries confirmed that they
had no intentions, plans or causes to deploy weapons in the
territories of new members or the need to change any of the
aspects of building the organization's nuclear force or nuclear
policy and did not foresee such steps in the future."
</P>
<P>
Hungary became a member of NATO in the latest wave of
enlargement of the transatlantic military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said that the words of the Hungarian prime minister
at a minimum put into doubt the numerous assurances of Budapest
that its admission into NATO was not anti-Russian and did not
threaten Russian security interests.
</P>
<P>
"This directly confirms Russia's concerns relating to NATO
enlargement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin urged the NATO leadership to "duly respond to the
demarche of Mr. Orban."
</P>
<P>
He said that Orban's "references to the domestic situation in
Russia are regarded in Moscow as totally inappropriate and
incorrect, and linked with the deployment of nuclear arms, are
simply dangerous."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asked to Keep Promises on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to keep his promises and
deal with the Cyprus issue seriously, Government Spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent statements by U.S. Ambassador to
Greece Nicholas Burns, Papapetrou said there are "concrete
assurances from the American side that the Cyprus issue will be
very high on the President's agenda during his visit" to the
region, later this month.
</P>
<P>
Burns has said that the Cyprus issue will not be the focus of
discussions during Clinton's visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton's visit to the region will be judged by its outcome
and if the Cyprus question is not at the center of his visit to
Greece, the government will be critical," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to see what President Clinton will do.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that at the end of the day the U.S. will honor their
pledges to tackle the Cyprus question in a serious manner,"
Papapetrou added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Burns had said that bilateral issues will be
the focus of Clinton's discussions in Athens, which will certainly
include the Cyprus issue and Greco-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negaso
Gidada Tuesday hailed sister relationship between Ethiopia and
Djibouti, which, he said, is exemplary in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet hosted in honor of Djibouti President
Ismail Omar Guelleh, Negaso said "We see Djibouti not only as a
reliable asset for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa, but
also as a reliable partner for development."
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia will redouble its efforts to promote its trade
and business interactions with Djibouti by facilitating for free
movement of people, capital and goods, as well as by easing cross
border transportation, optimum utilization of the port of
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, Negaso reiterated accusation against
Eritrea, saying the neighboring country imposed "war of
aggression" on Ethiopia, which has become "a tragedy for the whole
of the region".
</P>
<P>
Negaso also expressed that Ethiopia always endeavors to bring
about national reconciliation and the formation of a broad-based
and all- inclusive central authority in the war-torn Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia welcomes and fully supports the recent proposal put
forward by Djibouti to bring about a lasting solution to the
tragic crisis in Somalia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh said that the Ethio-Djibouti bilateral bounds were
stronger than ever, and stressed the need to work more to further
the existing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president also expressed support for Ethiopia in
the Ethio- Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since the border war broke out in May 1998 between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, Ethiopia, the land-locked country, has resorted to
Djibouti port as its sea outlet.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi
Zuetir on Tuesday strongly condemned Israel's continuous
aggression on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli assault on Lebanon aims at exerting pressure on
the country and destabilizing the situation in the region," he
said in a statement published by the state-run National News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Lebanon will not yield to the Israeli threat
and will stick to the demand that the Jewish state withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon,
which covers one-tenth of the country's territory, in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Israeli troops escalated the air strikes on
villages and hills in the region which are presumed to be hideouts
of Hezbollah guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Inflation Rate Up due to Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate rose to
8.2 percent in October from 7.2 percent in September due to a
severe drought in the north of the east African country, the
Central Bank of Kenya said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Higher food prices indicated "the current shortfall in supply
of food items,'' which had triggered off an increase in
inflation, according to a report released by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Local economists warned that a double digit inflation in the
future is possible.
</P>
<P>
The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes food prices,
was unchanged at 6.6 percent in the year up to October.
</P>
<P>
Economists blame the sharp rise in the inflation rate on a
combination of food shortages, a depreciation in the Kenyan
shilling against the U.S. dollar, and higher energy costs.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank said in September that those
pressures would " be insufficient to push inflation beyond the
single digit range by June 2000". The bank is targeting an
underlying rate of five percent by next June.
</P>
<P>
About five million Kenyans are reportedly threatened by famine
in up to 18 districts countrywide.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 2 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdul-Aziz held talks here
Tuesday afternoon local time at the Prince's residence.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prince said that China is the best friend of Saudi
Arabia, which is also the common feeling of all Arabians.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made a high comment on the remarkable achievements of the
Saudi Arabian people under the leadership of King Fahd in
defending the independent national sovereignty and territorial
integrity, developing national economy and improving the living
standard of its people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Saudi Arabia is an important country in the
Middle East and Gulf regions and exerts key influence in
safeguarding regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President praised the independent and peaceful
foreign policy and the positive role Saudi Arabia has played in
maintaining peace and stability of the Gulf region, restoring the
solidarity between Arab countries and pushing forward the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade since China and Saudi Arabia have
established diplomatic ties, drastic progress has been achieved
through joint efforts of both sides in all fields of politics,
economy, culture, news media and sports. China is satisfied with
the development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Last year when the Crown Prince visited China, the two
countries have decided to enhance the bilateral relationship in
political and economic fields to the height of strategic
cooperation, which well demonstrated the political willness of the
two countries to further develop relationship, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that China and Saudi Arabia relationship
has enjoyed a good momentum of development, with frequent visits
of high ranking officials and field of cooperation expanded," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China and Saudi Arabia are important countries in East and West
Asia respectively, both of which adopt independent and peaceful
foreign policy and have identical or similar views on many
international affairs with mutual support and cooperation, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Although social systems of the two countries are different, he
added, they don't have problems left over from history and have no
conflicts of fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Saudi Arabia have advocated to develop bilateral
relationship on the basis of the principle of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, non-interference in other's internal
affairs, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
At present, Jiang said, international situation is undergoing a
profound change, economic globalization is developing rapidly,
which has provided us with opportunities and challenges as well.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Saudi Arabia are developing countries, which
face the common task of developing national economy and improving
the living standard of the peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, learning from each other is not only beneficial to the
development of bilateral relationship but also the construction of
respective country, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President reaffirmed that China valued its
relations with Saudi Arabia and is willing to join hands with it
to devote to the establishment of strategic relationship and
cooperation in political and economic field.

ABU DHABI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) and the European Union (EU) ended their
annual meeting Tuesday, failing to make progress on a free trade
zone proposal.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries currently impose taxes on imports of Gulf
aluminium and petrochemical products, which the GCC sees as a
major obstacle for a long-awaited fthe one-day meeting in
Dubai, UAE, reiterated the GCC's desire to establish a free trade
zone with the EU, the GCC's top trading partner.
</P>
<P>
"The GCC is the only market in which the EU enjoys a surplus in
trade balance, estimated at 19 billion U.S. dollars," Abdullah
said.
</P>
<P>
Ways must be found to "remedy the imbalance by increasing the
influx of goods from the Gulf to the EU markets," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups six Gulf states. They are Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, who led the EU
delegation to the meeting and whose country is holding the EU
presidency, denied that EU countries were adopting a policy of
protectionism with regard to negotiations with the GCC, saying
that the common objective of the two sides was to reach an
agreement on a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
She said she had a great respect for the steps being taken by
the GCC to forge a common customs tariff, which the EU sees as the
base for a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The GCC member states have set March 1, 2001 as the target date
for a customs union to come into force, the first step toward
setting up a Gulf common market with annual imports of more than
50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, GCC and EU officials expressed concern
over the seriousor more international efforts to
ensure that the oil-for-food program works to the fullest
advantage of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under the program that went into effect in December 1996, the
U.N. allows Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990,
to export limited amount of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials agreed with the GCC countries that the dispute

<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission
(JMC) started its meeting here Tuesday afternoon in the absence of
a delegation from the Congolese rebel group, the Movement for the
Liberation of Congo (MLC).
</P>
<P>
Zambia's defense secretary Timothy Kazembe told journalists
that members of the MLC are expected to join the meeting later.
</P>
<P>
The non-arrival of the MLC members had forced the meeting to be
 postponed twice, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kazembe disclosed that the meeting would discuss in detail the
implementation of the cease-fire agreement in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He said items on the agenda include the disarmament process in
the country and making a decision on who would supervise it.
</P>
<P>
Kazembe said the meeting would also come up with a budget on
the peace- keeping mission in the DRC, adding that it would also
see the deployment of forces from 12 African countries to oversee
the cessation of hostilities in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Set up under the cease-fire agreement, which was signed in
Lusaka earlier this year, the JMC will be responsible for
executing peace-keeping operations until the deployment of the
United Nations peace-keeping force.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Deal Refugee Issue in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein stressed Tuesday that the issue of Palestinian refugees
must be touched upon in the upcoming final status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with British Defense
Minister Jeffry Hoon who is visiting Amman on bilateral ties and
the Middle East peace process, Jordan`s official news agency
Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The refugee issue involves legal, political and economic
dimensions that could not be ignored, and the world community must
start setting a comprehensive idea dealing with the issue,
Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that problems concerning refugees and Jerusalem
are delicate and significant due to their effect on the future
and sustainability of the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinian refugees had fled their homes and taken
shelter in neighboring countries after decades of wars between
Israel and the Arab world, and Jordan alone has some 1.2 million
registered Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government said it supported the rights of the
Palestinians of either returning to their homeland or asking for
compensation, though most of the Palestinian refugees have been
granted Jordanian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
For his part, British Defense Minister Hoon expressed his
appreciation for the role played by King Abdullah in promoting the
peace process in the region, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and for
years, the kingdom has been trying to narrow the differences
between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors for a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Spending Fed More by Home Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that the consumer spending
boom has been fueled more by rising home sales than by the soaring
stock market with its volatile gains.
</P>
<P>
He said that research by Fed economists indicated that the
profits homeowners get when they sell their houses get translated
into increases in consumer spending in a bigger way than capital
gains realized from rising stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Even though the appreciation of stock prices has been vastly
greater than that of home prices, most estimates suggest that
stock gains are consumed only gradually, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believed that while stock market gains have lifted
the level of consumer spending by around 3 percent to 4 percent
annually, the increased consumer spending that has come from
rising home sales has been near 5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan pointed out that the major reason for this difference
is that homeowners spend with more confidence that the wealth
building up in their homes is more nearly permanent than gains in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"While home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are
rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but
persistent rise in home values that is perceived to be largely
permanent," Greenspan said. "This experience contrasts markedly
from volatile and often-ephemeral gains in stock market wealth."
</P>
<P>
In his remarks today to a mortgage conference sponsored by
America's Community Bankers, Greenspan offered no hints as to what
the Fed may about interest rates at its next meeting Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
Some economists are still looking for a rate increase,
believing that last week's report showing the economy grew at a
4.8 percent rate in the summer will lead the central bank to
conclude that interest rates need to rise further to slow economic
activity and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
In his today's speech, Greenspan said the wealthiest Americans
own the largest share of stocks and their rising wealth does not
translate into increased spending at the same rate as lower income
groups.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan estimated that one-sixth of the impact on consumer
spending from rising wealth has come from equity extracted from
the stock of existing homes, either through sales or by homeowners
taking out home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
He warned that while the homeownership rate rose in the
July-September quarter to more than 67 percent, it has spent most
of the 1980s and 1990s stuck at around 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Future gains will depend on efforts by the banking industry to
continue to streamline the mortgage application process so that
more groups can qualify, Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> War-created Refugees Flow Into Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Refugees from war-torn Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are flowing into
Mozambique, the Mozambique News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 refugees are known in the northern province of Niassa,
 provincial police commander, Zacarias Cossa said. These refugees
fleeing from political instability in the Great Lakes region had
to cross Tanzania before they came to Mozambique, he added.
</P>
<P>
Possibly, there are many more who have not been reported, Cossa
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has acquired a reputation for stability, and
"probably that is why many refugees come to our country," the
police commander noted.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been given shelter at an accommodation center
in the provincial capital, Lichinga, while awaiting a decision on
their situation.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has committed itself to sheltering refugees from
war-torn countries by signing the U.N. convention on refugees.
</P>
<P>
The police have notified the Mozambican Refugee Support Nucleus
which reported the case to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), Cossa said.
</P>
<P>
As for the social behavior of the refugees, the police
commander said that no crime has been reported involving this
group, and they have never caused the authorities any problems.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on fears that the refugees might vote in the
forthcoming elections from December 3 to 4, Cossa said there is no
such possibility because most of them came into the country after
the voter registration process had ended.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkish Premier's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday criticized the
statements made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit concerning
Athens' guarantor power for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that these statements were not accurate as
Greece was not only a formal guarantor power but in practice one,
as it met all its obligations and commitments.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Ecevit's statement as "unfair," Reppas noted that
such statements did little to contribute to the progress already
noted in improving relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that talks between the two foreign ministries'
officials would continue.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit reportedly said Monday that Greece had lost the right to
be considered a guarantor power for Cyprus as the military junta
then ruling the country was behind an attempted coup on the island
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the island republic's security, Greece and Cyprus
has signed a joint defense pact.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says U.S. Bound to Observe Nuke Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has written foreign governments to say the
United States is legally bound to observe the nuclear test ban
treaty despite the Senate's rejection of the pact.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times Tuesday quoted Albright as saying in a
letter that the administration does not regard the Senate's
rejection as the death of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said the Senate vote was "a major
disappointment to the administration, as I know it was to your
government."
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by a
vote of 51-48 on October 13 although the administration urged the
vote to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Albright's letter was the administration's formal diplomatic
notice that it will abide by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Following the Senate's rejection of the treaty, President Bill
Clinton promised that the U.S. would continue its moratorium in
nuclear testing, which had begun in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. has no plans and no need to conduct
nuclear tests and will maintain a self-imposed ban on testing.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this setback, I want to assure you that the United
States will continue to act in accordance with its obligations as
a signatory under international law, and will seek reconsideration
of the treaty at a later date when conditions are better suited
for ratification," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary's letter was dated October 18 and her spokesman,
James Rubin, confirmed the letter, The Washington Times said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the administration believes it is still bound to
legally abide by the test-ban treaty because it has not given up
on ratification in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that so long as the president, in this case,
President Clinton, expresses his intention to seek advice and
consent pending whatever time frame he chooses, customary
international law applies," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Although the administration officials said the treaty can be
resubmitted to the Senate for another vote, experts say it is
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times quoted John Bolton, a constitutional
specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, as saying
that the treaty is already dead.
</P>
<P>
"In theory they can always resubmit it, but as a practical
matter, it's as dead as the Versailles Treaty," Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected the Versailles Treaty in 1919, repudiating
the League of Nations.

OSLO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak began their three-way talks at the U.S. ambassador's
residence here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such summit since Barak ousted his hardline
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Israel's general elections in
May. The three leaders are here for a commemoration ceremony
earlier Tuesday for late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was shot and killed by a Jewish opponent of his peace
policies on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Arafat and Barak will focus their discussions on ways

vitality into the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton met with Arafat and Barak separately,
apparently in an effort to facilitate the tripartite "unofficial

<HEADLINE> Arab Israeli Legislators Present Bill Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Arab Israeli legislators
have submitted a bill to the Knesset, or parliament, which calls
for the change of the definition of Israel as a Jewish state,
Israel Radio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, from the Balad party, and Muhammad Barakei, from
the Hadash party, said that Israehed 51 years ago, Israel has been defined as
Jewish
state, where Jews account for nearly 80 percent of the
population. But Arab legislators and some left-wing Jewish
legislators said this definition should be changed since it
implies discrimination against minority citizens.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 million Arab Israelis feel that they are discriminated
against in almost every field compared with Jewish citizens
because of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
There has never been an Arab cabinet minister in all
governments over the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
Three Arab parties -- Balad, Hadash, and the United Arab List -
control 10 seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In July, United Arab List legislator Hasham Mahamed was
appointed member of a prestigious Knesset committee overseeing
national security and foreign affairs for the first time. But
right-wing legislators have threatened to boycott the work of the
committee.

November and December, Lamisso told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
About 11 million children are targeted during the 1999 polio
immunization campaign. And about 10.5 million children aged
between six and 59 months and more than 400,000 lactating mothers
will also receive Vitamin A capsule during the process.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in
Ethiopia. Its consequence is blindness, affecting mainly the
children population.
</P>
<P>
Together with the polio vaccine, immunization of measles and
tetanus will also be conducted in some selected high-risk regions
in the country, Lamisso said. Measles is another major child
killer in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Some three million children are expected to be protected from
measles through the immunization.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice minister, more than 30,000 vaccination
posts are ready for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
All hospitals, health centers, health stations and health
posts, schools and churches, mosques and market places will be
used as vaccination sites, and more than 62,000 volunteers will be
mobilized.
</P>
<P>
The overall budget planned for anti-polio campaign this year,
including vaccines, Vitamin A capsules, equipment and operational
cost, are about 48 million birr (six million U.S. dollars),
Lamisso said.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Phillips, senior official of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), told the press conference that the
UNICEF has contributed about 70 million birr (8.7 million U.S.
dollars) towards the Ethiopian National Immunization Day campaign.
</P>
<P>
The fund has been mobilized through the generous support of the
 governments of Japan, the United States and Canada, Phillips
said.

<HEADLINE> Hombach Dissatisfied With Balkan Reconstruction Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The German special coordinator
for the stability pact for southeast Europe, Bodo Hombach, Tuesday
expressed his dissatisfaction over the slow progress of the Balkan
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference on the reconstruction of
the Balkans in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Hombach
said that the forces which had sought a military solution to the
Kosovo crisis were not moving fast enough to raise the funds
needed for the reconstruction of the Balkan region, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The special coordinator himself appeared unable to determine
when and where a decision on raising funds could be reached.
</P>
<P>
He praised Greece for its cooperation with other countries in
the region, saying that Greece had been the only country to
present a detailed action plan for the reconstruction of the
region so far and had also set itself as an example of steady
economic growth for others countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Romanian Finance Minister Decebal Traian Remes said
that financial organizations were not addressing the region's real
needs, such as those arising in the wake of the Kosovo crisis and
asked for the Black Sea Cooperation Bank and cooperation council
to become more actively involved in reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev also
stressed the need for a joint strategy on Balkan developments and
the European Union (EU) prospects of Balkan countries.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Washington to Preserve ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has warned the U.S. that Washington's deployment of a national
anti-missile system would lead to the collapse of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and have very dangerous consequences
for the entire disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, which was delivered
by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Oslo, Yeltsin said the
U.S. attempt to alter the ABM would especially hurt the
disarmament of nuclear weapons and international stability and
security, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Faithful adherence to the ABM Treaty and all other
understandings in arms restriction and reduction, combined with
political and diplomatic efforts at various levels, would be
sufficient to counter the threats the United States is trying to
use as an excuse for its plans to deploy a national anti-missile
defense system," the Kremlin press service quoted the message as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has also sent letters to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and leaders of the seven major industrialized countries, or
G-7, and China, India, South Africa and Sweden, calling their
attention to the alarming situation created by the latest U.S.
moves in the field of anti-missile defense, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
Even though only a few countries are signatories to it, the ABM
treaty is essential to the security of every nation, the letters
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia called for international efforts to keep it in place and
urged all countries to abide by the 1972 treaty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly will vote this week on a
Russian-Chinese draft resolution calling for maintaining and
abiding by the ABM Treaty, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> 75,000 Zambian Households to Be Lighted Up By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Tuesday promised that 75,000 households in Zambia will be
lighted up by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this when launching the Chifubu Township
Electrification Project in Ndola, Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that the electrification of
townships will help uplift the standard of living of people and
reduce dependency on charcoal which has greatly contributed to the
gross destruction of forests.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation, under its normal
electrification program, would connect about 15,000 households per
year for the next five years. At this rate, a total of 75,000
households would be added to the electricity supply network by
2003.
</P>
<P>
The Chifubu project the president commissioned is expected to
electrify 5,000 households.
</P>
<P>
As a practical demonstration to the electrification program,
early in 1994 the Zambian government created a rural
electrification fund which is administered by the Ministry of
Energy and Water Development to provide electricity to rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Some of the rural electrification projects have been completed.

<HEADLINE> Half of Urban Mozambicans to Use Running Water in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
working to ensure that 50 percent of the urban population have
access to piped water within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Baete, chairman of the Water Supply Investment and
Assets Fund, made these remarks here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only some 30 percent of the population of the seven
Mozambican cities, namely Maputo, Matola, Beira, Dondo, Quelimane,
Nampula and Pemba, have access to piped water.
</P>
<P>
The French-led private management consortium, Aguas de
Mocambique (Waters of Mozambique), has signed an agreement with
the Mozambican Water Supply Investment and Assets Fund, the
Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the management of the water supply
systems in the seven cities will from the end of November be
entrusted to Aguas de Mocambique.
</P>
<P>
But the infrastructures will remain as property of the
Mozambican state, and will be supervised by the Mozambican fund.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European
Union, and the governments of Mozambique and the Netherlands have
raised 114 million U. S. dollars for the initiative to better
supply the water for the urban Mozambicans.

<HEADLINE> Arab Israeli Legislators Present Bill Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Arab Israeli legislators
have submitted a bill to the Knesset, or parliament, which calls
for the change of the definition of Israel as a Jewish state,
Israel Radio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, from the Balad party, and Muhammad Barakei, from
the Hadash party, said that Israel should be defined as a
democratic and multi-cultural state since 20 percent of its 6
million citizens are Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Established 51 years ago, Israel has been defined as a Jewish
state, where Jews account for nearly 80 percent of the
population. But Arab legislators and some left-wing Jewish
legislators said this definition should be changed since it
implies discrimination against minority citizens.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 million Arab Israelis feel that they are discriminated
against in almost every field compared with Jewish citizens
because of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
There has never been an Arab cabinet minister in all
governments over the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
Three Arab parties -- Balad, Hadash, and the United Arab List -
control 10 seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In July, United Arab List legislator Hasham Mahamed was
appointed member of a prestigious Knesset committee overseeingthe
committee.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Deng Xiaoping Theory On United Front Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on united front
work under Deng Xiaoping theory was held today in the Great Hall
of the People.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the "people"
as understood within Marxism is the cornerstone of the united
front work.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how "the people" has been discursively defined in
a number of social and cultural discourses over time, the basic
notion that "the people" have created history remains unchanged,
he said. "It is a principle for the work of the united front to
reserve differences while seek common ground and display tolerance,
" added Li.
</P>
<P>
Li also stressed the importance of tolerance, saying that an
official doing united front work should be open-minded and willing
to listen to different points of view.
</P>
<P>
Those doing united front work should build a good image, enjoy
popularity and have a noble character.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a standing committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also
spoke at the symposium.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government vowed to turn Hong Kong
into a regional center of innovation and technology, HKSAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Hong Kong Awards for Industry Presentation
Ceremony, Tung said the 21st century is just around the corner and
in the new era of the knowledge-based economy, ideas and
information will matter as much, if not more than, tools and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
The success, or otherwise, of an economy will be determined by
its abilities to create and to innovate, Tung said. "Trade
liberalization and the evolution of information technology have
brought down many traditional trade barriers and accelerated our
migration to a global market."
</P>
<P>
To ensure that Hong Kong is well equipped to embrace these
challenges and opportunities that come with them, the government
is firmly committed to developing Hong Kong into a regional center
of innovation and technology, Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We have already set up a five billion HK dollar (641 million U.
S. dollar) innovation and technology fund to upgrade our
innovation and technology level," he said. "We are in the process
of establishing the applied science and technology research
institute to encourage mid-stream research and development."
</P>
<P>
"We will also set up a standing advisory body and high-level
promoting group to strengthen our institutional arrangements for
promoting innovation and technology," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has just announced a new scheme to
attract talents to Hong Kong to bolster Hong Kong's human
resources base, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Tung emphasized that before the end of the year, the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange will launch the Growth Enterprise Market which will
serve a new capital raising channel for innovation and technology.
</P>
<P>
"The government has done its part and will do more," he said,
urging the community as a whole to seize the opportunities and
business leaders to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
Their readiness to stay ahead of change and make the best use
of innovation and technology is vital to Hong Kong's future
success, Tung concluded.

GENEVA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will join
hands with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) anti-doping
agency in the anti-doping campaign, a EU commissioner said on
Tuesday in lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"The EU wants to participate for a very simple reason. The
sports world is an important part of the social component of

<P>
The anti-doping agency is to be set up on November 10 when the
founding board members are to be announced at its establishment.
</P>
<P>
Reding said the number of board members had not been decided,
but its composition would equally reflect the worlds of sport and
the public.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch has said he will not preside over the body, which
many governments have urged to be completely independent.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday began a closed-door session to consider a report
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest development in
Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Council meeting in this month under the
presidency of Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15-member Council, Annan has reported some
progress in the preparations for a referendum on the future of
Western Sahara, and called for continued cooperation of the
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
In his just released report to the Security Council, Annan said
that there has been progress in the identification of the
so-called "contested tribes."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief urged both parties to maintain their cooperation
so that the process can be completed, as planned, by the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which will give the people of the territory the
option of choosing between independence and integration with
Morocco, has been delayed several times because of differences
between the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front,
particularly on the question of voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the very large number of applicants -- more
than 79,000 -- who have submitted appeals corresponds very closely
with the number of people omitted from the first part of the
provisional list of potential voters issued on July 15.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances," Annan said in his report that
described the activities of his Special Representative and the
U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), "we
might be confronted with a lengthy appeals process, involving
almost all applicants rejected in the first instance, as well as a
large number of applicants whose inclusion in the provisional
voters list has been challenged."
</P>
<P>
This will have consequences on the level of staff, financial
and other resources required for the Mission, as well as the
timetable for holding the Referendum, Annan said. He plans to
provide the Security Council in early December with a realistic
assessment of the steps ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) continued to prepare for the repatriation of
Saharan refugees as provided for in the Settlement Plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said it is "regrettable" that UNHCR's draft plan
of action on confidence-building measures has not yet been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The importance of fostering a climate of trust and confidence
can not be overemphasized, he said, and urged the parties to
cooperate fully with MINURSO and UNHCR for the immediate
initiation of the measures they have agreed to in principle.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners to Pay More for Working in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners working in Thailand
are going to pay 10 times more to obtain a work permit in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government endorsed in principle the draft proposed by
the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to revise the fee on
foreigners' work permits at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, a
Government House press release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fee for one work permit for foreigners will be raised to
10,000 baht (259.7 U.S. dollars) from the current 1,000 baht
(25.97 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The yearly extension of the work permit will also be raised to
10,000 baht.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government grants foreigners a maximum of one year
stay at a time, which means that foreigners working in Thailand
have to renew their visa and work permit every year.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised draft, foreigners who apply for
permission for changing jobs or moving to the new location of work
will also be charged 5,000 baht (129.8 dollars) instead of the
current 500 baht (12.98 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it is necessary to revise the fee regulation
because it is "not compatible with the current economic
development."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Angola's Small Village to Be World-class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- With the rapid development of
geologic survey, Catoca, a small, quiet and sparsely populated
village in northeast Angola, has been announced as the potential
fourth largest diamond- producing mine in the world.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said after an initial geologic analysis that there
is an estimated diamond reserve of 72 million carats in the
62-million-cubic meter kimberlite rock in the village near
Saurimo, capital city of Lunda- sul Province.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, among the diamonds produced in Catoca,
averagely weighing 0.11 carats, 40 percent are of jewel-class, 15
percent semi-jewel- class and 45 percent are for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
The abundant diamond reserves in Catoca and the high-quality of
the precious stones attracted world-class diamond companies, which
had announced to establish a joint enterprise in the village for
diamond extracting and processing.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of illegal diamond searchers prospecting in Catoca
will be expelled by the government in near future.
</P>
<P>
Catoca will lodge three foreign companies introduced by the
Angolan National Diamond Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Almazi RossII Sakha Company has advanced technology in
the exploration of the kimberlite, the ore deposit for diamond.
British Daumonty Financing is a company famous for diamond
classification, polish and sales. Brazilian Odebrecht Company
invested much in the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
As a representative of the Angolan government, the Angolan
National Diamond Enterprise provides the foreign companies with
resources and the authority of exploration.
</P>
<P>
The companies, respectively from Russia, Britain, Brazil and
Angola, have invested 29.3 million U.S. dollars in the
establishment of the Mineral Society of Catoca.
</P>
<P>
The newly-organized management of the joint enterprise
considers that due to the large reserve of diamonds and the
capacity of production, Catoca will start up in the future as the
fourth largest diamond mine in the world, only after the
Tanzania's Mwadui, Russia's Arkangel and Botswana's Orapa.
</P>
<P>
But the development of the Catoca Mine is currently under the
shadow of the civil war and the rampant conflicts in the richly
mineralized districts, which have been targets of the attacks
launched by bandits and the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, illegal prospectors will not give up their searching
for wealth even after being driven out of the district.
</P>
<P>
They have more acquaintance with the mine than workers of the
foreign companies, which will also affect the production of the
Mineral Society of Catoca.
</P>
<P>
Due to the difficult road transportation of extracting
equipment and necessities of life, it is believed that the cost of
exploration, production and the living expense will be much higher
than imagined.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all the things will have to be transported by air.
</P>
<P>
Angola, an important diamond-producing country in Africa, had a
 production of two million carats in 1998, with Lunda-norte and
Lunda-sul as the main producing districts, which are adjacent to
the mineralized district in the east of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Renovated UNITA Appeals for Savimbi's Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Renovated Commission of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) Tuesday
appealed to the countries lodging relatives of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi to guarantee their security.
</P>
<P>
The renovated UNITA, an organization established by former
UNITA members who have announced to abandon Jonas Savimbi, made
the statement following a speech by Araujo Sakaita, one of the 28
offsprings of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Sakaita, who deserted his father and fled to Luanda from Togo
last week, advocated in his speech that the end of war can only be
achieved through the physical annihilation of Savimbi and his war
machine.
</P>
<P>
Considering that Sakaita's speech hinted that all sons and
relatives of Savimbi are in danger, the renovated commission
appealed to the countries accommodating them to realize the
situation and protect them from molestation.
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged the Angolan government to make
efforts to help them through diplomatic channels, and asked the
governments of those countries to take responsibility of their
security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Standing Committee of the Renovated Commission
of the UNITA vowed to use all legitimate means to persuade the
United Nations Security Council to set up a special tribunal to
try Savimbi for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee said that it will file with the tribunal
all evidences proving the crimes committed by Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Health Threats in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Epidemic diseases such as
cholera and malaria are becoming a major public health concern in
East Timor with the rainy season there due to begin in November,
the World Health Organization (WHO) warned here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, WHO called for tuberculosis (TB) treatment programs
to be restarted urgently, citing epidemiological studies on East
Timorese refugees in Australia as showing that 2.9 percent of them
are active carriers of TB. That would mean that 20,000 East
Timorese dispersed through Timor with active TB.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential that we re-establish TB treatment
programs if we want to avoid a dramatic increase in the number of
TB-carriers/infected people," said Dr Diego Buriot, WHO
Director-General's special envoy to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
WHO also warned that it is running short of money to sustain
and expand its public health presence in East Timor to meet the
above disease threats and to provide technical back-up for the
full range of health-sector programs being implemented there.
</P>
<P>
WHO has appealed for 11.4 million as a part of the United
Nations' Consolidated Appeal launched on October 27 in Geneva. The
bulk of the WHO appeal (7,785,000 U.S. dollars) is for health
sector coordination, surveillance, control of priority diseases
and addressing health personnel problems in both East and West
Timor.

<HEADLINE> Arabs See Russia as Partner for World Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab states see Russia as a
partner for the future of the world, with joint economic interests
that can be strengthened, Egypt's parliament speaker said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Fathi Sorour, speaker of the People's Assembly, said at
an Arab-Russian symposium that Russia and Arab countries play an
important role in the shaping of a multi-polar world to promote
dialog and bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The main interest and objective of the Arab world are to
achieve and safeguard peace and security in the Middle East
region, Sorour stressed.
</P>
<P>
But some Western countries take double standards by urging Arab
states to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction while
defending Israel's possession of nuclear weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is believed to have nuclear weapons. But it neither
confirms nor denies the allegation.
</P>
<P>
It has become a global system that the Northern industrialized
countries manipulate the international decisions and impose them
on the Southern developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arab states can challenge this if they establish a partnership
among themselves and with their traditional friends in all parts
of the world, including Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Partnership should not be limited to trade trade and cultural
and political ties, it should be extended to security ties and
provides the appropriate atmosphere for the realization of
economic partnership, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the traditional partner of the Arab world, y, Sorour added.
</P>
<P>
The topics addressed at the symposium include Arab-Russian
relations and bilateral and collective cooperation, Arab-Russian
cooperation in the shaping of a multi-polar system, and
international relations based on equality and the principles of
the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is attended by representatives from Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen and
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Raise Minimum Term of Duty for Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday it would
raise the minimum term of duty for a soldier in the
all-professional army from three to four years.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that (the minimum commitment) should be
raised to four years.... This will make a significant contribution
to the army's ability to fulfil its obligations and liabilities,"
defense minister John Spellar said in a written parliamentary
answer.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as Britain committed more and more military
roles abroad, especially after it sent large number of troops to
the Balkans by the end of the Kosovo war, its army has been
stretched to the limit.
</P>
<P>
Britain now stationed about tens of thousands of troops in the
Balkans, Germany and Cyprus. Its military commitment in Northern
Ireland, which keeps in high tension on its peace process, also
means a lot of soldiers on duty.
</P>
<P>
Spellar said that improved retention of soldiers was the key to
meeting the army's staffing targets.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from both the army and the soldier's families,
the British contribution to the NATO-led SFOR force in Kosovo
would be scaled down from some 4,200 soldiers to around 3,300 by
the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Describes Political Commitment as Core in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ugandan Health Minister
Beatrice Mukaye Wabudeya briefed here Tuesday her country's
experiences in fighting AIDS saying that political commitment is
at the core of this problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "President Yoweri Museveni publicly preached
about AIDS and his message was echoed at all levels of the
government resulting in the rate of infections being reduced by
about 50 percent over the past six years."
</P>
<P>
She said the political commitment triggered a multi-sectoral
approach to the problem. Non-governmental organizations,
churches and private sectors all joined hands in finding a
lasting solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said besides the political commitment, the blood
transfusion services in Uganda thoroughly screened the blood
samples to ensure that no infected blood would be administered to
patients.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government, she said, set up the AIDS Commission to
deal with advocacy programs and this resulted in raising
awareness of the pandemic to almost 100 percent in the country.
</P>
<P>
Public awareness campaigns included free family talk shows on
radio, posters, programs on voluntary counseling and news letters
circulated in schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said there was also a need to effectively train counselors
so that they would be in a position to give hope to the HIV/AIDS
victims, adding that in Uganda AIDS sufferers were sometimes
given loans by some NGOs to start income generating programs.
</P>
<P>
"More AIDS victims are coming out in the open because of these
advocacy programs and some of them are taking a leading role in
the awareness campaigns," she said.
</P>
<P>
To date the rates of HIV infection in Uganda in urban areas had
declined by 50 percent from the staggering levels recorded at the
same sites at the peak of the pandemic in the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
The decline was even more significant among teenage girls
between 15 and 19 years of age. In 1992, 17 percent of sexually
active teenage girls were found to be HIV positive but this rate
fell to six percent by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Coffee Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee prices soared
Tuesday following the reports of a possible drop in Brazil's
coffee yields because of lack of rain, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya said all 22,504 50-kg bags offered
were sold, at an average price of 101.76 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Provisional figures indicated PB grade was sold at a high of
119 dollars a bag compared with 106 dollars two weeks ago while AB
grade topped 126 dollars versus a high of 110 dollars. AA grade
sold at between 96 dollars and 136 dollars a bag from the previous
auction range of 96 dollars to128 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I think these prices are sustainable,'' another trader said,
pointing to Brazilian yields as the main factor.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's top grade coffee prices plummeted from over 300 dollars
a bag last year to under 100 dollars for much of this year and
analysts say it could take three years before the country's coffee
prices recovers.

According to a summons issued Monday, Morton and publishing

or send representation within three weeks.

<P>
"We have had difficulty in finding Morton so the order of court

<HEADLINE> Oslo Summit Ends, Called as "Very Good Meeting" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The three-way summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak ended about one hour after it began.
</P>
<P>
"We have revitalized the process," Clinton said after the talks.
"The two sides have not only named their teams, they have agreed
that the leaders will personally continue to meet on a regular
basis."
</P>
<P>
The summit was about one hour behind schedule and also one hour
shorted than previously expected. Clinton said he felt they had
completed a "very good meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have agreed to avoid causing trouble to
each other before they come to a framework agreement in
mid-February, and to have a summit at the end of the process.
</P>
<P>
Now the two sides are committed to a framework agreement by
February and a final accord by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that he was "confident that a
Camp David-style summit is possible in January if enough progress
has been made in final status talks."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Egyptian leaders met in Camp David in 1978 and
reached a peace accord, the first between the Jewish state and an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to establish a new mechanism to
facilitate their talks and prevent waste of time in the final status
talks, to be kicked off on November 8, said the official, who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams would work four days a week and report
directly to their leaders, and a hotline is expected to be set up
between Arafat and Barak, he said.
</P>
<P>
The much expected meeting came after Clinton met Arafat and Barak
separately, and Arafat and Barak made an unscheduled one-to-one
meeting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials present at the meeting said the mood was
optimistic, and Barak was willing to touch upon any sensitive
issues.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides did not get into essence for fear this could
sour the atmosphere, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the three leaders had been expected to focus on
ways to approach the toughest final status issues and inject new
vitality into the peace process. But neither side anticipated a
major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters at the start of the summit: "I think even
though the issues are difficult, the will is strong and we are off
to a pretty good start."
</P>
<P>
He offered to do anything he could to help the two sides to
achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such summit since Barak ousted his hardline
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Israel's general elections in
May. The three leaders are here for a commemoration ceremony earlier
Tuesday for late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
killed by an extremist Jew opposed to his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has urged for quick implementation of signed
agreements and start of talks on final status issues. They cited
Israel's continuous settlement policy as a threat to the entire
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a Rabin protege, has vowed to continue the journey started
by Rabin toward a lasting peace with Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton left for home after winding up his two-day visit here,
and Arafat was flown to Budapest, Hungry, according to informed
Palestinian sources.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for U.N. Military Observers in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday called for the establishment of a United
Nations Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
the deployment of up to 500 military observers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the call in a report presented to the U.N.
Security Council. He expects the establishment prior to the
council's authorization, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to discuss the report Thursday
and the current mandate of the U.N. liaison officers already in
Congo (K) and neighboring countries is to expire Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The enormous obstacles facing any United Nations operations in
Congo (K) have always been very apparent, he said in the report.
He added, "The experience gained so far in deploying a small
number of military liaison officers in and around the country has
only served to deepen our appreciation of the difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Efforts to support the peace process must continue, he said,
adding that the suffering in Congo (K) has persisted for far too
long for the world to miss the chance offered by the Lusaka
Ceasefire Agreement, signed by six countries involved in the
conflict in July and by some armed groups in August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan recommended to the council the extension of
the mandate of the U.N. personnel currently in Congo (K) until
January 15, 2000. By then, he said, on the basis of the
conclusions of the technical survey team, it should be possible to
provide the council with further details of the possible
establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping operation in that country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Experience Continued Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of Kenya will
continue experiencing reduced rainfall in November, prolonging
the current drought for an indefinite period, the country's
Meteorological Department predicted.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological Department Director Evans Nyakwanda said that
the country would have less than 50 percent of the expected
rainfall in November, according to sources here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Western highlands, Lake Victoria region and parts of
central Rift Valley would have a high possibility of receiving
high rainfall, the official said, adding that North Eastern
Province, Coast region and parts of the central districts might
experience low rainfall.
</P>
<P>
While attributing reduced rainfall to the state of the sea
surface temperature, Nyakwanda said his department would continue
working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to inform
farmers on the best times to start planting.
</P>
<P>
Nyakwanda said that his department has advised farmers in the
eastern part of the country to plant drought- resistant and short
maturing crops and farmers in the west to plant more food to
assist other regions as they will be less affected by famine.
</P>
<P>
Drought has hit most parts of this East African country since
the beginning of this year. So far more than 20 districts are
facing the threat of famine and the government has taken measures
for relief food to those famine-stricken victims.
</P>
<P>
Due to the continued drought, the water level of the energy
reservoirs has been lowered and the Kenyan government practised a
power rationing since September.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that power rationing is to continue as there
will be less water available for hydroelectric power generation.
</P>
<P>
The persistent water deficit and high temperatures have also
affected availability of water for domestic and industrial
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The government was advised to find ways of storing water during
the rainy seasons and also introduce alternative power supplies
like wind or solar, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Growth Predicted for Latin America in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The specialist magazine,
"Latinwatch" believed that the year 2000 will be a good year for
Latin America, that it will get over the recession and recuperate
growth.
</P>
<P>
The favorable factors for the Latin American recovery include
the acceleration of the world-wide economy in the year 2000, in
spite of a modernization in the United States, said the monthly
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Latin America next year will once again get back on the path to
recovery, and the forecast for the year 2000 is a growth rate of
3.1 percent, added the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The region will recover from the "shocks" of the recent past,
and begin its recovery, due to the improvement of the prices of
raw materials on the world market, says the specialist magazine.
</P>
<P>
A depreciation of the dollar against the euro will favor the
situation in Argentina, whose money is indexed to the U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
The negative factors which will affect the region in the coming
year are the eventual rise in interest rates in both the U.S. and
Europe, which will reduce income from investments.
</P>
<P>
Latinwatch stated that in the year 2000, Brazil will have a
growth rate of 3 percent, Chile will register the highest growth
in the region, Peru, Bolivia and Mexico above the average, and
Colombia and Venezuela will be close to the average.
</P>
<P>
The publication said that the inflation in the region will
reduce to an average of less than 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Minister Urges Taliban to Hand Over Bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Defense Minister
Prince Sultan said Tuesday that it is in the interest of
Afghanistan's Taliban movement to expel Saudi-born millionaire
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot speak for another country. However -- my personal
view -- his continuing there is not in the interest of
Afghanistan," Sultan told reporter after his talks with U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban hands him over to face justice -- whether in
the United States or anywhere else -- we believe justice should
take its way," Sultan added in response to question. He stressed
that bin Laden had been stripped of his Saudi citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"Bin Laden is not a Saudi citizen. He was stripped of his
citizenship because he is considered a traitor to his country and
to his faith, which is Islam," Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was reported last week to have sought safe passage
from Afghanistan to an unknown country to escape a tightening
international noose.
</P>
<P>
He was believed to have masterminded bomb attacks at two U.S.
embassies in Africa last year, which killed more than 200 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said his talks with Cohen centered on cooperation in
countering development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
in the Middle East and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the investigation of bombing of Khobar Towers
military complex in 1996. Sultan declined to share any information
with the reporters, only saying that the investigation had so far
turned up no connection to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been confirmed yet in this (Iran) area," he said.
"As of now, the investigation is continuing and we don't have any
evidence we can share with you."

street riots in Kuwait involving Egyptian workers there.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Kuwait, Minister of Manpower and Immigration
Ahmed el-Amawi said the Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations are solid and

Khalid Al-Hamad Al-Sabah has said the Kuwaiti-Egyptian relations
will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Amawi said he will meet with Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Sabah and senior officials on the
conditions of Egyptian laborers in Kuwait after the incident.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taliban Want Good Ties With US: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Wednesday said they want to improve ties with the United States
but accused Washington of not giving a positive response to its
offer to solve the thorny issue of Osama bin Laden, news reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to improve relations with the United States on
bilateral cooperation but we want the United States to help
achieve this goal," the Taliban's Foreign Minister Maulvi Wakil
Ahmed Mutawakil told a news conference in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of bin Laden's handover to the
United States and said Washington should have positively responded
to Taliban proposals to settle the dispute over the alleged
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar Tuesday threatened to close
talks over bin Laden if the United States stuck to its demand for
the Saudi national's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, who has been accused by Washington of masterminding
terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa last year,
wrote a letter to Omar last Friday offering to leave Afghanistan
provided the militia facilitate his movement and keep his next
destination secret.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to bin Laden's letter, a U.S. State Department
spokesman said that simply banishing the Saudi national from
Afghanistan was not the same as bringing him to justice.
"Washington wants to put him on trial," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil said the Taliban seek a solution to the bin Laden
issue, but the United States wants to keep it unresolved to make
it a basis for its "anti-Islamic" and bias intentions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. response to bin Laden's desire to leave Afghanistan
shows that it does not want a peaceful solution to the problem, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States earlier asked the Taliban to expel
bin Laden and now when he has offered to leave Afghanistan,
Washington has changed its stand.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban foreign minister said the Taliban floated two
proposals to the United States to find a peaceful solution to the
long-standing controversy but Washington responded in negative.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban "offered talks on the issue and also proposed to
let religious scholars take a decision in accordance with Islam,"
but both of them were turned down by the United States, he said.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Denounces Lee Teng-hui's "Two Chinas" Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency
Xinhua published a commentary today condemning Lee Teng-hui's "two
Chinas" remarks in an essay in the November/October issue of the
US-based Foreign Affairs bimonthly.
</P>
<P>
While the island province is still plagued by the aftermath of
a devastating earthquake, Lee Teng-hui has begun to make his
political views clear again by publishing a long article.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui is determined to continue this political line,
regardless of the interests of Taiwan compatriots, the Xinhua
commentary says. In his article, Lee says that the international
community has gradually become accustomed to the Chinese
government's remarks on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems" policy of the Chinese government has been applauded
around the world, the Xinhua commentary says, noting that Lee's
article does everything in its power to damage cross-straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
It is Lee who has distanced himself from the international
community by stubbornly challenging the one China principle. In
fact, the international community opposes Lee's "two nations"
statement. Lee's splittist attempt threatens the existence and
development of Taiwan and the interests of Taiwan compatriots, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentary quotes the Taiwan media as disclosing
that Lee's article was written by a group of his senior aides and
rewritten by Lee himself. Lee's requests for publishing the
article, however, were turned down many times.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also says that Lee has been criticized in Taiwan
for his inability to deal with earthquake relief work, adding that
Lee has spared no efforts to preventing the mainland from aiding
earthquake victims in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> HK Disneyland to Boost Local GDP by 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Disneyland
project should increase Hong Kong's GDP by 0.4 percent a year, a
senior government economist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, for this project alone, it is tantamount to
expanding the tourism sector by one-tenth or 10 percent, which
contributes about 4 percent to Hong Kong's GDP," K Y Tang said at
a press conference in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who is in London, also took
part in the press conference through a special video-link, spoke
of the widespread benefits to Hong Kong's economy as a whole of
the Hong Kong Disneyland project.
</P>
<P>
Describing the project as an infrastructure investment, he said
it would generate returns not only for the government "but for
ordinary people who are operating restaurants in Hong Kong. Our
hotels will benefit. Our tourist industry will benefit. Our
airlines will benefit. And all the retail shops will benefit as a
result of more tourists coming to Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that viewed in the light of the benefits to the
entire economy, Hong Kong had "a good deal." This was based on the
net economic benefit in present day values over 40 years of 148
billion HK dollars (about 20 billion U.S. dollars) and an economic
rate of return in real terms of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Even on a return basis it is a much better investment from our
point of view than some other infrastructure programs," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of more tourists from China's mainland, the
financial secretary said there would definitely be an increase in
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsang said, there was still about six years to study
the matter and talks would be held with the relevant authorities
on arrangements to make it more convenient for mainland tourists
to visit Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I think this can be done," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the financing arrangements, Commissioner for Tourism Mike
Rowse said the government and Disney had learned lessons from the
experiences of Paris Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
One lesson was that Paris was over-leveraged with the debt
equity ratio highly weighted in favor of debt and only a
relatively small amount of equity, Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have gone for a much more prudent ratio of 60:
40, which we think is appropriate for this kind of project. The
project finances are also very robust and can cope with a very
considerable degree of downside and still pay off the commercial
loan and the government loan on time within the 25 years," Rowse
said.

<HEADLINE> Floods in Central Vietnam Kill Nearly 100 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Heavy floods that have hit
Vietnam's central provinces over the past three days, killing
nearly 100 people and injured 12 others, submerging 100,000 houses
and halting almost all traffic lines, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By an initial breakdown of central provinces, the death toll is
the highest in Thua Thien-Hue (48), followed by Quang Tri and
Quang Ngai (13), Quang Nam (12) and Binh Dinh (7), VNA quoted
Vietnam's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Huy Ngo
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 12 people are reported missing in Quang
Ngai province.
</P>
<P>
Ngo, who is also head of the National Committee for Flood and
Storm Control, was assigned to lead one of the two central-level
delegations to the flood-hit area, but they have failed to access
the worst-hit Thua Thien-Hue as the floods cut off transport to
the province.
</P>
<P>
However, material losses remain unknown at present.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha
Phieu has sent a message of sympathy to the flood-stricken
provinces, asking local residents to unite and cope with
difficulties and local authorities to directly monitor and
supervise anti-flood work.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's State President Tran Duc Luong has also sent his
condolences to families of those killed in the floods and hoped
that local party committees and authorities would exert efforts to
minimize the damage caused by flooding.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Use More Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Daily natural gas consumption of
Beijing this winter will double from 3.21 million cubic meters to
6.8 cubic meters due to anti-air pollution efforts, according to
the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
Beijing's air is ranked third among the world's worst air
pollution. In 1998, air pollution in Beijing was mainly caused by
coal and exhaust fumes.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has encouraged people to use gas instead of coal since
last year and plans to have more households use gas instead of
coal for heating in winter.
</P>
<P>
China's largest gas-powered thermal energy plant was completed
in Beijing this year which will consume 70 million cu m of gas
annually. 2,800 gas-powered buses will be put into operation by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has to raise the transmission capacity of its gas
pipelines by compressing gas as gas demands increase in Beijing,
said Yao Wei, deputy general manager of Beijing Gas Transmission
Company.
</P>
<P>
The increase of daily gas supply for Beijing this winter is the
result of a gas compression station in Shaanxi that will be
operational from November 15 and a gas pipeline that will link
Beijing with Dagang, a gas production base near Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will provide residents with heat from November 15. Most
gas supplies have come from Shanxi since 1997.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM Gives Optimistic Assessment of New Indonesian Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has given an optimistic assessment of the prospects of
the new Indonesian government, according to a transcript of his
interview available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goh's interview with a group of visiting Philippine journalists
on October 28, 1999, covered a wide range of subjects.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on his assessment of the new Indonesian
government, Goh said: "They have stared out very well. The new
government has legitimacy and the moral authority to govern
Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new Indonesian cabinet, Goh commented that
"This is a government that has been in a sense elected by the
people."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the signs of success for the government are
there and they have some very able people in Cabinet," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he foresees in the future of Indonesia after calls
for independence arose from some part of Indonesia following East
Timor's separation, Goh said: "I don't see the danger of the whole
place breaking up over the next few years."
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem which the new government has to handle very
skillfully and I think the new government is going to allow more
autonomy to the regions, in particular the regions which have rich
resources so that the provinces can have a bigger share of the
revenue coming from the resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And if they can have this autonomy for the provinces, the
provinces may be satisfied that they can do what they want for
themselves and they remain very much part of Indonesia," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The European Investment Bank has agreed to offer Egypt
a loan of 15 million euro (16 million U.S. dollars) to build part
of a highway, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed on Tuesday, the loan will be used for
the construction of the road linking Alexandria and Rosetta to the
east.
</P>
<P>
Th(81.18 million dollars), said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Nortel Networks Inc. based in the United States will
carry out a communications project in Egypt, funded by the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Al-Akhbar daily
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed between Telecom Egypt and Nortel on
Tuesday, the U.S. company will install 310,000 digital telephone
lines in Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said and some new communities.
</P>
<P>
The USAID will channel 36.8 million U.S. dollars to the
project, which will contribute to expanding telecommunication
services to about 1.8 million Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's tax revenues in October totalled only
2.38 billion U.S. dollars, 10 percent less than that of
September, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months this year, it said, tax revenues
totalled 24.857 billion dollars, up by 2.1 percent in real terms
compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government set a real increase of 2.9 percent for the
whole 1999 in tax revenue collections.
</P>
<P>
The total shortfall in tax collections compared with the
government's target is therefore 100 million dollars for the first
10 months in the year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Central Bank Urged to Coordinate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
has been urged to implement a coordinated set of fiscal and
monetary policies in a bid to salvage the country's debilitated
macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Previous policies of the central bank failed to bring
macro-economic stability because other crucial factors were not
resolved, Financial Holdings Limited, a leading financial
institution in the country, said in its report on Zimbabwe's
economic outlook released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Getting one set of policies generally right while leaving
others out of line naturally results in inferior outcomes," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank recently raised interest rates in an effort to arrest
spiraling inflation, but the result was an increase in money
supply, it said.
</P>
<P>
The financial institution attributed the impotence of the tight
monetary policy to the fiscal expansion and the high budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
It said that the budget deficit target of six percent is
unlikely to be met, predicting that the figure would be peaked at
10 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Punitive interest rates of over 50 percent, high inflation of
about 70 percent, huge budget deficit and large domestic borrowing
characterize Zimbabwe's economy, the institution said.
</P>
<P>
It said that agriculture, the largest economic pillar of the
country, might be hampered by some shortages of fertilizers and
high input costs.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, the second largest economic pillar,
was performing below capacity with output falling by 11.1 percent
this year compared to a mere 0.8 percent last year, it added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Defends Govt's Rice Importation Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the government cannot just immediately
impose a total ban on the importation of rice, as this could
seriously threaten the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
"Importation is a big drain in our dollar reserves. But if we
do not import rice at this time, our people will have to fall in
line just to buy the staple," Estrada said in a radio speech.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada promised that as soon as the country has
reached an era of self-sufficiency in food production, the
government will immediately impose a ban on rice importation.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said that a group of farmers are planning to
submit to the government a 13-point proposal for alleviating the
living condition of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Among these proposals is their call for a total ban on
importation and an increase in funds for agriculture to help boost
food production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated his previous statements that among his
administration's top priority is the country's food security,
which he said could only be attained by modernizing the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has already issued instructions to Agriculture
Secretary Edgardo Angara to prioritize projects involving the
setting up of more irrigation facilities.

<HEADLINE> HK Protects Human Rights "Unequivocally" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has protected the
rule of law, judicial independence and human rights unequivocally,
a government spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to media inquiries
about the comments made by the United Nations Human Rights
Committee regarding the interpretation of the Basic Law to resolve
the right of abode issue.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the Basic Law, the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is implemented in Hong Kong
through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since enactment of the Bill of Rights Ordinance in the
early 1990's, the laws of Hong Kong have been amended and improved
to comply with the ICCPR," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed: "The right of final adjudication of
court cases by the Court of Final Appeal is distinct from the
right of final interpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)."
</P>
<P>
Both constitutional rights are protected by the Basic Law and
have been well respected throughout the process. The
interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is entirely legal and
constitutional, he said.
</P>
<P>
Interpretation of the Basic Law to resolve the Right of Abode
issue received majority support in the Legislative Council, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, it also received wide public
support. The HKSAR government respects the right of final
adjudication of the Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
"We are, therefore, assessing the applications of about 3,700
people who have claimed the right of abode according to the Court
of Final Appeal's decision of January 29, 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, absolutely clear that the rule of law,
judicial independence and human rights in Hong Kong are protected
by the Basic Law," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Hong Kong
were urged to help disseminate messages on AIDS prevention and to
accept HIV-infected/AIDS patients on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This year's World AIDS Campaign theme - Listen, Learn, Live!
World AIDS Campaign with Children and Young People - calls for all
people, especially the young, to fight against AIDS," Homer Tso,
chairman of the Hong Kong Advisory Council on AIDS, told a kick-
off ceremony for the 1999 World AIDS Campaign.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in Hong Kong, up till June this year,
there were altogether 1,255 HIV infections reported. About four
percent of the reported cases were patients aged under 19, while
32 percent of the cases were patients aged under 30.
</P>
<P>
More than half of those infected by HIV worldwide are aged
under 25, and six people aged under 25 are getting infected every
minute, Tso said.
</P>
<P>
Popular artists Cecilia Yip, Carina Lau and Eddie Kwan also
appealed to the public to accept AIDS patients, put their names on
a Red Ribbon and affixed it to a giant globe to show their support
for the World AIDS Campaign.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese drama series that puts across positive AIDS messages
will be broadcast every Saturday and Sunday in November at 6.30 p.

<HEADLINE> HK Disneyland Expected to Bring about Intangible Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to
receive significant intangible benefits from the establishment of
Hong Kong Disneyland in addition to economic benefits, according
to a report released by Tourism Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report outlined six "non-quantifiable" benefits that will
flow from the theme park and its associated facilities - quality
standards, technological innovation, quality of life, image,
training, and environmental sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
Given Walt Disney's reputation for creativity, operational
excellence and delivering high levels of guest satisfaction, the
operation of Hong Kong Disneyland will set a new standard for the
service sector in Hong Kong, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It would also showcase the best of cutting-edge technology in
its attractions and shows," it added.
</P>
<P>
On quality of life, the report said it will provide quality
family entertainment, and quality entertainment and recreational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the theme park, the project includes the
construction of three to four Disney-themed resort hotels with up
to 2,100 rooms on completion of Phase I.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Disneyland will no doubt enhance the international
image of Hong Kong as a vibrant, cosmopolitan city, and
specifically enhance the status of Hong Kong as a key tourist
destination in Asia and the world," the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
The theme park's marketing and sales efforts, in combination
with those of Hong Kong in general would help make international
tourists aware of the multiple reasons for travel to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In training, the Tourism Commission believed that Walt Disney's
commitment to employee training and development, especially in the
area of guest service, will provide an added resource and
leadership presence to Hong Kong's expanding service sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said the commitment of Disney to environmental
sensitivity in its theme parks around the world will help set a
new standard for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The company will bring its experience in environmental
awareness and education to this project, including environmentally
friendly operating practices such as recycling, energy
conservation, and waste and water management," the report
concluded.

</P>
<P>
He said close cooperation among IDB members would ensure that
the member countries were not marginalized by the current trend
towards globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent Asian economic crisis had demonstrated the
need to build up IDB members' resilience and the need to foster
close cooperation among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"IDB member countries in Asia, in particular, and all member
countries in general, have to be prepared to meet the challenges
posed by globalization and the failure of the current economic and
financial system in ensuring stability," Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the IDB for setting a target to increase intra trade of
member countries by one percent a year for the next three years,
he said IDB's efforts to assist the growth of intra trade by 4
billion U.S. dollars this year and multiples of that in the
subsequent years deserved a whole hearted commitment from
IDB-members.

<HEADLINE> China Reports 130 Million Hectares of Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China today announced an
accurate figure for its farmland, which is 130 million hectares,
35 million hectares more than previously reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey issued by the Ministry of Land and
Resources and the National Bureau of Statistics there are 10
million hectares of parks, 227 million hectares of forests and 266
million hectares of grasslands in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said that the actual amount of farmland
didn't increase, because the survey standardized various
measurements according to internationally accepted criteria.
</P>
<P>
60.2 percent of farmland has no irrigation facilities, while in
the central and western areas, the percentage is higher. Farmland
in east China only accounts for 28.4 percent. The per capita
farmland is a little more than 0.1 hectare, less than the world
average.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted from 1984 to 1996, involving more than
500,000 professionals.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Egypt Agree on Maintaining Solid Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Egypt agreed on
Wednesday to maintain their solid bilateral relations and keep
them unaffected by any isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sulaiman Majid
Al-Shaheen and visiting Egyptian Minister of Manpower and
Immigration Ahmed Al-Amawi voiced the desire in their meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen, quoted by official Kuwait News Agency, asserted
that "individual incidents that happen from time to time do not
affect the firm Kuwaiti-Egyptian relationship that dates back to
many decades ago."
</P>
<P>
He said that officials of both countries agreed that last
week's street riots in Kuwait, which was ignited by an arrest of
an Egyptian who refused to pay for a plate he smashed in a local
grocery shop, should not be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
The massive riots, which involved thousands of Egyptian and
Asian expatriate workers living in Kheitan, a poor district about
10 kilometers south of Kuwait City, were put down only after the
deployment of heavily-armed army units.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti and Egyptian leaders are keen to deal with the
issue in a normal way and on a sound basis," Al-Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, other senior Kuwaiti officials, including Foreign
Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and Interior Minister Sheikh
Mohammed Khalid Al-Sabah, also underlined that the isolated issue
will not affect the strong ties between Kuwait and Egypt, although
they vowed the government will not tolerate anyone who acts
against law and order.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
announced Wednesday that the military has captured the top leader
of the rebel New People's Army (NPA) in the southern Philippines
following three days of intensified clashes, Philippine News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado was quoted as saying that
Leonardo Pitao, the commanding officer of the NPA, was cornered
Tuesday night in Mindanao by elements of the Intelligence Service
of the Philippine Armed Forces and military troops.
</P>
<P>
Also taken from Pitao was one handheld radio, a cellphone, 24
pieces of batteries, some party documents, a Swiss knife and
personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said an exhaustive intelligence operation was launched
by the military following the kidnapping of police officer Victor
Obillo and his aide Eduardo Montealto in Mindanao on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Obillo, commanding general of the 55th Engineering Brigade of
the Philippine Army, and Montealto were held captive for 58 days
before they were released after a lengthy negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Another army official Jose Calimlim said that the capture came
when the NPA launched a series of attacks in Quezon and Mindoro
Oriental since last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels burned nine dump trucks and three mixers of a
construction company in Quezon, Manila, at Sunday dawn. The
following day, they raided a police station in Oriental Mindoro,
disarming four policemen.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Vows to Liberate Whole Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia is determined to liberate
the entire breakaway republic of Chechnya and to restore normal
life of the Chechen civilians, said Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The liberation of Chechnya is the goal set for the federal
armed forces. President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted
backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya," Sergeyev
said in Fergana, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Sergeyev arrived in
Uzbekistan Wednesday to analyze the performance of the Southern
Commonwealth Shield-99 exercise, aimed at fighting large terrorist
units with Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek forces
involved.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the Russian Eastern Army has surrounded
Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, and there are very few
militants remaining.
</P>
<P>
He believes that local volunteers will make the greatest
contribution to the liberation of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
Naurskaya, Shelkovskaya and Nadterechnaya districts are
completely controlled by the federal troops, who have also taken
control of seven of the 22 villages in the Gudermes district and
nine of the 31 villages in the Grozny district, while the
separatists are short of weaponry, munitions and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the federal troops will soon surround the
populated areas where the rebels congregate.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha
districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the
federal troops, said a source from the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The source said foreign extremists and weaponry are arriving
from abroad to aid the Chechen militants, with more than 300
terrorists coming from the Middle East in October, and by orders
of field commander Shamil Basayev and Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov. They have moved to the villages in the Itum-Kale,
Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts.

led 24-23. But the Asian champion failed to gained the two set
points and saw the Caribbean team scored three points to led 1-0.

round along with Russia, Brazil and Japan on two wins, while China,
South Korea, Croatia and Italy had a 1-1 win-loss record each in
the 12-team competition.

said Cuban coach Antonio Perdomo.
</P>

Brazil crashed Peru 25-17, 25-15, 25-16, while Croatia took an
easy win over Tunisia 25-7, 25-15, 25-10.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Virginia Republicans won a historic victory in Tuesday's
state legislative elections, capturing complete control of the
General Assembly after more than a century of Democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton declared on Tuesday night that
the Oslo mini-summit has "revitalized" the Middle East peace
process, with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat now in "high gear" to forge ahead on a basic
framework for creating a permanent peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate Tuesday voted, 49 to 48, for the last
spending bill of the year, on labor, health and education. The
bill contains a nearly 1 percent cut for all federal agencies that
President Clinton quickly rejected as "blind" and "mindless" and
pledged to veto.
</P>
<P>
-- Access to Russian nuclear sites by American inspectors,
always a delicate issue, has become increasingly troublesome of

support in the United States Congress for the administration's
program to create civilian jobs within Russia's closed nuclear
weapons complexes.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- American Home and Warner-Lambert are in talks to merge in a
deal valued at about 65 billion dollars and would unite two of the

<HEADLINE> E.Timor Is Not ASEAN Problem: S'pore PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has made it clear that East Timor is not an ASEAN
problem but remains an international one, according to a
transcript of his interview available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goh's interview with a group of Philippine journalists took
place on October 28, 1999, about a month before he will fly to
Manila, capital of the Philippines, to attend the ASEAN Informal
Summit scheduled for late November.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question as to who should take the lead in heading
the new U.N. peacekeeping force to East Timor, Goh said: "It is
not actually for ASEAN to decide because I do not regard East
Timor to be an ASEAN problem."
</P>
<P>
"It was not a problem created by ASEAN," Goh added.
</P>
<P>
Goh stressed "It was and is an international problem. It
remains an issue with the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Adding more grounds of arguments to his point of view, Goh said
"Portugal supported by the European countries and of course very
much involving the United States had East Timor on the agenda of
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"NGOs in Australia also supported autonomy for East Timor and
of course Indonesia decided on having this popular referendum for
the East Timorese and it was President Habibie who offered the
choice of either autonomy or independence to East Timor," he said.
"It never started off as an ASEAN problem."
</P>
<P>
Goh said ASEAN has to help East Timor, Australia and Indonesia
restore normalcy to East Timor as Indonesia is a member of ASEAN
and East Timor was part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On the question of who should lead the U.N. peacekeeping force,
Goh said "I think it is a matter for the United Nations to
decide."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think ASEAN should be placed in a position as to who
should be the leader in ASEAN," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever can be the leader and willing to be the leader and
acceptable to the East Timorese will be the leader," he said,
drawing attention to the composition of the peacekeeping force
which comprises other troops from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore will respect whoever is confident to lead.
</P>
<P>
"But the leader must be acceptable to the United Nations and to
the East Timorese and Indonesia," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on reports that East Timor is not interested
in joining ASEAN, Goh said: "I regard that as significant because
it reflects the interests of East Timorese. They prefer to be
identified with the South Pacific countries."
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the geography and ethnic composition of East
Timorese, I think it is quite a sensible choice for them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister affirmed that "I don't think it reflects any
erosion of confidence in ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
"They felt they are not part of ASEAN, they don't want to be
and that has nothing to do with confidence in ASEAN," he added.

undermanned police stations in the past four days, prompting
government forces to be on alert.

<HEADLINE> Space Detector Launched to Find Anti-Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A space detector "Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer" (AMS) will be sent into the space again in
2003 to look for anti-matter and missing matter, said Samuel C.C.
Ting, an American Nobel Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
Similar explorations were conducted when the 3.5-ton detector
was carried into space by the shuttle "Discovery" at the Kennedy
Space Center on June 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The AMS collected data from space during the ten day trip. No
anti-matter had been found, said Ting, who headed the space
detector team, made up of scientists from the United States, China
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The key component of the detector is a permanent magnet
produced by two institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"We will use a superconductor magnet which has a magnetic force
ten times stronger than the permanent magnet," Ting said. The
superconductor magnet is expected to be completed by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have to date not been able to discover anti-matter
and missing matter in space. "The AMS will help us explore a
completely new field of science," said Ting, adding that the
detector may discover other things in space as well.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Redress Anomalies in Trade Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
redress the anomalies in the WTO agreements and formulate policies
which would stimulate growth and poverty alleviation in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade policies and balances have been in favor of developed
 countries, Obasanjo said in Abuja Tuesday when opening a national
seminar on "the implications of WTO agreements on the Nigerian
economy".
</P>
<P>
The president told the three-day seminar that there are
significant imbalances between rights and obligations in the
existing multilateral trade agreements for the developing
countries, and the lack of full liberalization in economic sectors
of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In spite of liberalization, exports from developing countries
continue to face both tariff and non-tariff barriers, Obasanjo
said, adding that special provisions have turned to endeavor
clauses due to lack of adherence by developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Inequalities brought about by globalization have made poverty
pervasive as more countries experience increased disadvantages
within the global economy," media reports Wednesday quoted
Obasanjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the adoption of structural reforms and
macro-economic measures had not yielded commensurate growth and
development for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president threatened to withdraw the nation's
membership of the WTO if the developed countries fail to urgently
address the issue of widening gap between them and the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which signed the WTO agreements in 1995, is pushing
for the country's re-negotiations of terms ahead of the WTO
meeting in Seattle, the United States, later this month.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the WTO in 1995, the developing
countries including Nigeria continued to face a number of old
problems including " endemic poverty and malnutrition, an
over-bearing external debt burden, inadequate resources, low
commodity prices, unfavorable terms of trade, trade barriers and
new forms of protectionism".
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt, all these problems represent significant
handicaps that not only affect the development process, but also
contribute to widening the gap between developed and developing
countries," he said.

JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki has invited his Israeli counterpart Ezer Weizman to visit
his country for further discussions on bilateral relations and the
Middle East peace process, Weizman's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa was encouraged by the progress in the Middle

visit South Africa," Mbeki said in his invitation, which was
conveyed to Weizman by South African Embassy in Israel.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was critical to Israel's policies concerning the
Middle East peace process in the past and former South African

<HEADLINE> Crackdown Against Plunderers From Nov 17: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf on Wednesday declared that the loan
defaulters and the plunderers of the national wealth should take
the deadline of November 16 seriously as crackdowns on them will
begin from then.
</P>
<P>
"They should not think that we are in any way lacking in
resolve," Musharraf said in an interview with the Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
He said the clock was ticking on them and that must be clear to
everyone. "They will see immediate action on November 17."
</P>
<P>
"We will crackdown on the first group of people and the things
will start from November 17 and then the courts will be there to
start trying them. May be, we'll put them behind the bars, they
should be prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the total lists of defaulters and plunderers.
There are many kinds of plunderers, and I will call them
plunderers of the national wealth. Everyone is not a loan
defaulter. There are people who have manipulated rules and
regulations and made money. They have even taken bribes and that
is not loan defaulting," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to APP, Musharraf talked about a wide range of
subjects including the time frame for a return to democracy,
freedom of the press, the role of the newly formed National
Security Council and the National Accountability Bureau, the
checks and balances in the Constitution, electoral reforms and
local bodies elections.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Musharraf said he was surprised by the
comparatively mild reaction to the military takeover on October
12.
</P>
<P>
The response from the international community was milder than
what he had expected, said the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
About the domestic response, Musharraf said he expected it to
be positive, because of the bad domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty sure that the conditions were so bad that the
people are going to accept this change," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said the change on October 12 was "absolutely a
reactive event." It was not a coup but a counter coup, he added.
</P>
<P>
The coup was by the previous government of prime minister Nawaz
Sharif, said Musharraf.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researchers Find New Cancer Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Newfoundland researchers
have discovered a new cancer gene called "early response one" (ER1)
, Canada's National Post newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laura Gillespie and Dr. Gary Paterno of Memorial University
have found that if they shut the gene off, cancer cells will not
grow, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In normal cells this gene isn't on, "but in all the breast
cancer, cell lines and tumors that we looked at, this gene was
activated," the researchers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"That tells us there must be some connection. This gene may be
required for cancer cells," they added.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe ER1, which they discovered in frog
embryos, is the master control in the development of tissues.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are collaborating with Methylgene, a drug
company in Montreal, in the hope that they can develop a drug
within the next five years to suppress ER1.

<HEADLINE> 94.8 Million Chinese Workers Register With Unemployment Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
that by the end of September, some 94.8 million Chinese workers
have registered with an unemployment insurance system, which will
play an important role in safeguarding the basic living needs of
the laid-offs and helping the unemployed find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yazhi, vice-minister of Labor and Social Security, made
these comments today at the China-U.S. Social Insurance Symposium,
sponsored by the Labor and Social Security Ministry and the
LeBoeuf Lamb Greene &AMP; MacRaeL, an American international legal
office.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since the establishment of the unemployment
insurance system in the mid-1980s, some 15.8 million Chinese
workers had benefited from the unemployment subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment insurance system is a kind of social insurance
which aims to provide a monetary assistance or re-employment
service for a period of time for workers who have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the central government issued a circular raising
the contribution to the unemployment fund from one percent of the
enterprise total payroll to three percent. According to the
circular, enterprises are no longer solely responsible for paying
the fees, but individuals must now contribute one percent.
</P>
<P>
This January, the State Council issued its Regulations on
Unemployment Insurance initiating several major reforms in the
unemployment insurance fund system, including fund collection,
which will further improve the system.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the unemployment insurance system is not
only playing a role in promoting the reform of the State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) by ensuring the basic living standard of China'
s laid-off workers, but also making contributions to pensions,
medical insurance as well as enterprise industrial insurance.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel deported Wednesday
another two American Christian women suspected of plotting
violent actions in Jerusalem, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The two, named as Sharon Peterson and Sister Karen, were among
20 members of apocalyptic Christian groups. Sixteen of this group
had already been deported last week.
</P>
<P>
The pair were put on an Israel's El Al flight to New York
Wednesday morning, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
</P>
<P>
The 20 were members of two Christian organizations, the
"Temple" group and the "House of Prayer" group, which believe the
turn of the millennium could witness the end of the world and the
second coming of Messiah.
</P>
<P>
One of another two waiting for deportation is an American
known as Brother David, who has lived in Jerusalem for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's deportation raised to almost 60 the number of
Christians expelled this year from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel tried to play down the repercusions that the
deportations could effect the country's tourist industry. Israel
expects three million Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy land
in 2000 to mark the start of Christianity's thrid
millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Federal Government
has launched a special panel to study the high incidence of
flooding in the most populous African country, the Guardian
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Environment Ime Okopido said in Abuja
Tuesday that the panel would put in place a national emergency
plan and an early warning system to prevent flooding from
occuring.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on the composition of the panel and
the time frame for its assignment.
</P>
<P>
Okopido said that his government was poised to procure better
scientific equipment to enhance the forecast of the intensity of
floods and other natural disasters.

On the spate of floods which had ravaged many parts of the
country, the official disclosed that his ministry would liaise
with the National Emergency Management Agency and the National
Commission for Refugees, with a view to providing relief materials
to the inhabitants of the affected communities.
</P>
<P>
He condoled with the "families of those who have suffered
untold hardships, loss of lives and property from the destructive
impacts of the floods."
</P>

Attributing the recent cases of flooding to what he called
"global climate change phenomenon," Okopido said his ministry is
working towards documenting the flooding experiences in the Niger

<HEADLINE> Russia Urged to Stop Military Actions in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian parliament
official called on Russia Wednesday to stop military actions in
its breakaway Muslim republic, Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hoped that Russia will understand that peaceful
settlement, negotiations and dialog are better ways than military
actions in solving problems, said Mohamed Abdellah, chairman of
the People's Assembly Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Abdellah made the remarks in an interview with Egypt's Middle
East News Agency on the sidelines of an Arab-Russian symposium,
which opened Tuesday, on bilateral and collective cooperation in
the political and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation to the symposium will realize that the
Arab nation is concerned over and calls for a halt to Russia's
military operations and violent escalation in Chechnya, Abdellah
said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is a good opportunity for expounding the Arab
views on the military strikes on sites in Chechnya, the Egyptian
parliament official said.
</P>
<P>
Russia began bombing Chechnya on September 5 in an effort to
wipe out Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is of special importance for the Arab-Russian
relations and opens a door for talks on joint and collective
cooperation in international and regional issues, Abdellah said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process and one
of the influential major countries on European and international
arenas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, China Issue Joint Communique (Part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
exchanged views with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on bilateral relations as well as regional
and international issues of common concern and they have reached
consensus.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press communique released at the end of the talks
Tuesday, both sides expressed satisfaction over the dramatic
growth in their relations of friendship and cooperation and
reiterated willingness to raise such ties in the political and
economic fields to the level of strategic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reviewed the Middle East peace process that has been
going on since the 1991 Madrid peace talks and welcomed the Sharm
El Sheikh peace deal reached between Palestine and Israel in
September on the implementation of the Wye River peace accord,
hoping it is a good step.
</P>
<P>
They held that related U.N. resolutions, particularly,
Resolutions 242, 338 and 425 passed by the Security Council on the
Middle East issue, the land-for-peace principle, the spirit of the
Madrid peace talks as well as the agreements already signed by
Israel and Palestine should serve as the principles and basis for
the settlement of the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, the Palestinian people should enjoy the
right to self-determination and establish an independent statehood
on their own territory.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed the importance of the Jerusalem issue,
saying any unilateral action that might affect the talks on final
status should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Both sides appealed to the international community to take
rapid and effective steps for the realization of a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the Middle East. They also urged Syria
and Israel to resume talks from where it was stalled and called
for an unconditional implementation of U.N. Resolution 425 on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed the importance of forbidding the
proliferation of massive destructive weapons of all kinds,
expressing support for a Middle East free of massive destructive
weapons and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the universality and validity of an international
system on the prohibition of massive destructive weapons and their
proliferation for any country and region of the world.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the developments of the Iraq issue, the leaders
expressed their deep concern over the current deadlock. They said
Iraq should practically and in an all-round way implement all
related international resolutions, while the Security Council
resolutions calling for meeting the humanitarian needs of the
Iraqi people should be carried out. They stressed it is imperative
to respect Iraq's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity and called on the international community to seek a way
out of the impasse as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Drivers to Choose Starting Positions in Rally Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Drivers are to choose their
starting positions for the first time when the Rally Australia,
the season's penultimate stage of the World Championships, changed
the rule of the starting orders.
</P>
<P>
The rally leader will pick his starting place first, followed
by the second and so on when the four-day event sets off on
Thursday night in Perth.
</P>
<P>
World leader Tommi Makinen of Finland welcomed the rule change,
saying this change will help top drivers.
</P>
<P>
Many drivers deliberately slowed down in some stages during
previous Rally Australia to start later on the next stage because
the early drivers were always disadvantaged by the dirt roads,
which were covered by thousands of small stones.
</P>
<P>
Late cars enjoyed better conditions after stones were swept off
the road by the earlier drivers.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, who is seeking for a record fourth world title, leads
Frenchman Didier Auriol by six points and a win in Perth will seal
his fourth title, regardless of the result of the season-ending
leg in Britain later this month.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Selects Four Deputy Directors-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore has selected four candidates
to serve as his deputies for the next three years, WTO officials
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four deputy directors-general selected by Moore are Ablasse
Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso, Paul-Henri Ravier of France, Miguel
Rodriguez Mendoza of Venezuela and Andrew Stoler of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said that Ouedraogo is the first African and first
representative from a least developed country ever chosen as a
deputy director-general of the international trade organization or
its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Moore, who took office in September, made the selection from a
pool of highly qualified candidates following weeks of intensive
consultations with dozens of WTO member countries.
</P>
<P>
He also consulted with his designated successor, Supachai
Panitchpakdi of Thailand, who will take office as WTO's next
director-general on September 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
"This decision was an extremely tough call, given all the very
good people who were nominated by their governments," said Moore,
"I have selected a broad mix of people with the wide range of
skills we need to ensure smooth and efficient management of the
WTO secretariat."
</P>
<P>
"I want these men in place as soon as possible and certainly by
the Seattle Ministerial Conference (from November 30 to December 3)
. Precisely when they can take up their duties is up to their
governments and employers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moore and Supachai have agreed that the four deputies will
serve for a month after Moore's term expires on August 31, 2002,
so as to ensure a smooth transition when Supachai takes office to
begin his three-year term.

<HEADLINE> EU, South Africa Still Face Wines, Spirits Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The long, drawn-out
negotiations on a Wines and Spirits Agreement (WSA) between the
European Union (EU) and South Africa are still deadlocked and have
run into "huge problems," EU sources said in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive arm, confirmed that the
port and sherry cases were closed, but the two sides have not yet
found a consensus on designations of origin for Greek ouzo and
Italian grappa. It is not yet clear whether the EU will defend
these two famous brands with the same strength as port and sherry.
</P>
<P>
The EU and South Africa signed a free trade agreement last
month by overcoming a last-minute row over the use of the terms
port and sherry.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Spain and Portugal, backed by France, Greece and
Italy, demanded written guarantees that South Africa should phase
out the use of the terms on its fortified wines.
</P>
<P>
The five EU members insisted the brands port and sherry can
only be used for drinks originating from particular areas of
Portugal and Spain respectively. But South Africa, one of the
southern hemisphere's biggest producers of fortified wines, argued
the terms set down for such a move.
</P>
<P>
EU and South African negotiators had agreed last month to
conclude the issue by the end of October, but missed the deadline,
according to a European Commission spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
This "jeopardized plans for the provisional entry into force of
the free trade agreement (FTA) between the two zones by January
2000," since it depends on the prior conclusion of the WSA.
</P>
<P>
"We did not meet our negotiating objectives," a Commission
spokesman said, adding now this is time for a political assessment
by EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has forwarded a preliminary report
updating the 15 EU member states on the negotiations to the EU
Council of Ministers. The EU's Committee of Member States'
Permanent Representatives to the EU will discuss the issue next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also indicated that for the time being, no
movement can be observed on the issue until the member states give
their common stance.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Sees Record High of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in South Korea
soared 85 percent year-on-year, hitting 10.25 billion U.S. dollars
in the first 10 months of 1999, a record high in a single year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time foreign investment has exceeded 10 billion
U.S. dollars in a single year since South Korea introduced foreign
capital in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government attributed the increase to a rapid
recovery of the national economy, eased regulations on foreign
investment, and the efforts by domestic companies to bring in more
investment as part of their restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
A big surge in investment from the European Union also led to a
rise of foreign investment in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving a goal of direct foreign investment of 15 billion U.
S. dollars this year will not be difficult." said a spokesman of
the Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Since South Korea's first efforts to introduce foreign
investment, it took the country ten years to bring in the first
100 million U.S. dollars in 1972. The foreign investment in the
country exceeded one billion dollars in 1987 and it amounted to
more than 5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
If South Korea reaches the target of 15-billion-dollar in
foreign investment this year, it will become the second largest
country in Asia after China in terms of absorbing foreign
investment, said the spokesman.

BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China now has more than 90,000
registered wholesale markets and bazaars nationwide, with nearly 1,
000 of them each reporting annual sales in excess of 100 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Goods sold in the markets have broadened from agricultural
products only in the 1980s to all kinds of industrial products and
basic materials for production.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the booming of home appliances, computer and
curio markets also bolstered the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
Yiwu Small Commodity Bazaar, located in east China's Zhejiang
Province, is so far the country's biggest wholesale market with
annual sales topping 20 billion yuan. Its products are exported to
more than ten countries and regions worldwide. A dozen similar
wholesale markets have annual sales of more than 10 billion yuan
each.
</P>
<P>
In some provinces, wholesale markets have extended to foreign
lands. The city of Mudanjiang in north China's Heilongjiang
Province, for instance, has become the country's key exporter of
fruits, vegetables, food, electronics and building materials by
setting up 80-plus branch markets in Russia.

As for the death rate of infants, the report showed that it has
declined by 11 percent in the past 10 years, saying that among
1,000 childbirths from 1995 to 1998, 31 children died before
living to one year.

The demographic inquiry is based on a sample of 12,919
aggregated families, questioning women from 15 to 49 years old and
men from 15 to 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
Conditions of lodgment, access to basic goods and services and
the level of instruction are also included in the questionnaire of

technology stocks which were boosted by the strong rise in
Tuesday's tech-heavy NASDAQ index.

They said that the pending resumption of IMF loans to Indonesia
also contributed to the active buying of Indonesia-linked stocks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Defend National Solidarity at Any </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has urged the people to continue with the spirit
of national solidarity to detehief Justice Francis Nyalali and some former minis
ters to
pay tribute to Tanzania's founding president Julius Nyerere, the
Daily News newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the National Assembly in session in the
central city Dodoma that the Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar
would be safeguarded at any cost.
</P>
<P>
"Our union will be defended at any cost while the welfare of
the people will be given priority. The tranquility which prevailed
during the mourning period is enough testimony that the
foundations which Mwalimu (as Nyerere is respectfully called) laid
are very strong," He said.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged Tanzanians not to despair but should instead
work hard and fight all that Nyerere disliked as a way of honoring
him.
</P>
<P>
The House will give full assistance to Mkapa in the task of
carrying forward the good work of Nyerere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fatma Maghimbi, leader of the opposition in the
National Assembly, said the Union is a very good thing but urged
for its review to seek a "national consensus on what form the
Union should take."
</P>
<P>
She decried the rampant corruption in the country and called
for an all- out war to fight the vice in addition to poverty,
ignorance and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia in the St. Thomas Hospital in London
on October 14.

<HEADLINE> Australia, Indonesia Agree to Ministerial Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Indonesia
Wednesday agreed to hold a ministerial meeting between them in a
bid to help restore soured relations over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he and
Indonesia's Ambassador to the United Nations, Makarim Wibisono,
were both keen to improve the political relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not anticipating when and where this will happen but we
think it is a good idea to have a meeting of that kind," Downer
told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The signs are there from both sides that we want to start to
get the relationship back on track again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that the issue of East Timor has ambushed
Australia's relations with Indonesia time and time again over the
last quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
"We see that now the East Timor issue has been resolved - at
least from a political sense - there is an opportunity to put the
endless problems over East Timor...behind us and to move forward,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer also said that after talks with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, the Australian-led multi-national force in East Timor
expected a seamless handover to U.N. troops sometime between
mid-January and early February.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia has offered to lead the U.N. force, Downer
said if Annan chose another country in the region," we're relaxed
and comfortable about that."

<HEADLINE> Three Chinese Securities Investment Funds to Increase Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China's first three transformed
securities investment funds have got official approval to issue
new units to increase their capital, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
The three funds are the Xiangzheng Securities Investment Fund,
the Changyang Securities Investment Fund and the Jubo Securities
Investment Fund. All were listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
bourses in late October after the transformation.
</P>
<P>
Xiangzheng will expand from 200 million units to 1.5 billion
units, Changyang from 200 million to one billion units, and Jubo
from 250 million to one billion units.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the three units would be given priority in
buying the increased units, at a price of 1.01 yuan per unit.
</P>
<P>
The unit face value will remain one yuan after the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Units not bought by the current shareholders would be sold to
commercial insurance firms, while the rest would be taken by the
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
By the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
the three funds have been recognized as unit-trust and closed-end
funds and would extend their existence by five years to 2007.
</P>
<P>
The Changyang fund would change its name to Jingyang after the
new issue.
</P>
<P>
All the investment funds approved by the Chinese authorities
before the promulgation of a regulation on securities investment
funds in November 1997 are known in China as "old funds."
</P>
<P>
As these old funds have innate drawbacks in investment strategy,
internal management, risk control and information disclosure, the
Chinese authorities started to transform them into regular
securities investment funds earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks Hit Hard by Daewoo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean domestic banks have
seen their third-quarter performance go into red due to Daewoo
crisis, said the Financial Supervisory Service Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen commercial banks registered a combined net loss of 172.
6 billion won (143.83 million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter,
compared with net profits of 2.27 trillion won (1.89 billion
dollars) in the first quarter and 814.6 billion won (678.83
million dollars) in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Banks saw red ink because they had to make additional
provisions worth 713.4 billion won (594.5 million dollars) for
their huge portfolio of Daewoo loans under stricter asset
classification standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they suffered 424 billion won (353.3 million
dollars) in securities management losses from the decline in the
Seoul stock market.
</P>
<P>
Hanvit Bank suffered the most with 498.8 billion won (415.6
million dollars) in net losses, followed by Peace Bank, Pusan Bank
and others.
</P>
<P>
Although in the black were Cho Hung Bank, Kookmin Bank, Shinhan
Bank, H&AMP;CB, Taegu Bank, and Hana Bank, some of them may sustain
net losses at the end of this year because of insufficient loan
loss provisions.

<HEADLINE> China Buttresses Trade with Quality Control Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China will be more vigilant
about its product quality inspection rules so as to promote
foreign trade and protect the interests of its people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, more than 5,200 Chinese and
international companies have been granted 40,000-plus quality
inspection certificates from Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
China this week announced a ban on wood packaging for goods
shipped from the United States and Japan which have not been
treated for a lethal pest.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration for Entry-Exit
Inspection and Quarantine (SAIQ) said that this is not a
retaliatory move in response to the similar U.S. ban on Chinese
wood packaging.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the ban will affect one third of the
exports from the U.S. and Japan to China. In 1998, the two
countries' exports to China totaled 16.96 billion and 28.21
billion U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already officially licensed 12
inspection and quarantine agencies and 148 inspection laboratories.
The biggest is the China Quality Certification Center for Import
and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the Exhibition of Quality
Certification Achievements in the field of China's import and
export commodities, SAIQ Deputy Director Wang Fengqing said that
the inspection and quarantine system has not only helped improve
product quality and competitiveness of Chinese companies, but also
safeguarded the health and security of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> China Boasts Multi-Level Old-Age Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that China now boasts a multi-level old-age pension
system, jointly paid for by the state, enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yazhi, vice-minister of labor and social security, made the
remark at the start of the two-day Sino-U.S. Social Insurance
Symposium, co-sponsored by the ministry and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene
and MacRaeL, a U.S.-based international law firm.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, 92.6 million Chinese workers were
registered in the basic old-age pension system, while 28.36
million retired workers were receiving pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that China's current multi-level old-age
pension system covers state-owned enterprises, township or
collectively-owned enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and
private businesses.
</P>
<P>
In the basic old-age pension, which combines social pools with
individual accounts, enterprises pay less than 20 percent of the
total payroll as old-age insurance fees for its workers, while the
workers pay eight percent of their salaries toward their pension.
</P>
<P>
China's old-age pension and insurance for retirees system began
in 1951. Then, only those enterprises each with more than 100
workers could be covered by the system.
</P>
<P>
By 1978 when China kicked off its reform and opening-up drive,
some 3.14 million Chinese workers became eligible for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
Another ministry official said that with the deepening of the
state-owned enterprises reform and the growth of the aging
population, China's old-age pension system has become "an issue of
great concern to both the government and ordinary people" and is "
in the midst of its most vigorous reforms to date."

<HEADLINE> Ancient Xylography Still Useful in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Although computerized
typesetting is popular, xylography, a 1,300-year-old printing
technique done entirely by hand, is still alive in China.
</P>
<P>
At an old-fashioned workshop in the Jinling Buddhism Publishing
House in downtown Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu
Province, workers print sutras from wood plates engraved more than
100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The craftsmen apply ink to the plates, cover them with paper,
and stroke the paper with brushes until the outlines of the
Chinese characters appear.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign collectors prefer xylographic sutras to
machine-made styles because of their traditional and artistic
value, said Xu Wei, director of the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
The art of xylography consists of sample writing, carving,
printing and binding, all done by hand, Xu said. Every year her
publishing house prints about 150,000 copies of sutras.
</P>
<P>
Ink used for xylography is a mixture of pine ash, flour, liquor,
vinegar and several other components which must be fermented for
at least three years. And the paper is made from bamboo.
</P>
<P>
The publishing house, set up in 1866, is a world center for
publishing Buddhist sutras, which are also regarded as artistic
works, and has a collection of 130,000 of the plates.
</P>
<P>
A professional carver can engrave only about a dozen Chinese
characters a day, and it usually takes about a week to complete a
plate, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Gets Letter From Sudanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
received a letter from his Sudanese counterpart Omar Hassan
al-Bashir on bilateral relations, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Saddam on Tuesday evening met with visiting Sudanese
Agriculture and Forests Minister Osman el-Hadi who delivered the
letter to the Iraqi president, said INA.
</P>
<P>
The letter dealt with means of developing bilateral ties in
all fields, it added without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Sudanese minister reiterated his
country's firm stance toward Iraq in confronting the U.S. and
British aggression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes taking off from Saudi, Kuwaiti
and Turkish military bases have been regularly attacking Iraq's
civilian and military targets in the two no-fly zones since last
December's four-night airstrikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones on Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
After the U.S.-British air campaign against Iraq last December,
the U.S. administration embraced an act providing 97 million
U.S. dollars in military aid for the Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, about 300 delegates representing Iraqi
opposition groups were brought together in New York by the
U.S. for the first time in seven years for a four-day conference
to discuss ways of overthrowing the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan told reporters Monday
that opposition groups living outside Iraq will be excluded from
joining in a multi-party system that the government is intending
to establish.
</P>
<P>
According to INA, Saddam has instructed his top aides to study
the possibility of forming new political parties and drawing up a
new constitution.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Manufacturing Output Recovers Pre-crisis Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's manufacturing
output has recovered to pre-crisis level, said the Bank of Korea
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Business vitality has been rapidly spreading from office
machinery, semiconductors, telecommunication equipment and autos
to other manufacturing industries, with manufacturing output
growing by 27.5 percent in the third quarter of this year from 23.
4 percent growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the gap in output growth rate between prosperous
and sluggish industries has been narrowing since the third quarter
of this year and the gap between corporations and small firms has
also been closing.
</P>
<P>
The gap stood at 15 percentage points in 1997 and widened to 18
percentage points in 1998 before narrowing to six percentage
points in the third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of operating ratio, eight of the surveyed 21
industries, including office machinery, electric machinery,
semiconductors and medical equipment, have recovered to pre-crisis
levels while most of the remaining were found to be above 90
percent of the pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
Since the economy is in a recovery phase, production activities
will become brisker in manufacturing industries other than the
prosperous ones -- office machinery, semiconductors,
telecommunication equipment and autos -- in the future.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997, then South Korea, the 11th largest industrialized
country was plagued by a financial crisis triggered by corporate
failures and bad loans of financial institutions, for which the
nation borrowed 58 billion U. S. dollars from the International
Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sun Microsystems Inc. Unveils New Servers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sun Microsystems Inc., a
developer of computer workstations, servers and software, Tuesday
added new midrange server computers, trying to put some more teeth
into its Internet strategy, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Palo Alto, a California-based company, said the new
Enterprise 220R and 240R servers can be bolted to a rack and are
geared for use by Internet or application service providers,
companies that typically need to stack up as many computers in as
little floor space as possible.
</P>
<P>
The new servers are designed to keep at bay IBM and Hewlett-
Packard, the two other biggest server sellers, said International
Data Corporation analyst Jean Bozman. Though Sun passed those two
competitors in server revenues in 1998, all three are strong, with
more than 4.5 billion dollars in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sun also introduced a server intended for telecommunications
corporations such as telephone companies. These machines are able
to withstand earthquakes, high temperatures from failed air
conditioning, and smoke from fires, said Neil Knox, vice president
of network systems at the company.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Tax Revenues Decline in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's tax revenues in
October totalled only 2.38 billion U.S. dollars, 10 percent
less than that of September, the Finance Ministry reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months this year, it said, tax revenues
totalled 24.857 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 2.1 percent
increase in real terms compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government set a real increase of 2.9 percent for the
whole 1999 in tax revenue collections.
</P>
<P>
The total shortfall in tax collections compared with the
government's target is therefore 100 million U.S. dollars for
the first 10 months in the year.
</P>
<P>
In October, income and real estate taxes totalled 1.285
billion U.S. dollars, compared with 1.333 billion in September
and 1.357 billion in August.
</P>
<P>
The customs and VAT (value added taxes) division collected
some one billion U.S. dollars in October, down from 1.14
billion collected in September. For the last ten months, the
division has collected 10.61 billion U.S. dollars, a real
increase of 4.2 percent over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Israel, the country's central bank,
said Tuesday that the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) fell in
October by 10 percent in relation to the previous month and
now stands at 92.6 points.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the reasons for the fall of CCI include
the fluctuations in the stock exchange, the peace process which
has a degree of influence over optimism and pessimism in the
market and the expectations that the current rate of
unemployment will continue.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Worldwide E-Business Weakens Traditional Procurement Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Corporations worldwide are
aggressively increasing the volume of purchases via the Internet
and shedding suppliers, according to a global study on procurement
released Tuesday by U.S. management consulting firm A.T. Keamey.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to 2001, participating companies in the study expect
to increase the volume of external spending handled via the
Internet by 1,000 percent. Keamey's study, based on 160 large
corporations from 28 countries, shows that within two years, as
much as one-fourth of many companies' external expenditures will
be ordered via the Internet, compared with less than 2 percent of
today.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the world's top 100 companies will do 400 billion
U.S. dollars of business-to-business transactions via the Internet
by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that corporations plan to decrease their
procurement headcount by roughly 25 percent in the next two years,
mainly in the transitional area. At the same time, they also plan
on average to eliminate more than 25 percent of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Procurement leaders today are leveraging supply markets for
innovation and revenue generation, while followers still focus on
cutting costs, according to the Keamey study.
</P>
<P>
Keamey's study also indicated that excellence in procurement
has a substantial impact on business performance. On average,
compared with the remaining three-quarters of the study's
participants, the top quartile of best-practice companies recorded
a nearly one-third higher rate of profit growth, and a two-fold
advantage in the reduction rate for cost of goods sold.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the participating companies' expectations for
suppliers have risen. They increasingly expect suppliers to drive
innovation and to support customers' marketing efforts, according
to the study.

The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over

<HEADLINE> Minister Vows to Further Curb Police Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Public Security Jia
Chunwang today vowed to contain police corruption and misconduct
within a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who took office in March of 1998, made the pledge here at
a hearing of the Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs under
the National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said China's 1.5 million police officers are generally
faithful to their sworn duties. Between 1998 and the first half of
1999, over 660 police officers were killed on duty and more than
10,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted there are some serious problems in the force
that have been the source of public complaints.
</P>
<P>
He listed bribery, abuse of power, negligence, direct
involvement in illegal activities and collaboration with criminals,
illegal use of weapons, and dereliction of duty while enforcing
the law.
</P>
<P>
Some high-level police officers have been found convicted of
criminal wrongdoing, while others lack professional competence, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, he noted, more will be done to improve
the quality of police of different levels, including arranging for
more training programs and strengthening the supervision system
for police.
</P>
<P>
Police officers will be required to take exams to determine
their qualifications, and a stricter recruitment system will be
put into place, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry has already adopted some measures to deal
with police corruption, and 3,000 police supervisory task forces
have been formed by public security departments across the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China needs to get tougher on
corruption in police departments as they play an uniquely
important role in maintaining social stability, national security
and safeguarding the overall economic and social development, top
lawmaker Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, the country's top legislature, made the remark after
hearing reports by Jia Chunwang, minister of public security, on
recent shake-ups in the 1.5-million-member police force.

</P>
<P>
"However, some police departments and policemen have been found
to be engaged in unfair enforcement of the law, breaking law
during law-enforcement, being rude and bullying people who pay the
taxes that pay for them," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Those wrongdoings have severely tarnished the dignity of the
law as well as the image of police of the nation," he pointed.
</P>
<P>
He told police departments to improve their internal and
external supervision systems, including supervision by people's
congresses at various levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's congresses are not going to handle
cases the way policemen do, instead they are to analyze specific
cases in order to promote justice and help the work of police
departments.
</P>
<P>
"China is poised at a crucial point of reform and development,
facing a series of complicated new situations and problems, thus
is especially in need of a police contingent that is politically
reliable, rigorous in discipline, honest and clean in fulfilling
duties and highly proficient," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Police departments should more vigorously build up their
quality and their officers and not fail the expectations of the
Party and the people, Li said.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer will deliver Australia's concerns about possible
nuclear arms proliferation when he meets senior U.S. officials in
Washington early Thursday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
said.
</P>
<P>
Downer and Defense Minister John Moore will attend the annual
Australia-United States ministerial (AUSMIN) meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Downer was quoted as saying on Wednesday it would be a chance
for him to express Australia's disappointment about the U.S.
senate's failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senate last month rejected the Clinton
administration's appeal to approve the CTBT, which would ban land,
air and underwater nuclear tests if enough countries legalized it.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the U.S. senate had undermined the arms control
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"What the senate has done has been most unhelpful in terms of
that arms control agenda," Downer told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The AUSMIN meeting, the first since July last year, will also
cover the East Timor and other Asia-Pacific security issues.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Force chief Admiral Chris Barrie is also
attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Oslo Summit Sets Up New Mechanism for Hard Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The much-anticipated three-way
summit among U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ended here
Tuesday without fanfare, but it was said to be a "pretty good
start" for the two sides in the Middle East to kick off final
status negotiation.
</P>
<P>
It was the climax of the two-day events in Oslo, capital of
Norway. "We have revitalized the process," Clinton said after the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were here to pay homage to Yitzhak Rabin, the late
Israeli prime minister who was assassinated four years ago by an
extremist Jew opposed to his peace policies. The commemoration of
Rabin drew renewed pledges from both Arafat and Barak to continue
the journey for peace which Rabin started right here in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
The summit enabled the two sides to turn their goals into
planned approaches on how to go down to tackle the thorniest
issues between them - Jerusalem, final borders, rights of
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and allocation of water -
in the tough final status talks that will be kicked off on
November 8.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have named their negotiating teams and agreed
that their leaders will personally continue to meet on a regular
basis, promised to work hard to avoid provoking each other with
public comments and actions, and expressed desire of a Camp David-
style summit at the end of the process.
</P>
<P>
According to their ambitious time table, a framework agreement
will be in place by mid-February and a final accord on permanent
pace is expected by September 2000. "We'll all in high gear
between now and then," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to a new mechanism to facilitate the talks:
their negotiating teams will work four days a week and report
directly to their leaders and a hotline is to be set up between
Arafat and Barak to ease the communication between the two "
partners in peace."
</P>
<P>
But there was no hope for major breakthroughs. They even did
not dig into substance, for fear it might sour the atmosphere,
despite their openly-claimed willingness to take up every
sensitive topic.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had wanted the summit to "at least stop the
settlement activities" in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but what
they got was far from equivocal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also listed, on the eve of the Oslo summit, their
respective and conflicting stands on final status issues.
Jerusalem, for example, is claimed by the Israelis as their "
undivided and eternal capital," while the Palestinians insist it
should be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Although this can be viewed as a tactic to ensure a better
bargaining position in the coming negotiations, its timing gave a
measure of sense how far away the two sides are from each other
and how arduous the road ahead is going to be.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton offered to do everything he could to
help the two sides to achieve peace. To him, this is a political
and moral obligation. Meanwhile, Clinton is eager to have an
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord before his term ends in 2001 to
crown his battered presidency.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, as a U.S. official admitted, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is to go to the Middle East once or twice and
the peace process coordinator Dennis Ross will travel there more
frequently for trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
But it is the Middle East leaders that have in their hands the
destiny of the peace process. A success required a strong
political will from both sides to make tough and painful decisions.
Arafat said he was well aware that "starting the peace was a much
easier task than maintaining the peace or deepening its roots in
our region."
</P>
<P>
Barak has vowed to work together with Arafat to strive to
overcome the difficulties and reach the common goal of peace. As
he put it, there's the will, there's the way.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Welcomes Camp David-style Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat welcomes Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's idea of
holding a Camp David-style summit early next year in order to
advance the final-status talks between the two sides, a local
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reservations about this, and we have no objections
to such a meeting," The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted Arafat as
saying in an interview Tuesday after holding talks with Barak in
Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders were held before a three-way
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton, a high-point of two days
of ceremonies marking four years since the assassination of the
late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced after the summit that Barak and Arafat had
agreed in principle to hold another summit in the U.S. in January
or February in order to help close a deal on the framework for a
final peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set an ambitious timetable for
reaching a framework agreement for a final peace treaty by
February, or three months from now.
</P>
<P>
A former army chief who likes to leave important decisions in
his own hands, Barak has suggested that he and Arafat, joined by
Clinton, hold a Camp David-like summit before the deadline to
clinch the deal.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and former
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, with the help of the then
U.S. president Jimmy Carter, held intensive closed-door talks in
the U.S. presidential resort of Camp David in 1978, paving the way
for the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty signed next year.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials have voiced their reservations on
such a summit for fear that the negotiations between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiating teams might be sidestepped.
</P>
<P>
They have expressed their disappointment over Barak's
appointment of Oded Eran, Israel's Ambassador to Jordan, as chief
of the Israeli negotiating team, saying Eran as a diplomat would
not be able to make decisions on issues regarding national
interests.
</P>
<P>
They said the appointment showed that Barak intended to create
a back channel in the negotiations, a charge denied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Eran and Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo,
head of the Palestinian negotiating team, will formally launch
the hardest negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will deal with thorny issues such as the final
status of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlement and the future of the contested
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with The Jerusalem Post, Arafat stressed that
the proposed summit should not be solely ceremonial. There should
be a distinct and actual agenda for the summit, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Millennium's 1st Mega-Meeting Has 100 Days to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in the
Foreign Ministry of Thailand on Wednesday to mark the 100 days
countdown of the tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first major global conference in the new
millennium, will be held here from February 12 to 19, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to review and assess the history of
economic development over the past 50 years and present their
blueprints for the world development in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's ceremony, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
that UNCTAD X will also provide an opportunity for the world to
learn from Thailand's "mistakes and successes."
</P>
<P>
Thailand has long been held up as an example of successful
development before it was caught up in the Asian financial crisis
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"(The meeting) has the potential to be a defining moment for
the world community in the quest for coherence and consensus on
policies and strategies to manage the phenomenon of globalization
in a way that would benefit all countries, developed and
developing alike," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also said in a message
which was delivered here by a U.N. regional officer Wednesday that
globalization has not yet provided answers to the problems of mass
unemployment or income inequality.
</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD X will provide a gold opportunity for the international
community to take firm and courageous action to enhance the
contribution of developing countries to the global economy and
take steps to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared
more equitably," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD was established in 1964 as a permanent
inter-governmental body, which is the principal organ of the U.N.
General Assembly in the field of trade and development.
</P>
<P>
Its main goals are to maximize trade, investment and
development opportunities of developing countries, and to help
them face challenges arising from globalization and integrate them
into the world economy on an equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people are expected to visit Thailand during the
tenth quadri-annual meeting, including 3,000 to 4,000 delegates
from 188 UNCTAD members, 1,000 to 2,000 foreign reporters and
3,000 to 4,000 family members of the delegates and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hoped that the mega-meeting, to be the largest
international conference Thailand has ever hosted, will bring the
country about 700 to 800 million baht (19 to 21 million U.S.
dollars) income.

<HEADLINE> North China Quake Is Aftershock Ten Years Ago, Seismologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The November 1 earthquake that
shook the area between Hunyuan County in north China's Shanxi
Province and Yangyuan County in Hebei Province was an aftershock
from a tremor that occurred there ten years ago, said Qi Xueqin,
deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Records show that two earthquakes measuring 6.1 and 5.8 on the
Richter scale broke out respectively in 1989 and 1991, just two
kilometers away from the epicenter of Monday's quake, which caused
slight injury of one person and damage to more than 6,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1989 quake, several aftershocks measuring 4.0 have
been detected in the same location, Qi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that local seismological bureaus are closely monitoring
the region joining Hebei and Shanxi provinces and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The spot is situated along the edge of the Datong Basin, where
several earthquakes measuring above 6.0 have struck throughout
history, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Expects $400 Million Business From BATEXPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's garment industry
received spot orders worth 44.02 million U.S. dollars at the
just-concluded apparel and textile show, and was expecting 400
million dollars' business from the exhibition.
This was learnt here from Anisur Rahman Sinha, president of the
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association
(BGMEA), on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition
(BATEXPO), the biggest yearly exposition in the textile and
apparel sector in the country, ended on Tuesday. The exhibition
has been held annually since 1989 to promote export of the
country's apparel and textiles products.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three companies, including eight foreign participants
from Pakistan, India and China, took part in the exhibition, which
was held at the Sonargaon Hotel in downtown Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 foreign buyers, including 20 new ones, and 450
local representatives of foreign buyers visited the show, Sinha
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's garment manufacturers and exporters also received
spot orders worth 4 million U.S. dollars for their ready-stock
apparel, the BGMEA president said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony on Sunday, Sinha pledged to
increase the export from the ready-made garment sector to 10
billion U.S. dollars in the next three years, which he said "will
bring significant changes to our country."
</P>
<P>
As the largest manufacturing sector, the textile industry
"occupies a very important position in Bangladesh," contributing
about 5 percent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and
around 50 percent of the industrial employment, according to the
BGMEA.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector earned some 4 billion dollars in the 1998-99
fiscal year by exporting products to 90 countries and regions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Ready-made garments, growing at an annual rate of more than 20
percent over the past few years, have become the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, which along with the textile industry
contribute about 70 percent to the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,000 garment manufacturers and exporters
in Bangladesh, employing nearly 1.5 million workers.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Stock Index Drops to Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Nairobi Stock Exchange
20-share index Tuesday slipped below a historic low of 2,300
points with many blue chip shares sinking sharply, the East
African Standard newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 2294.90, losing 17.23 points or a drop of
0.7 percent. This is the second time that the Nairobi stock index
slipped below 2,300 point mark. The first time was on December 3,
1993 when it closed at 2,288.76 points.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi stock index tracks the performance of 20 companies
from a cross-section of sectors and Tuesday's historic low shows
that the share prices of those companies have on average been
dropping over the years.
</P>
<P>
The index is normally taken as an indicator of the performance
of the economy, the paper said, adding that an unfavorable
investment climate makes investors shy away from the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Among those whose share prices dropped sharply were Kenya Power
and Lighting Company, East African Breweries Limited and Uchumi
Supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's turnover rose to 10 million shillings (about 1.33
million U.S. dollars) on a volume of 413,000 shares against a
turnover of 6.4 million shillings recorded Monday.

malaria epidemic, Kenya's Health Minister Sam Ongeri said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which is preventable and curable, kills 72 Kenyan

a consequence of cerebral malaria every year, he was quoted as
saying by Wednesday's East African Standard newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) has resolved to ratify the trade protocol on
January 1 next year to replace the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU), Times of Zambia newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister David Mpamba said
in an interview here on Tuesday that ministers of trade in the
regional grouping had agreed to ratify the program in two months'
time.
</P>
<P>
The technical team is still ironing out finer details contained
in the rules of origin, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The details in the rules of origin are complex and that is one
of the reasons why the signing of the agreement has been delayed,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement is expected to be signed in the next two
months, its full implementation would take more than eight years,
Mpamba said, noting that a provision has been given to allow
member countries that may not be able to implement the protocol to
seek abrogation for up to eight years.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, some countries in the SACU are
reluctant to ratify the agreement with Zambia fearing that it
would take up their market.
</P>
<P>
This has been the major cause of the delay in signing the
regional grouping agreement, he said.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Provide US$500,000 for Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and three African nations have agreed to contribute
500,000 U.S. dollars to bolster the fragile peace process in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the daily Herald reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Uganda have each pledged 100,000 U.S. dollars
while the OAU and Zambia have already released 200,000 U.S.
dollars and 100,000 U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The contributions are expected to kick-start the process and
give the Joint Military Commission (JMC) a financial base to
launch its work.
</P>
<P>
The JMC comprises the belligerents in the DRC war -- Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola on the one hand and Rwanda and Uganda on the
other.
</P>
<P>
The amount donated so far, however, falls far short of the five
million U.S. dollars required by the JMC to carry out its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The JMC, which held its first meeting in Ugandan capital
Kampala last month, is due to meet in the Zambian capital Lusaka
this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 3 (Xinhua)-- Ma Yaomei, a formerly poor
woman in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has earned herself the
title of "cattle-breeding queen" with the aid of UN loans, setting
a good example for the other local women.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Women's Association of Guyuan County said
over 65,000 women are managing all kinds of businesses including
crop raising, livestock breeding, trading, and the service sector
with foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 20 international organizations have loaned more
than two million U.S. dollars and two million yuan (more than 220,
000 dollars) to poverty-stricken areas here, including the United
Nations Population Fund (UNPF) and the 4701 Project of the World
Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, a total of 12.8 million yuan (about 1.5 million
dollars) has been allocated to eight of the poorest counties to
pull people out of poverty. Ma Yaomei, for example, now makes a
net income of 30,000 yuan a year by raising some 50 cattle, while
in the past, her average annual income never exceeded 1,000 yuan (
about 114 dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Unearths Bamboo Slips from Three Kingdoms Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 100,000 slips of bamboo
and wood from China's Three Kingdoms Period (220 A.D.- 280 A.D.),
discovered in Changsha in south China's Hunan Province, have
proved of great value for both archeology and the study of Chinese
calligraphy in ancient times, according to specialists in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The slips, discovered in October 1996, record in detail the
means of imposing and collecting farmland rents, the tax system,
and also several cases of corrupt officials in the Wu Kingdom (222-
280), invaluable additions to the understanding of society during
the Three Kingdoms Period.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, director of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage, said the Chinese characters on the slips are also
masterpieces of the calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of slips of the Eastern Han Period (25 A.D.- 220 A.D.)
and around one thousand slips of the Western Han Period (206 B.C.-
24 A.D.) were also discovered nearby in 1997 and 1999,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that archeologists will complete excavations and
classifications at the Changsha site by the year 2005, and a
series of books on the discoveries will be compiled. The first
volume on the findings was already published on October 28 this
year.
</P>
<P>
He added that construction of a center in the city for the
protection, study and exhibition of the discoveries is expected to
start soon.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese wrote on either wood slips or bamboo slips, as
paper was not commonly used in China until the Eastern Han Period.

<HEADLINE> 2 Injured, 7 Vehicles Damaged by Collapsed Bazaar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Debris of the collapsed floor of
a bazaar at downtown Baguio city in the northern Philippines
Wednesday morning injured two persons and damaged seven parked and
passing vehicles, the Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
The agency quoted Virgilio Hidalgo, local police officer, as
saying that the two injured were a driver and a passenger who were
among the occupants of the passing vehicles hit by the debris of
the collapsed floor of the bazaar.
The four-storey building in the central business district of
Baguio, the summer capital of the Philippines, was ravaged by a
48-hour fire two weeks ago, Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
The two injured persons were rushed by responding rescuers and
firemen to a nearby hospital. Timely arrival of Baguio police and
firemen prevented further confusion in the area, the police
officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said persons earlier seen trapped at the fourth floor of the
gutted building turned out to be members of the demolition crew,
adding that they were provided by rescuers with passage after the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Hidalgo said the two injured persons were declared by hospital
authorities as out of danger. Police already banned all passers-by
near the building.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Sale of State-Owned Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities recently
announced the start of an experiment to reduce state-owned shares
in listed companies, signaling another step in the reform of state-
owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among China's 900-odd listed enterprises,
non-circulating shares held by the Administration of State-Owned
Property and state-owned corporate bodies account for more than 60
percent of their equities, while circulating shares held by
general investors stands at only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that such an equity structure reduces the pressure
from investors on the management of the listed SOEs, and is
apparently contrary to the government's intention in listing such
SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yufeng, a researcher with Greatwall Securities Co., Ltd.,
said reducing state-owned shares will lead to the diversification
of the SOE equity structure and increase the managers'
responsibility to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the move is also connected to the government's
strategy of letting SOEs withdraw from certain sectors of the
economy and increase their presence in the sectors where they must
play the decisive factor, such as military-related industries,
telecommunications and others.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by reducing state-owned shares to an
extent where such shares still maintain an absolute holding
position of not less than 51 percent, the government will be able
to recover tens of billions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qin Yongfa, an official of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that if this money is spent on perfecting the
social security system, it will greatly help the SOE reform, which
will inevitably lead to massive unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jianfang, a researcher with the China Securities Co., Ltd.,
said the government's experimental program is both positive and
prudential.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, two enterprises will be chosen to take part
in the experiment in 1999, with their shares for sale not to
exceed 500 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Meets IMF Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Wednesday discussed the new government programs
with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director for
Asia Pacific Hubert Neiss during a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the meeting, Neiss said the IMF is
ready to assist Indonesia in implementing the programs,
particularly in agriculture and small-and-medium scale
entrepreneurial development.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is familiar with such programs. The IMF's programs are
flexible and can be adjusted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said the IMF is ready to help Indonesia to continue its
economic recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
The programs for state-owned bank restructuring must be
accelerated, he said, noting that similar programs on the private
banks have worked more smoothly than in the early period.
</P>
<P>
On the Bank Bali scandal, Neiss said the IMF hoped such
scandals will not happen again in the future, as the funds will
strengthen the country's banking restructuring agency.
</P>
<P>
The scandal involves the dubious transfer in early June of a
commission of some 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
from the Bank Bali to a private firm linked to close associates of
former president B.J. Habibie and the former ruling Golkar Party.
The commission was paid ostensibly for a private company's
assistance in recouping loans from closed banks.
</P>
<P>
In September, the IMF decided to temporarily stop the
disbursement of its aid to Indonesia until the results of the
Australia-based Pricewaterhouse Coopers' audit report on the
scandal were fully made public.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik
Kian Gie Tuesday presented the 400-page report to Neiss in line
with an earlier order by the president to make the report
available to the public and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said he will report to the IMF Director's council in
Washington on Friday about his meetings with Indonesian government
officials.
</P>
<P>
After that, the IMF technical team and Indonesia will discuss
the Fund's further programs for the country, he added.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand received a boost for
its hopes of staging the 2008 Olympics as Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai threw his weight behind the bid.
</P>
<P>
Chetta Thanajaro, chairman of the Olympic Committee of Thailand
(OCT), said on Wednesday that Chuan had agreed to back the Olympic
bid by Bangkok, which successfully hosted the Asian Games last
December.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures put the Asian Games marginally in the black,
with revenues of about 2.2 billion baht (61.1 million U.S. dollars)
against expenses of 2.1 billion baht (58 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chetta said hosting the games would have only a limited impact
on Thai government coffers and the private sector would be tapped
for sponsorship deals and other funding.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Paris, Seville, Osaka, Kuala Lumpur, Istanbul, Toronto
and Buenos Aires are now in the bid race for the 2008 Games.

<P>
DALIAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Huan Huan and Le Le, a black
swan couple, parented four nestlings this autumn after an unusual
birth of three in spring.
</P>
<P>
Mild and elegant, endangered black swans were originated from
Tasmania in Australia and usually lay eggs in summer or autumn,
only once a year.
</P>
<P>
Huan Huan and Le Le, who moved into the Yanshui Lake area of
the Dalian Forest Zoo in northeast China's Liaoning Province in
1997, laid three eggs earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
It was a miracle that Huan Huan and Le Le laid three eggs in
chilly March this year and successfully hatched three nestlings in
spring, when it was still cold in northeast China, according to
zoologists.
</P>
<P>
They contributed this fertility of Huan Huan and Le Le to the
global warming phenomenon and the congenial environment of the
Dalian Forest Zoo, which is home to 14 black swans.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Help Overseas-trained Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Doctors who trained overseas
but can't practise in New Zealand will be offered training courses
under a scheme, the New Zealand Government has announced.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 overseas-trained doctors living in New
Zealand with permanent residency who can't get jobs in their
profession because they haven't met New Zealand Medical Council
registration requirements.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Wednesday quoted
Health Minister Wyatt Creech as saying: "We have been very
concerned that we've had gaps in areas such as rural practice and
we've also had a pool of people who, with some training, could
have the skills and competence to fill the jobs."
</P>
<P>
"We've got anecdotal reports of them driving taxis, or sitting
on social welfare benefits. We do not want that to continue," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Creech said there will be strings attached to the training
courses, and doctors involved have to agree that once registered
they will be available to work in areas that need more doctors.
</P>
<P>
"This is a win-win for overseas-trained doctors, the health
profession, and New Zealanders," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Health Minister disclosed the cost of the
program have been factored into the health budget during the next
three years. If all training opportunities are taken up the cost
of setting up the programs for next year will be 4.9 million NZ
dollars (2.5 million U.S. dollars).

ATHENS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Olympics Organizing
Committee (COJO) said Tuesday that they will submit its marketing
plan for the 2004 Games to the International Olympic Committee (
IOC) later this month.
</P>
<P>
COJO Marketing Director Georges Bolos said that the plans to
promote the Games are expected to be adopted by the IOC later this
month and will be implemented following Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
After an aborted plan for an Olympic lottery, the organizers
had hoped to raise 287 million U.S. dollars for the 2004 Games
through sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
The government scrapped the lottery plan last month following
criticism that the government was turning the country into a
casino.
</P>
<P>
The COJO still fell short of finding a way to compensate an
estimated loss of 200 million dollars caused by the lottery
stoppage, COJO Vice-president Niki Tzavellas said.
</P>
<P>
Tzavellas said that their aim now was to convince Greek
sponsors to invest in the Games with three reasons: financial,
patriotic and prestige.

HANOI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai has asked all ministries to cooperate with the Foreign
Ministry to devise policies favorable to Viet Kieu (overseas
Vietnamese) when they return to Vietnam, Vietnam News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The instruction is contained in a decision issued on October
27.
</P>
<P>
The new decision aims to promote overseas Vietnamese ties with
their native country and encourage their contributions to national
development, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the returning Viet Kieu with valid
Vietnamese passports will be allowed to cross the border without
entry or exit visas.
</P>
<P>
Having entered the country, they are set to register their
temporary residences at the police stations just like the local
Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
However, those who are relatives or personal assistants or who
are visiting foreigners employed by international organizations or
who are members of a diplomatic mission in the country, will have
to follow different procedures to register as temporary residents
under the guidance of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Vietnamese with valid Vietnamese passports and those
who hold foreign passports but have been awarded certificates of
recognition for their contributions to the native country's
liberation or development by the Vietnamese Representative Offices
based in their resident countries will enjoy visa fee exemption
and the same transportation fees and service charges as the local
Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
Intellectuals, experts or skilled workers coming home to work
for at least one year at the invitation of government agencies
will be allowed to bring into the country a four-seater car and
some personal necessities free from duty payment. These things,
however, will have to be taken out of the country together with
their owners when the latter terminate their working terms.
</P>
<P>
The decision will takes effect on November 12.

<P>
DHAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Finance Ministry
has advised all nationalized commercial banks to stop trade union
activities at their regional and field offices by the end of this
year, The Independent daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting reliable sources, the report said the ministry advised
the Sonali Bank, one of the country's four nationalized banks, to
stop trade union activities at its regional offices and branches,
and to recover the spaces the trade unions had been occupying at
those offices.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, trade union activities were to be
allowed only at the head offices of the banks, not at their
regional and branch offices, a senior official of the ministry was
quotes as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was not passing any order, but only advising the
banks to fulfill requirement of the law, he said, adding that the
banks had so far been hesitant to take the measure that was needed
to restore discipline and improve their work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Similar reminders would be sent to other nationalized banks so
that trade union activities at their regional and branch offices
would come to a halt by the end of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is considering allowing trade unions
in the country's two export processing zones, and a final decision
is likely to be taken within one year after assessing the whole
situation, The New Nation newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Have Least Access to Health Services: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A large proportion of the
people in Nepal are still deprived of basic health rights and its
percentage of people with access to health services is the lowest
in the South-East Asian Region (SEAR).
</P>
<P>
According to a working paper presented by ex-member of Nepali
National Planning Commission Dr. Bal Baidya, only 10 percent
Nepalese have access to health services, while the percentage in
Indonesia is 43 percent, Myanmar 48 percent, Bangladesh 74
percent, the Maldives and India 75 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 84 percent of the population in Nepal are living
without access to sanitation and 29 percent without access to safe
water.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the daily per capita supply of calories of the
Nepalese is 2,339, comparing to 2,628 in the developing countries
on average.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate in Nepal is only 38 percent, comparing to 54
percent in India, 84 percent in Myanmar, 85 percent in Indonesia,
91 percent in Sri Lanka, 95 percent in Thailand, 96 percent in the
Maldives, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The public expenditure on health in Nepal is 1.2 percent of the
GDP, 2 percent in Thailand, 1.4 percent in Sri Lanka, 1.2 percent
in Bangladesh and 0.7 percent in both India and Indonesia,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, as much as 50 percent of the resources available to
the public health system are being wasted in the sense that they
are not producing the desired outcomes or providing the desired
services, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper was presented Tuesday at a three-day regional
conference of parliamentarians on "Health of Vulnerable
Population" in Kathmandu on November 1-3.

<HEADLINE> Tunnel Makes Travel to Scenic Spot Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A newly-completed tunnel has
made access to the Jiuzhaigou Nature Protection Zone in southwest
China's Sichuan Province safer and easier.
</P>
<P>
The 1,614-meter-long tunnel was dug along the most dangerous
mountain section of the Chengdu-Jiuzhaigou route, where frequent
traffic accidents occur because of narrow roads, steep slopes and
sharp curves.
</P>
<P>
The problem has long been a headache for both local tourism
agencies and travelers.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the Mianyang city government invested 80
million yuan (8.43 million U.S. dollars ) to build the tunnel,
replacing the trans-mountain highway.
</P>
<P>
The 9 meter-wide and 5-meter high tunnel was completed after a
29 months of construction, and was recently opened to traffic.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Expects To Profit From First Year's Buick Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai General Motors Corp.,
a Sino-U.S. joint venture, is expected to realize profits from its
first year of production of Buick sedans, 20,000 of which are
slated to come off the assembly line by year's end, double the
originally planned figure.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers say this is because the company has been
able to allow full play to its production capacity three months
ahead of the time needed by similar GM-funded enterprises in North
America.
</P>
<P>
Also, Shanghai GM is turning out still better-quality Buicks
than those manufactured in North America, according to insiders.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM readjusted its Buick production target several
times, from an original 10,000, to 12,000, then to 18,000, and
finally to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The expanded production is also expected to satisfy the large
number of customers now on the waiting list.

<P>
SHENZHEN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Federal Express
(FedEx) corporation Tuesday initiated a new air-cargo route
between the United States and Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
FedEx's special express delivery zone at Shenzhen's Huangtian
Airport was also opened simultaneously, offering around-the-clock
customs clearance service.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a gathering to mark the start of the service,
David Cunningham, president of FedEx Asia Pacific Division, said
that his company's initiation of air-cargo service to Shenzhen,
one of China's largest export cities, shows FedEx confidence in
China's express delivery market.
</P>
<P>
There will be five flights a week on the new route using DC-10
and MD-11 aircraft, based on an agreement signed by FedEx and
Shenzhen Airport. The new service is expected to benefit both
exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
FedEx began service from the United States to Beijing and
Shanghai in 1996 as the only foreign air freight company with the
right to fly its own aircraft to and from China. Beginning Tuesday,
the number of flights on each route has increased from four to
five a week.

<P>
BELGRADE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The government of Montenegro,
one of the republics of the Yugoslav Federation, Tuesday decided
to adopt the German mark as a parallel currency with the Yugoslav
dinar.
</P>
<P>
Montenegrin Finance Minister Miroslav Ivanissevich announced
the decision at a press conference in the Montenegrin capital of
Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
Montenegrin Prime Minister Filip Vujanovich told parliament on
the same day that the decision was made to protect the economy and
the interests of the people and to avoid the occurrence of
hyperinflation.
</P>

The decision has sparked criticisms from the opposition.
Momccilo Vuccetich, a deputy of the Socialist People's Party in
parliament, said the decision is unconstitutional and represents "
a typical act of secession".

<P>
YANGON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is launching a market
boat services between the capital of Yangon and the second largest
city of Mandalay in the north to enable people in towns and
villages on the Ayeyawaddy River banks to buy goods produced in
northern and southern parts of the country at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
A boat named Myananda, carrying 1,400 tons of goods, departed
from the Yangon Nanthida Port Tuesday and is now on its sale trips
along the river, official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With two barges, the ship is carrying foodstuff such as rice,
salt and fish paste, personal and household goods and other
general merchandise, and will stop at 18 towns along the river
during its 45-day journey.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been operating such kind of boat sales services
since January 1993 and this is the 67th sales trip of the
Myananda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beginning June this year, sales boats of its kind
are also plying between Mandalay and Bhamo, the northern most part

<HEADLINE> Worldwide LAN Semiconductor Market to Reach 3.3 Billion Dollars in 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide semiconductor
revenues within local area networking (LAN) equipment segments
this year will grow by 14.8 percent from 1998 to 2.6 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Increased competitive price pressures combined with significant
chip integration will continue to influence the future of the LAN
semiconductor market, said the report from the U.S. market
research firm, International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
LAN equipment includes routers, switches and network interface
cards, also known as network adapters.
</P>
<P>
IDC projected that the total worldwide market will reach 2.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1999 and then slowly level off in growth,
posting 3.3 billion dollars in revenues in 2003, a 5.1 percent
compound annual growth rate through the forecast period.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Fast Ethernet switch chips will become the
primary driver, accounting for 50.7 percent of total LAN
semiconductor revenues in 2003. Fast Ethernet is a high-speed
version of Ethernet, a shared media LAN.
</P>
<P>
Adoption of lower-cost standard products over customized in-
house silicon designs will remain a key issue for networking
original equipment manufacturers to examine in the future, IDC
said. The push to produce more intelligent LAN systems to spark
the convergence of data, voice and video traffic remains at an all-
time high.
</P>
<P>
In the end, IDC believes the penetration of semiconductor
standard products will become a major force in the industry as
several key chip technologies integrate into one another along
with higher layer networking functionality.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras overcame the
rustiness from the absence of over one month before saving three
match points to beat Spainiard Francisco Clavet at the second
round of the Paris Open on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The American, who has not played since injuring his right hip
flexor in a match in Indianapolis on August 20, took two hours and
two minutes for the 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) victory.
</P>
<P>
The former world No.1 seemed to head out of the event as he was
serving at 5-6, when Clavet had three match points in the final
set.
</P>
<P>
But twice the Spaniard hit weakly into the net and on his third
match point had no answer to a powerful backhand volley from the
American.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, seeded five, failed to break a jinx
over Russian teenager Marat Safin who powered to score a 7-6 (7-4),
3-6, 7-6 (7-4) win in round two.

<HEADLINE> State Budget Safe: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will no longer face
serious problems with its budget after the complete auditor's
report on Bank Bali scandal was disclosed to the public and the
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was
resumed.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance
and Industry Kwik Kian Gie after attending a ministerial
coordination meeting here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is okay. The state budget is no longer a problem,"
Kwik Kian Gie was quoted by the Antara News Agency Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kwik Kian Gie had said the 1999-2000 state budget
ending March next year was in a deficit and budget planning for
the next fiscal year had been disturbed following the suspension
of aid from the IMF after the international aid body assessed the
government as not serious in settling the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's loans, as well as support from the World Bank and
other donors, were halted in the middle of September after the
previous administration declined to release the full audit because
of restrictions of the banking secrecy code.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout for
Indonesia. The fund has a commitment to provide 12.3 billion
dollars, of which some 10 billion dollars has been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has been insisting on the full disclosure of the
Pricewaterhouse Cooper's report as a condition for the resumption
of its aid.
</P>
<P>
With the disclosure of the Australia-based international
auditor's report, Kwik Kian Gie said, talks on Indonesia's
economic recovery program with the IMF could be resumed.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is settled, socio-political conditions are stable
and the budget is no longer a problem. Food supply is also
sufficient," he said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting IMF's Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss welcomed the
disclosure of the report.
</P>
<P>
"We'll study the report carefully ... and I'm sure that the
government will take necessary follow-up measures so that such a
case does not recur, and will take legal action," he said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Neiss, whose visit is scheduled to last until Friday, said a
technical team from the IMF was expected to arrive in Jakarta next
week to discuss the best way to disburse the loans.
</P>
<P>
The audit discloses the transfers of funds from the 546 billion
rupiah (78 million dollars) 'booty' involved in the scandal to a
number of politically well-connected business people, close aids
of former president B.J. Habibie and the former ruling Golkar
Party.
</P>
<P>
The audit also recommends further investigation of Bank
Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin, former finance minister
Bambang Subianto and former state minister of the empowerment of
state enterprises Tanri Abeng.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Budget Surplus to Hit 95.5 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin indicated Tuesday that the country's budgetary surplus
could hit 95.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 64.97 billion US
dollars) in five years, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Martin was quoted as telling the Finance Committee in London,
Ontario, that some 67 billion Canadian dollars (some 45.58 billion
dollars) is up for grabs, while 28.5 billion (over 19.39 billion
dollars) will be in contingency padding.
</P>
<P>
Without counting contingency reserves, Martin projected a
surplus of 5.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.74 billion
dollars) for the fiscal year of 2000-2001, 8.5 billion (over 5.78
billion dollars) for 2001-2002, 12.5 billion (nearly 8.5 billion
dollars) for 2002-2003, 17.5 billion (over 11.9 billion dollars)
for 2003-2004 and 23 billion (some 15.65 billion dollars) for 2004-
2005.
</P>
<P>
The minister was giving his annual economic update to kick off
pre-budget consultations.
</P>
<P>
"The great debate is underway as to how to use these surplus,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He promised a multi-year plan for tax cuts, which will be the
second highest among G-7 countries. The debt swallows 27 cents of
every dollar in federal spending, but it has shrunk from 36 cents
in the 1995-1996 fiscal year, he said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Continues Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC basket
of seven crudes kept rising last week up to a high of 21.62 U.S.
dollars per barrel, continuing the rebound trend started the
previous week of 21.37 dollars, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This happened thanks to OPEC leaders' recent intention of
extending the production-cutting policy which will expire next
March as well as the increased market demand of heating fuel in
the current winter.
</P>
<P>
In September, OPEC oil price rose quickly to 22.17 dollars
because its member countries had strictly implemented the
agreement reached by their oil ministers in March on production
cutting aimed at shoring up the price.
</P>
<P>
In October, it slightly went down to 21.63 dollars, though
still above the organization's benchmark of 21 dollars. Analysts
attributed the drop to rumors of excessive production by some OPEC
members as well as sufficient stockpiles in major consumers.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, OPEC oil price started sliding, because of
global over supply and economic recessions in regions, until
February this year to touch 9.5 dollars, even lower than the 1998
meager level of 12.28 dollars.

"Otherwise, the risk would be a rise in interest rates and a

Although some prices increased "abnormally", the prime minister

The independent advice group would provide advice to Cohen in a

report on the matter, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
When asked about possible immunity to veterans of the Korean

"The only decision is to move forward as quickly as possible
with a thorough, far-reaching investigation," he said.

The seven members of the advice group include Donald Gregg,
former ambassador to South Korea, Pete McCloskey, former
California Republican Representative, Korean War veteran, Rober
Riscassi, former commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, Ernest
May, professor of history at Harvard University, Young Kim, former

<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Leeds manager David O'Leary is
on a collision course with FIFA after his defiant insistence that
Harry Kewell will not be allowed to play in two friendlies for
Australia later this month.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, football's world governing body, have confirmed that
Soccer Australia have grounds for an appeal to force Leeds to
release their star midfielder.
</P>
<P>
Kewell has admitted he is "gutted" he will miss out on the
first match, against Brazil, with the friendlies coinciding with a
10-day break while England and Scotland meet in the Euro 2000 play-
offs.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old was especially keen to play in the game against
Ronaldo and Co on November 14 as it is being held in his home town
of Sydney and is also Frank Farina's first game as national coach.
</P>
<P>
An adamant O'Leary said: "I am sorry to disappoint the
Australian nation, I am sorry to disappoint the player and sorry
to disappoint his family, who would have been looking forward to
seeing their son back on home soil.
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line is that Harry is a young player and I've
got to look after him. It's only the beginning of November and
already we are having a very hard season.
</P>
<P>
"Harry will one day be a truly great player and it's my duty to
help him along that path.
</P>
<P>
"Harry and his manager (Farina) will argue that the match has
come during a lull in the Premiership, this time because of the
Euro 2000 qualifier between England and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"But it's my view that it is the ideal opportunity for him to
have a well-earned rest."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, O'Leary added: "The
game places extraordinary demands on top players and we must take
care of them."

<HEADLINE> Villeneuve Threats to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Formula One driver Jacques
Villeneuve is threatening to quit struggling Formula One outfit
British American Racing if team boss Craig Pollock is ousted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian former world champion is a close friend of Pollock
who may be forced to take the rap for the team's desperate season,
when BAR failed to score a point and finish in last place.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Scot Pollock could be the main victim.
BAR vice-chairman Adrian Reynard said: "The directors want to see
changes in the team from the top to the bottom, so that we can
improve our performances and prove to Honda that we're a credible
team."
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, believed to receive around 7.5 million pounds a
year, warned: "A big reason for me joining the team was because
Craig was instigating it. So he's a key element for me remaining
in the team."
</P>
<P>
Pollock, meanwhile, has said he is comfortable with his
position but added: "I strongly believe that there is never smoke
without fire.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody in our organization is fueling the fire because it
serves him to do that. It's not my problem; it's his."

<HEADLINE> Peru, Colombia to Discuss Possession of Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Colombia will discuss the
territorial possession of three islands in the Amazon river, the
natural border between the two countries next year, said sources
from the Peruvian Foreign Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mixed commission formed by the two countries, in its second
meeting in March, will take on the theme of the islands of
Patrullero, Vamos and Korea, which are void of territorial
demarcation, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Due to diastrophism of the riverbed, the islands appeared in
1929, when the two countries signed an agreement which defined the
territorial possession of other islands in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Amazon river is the most opulent in the world, as well as
the longest (6,762 kilometers) and the widest (between 20 and 50
kilometers depending on the season).

<P>
SANTIAGO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes reiterated Tuesday that no Spaniard has the
authority to investigate crimes committed inside a Latin American
country.
</P>
<P>
Valdes made the statement after he was informed that Spanish
judge Baltasar Garzon had indicted Argentine officers for linkage
with former military dictatorship in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
Garzon is expected to issue arrest warrants against many on the
indictment list, including the members of the military juntas that
ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983, as well as military chiefs
involved in alleged abuses during that period.
</P>
<P>
The same judge has been investigating the alleged killings of
Spanish citizens during former Chilean leader August Pinochet's
rule from 1973 to 1990, aiming to try the general on charges of
genocide, kidnapping, torture and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Judge Garzon nor any other Spanish judge has the
authority to investigate crimes committed by Latin Americans
against Latin Americans in Latin America," said the Chilean
foreign minister.

QUITO,, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's southern border with
Peru is in a state of emergency, because 9,726 residents in the
province of El Oro have been infected by malaria during the first
ten months of the year, official resources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the infected, 5,631 correspond to the Falciparu type and 4,
095 to the Vivax type.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the World Bank, in this border
region 85 per 1,000 inhabitants have contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the high incident rate in the region is due to
the daily passage of people between Huaquillas in Ecuador and
Aguas Verdes of Peru, and a high presence of the infecting
anopheles mosquitoes.

XINING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A new forest covering over 1,400
hectares of land will be created in Xining, capital of northwest
China's Qinghai Province, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The new forest will increase the city's forest coverage to 20
percent from 14 percent at present when it is completed, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of more than 14.8 million yuan ( 1.8 million
U.S. dollars), the forest will also help prevent soil erosion in
more than 170,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As the largest industrial city on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River, Xining has long suffered from draught and soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
The local government has made great afforestation efforts in
the city, and last month a forest of 1,400 hectares was completed
at a cost of 8 million yuan.

BUENOS AIRES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese iron and steel
company NKK and Argentina's Siderca have created a joint venture
to expand their competitiveness in the world market, said a
spokesman for NKK Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new company, formed by the two world-wide giants in
seamless pipes, will begin functioning in the first quarter of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Siderca will have a 51 percent holding in the company, offering
its world-wide commerce network, and NKK the remaining 49 percent,
sharing with Siderca its technology.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be part of the Techint group, the world
leader in the production of seamless pipes, to which Siderca also
belongs, along with the Italian company, Dalmie, Tamsa of Mexico,
and the Venezuelan company, Sidor.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the initiative of NKK was taken because the
Japanese iron and steel industry is going through a difficult
period of reorganization, due to its excess productive capacity
and high costs.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Signs Multi-Year Contract with Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks on
Tuesday signed three-time all-star player Latrell Sprewell to a
multi-year contract in New York.
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but several reports in
recent days have reported Sprewell agreed to a five-year contract
worth 61.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful to be staying in New York," Sprewell said. "
Since I got here, the fans have supported me and made me feel
welcome. I hope to be part of the team that brings a championship
back to New York."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell, 29, will earn nine million U.S. dollars this season
before the extension kicks in. If he terminates the deal after
four years, Sprewell's package would be worth more than 47 million.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for Latrell," said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy. "He
has earned this contract by his outstanding play and was an
integral part of our team's success."
</P>
<P>
Over a week ago, Knicks management met with Sprewell and his
agent, Robert Gist, and offered him the maximum allowed under the
collective bargaining agreement with the option of length of
contract, up to five years.
</P>
<P>
Less than two years ago, Sprewell was suspended from the NBA
for attacking former Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo.
After serving his one-year suspension, Sprewell was traded to the
Knicks. Although he arrived in New York as a national pariah,
Sprewell quickly became the team's most popular player with the
fans, who relished his up-tempo style.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell was not happy with his role off the bench as a sixth
man small forward during the lockout-shortened season, but became
a starter in the postseason when the Knicks reached the Finals.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell averaged 16.4 points and 4.2 rebounds in 37 games with
the Knicks, missing time with a stress fracture in his right heel.
In 20 postseason games, he averaged a team-high 20.4 points and 4.
8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell spent the first six years of his career with Golden
State and averaged a career-beast 24.2 points in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> German Teams Crashed Out on Bad Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) - It was not a night for two German
teams as both Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen failed to
make the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund, European champions three season ago, went out after
losing 1-0 to Boavista in Portugal -- a result that condemned them
when coupled with Feyenoord's win.
</P>
<P>
Feyenoord, who had drawn their previous five Group C matches,
grabbed the second place as they edged Rosenborg Trondheim 1-0 at
home with an 85th minute goal from Brazilian substitute Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Rosenborg finished first with 11 points, followed by Feyenoord
(8), Borussia Dortmund (6) and Boavista (5).
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen also wrapped up third as they were held by Maribor
Teatanic of Slovenia to a 0-0 home draw.
</P>
<P>
The tie left Leverkusen drawing with Dynamo Kiev on seven
points each after the  Ukrainian side crashed to a 1-0 home
defeat to Group A winners Lazio.
</P>
<P>
But Kiev, semi-finalist last year, advanced for better head-to-
head record between the two after drawing 1-1 in Germany and
winning 4-2 in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Lazio finished unbeaten with 14 points in first place, ahead of
Kiev and Leverkusen on seven and Maribor on four.
</P>
<P>
The consolation for the two Germany teams are Friday's draw for
the third round of the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin are two more German teams who
have the chance to advance to the final 16 but they could miss out
as well if the results of Wednesday's games don't go their way.
Bayern, last season's losing finalist, must beat Glasgow Rangers
while Hertha needs at least a point at Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
While other teams suffered agonies of elimination, Barcelona
and Fiorentina who had already made sure of their places in the
second phase from Group B, enjoyed a celebratory night with a 3-3
draw in Florence.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona finished top with 14 points, followed by Fiorentina (
9), Arsenal (8) and AIK Stockholm (1).
</P>
<P>
Arsenal ended their disappointing campaign with a 3-2 win over
AIK in Stockholm where Marc Overmars scored twice for Arsenal and
Andreas Andersson scored both AIK's goals.
</P>
<P>
European champions Manchester United took first place in Group
D after their 2-1 home win over Sturm Graz thanks to goals from
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.
</P>
<P>
But Graz were happy at the end after grabbing a UEFA Cup spot
from the reach of Croatia Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Olympique Marseille, the other qualifiers from the group,denied
Zagreb their UEFA Cup consolation by equalising in the last minute
to force a 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
That meant United finished on 13 points, Marseille 10, Sturm
Graz 6 and Croatia Zagreb were last with five.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the competition ends on Wednesday with the
final matches in Groups E, F, G and H.

<P>
NANJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The development zones in east
China's Jiangsu Province, one of the country's economic
powerhouses, have become new growth areas for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the 80 state and provincial
development zones, established since 1985, have had a combined
total of 33,452 enterprises, including 5,775 overseas-funded
businesses, with combined contractual overseas investment of 32.56
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These development zones reported 215.7 billion yuan in business
revenues in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of the overseas investors, 114 are among the world's top 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute this growth mainly to an improved
business environment in the zones.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 14 years, the province has used more than 37
billion yuan in energy, transport, telecommunications, and other
infrastructure facilities, including the Shanghai-Nanjing

<HEADLINE> Action Against Social Exclusion Urged In Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- European Anti-Poverty (EAPN)
will hold a meeting next week in Helsinki on the theme of "Social
exclusion in Europe: Time for Action - National and European
policies to combat poverty and social exclusion".
</P>
<P>
The idea is to provide a forum for the exchange of information
and experience, as well as an opportunity to discuss how these
national policies could relate to proposed European Union (EU)
action in this field, said the European Report, one of the EU
publications.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some EU countries have embarked on a review of
their policies to combat poverty and social exclusion. The
policies have several features in common, the Report said.
</P>
<P>
They make the fight against poverty and social exclusion a
"national priority"; they rely on integrated strategies, aiming at
tackling the multidimensional face of poverty and social
exclusion; they endeavor to strengthen partnership between
different actors and to involve those who are experiencing poverty
and social exclusion, according to the Report.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Helsinki conference aims to provide a forum to
discuss and exchange information and experience in this area
between different types of actors: national administrations, local
authorities, social partners and non-governmental organizations,
it said.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said the 15-nation bloc would soon put forward
proposals in this field after the Helsinki conference on November
8 and 9.

negotiated settlement with France to end the beef dispute was not
a climbdown.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a climbdown not at all... They have raised a
number of issues they want to explore and we will explain those
elements," a Reuters report quoted an Agriculture Ministry
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The comments were made after Britain's agriculture minister
Nick Brown and his French counterpart Jean Glavany agreed in
Brussels that scientific experts should study five areas in
efforts to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
British farmers and the Conservatives have reacted with
surprise and anger at the new compromise with France.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives accused that the Labor was "caving in" to
"totally unjustified demands" from France.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are under intense pressure to resolve
the dispute which has soured relations between London and Paris
and led to some British shops boycotting French goods.

CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

rejected a republic, News Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive
Rupert Murdoch said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Lifts Interest Rates First Time in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) Wednesday lifted interest rates for the first time in over
five years.
</P>
<P>
The quarter of a percent rise was exactly as expected by
financial markets, although many commentators are predicting a
second identical rise within months.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank said it acted now because the economy was
growing faster than expected, and inflation was likely to continue
to grow over the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian economy is growing faster than the bank or most
other forecasters had expected," RBA governor Ian Macfarlane said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time inflation has now returned to the 2-3 percent
target zone, after a lengthy period below target."
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the rate hike was
not a blow to his government's economic credentials, but was a
piece of fine tuning by the Reserve Bank.

The Dow index closed down 66.52 at 10,581.84, expanding its

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned over Congo Military Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States
expressed concern on Tuesday over reports of military movements
in the Democratic Republic of Congo and said this violated
the Lusaka peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is deeply concerned by reports of military
preparations, including the movement of troops and material by
forces on both (government and rebel) sides," the State Department
said.
</P>
<P>
The Congo government of President Laurent Kabil, with the
help from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, has been engaging war
with rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
In August, the six governments and the rebels agreed in Lusaka,
Zambia, to a ceasefire and peace plan, envisaging a national
dialogue, deployment of peacekeepers, creation of a new national
army and withdrawal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Washington said the reports of military movements violated
the Lusaka agreement and said these military movements were
"provocative and risk being used as a pretext for the resumption
of fighting."
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns any violation of this accord and
we will hold responsible any government or rebel organization
that violates the accord," the State Department said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> E.Timor Troops Transfer Expected by February: Downer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The multinational force
for East Timor, called INTERFET, is expected to handover its
peace-keeping mission to a United Nations operation by February,
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Downer, whose country is leading the INTERFET composed of more
than a dozen countries and numbering some 8,000 troops, said the
target date for the handover "will be somewhere between
mid-January and early February."
</P>
<P>
Downer, on his way to Washington to voice Austalia's concern
over the U.S. Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty, stopped in New York and met U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other officials, focusing on East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference at U.N. Headquarters that Australia
would cut its contribution from the current 5,000 troops to the
INTERFET to some 1,700 to the U.N. operation which was authorized
by the Security Council late October to total 9,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET was previously mandated by the council to restore
peace and security in East Timor where a referendum on August 30
resulted in independence instead of broad autonomy within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET began to be deployed on September 20 to quell
violence and chaos following the announcement of the referendum
result.
</P>
<P>
The council said the INTERFET's mandate should transfer to a
U.N. peace-keeping operation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to set up a U.N. Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to take charge of overall
affairs for the territory in a period of two to three years before
its full independence. The military component is a major pillar of
the UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia would not mind who will lead the U.N.
operation, but in any case it would give its support to the
peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he and Annan agreed that "there should be a
seamless transition" between the INTERFET and the U.N. operation.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET reported Monday that since its deployment the
security situation in East Timor has improved "dramatically" with
more refugees returning to East Timor from West Timor and "the
conditions are approaching a time" to hand over to the UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
It takes some time for the U.N. to prepare for the formation of
the operation mostly because it needs to raise funds. U.N.
officials put the UNTAET costs at 700 million to 1 billion U.S.
dollars for the first year of its operation alone.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Forces Destroy Electricity Towers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Tuesday blew up two
electricity towers close to the municipality of Arboleda in the
province of North Santander, said military sources.
</P>
<P>
The flow of electricity was cut off in the zone for a number of
hours, close to the Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
The act was attributed to the Mariscal Antonio Jose de Sucre
battalion of the FARC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bomb exploded on the same day without claiming any
victims in the entrance to a Colombian town hall.
</P>
<P>
The explosion destroyed 80 percent of the town hall and caused
damage to nearby buildings, said a local police spokesman in
Curumani, 900 kilometers to the north of Santafe de Bogota.
</P>
<P>
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion, but
authorities are attributing it to the rebel National Liberation
Army (ELN), the second largest rebel group within the country.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the largest rebel group in Colombia, followed by
the ELN and the smaller one, the People's Liberation Army (EPL).
</P>
<P>
Colombian people have already been fed up with the decades-long
armed conflict, which has left some 400,000 dead and caused huge
material losses for the Latin American country.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Eastern Province Can Play Important Role In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his belief Tuesday that the Eastern Province of Saudi
Arabia can play an important role in advancing Sino-Saudi
cooperation in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting here with Prince Mohamad, governor of the
Eastern Province, Jiang noted that the region is an important oil
industrial base where the country's famous oil companies and
institutions are located, and is convenient in terms of transport
as it is near the sea.
</P>
<P>
He praised the province for its contribution to the rise of the
Saudi economy and for providing a large number of professionals
for the country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that oil cooperation is an important
aspect of Sino-Saudi relationship. He added that the two countries
agreed to establish strategic cooperation in the sector of oil
during Crown Prince Abdul Aziz's visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Jiang said, he held in-depth discussions
with Saudi leaders on bilateral cooperation in the oil sector,
which produced positive results.
</P>
<P>
Prince Mohamad said that although the time of Jiang's visit to
Saudi Arabia is short, it is a fruitful visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the memorandum of understanding on oil cooperation
signed during Jiang's visit is good news, which will help advance
the development of the Eastern Province as well as the growth of
the relations between the region and China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate Calls for Industrial Nations' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official Tuesday
in Bonn called on the wealthy nations to ratify the Kyoto protocol
"as soon as possible" and "without any new term".
</P>
<P>
At the U.N. Fifth session of the Conference of the Parties of
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP5), Liu Jiang, deputy
chief of Chinese State Development Planning Commission, said the
industrial nations should fulfil their commitment to reduce or
restrict emissions of greenhouse gas, transfer technology and
provide developing countries with financial helps as stipulated in
Kyoto protocol.
</P>
<P>
The conference should seek all the meassures that accord with
the different conditions of different country to tackle the
climate change, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto protocol, passed by the COP3 in November 1997 in the
Japanese city, has so far not been ratified by any industrial
nation.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which commits the wealthy nations to cut their
overall emissions until 2012 by 5 percent compared to 1990 levels,
will become international law only after it is ratified by at
least 55 nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said in an earlier letter to
the conference that Kyoto protocol must go into effect before year
2002.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said the COP5 was aimed to make preparation for
the next round, and crucial decisions would be left for COP6
scheduled for year 2000 in The Hague, the Netherlands, since most
developed countries were unwilling to ratify the protocol.
</P>
<P>
At the minister-level negotiations of the conference, Liu also
said few developed countries were "sincerely" ready to restrict
their greenhouse emissions, while in most of them the emissions
were rising.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most wealthy countries were unwilling to provide
developing nations with technical and financial aid, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu accused some developed countries of trying to commit the
developing countries to cut the emissions of greenhouse gas.
</P>
<P>
Top tasks of the developing countries were to develop the
economy and improve people's living standard, and they could not
restrict emissions before they were able to afford any measures,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China, as world's largest developing nation, was also unable to
afford the commitment before its economy reaches the level of
medium-developed country, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
China's ability to commit the Convention will be weakened
unless the wealthy nations provide it with technical and financial
help, Liu warned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Bonds Being Sold Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Department
Tuesday launched a new Internet site through which Americans can
buy U.S. Savings Bonds anytime they want.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Savings Bond Connection web site gives
Internet users the option of buying savings bonds online from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to boost bond sales by making it easier
for people to buy them. It also hopes the venture will attract new
investors, such as those who spend a lot of time in cyberspace,
and encourage Americans to save more.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be of concern to any observer in the American
economy that personal savings are today lower than they have been
in half a century," said Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
"Americans have relied on savings bonds for decades as an
important tool in their efforts to save for their future," Summers
said. "By bringing savings bonds as close as your home computer,
this program makes it more convenient for millions of Americans to
add to their savings."
</P>
<P>
Approximately 55 million Americans own savings bonds worth 185
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Series EE bonds, which sell for half their face
value, will be available in denominations ranging from 50 dollars
to 1,000 dollars. Series I bonds, which carry a lower interest
rate but are adjusted to reflect inflation, will be sold in 50
dollars to 500 dollars in denominations.
</P>
<P>
To buy bonds online, a purchaser goes to www.savingsbonds.gov
and clicks on the Savings Bond Connection. Online buyers provide
information, including name, Social Security number and mailing
address, just as when they purchase bonds from banks and other
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Bonds bought on the Internet must be purchased by credit card.
For now, only MasterCard and Visa will be accepted.
