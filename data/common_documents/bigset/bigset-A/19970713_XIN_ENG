<HEADLINE> SDP Leader Blasts Dispatch of Evacuation Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party
leader Takako Doi today blasted the government for using military
planes for possible airlift of Japanese nationals from Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ordered by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, three C-130 cargo
planes of the Air Self-Defense Forces have arrived in Thailand and
will stand by there to carry out an evacuation mission if needed.
</P>
<P>
Doi challenged the legality of the government decision, said a
Kyodo news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "preparatory actions" that the government has
claimed as grounds for the dispatching, Doi said: "There is
nothing written about preparatory actions in the Self-Defense Law."
</P>
<P>
When the law was revised in 1994, she said, there was a "big
discussion" on the need to prevent the evacuation of Japanese from
leading to the dispatch of military forces overseas.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, however, argued that the deployment of
Japan's military planes for evacuations abroad became possible
under the 1994 revision of the Self-Defense Law.
</P>
<P>
Doi expressed displeasure with Hashimoto, who she said gave no
advance notice on the evacuation mission, to her party, a
coalition partner of Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"My party has not been informed of the move and no discussions
have been made on the matter," Kyodo quoted Doi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, where hundreds of Japanese are staying, was on the
verge of a civil war after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen deposed
First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh by force.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed in Flood in South Bangladesh Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed today
in south Bangladesh while the overall flood situation worsened
further following incessant rainfall along with on rush of hilly
water, according to official news agency Bangladesh Sangbad
Sangstha (BSS).
</P>
<P>
With the reports of ten fresh deaths, the death toll rose to 42
in the on-going flood, which has turned most parts of Bangladesh
as an inundated area, leaving millions of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
In Bandarban, one of the southern hill districts, nine people,
six of them belonging to one family, were killed today in a
landslide in Lama county.
</P>
<P>
The victim family was killed when a big chunk of mud collapsed
on their house while the three other people were killed in another
landslide in Kalagata hills, local police said.
</P>
<P>
The district administration said some 60,000 people were
affected and 2,000 thatched houses were damaged as heavy onrush of
water from the hills inundated six counties of Bandarban district.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least one person was killed, and an unspecified
number of people were injured in the flash flood which also caused
disruption of road communications at many places in Bangladesh's
largest port city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
According to an official handout, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
today directed the armed forces to take all necessary steps to
tackle the current flood situation.
</P>
<P>
The army stationed in Chittagong has already sent 800 kilograms
of biscuits to Bandarban district as emergency relief from its own
resources while air force helicopters have also been operating
relief activities as road communication were disrupted.

<HEADLINE> Nine Injured in Renewed Violence in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- At least nine Palestinian
youths were injured today by Israeli soldiers in renewed clashes
in the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Hebron said that masked Palestinian youths
attacked with rocks and firebombs the Israeli troops stationed
inside an Arab school, where a torn copy of Islam's holy Koran
was found early this week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians held the Israeli soldiers responsible for tearing
the Koran and responded with more violence. This incident added
fuel to the already tense situation sparked by the offensive
leaflets depicting Islamic prophet Mohammed as a pig, pasted by a
Jewish woman from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers returned rubber bullets and tear gas, injuring
at least nine Palestinian protesters. Jewish settlers also joined
in the clashes, throwing back rocks from roof-tops.
</P>
<P>
A firebomb was thrown at Israeli soldiers Friday night, but no
one was injured. This morning, Israeli soldiers dismantled a
home-made pipe bomb planted near the division line between the
Arab and Jewish quarters.
</P>
<P>
After redeploying troops from 80 percent of Hebron in
accordance with an agreement signed in January, Israel retains
control over the other 20 percent where some 450 Jewish settlers
are living.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since
March when Israel began building the controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian National Authority
(PA) is demanding a halt to the settlement activities before the
peace process can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued clashes in Hebron, there was a positive
sign for reconciliation between Israel and the PNA: Israel
announced today that the two sides would resume talks Sunday to
discuss cooperation in the construction of a Palestinian airport
in Dahaniya, Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Israeli and Palestinian officials
toured the building site on Friday. Israel is insisting on its
right to share the security control over the airport for fears
that weapons might be smuggled in to threaten its security.
</P>
<P>
If the disputes over the airport can be resolved and safe
passages for Palestinians to travel between West Bank and Gaza
Strip opened, observers here believe, it will pave the way for
resuming the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Unions Press Renault on Layoff Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators for French automaker
Renault SA and representatives of Belgian trade unions disagreed
Friday over the text of a take-it-or-leave-it layoff plan for
blue-collar workers at the carmaker's Belgian plant.
</P>
<P>
The 2,700 blue-collar workers at the Vilvoorde plant near
Brussels are to vote Thursday on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Renault reached an agreement earlier Friday with trade unions
for around 400 white-collar workers, about 15 percent of the work
force, that included more severance pay than Renault initially
offered.
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar unions, holding out for a similar package,
threatened to block a Renault car plant in France. They also said
that they wanted a firm commitment from Renault to save a total of
600 jobs at the plant.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation remains like this, I fear the worst," said
Georges Jacquemijn, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Renault plans to close the plant by the end of this year as
part of a plan to cut costs.

Sudan State Minister at the Foreign Affairs Mostapha Osman Ismail

to restore brotherly and normal ties" with Kuwait.
</P>

of Iraq during the Gulf crisis in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said, "we took the opportunity to visit
our brothers in Kuwait to underscore that our policy will be
based firmly and strongly on perpetual support for Kuwait and
its causes."
</P>
<P>
He also said, "we will do whatever possible to secure the
release of all the prisoners still held by the Iraqi regime."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that more than 600 Kuwaitis were still jailed in
Iraq and used every forum and opportunity to call on the
international community to press Iraq to give them freedom. Iraq
so far has given files of more than 100 Kuwaitis who were caught
in the period of Iraqi occupation and being detained in Baghdad,
but denied Kuwaiti allegations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ismail was received by Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah to whom he delivered a letter from
Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. The contents of the letter was
not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say the message is the first contact on the
level of the state leadership between the two countries since the
Gulf war and heralded a possible start of a slow reconciliation
process.
</P>
<P>
Ismail also held talks with Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad and described his meeting
was "successful and a step on the road towards the normalization
of relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, an agreement between Kuwait and Sudan
was made to start exchanging visits soon of non-political
delegations as a first step towards restoration of full ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently represented in Sudan by a Charge D'Affaires
while the Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait has been closed for more
than six years.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait accelerated the process of reconciling relations with
Arab countries including Sudan, Yemen, Jordan and the
Palestinians which supported Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991
that liberated the small oil-rich Gulf state from Iraqi
occupation.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Says Return to Army Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said today that the French nation should retain the right
of returning to army draft, and said that he would propose to
parliament a new bill on the reform of army.
</P>
<P>
"Without idealizing what was the former military service, one
should breathe the spirit of defense in a democratic country which
is not subjected to an immediate threat, but is concerned about
its international responsibilities," said Richard in a speech to
members of a military academy in Cergy-Pontoise northwest of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac decided in late 1995 to
professionalize the French army and stop the 200-year practice of
army draft in France.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that the "strategic data" which led France to
professionalize its army is not "eternal".
</P>
<P>
He also said that professionalization of the army is "a choice
not suffered by wanted" by France, which has seen the threat on
its European frontier "moving away but not inevitably
disappearing."

Friday proposed an exchange and training program for officials
working with border control, immigration and asylum.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, EU commissioner for justice and home affairs,

<P>
"We have to make sure that customs, police and judicial
authorities in all member states work together and understand each
other," Gradin emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The training will reportedly focus on instructors and
specialists especially decision makers and those in charge of
training.
</P>
<P>
There will be an exchange program for officials between
national administrative departments. The Odysseus also comprises
production of teaching material and circulation of information.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM Haughey to Testify at Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey is expected to testify later next week at a
payments-to-politicians tribunal investigating the case of Haughey
receiving a large sum of cash from an Irish tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Dennis McCullough, counsel for the tribunal, told the tribunal
in April that Haughey received 1.3 million Irish pounds (about 2
million U.S. dollars) from businessman Ben Dunne between 1987 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
Haughey, who had been Irish prime minister between 1979 and
1992, last week issued a statement through his legal team,
admitting for the first time that he was the recipient of the cash
and he also admitted misleading his lawyers, said reports from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who came to power after
winning a June 6 general election, is now facing increasing
opposition pressure to set up another tribunal to investigate
Haughey's case alone.
</P>
<P>
Ahern made it clear last week that the current tribunal would
have to run its course, but said he was keeping an "open mind"
about any new investigation into one of the most powerful
political figures in Irish politics since self-rule seven decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
Irish businessman Dunne had earlier admitted that he gave
Haughey the money in the form of three bank drafts of about 70,000
pounds (about 112,000 dollars), but he stressed that he never
expected "any favor or benefit" from the former prime minister.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military authorities have decided to
tighten the screws against Palestinian resistance, the state-run
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is preparing for a possible
escalation of violence in the Palestinian territories and,
particularly, further deterioration of situation in the West Bank
city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The move came after weeks of violent demonstrations and
protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip resulted from Jewish

Muhammad as a pig set off a wave of violent clashes between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in Hebron.

progress during the talk that would continue tomorrow while
Plavsic remained silent.
</P>

The meeting was held when Plavsic was battling Bosnian Serb
hard-liners who see her as too moderate. She has been the only
senior Serb official to advocate closer compliance with the Dayton
accords and has accused the hard-line leadership of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Asks To Implement Open-ended Grain Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Zhu Rongji, speaking
to a three-day meeting on grain purchase and sales Friday, urged
government offices nationwide to be strict in implementing the
state grain purchase policy that says local governments should buy
grain at protective prices from growers in an "open-ended" way.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held July 9-11 and was attended by heads of
ministries and senior agricultural officials from all provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China, said, "The policy is an important decision of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State
Council for favorable agricultural development and the sustained,
speedy and sound development of the overall national economy."
</P>
<P>
The policy says that the state grain system must purchase grain
at subsidized prices and that state buyers can not reject, stop,
or limit grain purchase, or pay farmers with IOUs.
</P>
<P>
It also says that financial institutions should ensure
sufficient funds for this, and prohibits the use of this capital
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Li Lanqing, a member of Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, spoke at the opening session of the
meeting, which was presided over by Luo Gan, state councillor and
secretary-general of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to harvest 118 billion kg of grain this
summer, a 3.5 percent increase, or four billion kg, more than in

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Agree to Accelerate Modification of CFE Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny
Primakov said today that Russia and the United States have agreed
to speed up the modification of the Treaty of Conventional Forces
in Europe (CFE).
</P>
<P>
After holding three hours of talks with visiting U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in St.Petersburg, Primakov told
reporters that both countries were interested in updating the CFE
Treaty and "agreed to hold further talks before the end of July."
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. cannot impose their decisions on other
signatories to the CFE Treaty, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
However, the decisions may give an impulse to the updating
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the prevailing situation in Bosnia, Primakov said both
Russia and the U.S. have agreed to consistently promote the
implementation of the Dayton agreements.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure this, joint projects on the economic unification of
the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation into one state
must be discussed," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Primakov said that Russia and
the U.S. would take advantage of their influences in the world to
make joint efforts to have the peace process kept moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and the U.S. planned to play a more active role in
mediation among the rivals in Middle East, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov admitted that Russia and the U.S. had different
views on the entry of the Baltic countries into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes the entry of the Baltic countries into NATO, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
But it is necessary to set up a security system for the Baltic
countries, he said, adding that the system can be sponsored by
Russia or jointly sponsored by Russia and the Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Primakov, Albright arrived in
St. Petersburg on Saturday on a two-day visit to Russia before her
visit to Lithuania, one of the Baltic countries.

<HEADLINE> Improving Efficiency in Agricultural Production Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Jiang
Chunyun, during a recent inspection tour of northwest China's
Gansu province, stressed the importance of using scientific
methods in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the province is basically
self-sufficient in grain and the number of poor people there is
decreasing, improving efficiency in agriculture is still a major
task.
</P>
<P>
He commented on continuing the land contract-system and easing
the burdens on farmers. The shortage of water remains one of the
major factors holding back the agricultural development in the
province, he said, adding that more attention should be given to
infrastructure for saving water and for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
To save more water, environmental protection work must be
improved and more trees planted, Jiang said. He went on to say
that the strategy of improving agriculture by relying on science
and education must be carried out in an effective way. "The
emphasis should be given to agricultural science and technology,
which are the main productive forces," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of combining commerce,
industry, and agriculture, as an effective way to help farmers
enter the market and improve agricultural efficiency.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Immigration and Naturalization Service is struggling to
put new procedures in place to prevent immigrants with criminal
records from becoming citizens. But the changes are making people
wait more than a year to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton assailed the tax cut proposals
of the Republicans, saying they would not help the middle-class
enough and would make the deficit rise. But he did not threaten a
veto.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton held open the possibility Saturday that he
will order the U.S. military to remain in Bosnia in some capacity
even after its current NATO peacekeeping mission comes to a close
a year from now.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pathfinder mission to Mars is just one success in an era
of space science that promises to uncover some of the fundamental
secrets to the universe. Space is no longer viewed as a territory
for human expansion -- the dream of the "Space age" -- but rather
as a storehouse of information.

<HEADLINE> Early Childhood Education Program Underway in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
undertaking a Early Childhood Education and Development Program
in a bid to assist about 1.5 million children in poor households
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-year program, the existing 20,000 pre-school
day-centers will be improved and 5,000 new ones set up in 14
districts where early education and development classes are in
the open or under trees, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the program period from 1997 to 2002, 13,000 teachers
will be trained while 8,000 more will receive refresher courses
in nutrition, health care, child-care and management of day-care
centers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Permanent Secretary of the Education Ministry
Elizabeth Masiga said, "Our objective is to curb inadequate physical
and mental development of children in the pre-school years."
</P>
<P>
By increasing access to child-care for poor households, she
noted, the program will have far reaching impact on opportunities
for schooling for girls.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, about 3 million children under the age of six come
from families living below the poverty line and 50 percent of
them suffer from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has agreed to provide 27.8 million U.S. Dollars
for the program while the Kenyan government is contributing 4.6
million Dollars to it.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has asked the government to increase its
budgetary allocation to early childhood education and
development programs.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the government allocates about half a Dollar per
child for early childhood education, said the bank, adding
that this amount is too low compared to the funding in the other
sectors of education.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government allocates 37 Dollars for a primary
school pupil, 100 Dollars for a secondary school student and
1,300 Dollars for a university student.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that this was a unique program in sub-Saharan
Africa. World Bank education experts are optimistic about the
success of the program since Kenya acts as the home for the
Africa Early Childhood and Development Network.

<HEADLINE> PLC Member Deems HK's Image Abroad Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) member Choy So-yuk places strengthening
Hong Kong's international image as one of her top missions in the
Hong Kong legislature.
</P>
<P>
Filling the seat vacated by Maria Tam Wai-chu, the 47-year-old
Choy told the Hong Kong Standard newspaper that she aims to uphold
Hong Kong's transition and the implementation of "one country,
two systems."
</P>
<P>
"Our work has just started," she said, adding: "I am doing what
every Hong Kong person can and should do."
</P>
<P>
Choy is especially interested in strengthening Hong Kong's
image abroad, according to the Hong Kong Standard today.
</P>
<P>
A favorable image will attract foreign investment and retain
Hong Kong's global status, the paper quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Having conducted business overseas and traveled worldwide, I
found many people's perceptions about Hong Kong are very much
affected by media reports," Choy said.
</P>
<P>
"They have created a misconception about Hong Kong," she went
on to say. "For example, a friend of mine in Germany thinks no
demonstrations or petitions will be allowed here" after the July 1
handover.
</P>
<P>
Choy, a business executive and a member of the central
committee of the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, was elected to
the PLC on July 8.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Year-Old Wooden, Bamboo Strips Unearthed in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 bamboo and wooden
strips dating back nearly 2,000 years have been unearthed in a
downtown area of this capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists say that it is the first time that such
strips dating from the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) have ever been
found.
</P>
<P>
They are detailed records of the political, economic, cultural
and social conditions of the time. They also give insights into
the development of ancient Chinese calligraphy and literature.
</P>
<P>
The strips, which are three cm to five cm wide and about 23 cm
long, fall into the categories of government documents, official
name lists, and calligraphic works.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the archeologists have discovered 36 sites dating
from the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) to the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911). Some 1,000 items of historical relics have been
unearthed, including tiles, bricks, pottery, and wooden and iron
objects for daily use.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease Becomes Epidemic In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Heart disease has become an
epidemic killer in South Africa and needs urgent attention, local
daily "Sunday Tribune" quoted a medical expert as reporting
today.
</P>
<P>
Sister Bernie Mothilall, an medical expert at a cardiac
hospital in Durban, said that of about 400 people tested for
cholesterol readings at a workshop in March, 38 percent fell
within the high risk range, 13 percent into extremely high risk
range and 42 percent had high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
According to another study, 75,000 Indians in Durban, the
capital of Kwazulu Natal Province, were estimated to be in need
of heart rehabilitation while only 100 people of all races were
seeking treatment. There are about one million Indians in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of the people tested had at least one major risk
factor including a family history of cardiovascular disease,
smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol or hypertension, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
A cardiologist said that South African Indians had one of the
highest incidence of heart disease in the world. "The situation
is really reaching epidemic proportions in the country, together
with the increasing emergence of heart disease particularly in
the black community," he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in the incidence of heart disease
to a change in lifestyle, resulting in an increase in smoking,
stress and eating habits.

Since the 1950s, the Palace Museum in Beijing has received a
gift of more than 20,000 cultural relics, including paintings,
jade, and seals from people of all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
More national treasures have been located and saved because of
the spreading awareness of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Relics of prehistoric mankind and fossils of ancient plants and
animals have been discovered and turned over to cultural relics
authorities by construction workers at building sites this year.

preservation organizations, and villagers raised money among
themselves to maintain the areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Manufacturers Call for Major Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers in Nigeria, facing
the pains of the harsh operating environment, have called on
the government to take steps for major reforms.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers identified the factors that they considered
as monumental impediments to the nation's economic growth as
continued lack of commitment to the privatization of government
parastatals, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The factors also include the government's disinterest in the
affairs of small and medium scale enterprises, inadequate
attention to energy matters and non-establishment of specialized
industrial courts for quick dispensation of justice on matters
between industry and other parties.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Manufacturers Association of
Nigeria (MAN), the hopes held out by the 1997 budget for
accelerted agricultural and industrial activities have not
materialized half-way into the year.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the budget was yet to be felt because of the
non-release of the capital vote for the first quarter or even
half way into the year.
</P>
<P>
The bane of manufacturers in the country, according to him,
can be listed as recession, illiquidity, consumer resistance,
gross capacity under-utilization, infrastructural insufficiency,
insecurity of life and property, product adulteration and blatant
infringement of registered trade marks.
</P>
<P>
Thus the MAN urged the government to propel the economy
forward by beginning a reflation of the economy through prudent
spendings on capital projects with good linkage effects.
</P>
<P>
"The government must pay some verifiable domestic debts to
local contractors and suppliers, and upgrade the purchasing power
of the individual through a reveiw of incomes, salaries and
wages," said Gbenga Akinnawo, a MAN branch chairman.
</P>
<P>
These would increase demand for factory products, thereby
increasing the much-needed capacity utilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MAN also called on the government to tackle the issues of
deteriorating and inadequate infrastructure facilities,
privatization of key parastatals, promotion of small and medium
scale enterprises, and energy production and supply.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Southeast Asian
Games might be delayed due to the expanding events and rising
costs, a Malaysian sports official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 games are to be held in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kuala
Lumpur will stage the 1999 games. But the Malaysian capital, busy
preparing to stage the 1998 Commonwealth Games, is not keen to act
as host for the 1999 competition.
</P>
<P>
Sieh Kok Chi, secretary of the Olympic Council of Malaysia,
said another Malaysian city might be persuaded to act as host,
according to the national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the games should take a rest in 1999. Then the member
countries can reassess the objective and its achievement and
decide whether they want it to continue." he added.
</P>
<P>
Sieh suggested cutting costs by using university hostels rather
than hotels to house athletes and officials, reducing the number
of events and the duration of the games.
</P>
<P>
Countries and regions take part in the SEA Games are Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia,
Burma, Vietnam and Brunei.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Prosecution Office Saturday
ordered the trial of three Egyptian journalists and three Saudis
on charges of libeling President Hosni Mubarak's two sons, the
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The six men are accused of printing a slanderous story about
the business dealings of Ala and Gamal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mubarak's sons filed a report to the prosecutor's
office complaining about the corruption allegations against them
that appeared in the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The allegations appeared in an advertisement printed on the
newspaper's sister magazine Al-Jadida, but publishers withdrew the
article before distribution.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian journalist Sayed Abdel-Atti, author of the article,
and Fawzieh Salama and Gamal Ismail, Al-Jadida editors who have
since been dismissed from the London-based magazine, have been
ordered to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
Saudis Hesham and Mohammed Ali Hafez, publishers of the
Al-Jadida and Sharq Al-Awsat, as well as Othman al-Omaer, the
paper's editor-in-chief, will also face trial.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the accused will face a maximum penalty of
three years in jail and a fine of 750,000 Egyptian pounds (221,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The date of trial has yet to be set. And some of the accused
would be tried in default, some court sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's sons accused the article of containing "lies and
various baseless allegations about transactions, commissions and
illusionary monopolies with a premeditated aim of inflicting
severe harm and slander" on the family.

saying the sharp increase of HIV carriers in Russia began in
January 1987.
</P>
<P>
The Russian AIDS center now has recorded 4,830 cases of
HIV-positives, among which 259 were AIDS-infected including 103
children. By now 239 of the 259 AIDS sufferers have died.
</P>
<P>
Drug addicts are the most vulnerable group in Russia. Each day,
the AIDS center will add 10 to 12 more drug addicts carrying HIV,
Pokrovskij said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that a peak period of HIV proliferation will
occur between late 1997 and early 1998 in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Though the virus' spreading may slow down after this period, he
said, some 100,000 to 200,000 more people will become HIV-positive
each year.
</P>
<P>
The expert called on the media, the medical and educational
departments to give more publicity to the danger of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Since it is unlikely to find an effective way to cure AIDS
disease in the coming years, the adoption of more precautious
measures will be the only way to prevent further spread of any
possible disasters, Pokrovskij added.

<HEADLINE> India to Hold Presidential Election Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Polling for the 11th
presidential election will be held across India tomorrow with
incumbent Vice-President Kocheril Raman Narayanan's victory a
foregone conclusion, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Though India's former Chief Election Commissioner T. N. Seshan
is in the fray with the support of a regional party, Narayanan is
likely to have smooth sailing as his candidature is being
supported by the ruling United Front, the Congress Party and the
Bharatiya Janata Party, among others.
</P>
<P>
After scrutiny of nominations on June 24, only those of
Narayanan and Seshan were accepted as valid.
</P>
<P>
Because Seshan refuses to withdraw from the race, a polling
will have to be held as scheduled on July 14.
</P>
<P>
However, Narayanan is believed to enjoy the support of more
than 80 percent of this year's 4,848-strong Electoral College
which comprises members of parliament and state legislative
assemblies in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an Election Commission spokesman, polling will be
held between 10:00 and 17:00 hours local time at the Parliament
House in the capital and polling stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
Ballot boxes and ballot papers have been flown to all polling
stations under tight security and will be flown back to the
capital and stored in the Parliament House till July 17.
</P>
<P>
The five-year tenure of President Shanker Dayal Sharma expires
on July 24. The new president to be elected is expected to take
the oath of office the next day.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) --Three Tanzanian factories
have been ordered to close down for polluting the environment
with industrial effluents, said a report available here today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma made the order
Saturday when he toured the three factories in Dar es Salaam
following complaints from residents that the industrial effluents
emitted by the three factories posed a great danger to their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Factories involved are the Trans-Tech which manufactures
cooking oil, Tanpack which makes tissue paper, and Mortans
Limited, a producer of zinc oxide, rubber products and automobile
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The three factories can resume production after installation
of facilities for the disposal of industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
Omar urged the three firms to adopt cleaner production
technologies and to collectively construct a central sewerage
system.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for all factories in the country to
install recycling plants, saying the facilities are vital in
checking pollution of the environment by toxic wastes or
materials that could not be broken down biologically such as
plastics and other synthetics.

<HEADLINE> Books On Complete History of Anti-Japanese War Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A series of books covering the
complete history of China's war of resistance to Japanese invasion
have been published on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the
July 7 Incident, the opening salvo in the war.
</P>
<P>
The series, starting from Japan's invasion of northeast China
in 1931 to its surrender in 1945, is titled "The War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression". It contains photographs,
documents, archives, memoirs and diaries concerning politics,
economy, culture, military affairs, diplomacy and outrages
committed by the Japanese invaders during that period.
</P>
<P>
Some of the documents and archives in the books, including
those published in Taiwan or after the founding of People's
Republic of China in 1949, as well as diplomatic documents of the
United States, Britain, Japan, the Soviet Union, Germany and
France, are for the first time made public in China.
</P>
<P>
The eleven-volume series was compiled by the Chinese Historical
Studies Society and the Institute of Modern Chinese History under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It was published by the
Sichuan University Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops provoked the September 18 Incident in 1931 to
start a full-scale invasion of northeast China. The July 7
Incident of 1937 in west Beijing signaled the start of the
eight-year national anti-Japanese war. The Japanese surrendered on
August 15, 1945.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Toughen Crackdown on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military authorities
has decided to tighten the screws against Palestinian resistance,
the state-run Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is preparing for a possible
escalation of violence in the Palestinian territories and,
particularly, further deterioration of situation in the West Bank
city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The move came after weeks of violent demonstrations and
protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip resulted from Jewish
settlement expansion. An anti-Islamic poster depicting Prophet
Muhammad as a pig set off a wave of violent clashes between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has arrested a number of Palestinian activists
allegedly responsible for resistance activities in Hebron. The
army has also decided to dispatch more undercover personnel to
infiltrate into Palestinian ranks to arrest more in the largely
self-rule city.
</P>
<P>
In addition, word has been spread that more sanctions against
the Palestinians would be forthcoming if violence continues.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified sources were quoted in the report as alleging
that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has ordered continuous
violence in order to exert pressure on the hardline Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is leaving for a trip to Britain and Austria
Monday. Israel fears that uprising-type violence would escalate
in his absence.

<HEADLINE> China's Commercial Banks Fund Big Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's large industrial
corporations, the backbone of the country's economy, are expected
to gain more support from the commercial banks when applying for
loans, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting large state enterprises is not only our duty, but
also a key strategy for our expansion," Yang Kaisheng,
vice-president of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
ICBC is acting as the sponsoring bank for 90 percent of the 512
pilot conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
The sponsoring bank practice was adopted last year across the
country. Under a fixed cooperation relationship, a sponsoring bank
offers its partner enterprise credit and consulting services,
while the enterprise opens accounts and does financial
transactions in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The large state firms this year would receive 80 percent of the
bank's 40 billion yuan loans. The supported firms include
Changhong Television, Yizheng Chemical Fiber, Daqing Oil and First
Auto Works, all stars in their trade.
</P>
<P>
China Construction Bank (CCB), which initiated the strategy of
supporting large corporations two years ago, also benefits from
the move.
</P>
<P>
"By focusing on large conglomerates and giving up poorly
performed small firms, our bank achieved good returns last year,"
said Liu Rengang, deputy general manager of the bank's credit
management department.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, about 95 percent of the loans can be
collected back on time, and problem loans account for no more than
one percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the bank's forces in investment banking, the
bank also offers unique services in the capital market for its
clientele.
</P>
<P>
"To develop large corporations and large industrial groups will
resolve the poor returns from a scattered extensive input," Liu
noted.
</P>
<P>
CCB has simplified loan procedures for conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 70 percent of its working capital loans
go to such sectors as energy, petroleum, post and telecoms,
transportation and chemical.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of loans, the commercial banks have worked
out methods to tighten auditing and supervision. CCB, for
instance, has set up a risk-monitoring system for credit check
before, during and after loans are granted.

<HEADLINE> Savings Decline Arouses Concern of Banks' Liability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown of new savings
deposits this year is a warning that Chinese banks must improve
their liability management, said a Chinese financial analyst on a
recent interview with China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, Lin Zhiyuan, professor of the
Research Institute of Finance and Banking under the People's Bank
of China, said that the drop of savings is a natural result
of cash flowing into the booming securities market after interest
rate cuts last year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, new individuals savings accounts
amounted to about 350 billion yuan (US$42 billion), down about 140
billion yuan from the same period last year, according to the
State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese people lost interest in savings accounts after
China twice cut interest rates last year and transferred their money
to the securities markets to seek higher returns.
</P>
<P>
Through the securities market, the money goes to enterprises,
which ultimately deposit the money in banks, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, the liability structure of Chinese banks
is changing. Enterprises are making more non-fixed deposits, and
fewer individuals are making fixed-term deposits. As a result,
the banks' debts become more fluid.
</P>
<P>
"The increased fluidity will add risks to banking operations
and cause the banks to become more sensitive to economic
fluctuation, " Lin said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that domestic banks must improve the management to
respond quickly to liability changes. Considering the banks'
endurance of sluggish savings deposits, the country's
interest rates on savings accounts should remain unchanged this
year to maintain the stability of the banking system. However she
added that the central bank's interest rate should be cut as early
as possible, saying that China's interests rates are still higher than in
foreign countries, which means domestic banks are unable to
compete in investment markets. enditem

<HEADLINE> Army Called Out to Help Flood Victims in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The flash flood that hit nearly
one-third of Bangladesh has deteriorated further and the
government called out the armed forces to undertake emergency
rescue and relief operations in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in the sudden flood, caused by incessant
downpours for the last five days and on-rush of hilly water, has
risen to 57 as reports of fresh deaths are still reaching Dhaka
from the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, before leaving for Germany on
Saturday, ordered the deployment of the army for emergency rescue
and relief operations in the flood-affected areas. Air Force
helicopters have already been used to drop relief supplies to the
marooned people.
</P>
<P>
The incessant rainfall and on-rush of hilly water from across
the border inundated vast areas in the country's northern and
southeastern regions and disrupted road and rail communication in
some districts.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Dhaka remains cut off from the northern
districts as the Aricha-Nagarbari ferry service was suspended on
Saturday noon while the road between Chittagong and the Cox's
Bazar has been closed for the fourth consecutive day today.
</P>
<P>
In Dhaka, heavy rainfall caused flooding in all low-lying areas
around it while the vegetables markets, most of them waterlogged,
were running out of supplies, causing a temporary hike of fish,
meat and vegetables prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Flood Information Center, at least 11 rivers
of the three major river basins have been flowing above their
respective danger marks with the rise in water levels on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Brahmaputra and the Ganges continued to rise at all points
while the rivers in the Meghna basin recorded both rises and falls
and all the rivers in the southeastern hill basin continued to
rise at all points, the center added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Government Criticized for Newsprint Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has come
under a barrage of criticism after it proposed to impose a
5-percent duty on imported newsprint.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament from different political parties voiced
in unison opposition to the proposal, demanding instead that the
government withdraw the proposal and provide more assistance to
the fledgling newsprint industry, the national press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Former Communications Minister Chiranjibi Wagle also lashed the
government's move, saying the newsprint produced in Nepal
constitutes just a small portion of total market demand as the
newspaper industry is basically dependent on foreign newsprint.
</P>
<P>
The government's duty proposal also met strong condemnation
from the print industry.
</P>
<P>
President of the Nepalese Journalists Federation Harihar Birahi
said his organization has been demanding more subsidy on the
newsprint. If the government imposes duty in such a condition, the
price for newsprint is sure to go up, which in turn will have an
adverse impact on print journalism.
</P>
<P>
President of Nepal Editors' Society Govind Biyogi said there is
no point for the government to impose such burdens on the print
media.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has some 160 regular publications, including 21 dailies
and 129 weeklies.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan President Highlights Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro
Arzu said today that Central America restarted the regional
integration after ending the armed conflicts that bled some of the
nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are in Panama to carry forward all our region toward new
horizons of joint development," said Arzu in a speech during the
one-day summit of the Central America opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala assumed today the semi-annual presidency of the
council of foreign, economy and foreign trade ministers of Central
America.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan president said that since the third decade of
the 19th century, when the federation that followed the
emancipation from Spain was broken, 21 of the 22 countries in the
region failed to integrate.
</P>
<P>
Central America has had serious political, economic and social
problems in the past years, and there were internecine armed
confrontations in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, said the
Guatemalan president.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of regional collaboration in the
face of economic globalization, not only intergovernmental, but
also the transformation in depth of the institutional scaffolding
of integration.
</P>
<P>
He advocated "a solid, consistent and correct" institutional
change to strengthen, intensify and develop regional collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The Central American presidential summit expects to adopt some
fundamental decisions on the reforms of the Central American
Parliament and Court.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (xinhua) -- Thirty-seven crew members of a
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) ship abducted by the
Sri Lankan Tamil rebels were released today, a spokesman of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said here.

<HEADLINE> China's Defence Sector Partially Opens to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Part of China's defence sector
is to open to overseas investors in a bid to upgrade its use of
electronic technology, according to today's Business Week,
commercial weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National
Defence and the Equipment Department of the General Staff of the
People's Liberation Army are to open parts of the defence
electronic sector to overseas investors next year, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They are also planning to encourage some overseas counterparts
to display their technology in China, commission official Su
Huining said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of defence-related electronics firms is believed
crucial to ensure rapid technical renovation of the PLA, local
analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the equipment department and the Ministry of
Electronics Industry (MEI) will jointly sponsor an exhibition in
Beijing next year.
</P>
<P>
The four-day show, China International Defence Electronic
Exhibition, will be due on May 12, 1998, in Beijing's China
International Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Technology and equipment to be displayed in the show will
include radar systems, command-control-communication-intelligence
integrated systems, navigation systems, military computers,
simulators, test equipment, microwave components, and other
products.
</P>
<P>
"We will invite foreign suppliers or companies in defence
electronics to participate in the exhibition," said one exhibition
organizer, who considered the show a good opportunity for
suppliers to enter China's defence market because they can meet
many potential end users from various military services.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show China's demand for electronic
technology and equipment is growing rapidly, and annual sales are
expected to soar to about 1,000 billion yuan (120.5 billion US
dollars) by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
With foreign help, the electronic industry's turnover last year
hit 300 billion yuan (36 billion US dollars), up 20 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To date, contractual overseas investment to China's electronics
totaled seven billion dollars, with more than 600
overseas-funded projects nationwide, according to MEI
sources.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges for Resuming Middle East Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The stalemate in the Middle East
peace process would only bring about new conflicts and violence,
and efforts should be made to resume talks between Israel and
Palestine, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dini made the remarks after coming back from the fifth
Mediterranean Forum held in Algiers, Algeria, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the recent tense situation in
the Middle East, which was aggravated by Israel's construction of
a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem earlier this year,
was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Israel's settlement practice as a negative
practice which destroyed the atmosphere of peace talks, the only
way to help find a real resolution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that peace in the Middle East was an essential
pre-condition for maintaining peace and stability in the
Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Peace process in the Middle East was among one of the major
topics of the two-day Mediterranean Forum, which
gathered together foreign ministers from 11 Mediterranean basin
countries.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Export 7 Million Tons of Sugar This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will increase its
sugar export to 7 million tons this year after its eliminating
sugar export quotas, a Brazilian official has said.
</P>
<P>
Julio Maria Borges, consultant to the Central Bank of Brazil,
said the bank announced Friday the elimination of quotas to sugar
exports.
</P>
<P>
By eliminating the quota, Brazil can export up to 7 million
tons of sugar this year, a volume higher than the 5.2 million tons
permitted by the government.
</P>
<P>
The present export surplus does not justify the 40 percent tax
created to guarantee the domestic supply.
</P>
<P>
Present sugar prices, 12.50-13 U.S. dollars for a 50-kilogram
bag, are being pressured down by the big surplus of
sugar, said Borges.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the biggest producer and exporter of sugar in the
world. Last year it produced 12 million tons of sugar.

<HEADLINE> 8th Pan-Arab Games Opens in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The eighth Pan-Arab Games opened in
Beirut tonight with more than 2,000 athletes from 19 countries
registered to compete in 20 events.
</P>
<P>
The Games opened in a magnificent ceremony held in the Beirut
Sports City Stadium, which had been destroyed in the 1982
bombardment of West Beirut by Israel, and was reconstructed during
the past two years with 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Athletes, guided by national flags of their countries, walked
into the noisy stadium in rows, warmly welcomed by an audience of
more than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the International Olympic
Committee, Esmat Abdul-Maguid, secretary general of the Arab
League, and other Lebanese political leaders and foreign diplomats
took part in the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon successfully held the second Pan-Arab Games in 1957.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, 95 Iraqi athletes returned home this
afternoon after the Lebanese authorities refused their entry in
fear of infruiating Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the two funders of
the Beirut Sports City's rebuilding and main financers for
Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction schemes.
</P>
<P>
Carried by four buses, the Iraqi team arrived at the Masnaa
Cross on the Lebanese-Syrian border Friday morning and threatened
to stage a protest if they were not allowed to take part in the
Games in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, after failing to obtain Syria's permission to
attend the Seventh Pan-Arab Games, the Iraqi delegation returned
to Amman and staged a sit-on on the Syrian-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
Due to a strict international sanction against their country,
the 160 Libyan athletes had to take a roundabout route to Lebanon
via Tunis and Italy. The Libyans will tark part in 12 events.
</P>
<P>
The competition will start on Sunday and go on until 27 with
the participation of 1,645 men and 470 women from Algeria,
Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,
Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi arabia, Sudan,
Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Tunis and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Among the events will be track and field, soccer, basketball,
swimming, tennis, shooting, wrestling, golf and gymnastics.

<P>
CARACAS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- At least one person and five
others disappeared -- four of them children -- in the flood caused
by pouring rains since Thursday night in northern Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The national press reported that the floods hit six
municipalities of the Valles del Tuy, in the state of Miranda,
bringing down four bridges, as well as flooding the metropolitan
airport, and causing considerable damage to a passenger terminal
and some businesses.
</P>
<P>
More than one thousand houses were damaged, and some of them
were completely destroyed.
</P>

Rain fell all day on Friday, increasing the danger of more
floods, since many rivers threatened with outflowing.

All the roads suffered landslides, flooding, fallen trees,
cutting the communication with many towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
The firefighting brigade chief of Miranda state, Miguel
Castellanos, said that at least 450 firefighters joined the

<HEADLINE> Higher Gold Output Expected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's gold output in the
January-June period this year reached 60 tons, representing an 18
percent increase from the same period of 1996, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China's gold industry officials are now
optimistic about meeting the goals this year because the country
has met 60 percent of the target set by the State Planning
Commission for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the January-June output also approaches
half the production goal set by the gold bureau. The gold mines
usually produce more gold in the second half of a year than in the
first half for seasonal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province ranks first in output, with 538,000 taels,
the equivalent of 16,812 kg.
</P>
<P>
Henan follows with 227,000 taels; Hebei, with 144,000 taels;
and Shaanxi, 144,000 taels.
</P>
<P>
Other gold producers are Xinjiang, Gansu, Hunan, Guangxi,
Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, Beijing, Fujian and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other industries closely integrated with the
international market, China's gold industry is still under state
planning. Gold produced by the mines is purchased by the People's
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
China produced more than 120 tons of gold last year, ranking
sixth in the world. A senior Gold Bureau official said that the
gold output this year is expected to hit 130 tons.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Meets Krajisnik </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic today held a closed-door meeting with Momcilo Krajisnik,
the Serb member of Bosnia's three-member presidency, in her power
base, Banja Luka, said a report of the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two Bosnian Serb
leaders, but they did not issue any formal statement after the
two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik only briefed the reporters that they were making some
progress during the talk that would continue tomorrow while
Plavsic remained silent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held when Plavsic was battling Bosnian Serb
hard-liners who see her as too moderate. She has been the only
senior Serb official to advocate closer compliance with the Dayton
accords and has accused the hard-line leadership of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Serb parliament voted a law which it says
enabled it to strip her of her powers and transfer them to a
defense council. She says the vote was illegal because she had
dissolved the parliament a day earlier.

southeast of this largest port city in north China, has
produced a total of 100 million tons of crude oil since it began
prospecting 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It turned out more than 2.18 million tons of crude oil

of oil reserve during the first half of this year, all surpassing
the targets set for this period.
</P>
<P>
The field began its prospecting in 1964 and has developed 21
oil and natural gas wells, forming an annual production capacity
of 4.3 million tons of crude oil and 360 million cu m of natural
gas. It also has a 2.5 million tons of crude-oil processing
capacity a year.
</P>
<P>
Dagang field, covering a prospecting area of 18,600 sq km in 25
districts, counties and cities, has now become a modern
comprehensive oil and natural gas base integrated with production,
processing, machine building, research and design. It ranked sixth
in the country with 4.34 million tons of crude oil output last
year.

JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia became the first
African Nations Cup qualifiers after defeating Malawi 3-1 at

<HEADLINE> Lewis Keeps Title as Akinwande Disqualified for Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council (WBC)
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis retained his title Saturday when
fellow Briton Henry Akinwande was disqualified in the fifth round
by referee Mills Lane for repeated holding.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande was warned several times by Lane and had one point
deducted from his score in the second round for holding and
refusing to fight.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight heavyweight title fight in which the
veteran referee disqualified a boxer. Lane did the same to Mike
Tyson two weeks ago in his bout against World Boxing Association
champion Evander Holyfield after the challenger bit both
Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
Lewis won every round and was aggressive throughout the
contest, while Akinwande failed to use his physical advantages of
speed and reach.

PRAGUE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel said
today he would run for his second term in the presidential
elections scheduled for early 1998.

Prime Minister Vaclav Claus, also president of the Civic
Democratic Party which is the largest ruling party in the country,

Under the Czech constitution, the president can run only two
consecutive terms. If elected, Havel will serve his last five-year
