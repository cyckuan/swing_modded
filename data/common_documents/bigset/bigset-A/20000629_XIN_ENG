<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 28 (Xinhua)-- A gas-based granular urea fertilizer
plant will be set up with Chinese assistance at Sirajganj, some
140 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, according to a memorandum of
understanding signed between the two countries here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be one of the five urea plants the government has
planned to set up to add value to the newly-found gas resources to
meet future fertilizer needs, estimated at 310,000 tons in 2005
and 410,000 tons in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) Wednesday
signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese Chemical
Engineering Corporation, Huan Qiu, to set up the giant fertilizer
factory at Sirajganj with a production capacity of 1,700 tons per
day.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Huan Qiu Corporation will carry out a complete
techno-economic feasibility study on the cost and is likely to
submit the report by August.
</P>
<P>
The state corporation BCIC now operates six urea factories with
a total production capacity of about 210,000 tons against annual
demand of about 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed
asked the BCIC and Huan Qiu officials to expedite their study so
construction works for the industrial unit could be started as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Academy of Science Dismisses AIDS Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Academy of Science
Wednesday dismissed claims by Nigerian surgeon Jeremiah Abalaka to
have produced HIV vaccines, just as the federal government
appointed a committee to verify all claims of cure for HIV/AIDS in
the country.
</P>
<P>
A committee, set up by the academy in April to investigate the
 scientific basis of Abalaka's claims, said in a report released
Tuesday in Lagos, that the preventive and curative vaccines were
not properly tried or evaluated in humans before being made
public, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The vaccines as prepared by Dr. Abalaka appear impure and may
cause hypersensitivity reactions or transmit serious infectious
agents such as hepatitis C, which is another known cause of liver
cancer," the five-man committee chaired by Etim Essien said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of their findings, the committee recommended further
investigation of the claims by Abalaka and others.
</P>
<P>
"We take the position that, despite the fact that the claims as
we have assessed them have extremely weak or sometimes
non-existent scientific basis, all the claims should be
investigated with proper scientific vigor," the committee said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day the report was released, the federal government
set up a 15-member expert/technical committee to verify the claim
by Abalaka and a host of other medical doctors and traditional
healers to have found a cure for the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Idris Mohammed, an immunologist from
the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, has two months to
complete its assignment.
</P>
<P>
Abalaka stunned the medical community last year when he told a
press conference in Abuja that he had developed a curative and
preventive vaccines for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- France reached the final on

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Take Retaliatory Measures Against U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway Turkish Cypriot
regime in northern Cyprus announced Thursday to impose restrictions
on the U.N. peacekeepers in retaliation for the U.N. decision to
renew their mandate without asking for its approval.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) would henceforth
only be allowed to cross to northern Cyprus through a checkpoint at
Ledra Palace in Nicosia and would be required to insure their
vehicles with Turkish Cypriot insurance companies, according to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots also revoked free water and electricity
supply to the UNFICYP soldiers, demanding that they pay for the
supply they use in their bases north of the U.N.-monitored buffer
zone on the divided island, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken as a retaliation for the U.N. Security
Council's decision to renew the mandate of the UNFICYP without
considering the Turkish Cypriots' demand for separate consultations
with the U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the measures, UNFICYP spokeswoman Sarah Russell
said the UNFICYP is consulting with the United Nations headquarters
and will respond "in due course."
</P>
<P>
Russell said that so far, the UNFICYP paid "the people in the
north" -- referring to the Turkish Cypriots -- for water and the
government-controlled Cyprus Electricity Authority for electricity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the UNFICYP, which comprises 1,208 soldiers and 33
civilian police from 12 countries, has been patrolling along the
180-kilometre dividing line separating the two communities.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has been demanding that his
self-declared regime be treated as an equal to the internationally
recognized Cyprus government, which has been rejected by the U.N.
and the government under President Glafcos Clerides.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Campaign Cannot be Stopped: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister Abdolvahed
Mousavi Lari said on Thursday that the reformist campaign fostered
by President Mohammad Khatami cannot be stopped by the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The social and cultural reformist movement which started from
President Khatami's presidential election victory in 1997 will
continue its course and eventually bear fruits, Lari told a
gathering of senior provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reformist movement is irreversible despite
impediments that are frequently put on its way by the
conservatives, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a close ally of President Khatami, also criticized
the conservative Guardians Council (GC) for annulling parliamentary
election results in a number of constituencies, blocking the way
for reformers to get control of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations were not understandable and for no good
reasons, the minister said, adding that such acts could only cast a
shadow of doubt over the authenticity of the election.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami's reformist allies won a landslide victory in
Iran's sixth parliamentary election held on February 18, ending the
long-time control of the legislative body by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to accept the humiliating defeat, the conservative
establishment has since taken tough measures to strengthen its rule
and curb the reformist movement.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the GC, supervisor of the election, has annulled
first-round and runoff election results in some 10 constituencies,
depriving 12 reformist candidates of their right to enter the 290-
seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Facing severe pressure from the conservatives, the new
parliament, dominated by reformers, managed to start work on May
27. But a number of seats are still vacant due to the GC's
cancellation of election results.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Proposes Plan To Eradicate Illicit Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the FARC plan, the pilot center will be installed
in Cartagena del Chaira, a municipality of 20,000 inhabitants in
the Amazons jungles of the south of Colombia, where the guerrilla
controls the production of cocaine and the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The FARC proposal was delivered to delegates from Latin America,
Canada, Japan, and Europe, who gathered in this place of the
country to seek non-military solutions for the reduction of the
area cultivated with coca plants, where the biggest harvest of
this drug is produced.
</P>
<P>
The FARC said that "the pilot plan" to eradicate the cultures
must be financed with funds from the Colombian government, the
United States, Germany, France, Italy, and the United Nations,
under the administration of the guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the FARC will present a report every six
months on the advance of the project to a commission of three
delegates of the Colombian State and to the United States, England,
France, Spain, and the United Nations representatives.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the largest rebel group in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. lawmakers this week finalized the 1.3 billion dollar aid
plan. The package aims to help Colombia retake jungles near San
Vicente del Caguan where the FARC and rebel paramilitary groups
guard and tax cocaine-producing plots for huge financial payoffs.

The aircraft will join the spraying campaign of two Peruvian

</P>
<P>
The locust plague that affects the northern Andean departments
of Cajamarca, Lambayeque, Cuzco, and La Libertad has eaten more
than 5,000 hectares of crops.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said that the number of producers
affected by the insects is more than one thousand, a great
increase compared to the 800 registered in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
An enormous cloud of millions of insects moves and eats
hectares of cultivated land of corn, beans, peas, yucca, maracuya,
mango, and natural pastures in the most affected zones.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government declared recently the zones affected by
the insects into a state of phytosanitary emergency, as a
preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
The government allocated more than 300,000 dollars to combat
the locusts and ordered the intervention of two army battalions to
combat the plague with flamethrowers and hand-held fumigators.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture ministry delivered to the agriculture producers
of the affected zones 20 tractors and 40 motorized sprayers for an
offensive from several fronts against the enormous locust cloud.

<HEADLINE> US China Experts Urge Clinton to Delay Decision on Building NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Current plans for NMD deployment are likely to serve as a
catalyst for China to accelerate nuclear weapons modernization,
since it believes that even a simple missile defense configuration
will leave its nuclear arsenal vulnerable," they said.
</P>
<P>
"A deployment decision at this time may also make U.S.
cooperation with China on a range of issues more difficult,
particularly with respect to Taiwan and regional security
questions.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the U.S. plans to expand trade and economic
relations with China would be adversely affected by a precipitous
NMD deployment decision," the China experts added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Wednesday that he would make a decision on whether
to begin building the NMD "sometime over the next several weeks"
after the third test of the system on July 7.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Ruling Party Calls for Building New Arab Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth Congress of Syria's
ruling Arab Socialist Baath Party has urged for the establishment
of a new Arab order to "serve the higher Arab national interests."
</P>
<P>
"The Arab revival needs effective solidarity and joint action to
build a new Arab order the groups all the Arab countries, respects
the interests of each country and serves the higher Arab national
interests," a statement of the congress said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official SANA news agency Thursday, the Baath
congress, held from June 17-20, discussed the developments of the
Arab situation.
</P>
<P>
It called for following up the cooperation between Syria and
Egypt on the one hand and member states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) on the other in the framework of the Damascus
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was signed in March 1991 by foreign ministers of
Syria, Egypt and six Gulf Arab states -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar, to strengthen
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Baath congress underscored the importance of tuning the
declaration into a nucleus of a strong well-established and
comprehensive cooperation ties in all fields, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the congress highlighted the desire to strengthen
Syria's ties with Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen, as well as the other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasized the importance of Syria's ties with
neighboring Arab and Islamic countries, particularly Iran and
Turkey, to contribute to the development of neighborly ties and
common interests.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Capital to Hold Parliamentary Runoff Election Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A runoff election for the sixth
Majlis (parliament) of Iran will be held on Friday in the Tehran
constituency, in which four candidates will run for two seats in
the 290-member legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The week-long election campaign by the hopefuls ended Thursday
and the poll will start at 09:00 local time (0430 GMT) Friday, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the election headquarters at the Interior Ministry,
the vote casting in some 2,124 ballot boxes will last 10 hours and
could be extended for two hours if required. The result is to be
announced within a maximum of 24 hours after the end of the
polling.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the Tehran constituency had voted in 30 candidates
in the first-round election held on February 18, of which 29 were
reformists supporting President Mohammad Khatami's moderate
policies.
</P>
<P>
But the conservative Guardians Council (GC), supervisor of the
elections, said there had been riggings in the election process and
nullified more than 700,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
After a three-month delay, the council finally confirmed 28
winners in the constituency, ordering the other two seats to be
decided in a runoff. Among the 28 winners confirmed, only two were
from the conservative camp, including former president and Majlis
speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The two were believed to have entered the winners' list with the
help from the powerful GC. Amid strong protests from reformists,
Rafsanjani announced that he would not take his seat in the Majlis.
His substitute is to be elected through a by-election.
</P>
<P>
The February 18 election resulted in a landslide victory for
reformists, putting end to the long conservative dominance in the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives still control most of the country's
powerful state organs like the police and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
After severe struggle with the conservative establishment, the
new Majlis started work on May 27.
</P>
<P>
But a number of seats are still vacant due to the GC's partial
annulling of election results. The conservative body is said to
have cancelled first-round and runoff election results in 10
constituencies, involving 12 candidates, all belonging to the
reformist camp.

<HEADLINE> South Korean FM Visits Russia for Putin's Trip to Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian and South Korean foreign
ministers discussed here Thursday bilateral ties and the Korean
problem, confirming Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit
Seoul this year.
</P>
<P>
Putin has decided to pay an official visit to the Republic of
Korea"some time in 2000," and the specific date will be agreed
upon through diplomatic channels, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told a news conference, after his meeting with South Korean
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Yi Chong Pin.
</P>
<P>
Yi, who arrived here Wednesday to prepare for Putin's trip to
Seoul, discussed with the Russian side "a range of issues of
mutual interest, involving the situation on the Korean Peninsula
in the light of the first inter-Korean summit earlier this month
and other international matters," said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The historic summit between the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea "has opened a door for
dialogue and cooperation" and "will contribute to creating trust
on the peninsula," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit "has further weakened the arguments of those who
advocate the creation of a national anti-missile defense system,"
he noted, urging that "the Korean Peninsula should be turned into
a nuclear-free zone."
</P>
<P>
The agenda of Putin's visit to DPRK slated for July will
include bilateral relations, security and stability in the Korean
Peninsula and in the whole Asian-Pacific region, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly announced its readiness to promote a
favorable atmosphere for the inter-Korean dialogue and to take
part in meetings of various formats to settle the Korean issue if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry has circulated a statement in
light of Yi's visit, saying that "relations with South Korea are
an important area of Russia's Asia-Pacific policy and a
constructive and mutually supportive partnership."
</P>
<P>
The last visit of a Russian head of state to Seoul was paid by
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin in November 1992.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Mexican
children will go to special polling stations on July 2 -- the same
day on which adults vote in the country's Presidential elections --
to register their opinions about their schools and communities.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Mexican Federal Electoral Institute, the
children's election is supported by the U.N. Children's Fund (
UNICEF), some 500 nongovernmental organizations and the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Children's Consultation, as the event is known, is also to
put into place certain formal child participation mechanisms
whereby Mexican children will have the opportunity to express
themselves freely on their rights.
</P>
<P>
A child's right to express himself or herself freely is
enshrined in Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, the world's most ratified human rights treaty.
</P>
<P>
This year's Children's Constitution falls on the heels of the
Latin American Survey of Children and Adolescents, which polled 12,
000 children across the region on their rights and follows a
similar event in Mexico on July 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that from 6 to 8 million children, aged six to
17, will cast votes which express their views on a wide range of
issues affecting their lives. Separate ballots will encompass
questions relevant to children in three age groups: 6 to 9, 10 to
13 and 14 to 17.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Ugandans Come out to Choose Political System of Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of voters Thursday morning
lined up at a polling station at the Railway Zone in the Ugandan
capital Kampala, quietly waiting for their turn to get ballot
papers on which there are a " Bus" and a "Dove", symbols for the
Movement and the Multi-party respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution requires that a national referendum be held on
Thursday for Ugandans to determine which of the two systems, the
Multi-party System or the Movement System, will be adopted by the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million of registered voters went to 16,500 polling
stations on Thursday across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala District, a total of 498,510 registered voters are
expected to vote at more than 1,000 polling stations, according to
the voters' registration list issued by the National Electoral
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"I vote for the Movement System, for the National Resistance
Movement has achieved positive performance in economic and social
sectors since it came to power in 1986," said the 20-year-old
Kalungi Isa.
</P>
<P>
Isa reported his identification in the voters' roll and get a
ballot paper at one of the four tables. Moving to the second,
about 10 meters away from the first, he ducked himself in the
basin on the table and fixed a tick. After putting his vote in the
ballot box on the third table, he had his thumb dipped into
indelible ink on the fourth table, indicating he has cast his vote
and will never be allowed to vote again.
</P>
<P>
"I was born in 1972. The economy of the country was worsening
before the Movement took over the power. I have seen the country
moving forward in various sectors under the Movement
administration," said Nbasa Julius, a graduate of the
country-known University of Makerere.
</P>
<P>
The Market Street at the downtown which is usually busy and
bustling appeared quiet. A dozen of voters were moving toward the
ballot table. One middle-age woman said after casting her vote, "I
prefer the Movement System. If the Multi-party System is adopted,
the country would be divided."
</P>
<P>
After the Movement took over power in 1986, a majority of
Ugandans preferred the Movement while some people wanted a
multi-party system. The idea of holding a referendum to decide
future political system is contained in the constitution which
recognizes people's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A 53-year-old man, who cast his vote for the Multi-party System
at 7:30 this morning, said, "This is an unfair contest. Opposition
parties in this country have boycotted the referendum, and many
supporters of the Multi-party have not come out to vote."
</P>
<P>
"The country should adopt the Multi-party System which could
put different views from various parties into the policies of the
government," said the man. "The Movement System is a dictatorship.
Although the Movement is said non-partisan, it will become a party
in future, may be in 2001," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ssemogerere, the opposition Democratic Party chief, has
urged Ugandans to boycott the referendum, saying that the
referendum has been rigged and the results are already known.
</P>
<P>
"The Multi-party System is good, but it is not mature for the
country to adopt this political system," said the middle-age
Kahumuza Hannington. "The opposition parties in the country are
weak, and there are no strong leaders, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"The votes for the Multi-party System are estimated at 15 or 25
percent of the total. Most of Ugandans trust the Movement, because
of its administration the country has made great progress in
various fields, including education, health, economy,
infrastructure and agriculture," said Kariisa Richard, a student
of Social Sciences Department of the Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
"The whole day polling exercise ended at 5 p.m. (local time),
and everything has been going on smoothly," Kick Kizito, public
relations officer of the National Electoral Commission, told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard no disruption or violence at any polling station
across the country," Kizito added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Dairy Production Constrained by Tse-tse Fly: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Ethiopia's dairy
production has been reduced by 90 million U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange annually due to cattle diseases transmitted by Tse-tse
fly in the country, a senior official of the Ministry of
Agriculture said Thursday.  Addressing a workshop in connection
with the launching of Tse-tse fly Control and Agricultural
Development Project, Vice Agricultural Minister Belay Ijigu
revealed that a total of 8 to 10 percent of heads of the country's
cattle, 14-16 percent of sheep and 11-13 percent of goats die
annually of diseases caused by Tse-tse fly.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the loss of foreign exchange, the
mosquito-transmitted diseases also directly or indirectly
victimize 5 million people and 10 million home animals, Belay
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice minister, the disease is affecting 15
percent of the total land area of the country, including 180,000
square kilometers of the fertile land area in the south, south
west and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that in accordance with an agreement reached between
Ethiopia and the European Union (EU), a four-year Tse-tse fly
Control and Agricultural Development Project will become
operational in October.
</P>
<P>
The project will mainly function in selected areas in Amhara,
Oromia, Benishangul-Gumus as well as in Gambela states.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 51.1 million birr (about 6.3 million U.S. dollars)
has been allocated for execution of the project, Belay said 43.2
million birr (about 5.3 million dollars) out of this is covered by
the EU and the rest by the Ethiopian government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Still Pushes For Three-Way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli official said Thursday
a proposed Israeli-Palestinian-U.S. summit in Washington can help
solve the difference between Israel and the Palestinians over
final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians will miss an opportunity if they
fail to reach a final peace agreement in the next few months while
U.S. President Bill Clinton can still broker the peace deal,
Minister of Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon said in an interview
with Israel's Channel Two television.
</P>
<P>
The United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended
her two-day shuttle trip in the region earlier Thursday, failing to
win Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's support for the three-day
summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked negotiators of the two sides to hold another round
of talks in the U.S. before such a summit was held. Otherwise, the
summit, which is expected to narrow the gaps between the two sides
on all key issues such as Jerusalem, borders, refugees, Jewish
settlement and water, was doomed to fail, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not worth the delay because we all know that President
Clinton is about to end his term," Ramon told the television.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the presidential elections in the U.S. in
November, he said, it would be difficult for Clinton to raise in
the Congress the very significant aid needed for carrying out an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak strongly supports the holding
of the summit, saying that it's time for himself and Arafat to make
the hard decisions needed to close the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who will decide whether to convene the summit after
hearing from Albright on her return, told reporters Wednesday in
Washington that he does not believe that the two sides can resolve
the final, most difficult issues without having the leaders get
together in some isolated setting and make the last tough
decisions.

<HEADLINE> Annan Promises Lebanon to Resolve Israeli Violations in 3 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
Wednesday night promised to Lebanese President Emile Lahoud to
resolve the alleged Israeli encroachments on Lebanese border within
three days, Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Annan promised me to end the violations in three days and to
send radar systems and helicopters to monitor any future Israeli
violations of Lebanon's air space or territorial waters", Lahoud
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud added that Annan, in his phone conversation with Lahoud,
was "unequivocal in admitting that Israel is violating the Lebanese
border and expressed admiration of Lebanon's stance."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said Annan asserted "absolute confidence" that the
Israelis would definitely withdraw from the violated border
locations despite their current procrastination tactics.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon accused Israel of still occupying 16 points of its
border, after the U.N. has verified the Israeli total withdrawal
from south Lebanon last month. Lebanon is also dissatisfied with
the "blue line" (the U.N.-marked line of the Israeli withdrawal),
saying it does not accord with the international recognized border
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli warplanes violated Lebanese skies by flying over
Beirut Thursday noon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah group said on Wednesday
that time was running out for ending Israel's border violations
through diplomacy, warning that military reprisals could not be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah said in an
interview carried by local newspaper As Safir Wednesday that he had
ordered his guerrillas in south Lebanon to "cease firing until
further notice".
</P>
<P>
Over the future of Lebanese-Syrian relations under the new
Syrian leadership, Lahoud said that the full coordination and
cooperation between the two countries in late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad's lifetime will be continued under his son, Bashar
al-Assad, who is expected to be the new Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
Bashar was "fully committed to his father's policies, especially
to what concerns full support to Lebanon in all fields," Lahoud
said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Ruling Party Confirms Commitment to Occupied Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Syria's ruling Baath Arab
Socialist Party reaffirmed commitment to the issue of the Israeli-
occupied territories, saying it is a national right endorsed and
recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Baath party, carried Thursday by the Arab
Syrian News Agency, stressed the "firm and solid" stance of Syria
regarding the issue based on relevant United Nations resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by the ninth conference of the Baath
party held on June 17-20 in the Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East should be
based on the Israeli pullout from all occupied Arab territories and
guaranteeing the Palestinian legitimate rights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"When Israel is committed to the pullout from the whole Golan
Heights to the June 4 (1967) lines, it will find that Syria is
ready to be involved in the peace process to achieve its
objectives," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations have remained stalled since
January due to Syria's insistence on Israel's pledge to a complete
withdrawal from the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in the 1967
war.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi trade ministry on Thursday
lashed out at the United States and Britain for shelving contracts
it signed with foreign countries under the fifth, sixth and seventh
phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the trade ministry said that the U.S. and
British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee have blocked 17
contracts Iraq signed with other countries to import oil spare
parts, electrical equipment and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the contracts were signed with Italian,
Austrian, Swedish, Belgian, German, French, Egyptian and Jordanian
companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the U.S. and Britain for impeding
the implementation of the humanitarian oil-for-food program by
blocking its contracts.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, launched in 1996 and now in its eighth phase,
Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for its 22-
million people reeling under the stringent U.N. sanctions which
have been in place since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has acknowledged that the
holds of the contract applications have had a direct negative
impact on the U.N. oil-for-food program and on the efforts to
reconstruct Iraq's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Russia, India Speak Against ABM, Intensify Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia and India said here Thursday
that they oppose the U.S. plan to deploy a missile defense system
anywhere in the world, vowing to consolidate bilateral operation
in military and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and New Delhi "express serious concern over the U.S.
plan to deploy a national or a theater anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
defense system, which will break the 1972 ABM treaty," Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told the press after a meeting with
his Indian counterpart George Fernandes, who arrived here Monday
for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions (of the U.S.), in our view, could limit the
prospects for further nuclear disarmament, significantly weaken
the nuclear non-proliferation regime and push the nuclear powers
into revising their plans on modernizing strategic armaments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Such U.S. steps as withdrawing from the ABM treaty could result
in"an uncontrollable nuclear arms race and a threat to peace and
security worldwide," Sergeyev stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister, for his part, spoke in favor of the
existing global nuclear weapons balance. Washington should see
that "the huge amount of money it intends to spend on this plan
could be much better and more useful if spent on providing aid to
developing countries,"Fernandes noted.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the joint Russian-U.S. center for ballistic
missile launch information "will do no harm to the security
interests of third countries, including India."
</P>
<P>
This center, to which Russia and the U.S. agreed during U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow in early June to set up
in ten months,will only monitor the launches of Russian and
American intercontinental ballistic missiles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed bilateral military cooperation,
signed a protocol on the results of the visit by Fernandes to
Russia,a document on further expansion of military and military-
technical cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
By the protocol, a Russian-Indian committee for military-
technical issues will be created, Fernandes told the press.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov and Fernandes have
been appointed as its co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin received Fernandes
and they discussed Russian-Indian political cooperation on the
international scene, military- technical cooperation, measures
against international terrorism and global strategic stability,
said the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the Moscow trip by Fernandes is to prepare
for Putin's visit to New Delhi on October 2-4, deputy chief of the
Kremlin staff Sergei Prikhodko told a news briefing.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Leader Calls for World Support to Djibouti on Somalia  (Updated with more quotes, background information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Thursday called on the international community to assist Djibouti
financially in its peace initiative for Somalia in a bid to
restore peace in the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
Kieran Prendergast, U.N. under-secretary-general for political
affairs, made the statement as he was briefing an open Security
Council debate on the current political and security situation in
Somalia, the first of its kind in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Djibouti has made commendable efforts to assist the people of
Somalia to resolve their conflict by peaceful means," he said,
adding that Djibouti has almost entirely financed the Somalia
peace meeting, and this turned out to be "an intolerable burden."
</P>
<P>
Initiated by Bjibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh, the
warring Somali parties convened a peace meeting at Arta, 30
kilometers south of the capital Djibouti, to elect a parliament
which would select an interim Somali president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the 13th of its kind initiated by the Djibouti
president, started on May 2, and has attracted considerable
support from the international community and Somalia's civil
society. However, it was bitterly opposed by the principal
warlords in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in the June 16 statement,
said here that he was "encouraged" by news the Somalia National
Peace Conference had moved into its second phase.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that, so far, the Conference has been almost
entirely financed by Djibouti," he said. "This is placing an
intolerable burden on a small State," Prendergast said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the international community to consider
seriously how to assist Djibouti in its peace initiative for
Somalia, especially in material ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Djibouti initiative, which has relied on Somalia's
traditional system of clans in organizing the Conference, appears
to be on the right track," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the support of this Council would offer the
best deterrence against capacity to profit from disorder are
threatened by a move towards peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of those who remain outside the peace process in Somalia, by
far "the most serious obstacles" are presented by the two "
building blocks," the self-styled "Somaliland" and "Puntland," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"What is taking place in Djibouti is a unique political
experience for Somalia: this is the first time that Somali elders
from all parts of Somalia have met; the first time that
representatives of the grass-roots, of almost all clans, have
discussed ways and means of rebuilding their country in a process
based on consensus-building from the bottom up, and the first time
that Somali women have been actively involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although Djibouti is acting as host and facilitator, the
process is Somali-owned, and that is very important," he added.
</P>
<P>
Due to lengthy conflict and drought in the country, Somalia is
suffering humanitarian crisis at the moment.But there is no
sufficient guarantee for safety and security of the international
humanitarian workers in the country.
</P>
<P>
A week of fictional clashes in southern Somalia's Lower
Shabelle region has left 58 people dead, many of them noncombatant
civilians, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The violence, which flared up Thursday, was sparked by
allegations that members of the Garre subclan had been stealing
cattle from their Gido neighbors during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a central government since the
overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, and is wracked
by conflict between rival clans and warlords.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Full Participation of Somali Factions in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday strongly
urged the Somali faction leaders, who remain outside the peace
process, to join the others in the peace efforts to end conflict
and restore stability in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council debate on Somalia, first of its kind at the 15-
nation Council in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China "strongly urge those leaders of the main factions of
Somalia who have stayed away from the National Peace Conference to
demonstrate necessary political courage and political wisdom and
take part in the peace process," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Any action detrimental to the attainment of peace in Somalia
will be rejected by the Somali people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of those who remain outside the peace process, by far the most
serious obstacles are presented by the two "building blocks," the
self-styled "Somaliland" and "Puntland," Kieran Prendergast, U.N.
under-secretary-general for political affairs, told the Security
Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders refused to join the peace efforts
initiated by the Djibouti president.
</P>
<P>
The Somalia National Peace Conference had moved into its
second phase by the peace meeting which started on May 2 in
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
China spoke highly of the Djibouti president and government in
its painstaking efforts to bring peace into Somalia, he said. "The
entire people of Djibouti support the process of Somalia and has
made very valuable contribution to this process."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the international community to provide all
necessary assistance to Djibouti so as to successfully implement
the initiative of Djibouti President (Ismail Omar) Guelleh," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the sanctions against Somalia, Wang said, "The effective
implementation of the arms embargo will doubtlessly promote the
peace process in Somalia. However, for too long, the relevant
sanctions have not been implemented."
</P>
<P>
"We hope this situation will be rectified as soon as possible,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> New Microrobots Might Manipulate Single Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Tiny, submersible robots may
suggest a single-cell retrieval system, desktop biofactories, or
even tools for minimally invasive surgery, according to a report
to be published in June 30 journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The new microrobots, 670 micrometers tall and 170 to 240
micrometers wide, are shorter than a hyphen and no wider than a
period. Unlike many previous designs, the Swedish-made microrobots
can function in salty broths, blood, urine, cell-culture medium
and other liquids, suggesting a host of biotechnology uses.
</P>
<P>
"Being able to manipulate many individual cells at the same time
is becoming increasingly important for genomics, proteomics, and
metabolic research," says Edwin W.H. Jager, a graduate student at
Sweden's Linkopings University and lead author of the Science
paper.
</P>
<P>
The microrobots successfully moved a bead up to 250 micrometers.
They also hoisted beads 270 micrometers, from one miniature
conveyor belt or "track" to another, proving their potential as
tiny factory workers. Treated with adhesion molecules, the robot's
fingers might select particular cells or bacteria from a sample,
or they might support surgical procedures. In addition, the
Science authors say, an array of microrobots could simultaneously
handle many cells.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with a multisensor area, the microrobots also may
suggest lab-on-a-chip designs, or "factory-on-a-desk" tools,
programmed to assemble various microstructures,
Positioned at the end of a catheter, the polymer-and-gold
microrobots might increase the range of surgeons, too.
</P>
<P>
How do the microrobots work? Imagine a human hand, opening and
closing. Similarly, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole can be
forced to shrink and swell on command. The researchers combine
layers of gold and polypyrrole, then use electricity to manipulate
contractions of the polymer.
</P>
<P>
To make the microrobot grab a glass bead, for instance,
researchers plump up the polymer by drawing positively charged
ions, called cations, away from an electrolyte solution and into
the material. Shrinking the polymer is as easy as applying a
positive charge to the gold, which oxidizes the polypyrrole and
causes cautions to flee.
</P>
<P>
Previous microrobots including electronic devices featuring rods
and levers, artificial flying insects made of polysilicon, and a
walking silicon microrobot. But, "none of these operate in water,
and would not be suitable as microactuators for the manipulation
of cells," Jager notes.
</P>
<P>
Whenever pure silicon is exposed, he explains, it oxidizes and
stops working. In the new design, silicon provides a skeletal
framework, which is encased and protected by gold and polypyrrole
"micromuscles."
</P>
<P>
"We think that these microrobots would be helpful for
fundamental studies, or for manufacturing other small devices,
especially if we set up arrays of them." Jager wrote.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition to Stop Land Reform Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) will block any further constitutional
amendments concerning land reform, MDC Secretary for Lands Tendai
Biti said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Biti, who is also new member of Parliament, said that land
should be distributed according to guidelines in the MDC
manifesto.
</P>
<P>
"They have amended the constitution, but not other legislation
like the Land Amendment Act of 1992. We will not allow them to
bulldoze it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament amended the constitution early this year to allow
the government to acquire land for resettlement without paying
for the soil, but for structures at the farms.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has indicated that there is need for
other legislation dealing with land reform to be amended to
become in line with the amended constitution.
</P>
<P>
At least 804 farms have been targeted for acquisition to start
at the end of this month when their owners would have responded
to the acquisition notice.
</P>
<P>
The MDC, the country's largest opposition party, proposes the
institution of land tax in its manifesto to raise funds for
compensating the farmers and finance land reform.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes the setting up of a Land Commission that would
be made up of different interest groups to spearhead the land
reform process.
</P>
<P>
The MDC won 57 seats out of the possible 120 contested
constituencies during last weekend's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe would appoint 30 more members of Parliament to
consolidate his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf) domination in Parliament.
</P>

KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of voters Thursday morning
lined up at a polling station at the Railway Zone in the Ugandan
capital Kampala, quietly waiting for their turn to get ballot
papers on which there are a " Bus" and a "Dove", symbols for the
Movement and the Multi-party respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution requires that a national referendum be held on
Thursday for Ugandans to determine which of the two systems, the
Multi-party System or the Movement System, will be adopted by the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 Million of registered voters went to 16,500 polling
stations on Thursday across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala District, a total of 498,510 registered voters are
expected to vote at more than 1,000 polling stations, according to
the voters' registration list issued by the National Electoral
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"I vote for the Movement System, for the National Resistance
Movement has achieved positive performance in economic and social
sectors since it came to power in 1986," said the 20-year-old
Kalungi Isa.
</P>
<P>
Isa reported his identification in the voters' roll and get a
ballot paper at one of the four tables. Moving to the second,
about 10 meters away from the first, he ducked himself in the
basin on the table and fixed a tick. After putting his vote in the
ballot box on the third table, he had his thumb dipped into
indelible ink on the fourth table, indicating he has cast his vote
and will never be allowed to vote again.

"I was born in 1972. The economy of the country was worsening
before the Movement took over the power. I have seen the country
moving forward in various sectors under the Movement
administration," said Nbasa Julius, a graduate of the
country-known University of Makerere.
</P>
<P>
The Market Street at the downtown which is usually busy and
bustling appeared quiet. A dozen of voters were moving toward the
ballot table. One middle-age woman said after casting her vote, "I
prefer the Movement System. If the Multi-party System is adopted,
the country would be divided."
</P>
<P>
After the Movement took over power in 1986, a majority of
Ugandans preferred the Movement while some people wanted a
multi-party system. The idea of holding a referendum to decide
future political system is contained in the constitution which
recognizes people's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A 53-year-old man, who cast his vote for the Multi-party System
at 7:30 this morning, said, "This is an unfair contest. Opposition
parties in this country have boycotted the referendum, and many
supporters of the Multi- party have not come out to vote."
</P>
<P>
"The country should adopt the Multi-party System which could
put different views from various parties into the policies of the
government," said the man. "The Movement System is a dictatorship.
Although the Movement is said non-partisan, it will become a party
in future, maybe in 2001," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ssemogerere, the opposition Democratic Party chief, has
urged Ugandans to boycott the referendum, saying that the
referendum has been rigged and the results are already known.
</P>
<P>
"The Multi-party System is good, but it is not mature for the
country to adopt this political system," said the middle-age
Kahumuza Hannington. "The opposition parties in the country are
weak, and there are no strong leaders, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"The votes for the Multi-party System are estimated at 15 or 25
percent of the total. Most of Ugandans trust the Movement,
because of its administration the country has made great progress
in various fields, including education, health, economy,
infrastructure and agriculture," said Kariisa Richard, a student
of Social Sciences Department of the Makerere University.

<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has
announced that more than 200 U.N. peacekeeping troops still being
held hostage by Sierra Leonean rebels are about to be released.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) Thursday quoted the
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah as saying in Freetown
that the U.N. peacekeepers, some of whom are Indians, should be
released by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is the main backer of rebels of Sierra Leone's
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and has already obtained the
release of hundreds of U.N. personnel taken hostage by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The information minister said Liberian President Charles Taylor
had recently received envoys from the United Nations and India and
was asked to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah said the imminent release of the remaining peacekeepers
was part of a deal under which the Sierra Leonean rebels have been
promised a ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels originally took hostage about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers in May.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek and Turkish Cypriot parties
Thursday held a meeting in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in
Nicosia to promote communication and the spirit of understanding
between the island's two communities.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, representatives from five Greek
Cypriot parties and four Turkish Cypriot parties attend the meeting
at the Ledra Palace hotel, which was organized by the embassy of
the Slovak Republic in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The participants decided to organize a "festival of mutual
understanding" between the two communities in September at the
Ledra Palace, said a communique. A coordinating committee will be
set up to deal with details of the festival.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the parties, in a cordial and constructive
atmosphere, continued an exchange of ideas on certain practical
issues of contacts between the two communities as well as of views
on the various aspects of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for years to bring the two
sides back together in a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula,
but little progress has so far achieved.
</P>

In recent months the Slovak embassy here has organized regular
meetings at the Ledra Palace hotel between party leaders from the
two sides.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
on Thursday called for constitutional reforms to promote the rule
of law so as to better accommodate international conventions, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Constitutional Reform in Turkey:
Principles and Results", Sezer urged constitutional reforms so as
to preserve human rights and freedom in the country in accordance
with universal standards.
</P>
<P>
The current Turkish Constitution was adopted in 1982, in a
period of military rule following a coup in September, 1980. This
constitution replaced the Constitution of 1961, which was also
drafted following a military coup.
</P>
<P>
However, under the 1961 Constitution, a system of checks and
balances had limited the authority of the government, the power of
the president was curtailed, and individual rights and liberties
were given greater emphasis, the president said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the 1982 Constitution expands the authority of the
president and restricts the exercise of individual and
associational rights.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been urging Turkey, which is striving for
the EU membership, to improve human rights conditions to meet the
Copenhagen criteria required by the EU of its full members.
</P>
<P>
Sezer, the former presiding judge of the Constitutional Court,
has vowed to modify the 1982 Constitution in a bid to speed up the
country's accession process to the European club.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that some articles of the 1982 Constitution which
are in conflict with the rule of law, democracy, basic rights and
freedoms should be modified.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that such initiatives will be supported. "
I think that such a conference will be effective in making our
constitution emphasize freedom and spread the democratic culture,"
he said.

JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A ship carrying hundreds of
refugees sank in Sahu waters in Indonesia's North Sulawesi on
Thursday afternoon and it was not clear whether anyone had
survived, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Indonesian officials as saying that the
ferry was built to hold 200 passengers but around 500 were
believed to have been aboard after 290 Maluku refugees fought
their way on to the ship on the Halmahera island, North Maluku,
scene of bloody communal clashes this month.

The ship left Tobelo on Halmahera en route to Manado, capital
of North Sulawesi. The ship sank about 64 kilometers off the North
Sulawesi coast, about 1,365 kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that rescuers suspended the search for
survivors as night fell on Thursday because they lacked proper
equipment to continue.

<HEADLINE> IBM New Technology Doubles Computer Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a news release reaching here Thursday, the company said the
technology, named IBM Memory eXpansion Technology, could
eventually be adapted for personal computers and e-business
devices. It is initially designed for Intel-based industry-
standard PC servers.
</P>
<P>
With the technology, customers can either cut costs by buying
half the memory to achieve the same performance, or they can
increase performance by installing the same amount of memory to
achieve twice the capacity. The savings can be significant for
both small and large customers, as memory comprises 40 to 70
percent of the cost of most servers.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, which effectively doubles the memory
capacity of a machine, is a hardware implementation that
automatically stores frequently accessed data and instructions
close to a computer's microprocessors so they can be accessed
immediately -- significantly improving performance. Less
frequently accessed data and instructions are compressed and
stored in memory instead of on a disk, thus increasing memory
capacity by a factor of two or more.
</P>
<P>
It incorporates a new level of cache designed to handle data
and instructions on a memory controller chip. By combining new
hardware-based compression algorithms and millions of tiny
transistors, IBM researchers were able to double server memory
capacity for most applications.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Up by 5.5 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased at a
robust 5.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000, but a
key inflation gauge posted the biggest gain in more than five
years, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter growth in the gross domestic product (GDP),
the nation's total output of goods and services, showed the
economy growing slightly faster than the 5.4 percent rate of the
government's two previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the economy grew at a sizzling 7.3
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP and closely watched by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan rose at an annual rate of
3.5 percent in the first quarter. That was the biggest increase
since 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The inflation figure was slightly higher than the government
estimated one month ago and significantly above the 2.5 percent of
the fourth quarter. Surging energy prices accounted for most of
the gain.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of the year, the economy had been
propelled by hardy consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in the first quarter grew at a 7.7 percent
rate, the strongest since the second quarter of 1983. Spending was
slightly more brisk than the government previously estimated and
was considerably stronger than the 5.9 percent rate in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The spending pushed the nation's savings rate, savings as a
percentage of disposable income, down to a quarterly low of 0.3
percent, worse than the government's previous estimate and down
from the previous all-time low of 1.8 percent recorded in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumer will continue spending,
boosted investment in new equipment and plants in the first
quarter by a rate of 23.7 percent, a little less than previously
estimated but much stronger than the 2.9 percent rate in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on growth.
Imports rose at an 11.7 percent rate, up from an 8.7 percent rate
in the fourth quarter, while exports grew at a 6.2 percent rate,
down from a 10.1 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, businesses increased their inventories by 28 billion
U.S. dollars in the first quarter, down from 66.7 billion dollars
in the fourth quarter. The change in inventories subtracted 1.54
percentage points from the first-quarter GDP growth, compared with
the contribution of 1.24 percentage points to the fourth-quarter
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the past 12 months in an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation from escalating. The Fed, amid signs of a slowing
economy, decided Wednesday not to boost rates for a seventh time
but left the door open should inflation worsen.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe the Fed may push rates higher at its
August 22 meeting. They said the Fed doesn't want a repeat of the
last two years, when growth slowed in the spring only to
reaccelerate sharply for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Many economists estimate the economy may have slowed to a 4
percent rate or less in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
The GDP report also showed that after-tax profits of U.S.
corporations grew by 5.8 percent in the first quarter, a better
performance than the government previously thought and up from a 2.
7 percent increase in the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the
United States fell 0.2 percent in May from April to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 875,000 units, the lowest level in eight
months, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sales in April dropped a revised 8.6 percent to 877,000 units,
compared with the initial estimate of a 5.8 percent decline to 909,
000.
</P>
<P>
The month-by-month decrease in new-home sales suggested that
the Federal Reserve's higher interest rates over the past year
have been sapping the demand for new homes.
</P>
<P>
Home sales in May were down 2.3 percent compared to a year ago'
s 896,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The median sales price of a new home rose 3.1 percent to 165,
000 U.S. dollars in May from the revised 160,000 dollars in April.
The average sales price fell 3.5 percent to 201,300 dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the May sales pace, the nation's inventory of 322,000 unsold
new homes at the end of May would last 4.5 months, up from 4.4 in
April.

Kieran Prendergast, U.N. under-secretary-general for political
affairs, made the statement as he was briefing an open Security
Council debate on the current political and security situation in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Djibouti has made commendable efforts to assist the people of
Somalia to resolve their conflict by peaceful means," he said,
adding that Djibouti has almost entirely financed the Somalia
peace meeting, and this turned out to be "an intolerable burden."
</P>
<P>
Initiated by Bjibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh, the
warring Somali parties convened a peace meeting at Arta, 30
kilometers south of the capital Djibouti, to elect a parliament
which would select an interim Somali president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the 13th of its kind initiated by the Djibouti
president, started on May 2, and has attracted considerable
support from the international community and Somalia's civil
society. However, it was bitterly opposed by the principal
warlords in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in the June 16 statement,
said here that he was "encouraged" by news the Somalia National
Peace Conference had moved into its second phase.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that, so far, the Conference has been almost
entirely financed by Djibouti," he said. "This is placing an
intolerable burden on a small State," Prendergast said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the international community to consider
seriously how to assist Djibouti in its peace initiative for
Somalia, especially in material ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Djibouti initiative, which has relied on Somalia's
traditional system of clans in organizing the Conference, appears
to be on the right track," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Health Ministers Adopt New Anti-Tobacco Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) health
ministers adopted Thursday a more strict anti-tobacco proposal,
which introduces new anti-smoking labeling rules and a cutting of
the maximum amount of tar and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for health and consumer protection David Byrne
said he was very pleased to see the proposal has received strong
support from both the EU ministerial meeting and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that one of the major health challenges of the
new millennium is to reduce the appalling and entirely preventable
death toll from smoking," he said and called the agreement reached
in Luxembourg "an important step forward."
</P>
<P>
The proposal, now going back to the European Parliament for
final ratification, could force companies to print health warnings
covering almost half of a pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
It will also force cigarette makers to reduce the amount of tar
and nicotine in cigarette. The maximum amount of tar per
cigarette was cut from 12 to 10 milligrams, while the maximum
amount of nicotine to 1 milligrams and carbon monoxide 10
milligrams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agreement introduces a prohibition of misleading
claims such as "light," "low tar" and "mild".
</P>
<P>
The health ministers agreed those measures should apply to all
products including that to be consumed in third countries so that
smokers in those countries should not be exposed to tobacco
products which do not meet the EU standards.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 EU citizens die of smoking-related disease every
year, and more than 85 percent of new smokers of EU start smoking
before the age of 18.

<HEADLINE> Modern Technology Ensures Preservation of Dunhuang Grottos (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the founding of new China, many caves in the grottoes
were tumble-down and vulnerable to natural and man-made damage.
Since 1950, the Chinese central government has launched a range of
repair projects on the 1,600-year-old site, which was put on the
World Heritage List by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization in 1987.
</P>
<P>
First, the sand dunes that had collected in front of the
grottoes were cleared away, then the hillside grottoes were
harnessed with reinforcing steel and limestone bars. Many wooden
footbridges were also built to link the caves and tighten the
stability of the grotto hill.
</P>
<P>
In the past half century, no reports on grotto collapse or
landslide have come from the site.
</P>
<P>
"We also use the chemical grouting technology to control rock
cracking," he said. As a result, the Mogao Grottoes can survive an
earthquake measuring up to seven on the Richter scale, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Mogao Grottoes have long been threatened by shifting sands from
Mingsha Hill, which is only 1,500 meters from the caves.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Research Academy and the Getty Conservation
Institute of the United States jointly conducted a three-phase
project to stop the sand from reaching the caves.
</P>
<P>
The first step was to grow some desert plants at the foot of
Mingsha Hill to keep the sand in place. Nylon fencing was erected
around the caves in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
The final weapon used to curb soil erosion and drifting sand
was silicon emulsion, which was sprayed to fix the sandy surface
onto the top of the caves, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
So far, the project has helped reduce the annual amount of sand
invading the cave area by 70 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
To repair grotto frescoes plagued by mold, fading and cracks,
Chinese archaeologists and foreign experts have used high-
precision equipment to analyze fresco paint and sculpture
structure.
</P>
<P>
Using art preservation techniques, the experts have repaired
over 3,000 square meters of damaged frescoes, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese archaeologists are researching computer data
to reveal the original color and appearance of the Dunhuang
frescoes.
</P>
<P>
"Through computer-simulated caves, people can experience a
lifelike scene from one thousand years ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Detailed information about the grottoes will be stored in
computers so that future generations all over the world can have
the chance to enjoy the wonderful frescos from ancient times, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Modern Technology Ensures Preservation of Dunhuang Grottoes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The 735 caves of the world-famous
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, west China's Gansu Province, remain
safe and sound after severe floods pounded them last Saturday,
only two days after the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the
"Sutras Cave."
</P>
<P>
Wang Wanfu, deputy director of the Conservation Institute of
the Dunhuang Research Academy, a center of Dunhuang studies, said
that the flooding was caused by heavy rain which poured into the
dry channel of the Daquan River in front of the Mogao Grotto Cliff.
</P>
<P>
"The one meter high flood destroyed a major bridge nearby,"
Wang said, but the Mogao Grottoes stayed intact thanks to the
effective protection system in place at the relic site.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have invested more than 100 million
yuan (12 million U.S. dollars) to protect the Mogao Grottoes since
the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have been successful in protecting the world-
class heritage relics from being damaged by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Located at the west end of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province,
Dunhuang was once an important cultural and trade city along the
Silk Road linking Central Asia with China.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang attracts visitors mainly because it contains some of
the most priceless examples of Buddhist art in the world: the
Mogao Caves, which were carved out of the rocks, stretching for
about 1,600 meters along the eastern side of the Sanwei Hill, 25
km southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The caves have preserved numerous frescos dating back to eleven
dynasties from the 4th to 14th centuries and covering an area of
45,000 square meters. They contain more than 2,000 colored
sculptured figures and five wooden eaves hanging over the entrance
of the caves.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said the caves are the greatest and most
consummate repository of Buddhist art in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Zuixiong, vice-president of the Dunhuang Research Academy,
said that Chinese archaeologists are trying to adopt all possible
protective measures and advanced technology to protect the site,
including desert control, cliff reinforcement, sculpture
preservation, and fresco repair.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they have developed a series of high-tech
methods including the computerized fresco repair, computer-
simulated caves and database information, Li said, adding that
these techniques will help reproduce lifelike Dunhuang art for
posterity.

<HEADLINE> HK Wishes to Expand Trade With Spain: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- There is much room for the
expansion of bilateral trade between the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Spain, HKSAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet held in honor of visiting Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Tung said the volume of trade between
Hong Kong and Spain amounted to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there is a lot more room for expansion," he said. He
welcomed "more Spanish companies to invest in or locate their
operations in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong will celebrate the third anniversary of its
return to the motherland in two days, Tung said he hoped the
Spanish prime minister will be able to see how Hong Kong "is
moving ahead confidently and proudly" under the unique concept of
"One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Hong Kong people have been
successfully running Hong Kong under the unprecedented concept of
"One Country, Two Systems" with a high degree of autonomy as
stipulated in the Basic Law, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish prime minister arrived in Hong Kong Wednesday
evening following a visit to the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Ranks Low in Human Development Index: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal ranks 144 in terms of
human development out of 174 countries and regions included in the
Human Development Report 2000 commissioned by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal's ranking is the same as last year, its Human
Development Index (HDI) value has increased to 0.474 from 0.463
last year, said Saraswathi Menon, resident representative of UNDP,
while launching the report here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among Asian countries and regions, Nepal's HDI remains second
to Bangladesh from the bottom, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The report puts Nepal's poverty rate at 51.3 percent, one of
the eight countries in the world where more than half of the
population suffer from human poverty," said Menon.
</P>
<P>
Menon said that while the incidence of human poverty in Nepal
is the highest in South Asia, Nepal's income inequalities are vast.
</P>
<P>
"The poorest 20 percent of the population earn less than 8
percent of national income, while the richest 20 percent earn
nearly 50 percent," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In gender related development, Nepal is the only country in
the world where female life expectancy is lower than that of males,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
The report records that Nepal's female life expectancy is 57.6
years, while male's is 58.1 years. The average life expectancy in
Nepal is 57.8 years, which is 4.2 years lower than the average in
all south Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
While Nepal's male literacy is 62 percent, its female literacy
is only 28 percent, one of the lowest in the world, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the low socio-economic status of Nepalese women,
who are more discriminated and marginalized, and are excluded from
many basic rights," said Menon.
</P>
<P>
Menon said concerted efforts have to be made to improve the
socio-economic status of women and other marginalized group.
</P>
<P>
"Human Development Report 2000 is a call to action on many
fronts: the importance of legal frameworks and the critical need
to focus on the most deprived, to name a few," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's Human Development Index measures a country's
achievements in terms of life expectancy, educational attainment
and adjusted real income.

<HEADLINE> Russia Predicts End of Battle in Chechnya's Serzhen-Yurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that the
battle near the village of Serzhen-Yurt in southern Chechnya will
come to an end later Thursday after four days of fighting, with
most besieged Chechen rebels being wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The military operations conducted by the Russian forces near
the Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt, where a large rebel group has
been surrounded, "will come to an end today," Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev told the press in Moscow Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergeyev denied the "heavy losses" on the part of
federal troops as reported by West media.
</P>
<P>
"There are some 150-200 fighters in this surrounded rebel group,
mainly Arab mercenaries, putting up a desperate resistance," he
said, confirming that the federal forces lost only 12 men in the
past three days of fighting but killed "scores of " rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also denied reports by some foreign news agencies that
Chechen guerrillas had wiped out a Russian convoy near the village
of Yarysh-Mardy, killing 50 servicemen in the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Interfax news agency on Thursday cited the
headquarters of the Russian forces in the North Caucasus as saying
that over 120 rebels have been killed in the fighting near Serzhen-
Yurt.
</P>
<P>
The Russian air forces have been keeping their attack on the
rebel group surrounded near Serzhen-Yurt, as the militants have
been trying to break through the federal encirclement, said the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"They suffered big losses to find there is no way to escape,"
said an officer at the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The office of Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russian presidential aide
on Chechnya, informed journalists that no Russian military losses
in Chechnya were reported over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The office also denied reports that large rebel formations have
concentrated outside Gudermes, the second biggest Chechen city,
describing this information as "untrue."

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Stresses Soil and Water Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng
today stressed that as China is facing shortages of both arable
land and water resources, soil and water preservation has become
more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting hosted by the Agriculture and Rural
Affairs Committee under the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
and the Ministry of Water Resources, the Chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee said that the protection of water and land
resources is vital for preserving quality living conditions for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Law on Soil and Land Conservation is a prelude
to the country's sustainable economic development strategy. China
should adopt all possible means to carry out comprehensive
treatment of the soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
He said that soil erosion has caused devastating sandstorms and
is becoming one of the major restrictive factors to the country's
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The scale of dust, sand and wind storms has increased since the
start of the 1990s. Li said that the ongoing project of returning
farmland to forest and grassland is of vital importance to fight
the disasters.
</P>
<P>
He asked the officials to strictly carry out the environmental
project with priority given to the river source areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that the State Council has worked out a series of
policies and regulations on water and soil protection. The work
has been reinforced in the country's strategic plan to develop the
vast western areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that high technology should be introduced in the
agriculture production in dry land, which is expected to help
combine the work on preventing desertification with poverty-
elimination projects.
</P>

Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, delivered a
report on violations of the environmental law at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tibetan Buddhist Seclusion in Roaring Downtown (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Wearing a yellow cassock and
prayer beads around his neck, Danzhub Rompa, a living Buddha and
associate research fellow at the Beijing-based High-Level Tibetan
Buddhism College of China, speaks softly.
</P>
<P>
"Students here are devoted to studying Buddhist doctrines. The
only thing secular in their curricula is the study of state laws
and regulations on religion," he says.
</P>
<P>
While city life rages on outside the red walls of the 350-year-
old monastery, the hush of serenity resonates within. Hallways are
decorated in the colorful Tibetan style. A white Pagoda used to
store the scriptures and clothes of the Sixth Panchen Lama stands
majestic, and the golden Sanskrit inscriptions above the gate of
the main hall are dazzling.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhism College, the top academy of its kind, was
initiated by the Tenth Panchen Lama. Set up in 1987, it is
designed to train reincarnated living Buddhas and high-level
Buddhist scholars for teaching and research, international
Buddhism exchanges and temple management.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the Dalai Lama clique's recent remarks about
the "extinction of Tibetan culture," living Buddha Danzhub said, "
Dalai simply turns a blind eye to the remarkable progress of Tibet
in the past 40 years, including the inheritance and development of
Buddhist cultural heritage."
</P>
<P>
He noted that by reforming its traditional teaching methods, in
which students were tutored only in a particular field of
knowledge, the college now uses modern teaching and management
approaches.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move has drawn together living Buddhas from
different sects of Tibetan Buddhism to carry out joint studies in
Buddhism. This has improved their mutual understanding, and
centuries-old sect conflicts have disappeared.

<P>
"This is a pioneering undertaking in the teaching of the
Tibetan Buddhism, and marks a great achievement in Tibetan
Buddhism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, Dalai still keeps on rumoring that Tibetan
Buddhism in China is under threat, but actually, his ultimate goal
is to fawn on the foreign anti-China forces in pursuit of Tibet's
independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the courses at the college are Buddhism-
related, and all the lecturers are well-educated lamas especially
invited from leading Tibetan temples.
</P>
<P>
The living Buddha admitted that Tibetan Buddhism is faced with
the problem common to all religions across the globe: the younger
generation of disciples tend to be more secularized. This is the
inevitable result of social and economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In old Tibet, when the feudal serf system prevailed, the only
alternative for the children from poverty-stricken families to
making a living was to become a lama. Nowadays, the improvement of
living standards offers them more choices. Dalai Lama's attempt to
reverse the trends and resume the feudal serf system in Tibet is
doomed to fail," the living Buddha said.
</P>
<P>
Dalai Lama also labels the increase of economic and cultural
exchanges between Tibetans and the Han people as an assimilation
of Tibetan ethnic people. He even says that Tibetans' option to
learn Chinese is endangering the unique Tibetan cultural tradition.
</P>
<P>
"But if you require your followers in exile learn English and
you yourself deliver speeches and sermons in English, aren't you
casting away the Tibetan culture?" the living Buddha Danzhub asked.
</P>
<P>
During summer vacation, the absence of students makes the
temple all the more tranquil. But another monastery nearby, the
Yonghe Gong Lamasery, is filled with pilgrims and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Losang Soidan, a 35-year-old lama, said that Yonghe Gong
Lamasery is the biggest Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Beijing,
where 100 lamas strictly practice the same Buddhist rites, sermons
and preaching as lamas in Tibet do.
</P>
<P>
"Every year the government allocates funds for the protection
of the cultural relics here. The cultural heritage of Tibetan
Buddhism is not damaged here, and on the contrary, it is fully
protected, inherited and developed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Urges Better Ideological and Political Work ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said today that the party should improve the
ideological and political education so as to rally the people for
advancing the socialist modernization drive in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
analyzed the complicated global and domestic circumstances and
stressed the importance of strengthening the ideological and
political work, Ding, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee and head of its Publicity Department, said at
the ideological and political work conference of the CPC Central
Committee, which ended this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks are strategies for the 21st Century meant to
blaze a new trail of ideological and political education for the
country, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang expounded on many basic theories and
practical issues of modern times, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, participants discussed Jiang's
remarks and exchanged good experience in various localities for
improving the ideological and political education.
</P>
<P>
The participants noted that the remarks constituted a
combination of Marxist-Leninist fundamental tenets and the
practice of China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th CPC National Congress in 1992, the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has adopted a series of
measures to enhance the ideological and political work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has said that the party's ideological and political work
is the lifeblood of the economy and all other undertakings, the
key to achieving the tasks of the party and the state, and the
major political advantage of the party and the socialist country.

<P>
In order to perfect the ideological and political work in the
country, the participants said, the party must carry forward its
outstanding traditions, adhere to Marxism, and fine-tune the
system for carrying out the work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party members and leading officials should study
the laws governing the ideological and political work and its
characteristics in the new situation, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
The party ought to focus on solving hot issues and difficult
problems for the people and effectively raise the quality of the
education work.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at various levels must do their utmost to
promote moral and political education, while all of society should
participate in the socialist education campaign, including party
organs, governments, trade unions and other public groups, the
participants said.
</P>
<P>
They said that all party members must fully understand the role
and importance of the ideological and political work in a
strategic and comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
The participants also suggested that in implementing the work
earnest efforts should be made to study the actual conditions in
the country, identify the hot issues, make short-term as well as
long-term arrangements for the education, and adopt practical
measures while making overall planning.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ding underscored that the enhancement of
ideological and political work is necessary for the drive of
deepening reform and open-up and developing the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The party must shoulder the heavy responsibility of cultivating
ideological and political understanding among the Chinese people
and mobilize them to devote themselves to the socialist
modernization drive, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Ranks 146th on UNDP Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh ranked 146th among 174
countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) report of the
United Nations Development Program released here Thursday, with an
improvement by 5 percent to 0.461 from 0.440 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The HDI ranking of Bangladesh among 174 countries has also
improved by 4 to 146 from 150. But the country rates lowest among
the South Asian countries, among which Sri Lanka ranks the highest
(84), followed by Maldives (89), India (128), Pakistan (135),
Bhutan (142) and Nepal (144).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the report, State Minister for
Planning Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir said this year's report has
combined human rights with human development for freedom and
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the report, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said the
country's HDI ranking was better than GDP ranking in the last
report.
</P>
<P>
He said the report made three references on Bangladesh - good,
bad and ugly.
</P>
<P>
The good one is that Bangladesh stands among the 25 countries
whose export growth average more than 10 percent annually. The bad
is serious inability of the court to provide timely remedy.
Bhattacharya observed domestic violence against women was referred
as "ugly" in the report.
</P>
<P>
He urged conscious citizens to exercise vigilance, articulate
priorities, monitor the activities of those who exercise
governmental powers.

<HEADLINE> Japan and U.S. Start Project to Help Health Care in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
under the name of population and health initiative of the US-Japan
common agenda, started a project Thursday in Cambodia to promote
health care in this country.
</P>
<P>
The team known as "a joint U.S. and Japan project formulation
mission on population and health" visited Cambodia from June 18,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The project will focus on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,
maternal and child health.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS epidemic is rapidly growing in Cambodia and the
government's anti-AIDS authority claims approximately 180,000
persons (approximately 3.7 percent of adults aged 15-49) have been
infected by HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan will actively seek ways to implement joint,
parallel or complementary activities, in support of the Royal
Government of Cambodia's national strategies, in an appropriate
and feasible time frame, said Kinichi Komano, director of research
and programming division of Japan's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is also in its highlight in Cambodia, claiming 10,
000 lives per year. Meanwhile, malaria continues to be a serious
threat to the health of Cambodians, especially women, children and
workers in forested regions, according to a statement released by
the team.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Foreign Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in 1993, the team
official said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the project has been carried out in Zambia and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia was chosen as the third country to implement
the project because of the situation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Stresses Relations Between Development, Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
Thursday that there exists a direct link between economic and
social development and human rights and that he indirectly
criticized some Western countries for imposing their doctrines on
others.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the United Nations Development Program (
UNDP) administrator Mark Malloch Brown at the Elysee presidential
palace, Chirac praised the UNDP for adopting a "pedagogical
approach" rather than one of simple criticism and condemnation
toward developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a direct link between democracy, freedom, good
government and development. The problem is not simply to impose a
culture concerning human rights on developing countries, but is to
explain to them the relations between development and human rights,
" said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France will continue to support the United Nations
in its efforts to help developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Terming the present aid volume provided by rich countries to
poor countries as "very insufficient," he said developed countries
should fulfill their 20-year-old promise to use at least 0.7
percent of their gross domestic product in aid programs for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP administrator on Thursday presented the French
president with an annual report on development around the world,
with its contents focusing on both development and human rights.
</P>
<P>
France refused to sign a declaration on the universal value of
democracy at an international conference on the subject held in
Warsaw early this week, reportedly because Paris did not wish to
see the conception of democracy be used as a political tool by
some people to interfere into others' internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Russia Toughens Mop-up As Chasing Dispersed Rebels in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops have strengthened
the searching of residential areas in Chechnya after the rebels
were surrounded and dispersed near the village of Serzhen-Yurt in
the south party of the war-torn republic this week, Russia news
agencies reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Individual rebel groups are trying to break through the
federal encirclement near the villages of Dzhugurty, Sayasan and
Ersenoi after sustaining heavy losses in the four-day bloody
battle near Serzhen-Yurt, Interfax cited the press center for
Russia's Combined Forces in Chechnya as saying.
</P>
<P>
The federal units killed more than 80 rebels and wounded
scores of the others in the fighting at a price of 12 dead and
dozens of injuries, said the press center.
</P>
<P>
The activities of illegal armed formations have also been
uncovered near the populated areas of Alleroi, Elistanzhi,
Selmentauzen and Makhkety, it said, adding that federal artillery
and air forces have been attacking the discovered rebel
concentrations and their bases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian troops and special police units are mopping
up other parts of the battered republic, where rebels' activities
are reported.
</P>
<P>
They have completely surrounded the village of Stariye Atagi,
a 15,000-resident town 20 kilometers south of Grozny, early
Thursday, as part of a new round of specially-targeted tasks, Itar-
Tass quoted Russian military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first mop-up of Stariye Atagi at the beginning of
this year, 80 people were held on suspicions of their involvement
in illegal armed formations with some arms seized, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Lately, Russian forces have conducted a series of mopping-up
operations in a number of other communities, including Alkhazurovo,
Duba-Yurt and Serzhen-Yurt, eliminating scores of militants and
mercenaries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Ironman A.C. Green was waived
by the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday after he won two
championship rings with the franchise in the 1980s and returned to
earn another this month.
</P>
<P>
Green, 36, who ran his league record for consecutive games to 1,
133 this season, averaged 5.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 23.5
minutes. In the playoffs, he averaged 3.9 points and 4.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"A.C. Green played an important role in helping us win the NBA
championship and has obviously meant a lot to this franchise over
the years," said Lakers Executive Vice President Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers re-acquired Green, who was on their "showtime"
championship teams in 1986 and 1987, from Dallas in exchange for
Sean Rooks last September. Green has been in the league for 15
seasons. He played for Phoenix after leaving the Lakers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He last missed a game on November 18, 1986, when then-Lakers
coach Pat Riley did not play him in Dallas. The previous mark for
consecutive games was 906 by Randy Smith.

<HEADLINE> Precipitation Does Little to Alleviate North China Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Though rain has fallen over much
of north China in recent days, it has done little to alleviate the
severe drought in the region, the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters said here today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the region in the Yellow River Valley received 50 mm of
rain at the beginning of June. However, the rainwater was not well-
retained, because of the lack of water conservation systems in the
area, said officials with the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The drought has affected some 10 million ha of farmland around
the country. Right now, 10.7 million people and 8.2 million
livestock are suffering from shortage of drinking water. China has
mobilized 40 million people to fight the drought.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River reaches are unlikely to receive large amounts
of precipitation in July and August to ease the drought, the
headquarters predicted.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains EU's Important Trade Partner: Envoy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is, and will continue
to be, the European Union's (EU) important trade partner in the
coming decade, said Ting David, the new envoy of the EU in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ting, head of the Office of EU's European Commission in Hong
Kong, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview on the eve of the
third anniversary of Hong Kong's return to its motherland that he
believed Hong Kong occupies an important place in EU's external
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The total trade between EU and Hong Kong in 1999 soured to 26.
257 billion euro (24.68 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for two
percent of EU's total trade. The EU's imports from Hong Kong last
year rose to 10.616 billion euro (10 billion U.S. dollars),
representing 1.4 percent of its total, while the exports to Hong
Kong surged to 15.64 billion euro (14.86 billion U.S. dollars), 2.
1 percent of the total EU export, according to Ting.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also an ideal place for EU companies, Ting said,
adding that as of June 1,1999, 253 EU companies were using Hong
Kong as their regional headquarters while 471 had regional offices
here.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong's business environment over the past
three years, Ting said he "has noticed the commitment taken by the
Chinese government to keep the business environment free as it was
before the handover."
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside suspicions about Hong Kong's future position as
an entrepot for Sino-EU trade, the envoy said he is quite
optimistic about Hong Kong's future after China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of a westerner, we do agree that China's
accession to the WTO will be very beneficial to the economy of
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ting believed the Hong Kong economy is mature enough to adapt
to the new situation, though there are fears that Hong Kong might
lose its role as a gateway from western countries to China.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Steams Ahead Despite Problems (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A SDPC estimate indicates that government investment accounted
for about 90 percent of the newly increased investment in the
country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu Jinglian, a renowned economist from the Development
Research Center (DRC) under the State Council, said that his
recent investigations in east China showed that the private
sectors are growing more interested in investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government adopts appropriate policies to
facilitate private investment, the private sectors will play a
greater role in sustaining rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Some local economists say that the country's struggle to fight
off deflation has produced a favorable opportunity. To prove their
point, they cited official figures showing that corporate profits
more than doubled as sales-production ratio surged to a new high
over the first five months of the year. The crop mix of the
farming industry has also improved and become increasingly market-
oriented.
</P>
<P>
However, some other economists pointed out that the surge of
corporate profits was mainly due to the international competition
and preferential government policies. Reduction of costs only
played a minimal role in boosting profits.
</P>
<P>
They noted that effects of economic restructuring on
stimulating consumer demand will take time to appear. Therefore,
in the short term, sustainable economic growth depends on the
increase of investment demand that was driven by government
investment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out in his government report
earlier this year that China will continue to carry out an active
fiscal policy so as to secure rapid and sustainable growth and
create favorable conditions for further restructuring the economy.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Steams Ahead Despite Problems (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to an analysis report by the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC), the economy is expected to grow 7.3
percent in the latter half of the year and reach an annual rate of
7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Chinese government's active fiscal
policy and improving international conditions have combined to
shove the economy forward.
</P>
<P>
Through issuing 100 billion yuan-worth of treasury bonds, the
Chinese government was able to boost investment in fixed assets by
a year-on-year 9.5 percent in the first five months of this year.
The endeavor also spurred domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Asian economies helped to push up the country's
foreign trade volume by 36.1 percent over the first five months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that China's economy has ducked out from
under the shadow of the Asian financial crisis and successfully
secured a rapid growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Director of the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS) Qiu Xiaohua said that people shouldn't be blindly optimistic
about prospects for the economy. As the country is struggling to
restructure its economy and set up a new mechanism of operation,
the problem of inadequate domestic demand has become more
prominent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer demand is playing an increasing but unsteady role in
promoting economic growth. From January to May, consumption of
energy, raw materials and cargo transport picked up pace, the
consumer price index stopped dropping, retail sales grew faster,
and consumer confidence climbed continuously.
</P>
<P>
However, seasonal factors played a major role in rise of prices.
And surges of imports were driven by quick growth of exports and
inflated prices of crude oil instead of domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Another annoying problem for the economists is to determine the
role private investment is playing in the economy. Since the
Chinese government has yet to compile statistics on investment
made by private and collective-owned companies, it is hard to
judge the effect that government investment has had on boosting
private investment.

"The Hong Kong people and the economy, in general, are very
quick to adapt to the new situation for the last decade, so I am
sure that Hong Kong will find a way to adapt once more, and adjust
once more its economy and its role with the Chinese mainland," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since 85 percent of Hong Kong's GDP is made up of services, it
can play a leading place as a gateway in introducing more foreign
service companies to the mainland," Ting said.
</P>
<P>
In the traditional trade of goods, a lot of small and medium-
sized overseas companies that want to do business in the mainland
also tend to turn to the help of Hong Kong companies as middle-men.
</P>
<P>
Ting took up his current post in Hong Kong in April. He said he
has two ambitious plans in his term to improve the relationship
between EU and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One is the Asia Link Program, which is designed to promote
exchanges of students between EU and Asian countries. It is
hopefully to be adopted by the year end and implemented the next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
His office and the local environmental departments will also
join hands to launch a project to strengthen the cooperation in
environmental protection, which has already drawn deep concerns
from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Ting
said.
</P>
<P>
Ting, a 56 year-old French diplomat with Chinese origin, said
he had lived in Hong Kong for about one year early in 1950. He
found that tremendous changes have taken place since he left. "You
know, Hong Kong is changing every day," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard that we used to have a wonderful view of the
harbor through the window of my office, but it is quite different
now," he said, pointing to a high-rise building standing before
his office. It is one of the examples that illustrate the fast
changes of Hong Kong, Ting added.
</P>
<P>
Ting was born in Shanghai and went to Paris in his youth with
his parents. He served as deputy head of the EU Commission
Delegation in Beijing eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Angry About News Coverage Incident in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish officials have reacted
vehemently to an incident in which the U.S. authorities barred a
Turkish reporter from covering a meeting between U.S. Vice
President Al Gore and opponents of the Iraqi government in
Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deniz Arslan, resident correspondent of the Turkish national
news agency Anatolia in Washington, was not permitted to take
photos of a meeting between Al Gore and opponents of the Iraqi
government even though she was the only Turkish journalist who
would take pictures to be used in the Turkish press at home.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Cumhur Ersumer said, "no one can impose
embargo on journalists. It is not possible to accept such an
attitude."
</P>
<P>
"We expect the U.S. to explain this attitude," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Aydin Tumen, Acting Chairman of the ruling Democratic Left Party
(DSP), described the incident as an extremely distressing
development, saying "if this incident occurred because they think
Anatolia News Agency is a state institution, it is much more
distressing."
</P>
<P>
Ismail Kose, Acting Chairman of the ruling Nationalist Movement
Party (MHP), said "The Foreign Ministry should launch an
initiative. This incident revealed that the U.S. which brings up
the issue of human rights and press freedom on every occasion to
Turkey did not conform to press freedom."
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Turkish Journalists Association, Nali
Gureli, also criticized the U.S. officials for not permitting Deniz
Arslan to take pictures from the meeting, stressing "it is wrong to
assume an unequal treatment among the press organs in an event
aimed at informing the public."
</P>
<P>
"Such a treatment is an expression of negligence and
irresponsibility toward the right to inform the public. It cannot
suit universal concept of free flow of information," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazmi Bilgin, Chairman of Journalists' Society, described the
incident as a shameful covered racism.
</P>
<P>
"Journalism is a universal occupation. Journalists' freedom to
cover events and inform the public cannot be restricted in any part
of the world," Bilgin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, addressing a weekly press conference, the Deputy
Spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Huseyin Dirioz, said they are
following the developments.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting at the U.S. State Department, all
journalists were asked about their nationalities and work places.
Bodyguards of Al Gore did not allow Arslan, the only Turkish
journalist and the Anatolia correspondent in Washington, to enter
the meeting room without any pretext.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. had done its utmost to bring Iraqi
opposition together in an attempt to topple the legal Iraqi
government under President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is known to be lukewarm to the U.S. maneuver for fear
that instability should arise afterwards. In its Iraq policy, the
Turkish government has given priority to secure stability and the
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has also been uneasy over the developments in northern
Iraq, particularly those concerning the possible establishment of a
Kurdish state, which might eventually include the Kurdish-populated
southeast of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Civil Servants Will Enjoy 13 Percent Salary Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong announced Thursday that his government has made a
major policy revision on public sector salaries and decided on 13
percent salary increases for civil servants in order to attract
and retain talent in civil service.
</P>
<P>
Making a ministerial statement at the Parliament, the deputy
prime minister said that the average total salary increase for a
civil servant from this revision is about 13 percent, including
the 3/4 month annual variable component (AVC), the 1/2 month
increase in performance bonus and the 5.8 percent increase in
monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
Performance bonuses, which are currently paid only to civil
servants in the more senior grades, will become a big feature in
public sector, Lee said, stating that the government will pay a
performance bonus to all civil servants with an objective to
strengthen the link between pay and individual performance by
building up a performance-related component in the total wage
package of every civil servant.
</P>
<P>
He said this revision will significantly narrow the salary gaps
between the civil service and the private sector and make the
civil service able to retain sufficient talent to continue to
function stably and effectively.
</P>
<P>
Giving a detailed explanation to the policy revision, Lee said
that a full review conducted by the government has revealed that
salaries of most schemes of civil service have not been revised
for at least two years because of the economic downturn and
private sector's earnings have risen substantially with the strong
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The review also shows that the starting annual salaries of the
civil service are generally lagging significantly behind the 75th
percentile salaries in the private sector, he said
</P>
<P>
He underlined that resignation rates have also gone up across
the entire civil services, noting 284 officers from the Senior
Officer Service (or 12 percent of total staff strength) resigned
in the first five months of this year compared to 267 for the
whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Excessive outflow will undermine the civil service and cause
public services to deteriorate, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Moroccan Foreign
Minister Abdelouhed Belkziz has been named the new secretary-
general of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
He will succeed his fellow countryman Azeddine Laraki whose
four-year tenure as the 56-member grouping's secretary general
expires at the end of this year. Belkziz will assume the job on
January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Thursday by Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar, the current chairman of the ongoing 27th meeting
of the OIC foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Morocco, Bangladesh and Turkey were the three candidates vying
for the top OIC post.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Abdelouhed's selection was made possible with
the spirit of cooperation and Muslim brotherhood shown by
Bangladesh and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the two countries had withdrawn their
candidacies, Syed Hamid said "the question of withdrawal did not
arise."
</P>
<P>
During consultations with representatives from the countries
involved, both agreed to support the Moroccan candidate, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We arrived at the decision supported by everybody based on
consensus," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said all agreed that there should not be any election for
the secretary-general's post to avoid the perception that Muslim
countries are divided.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting opened here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Budget for Fiscal 2000-2001 Passed in Bangladesh Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Amid opposition boycott, Bangladeshi
parliament Thursday passed the national budget for fiscal 2000-
2001 amounting to 428.59 billion taka (8.24 billion U.S. dollars)
with overall deficit of 186.61 billion taka (3.59 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The opposition, except a few members of Jatiya Party, continued
their abstention when Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria moved
the money bill to pass the budget through voice vote by treasury
bench members.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred cut motions were submitted by opposition
members of parliament, but those motions were not moved because of
their absence. Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury applied guillotine
to quicken the passage of the budget after brief discussions from
10 a.m.to 12 a.m..
</P>
<P>
Referring to the much-criticized huge deficit in the budget,
the finance minister said the deficit would be met by foreign
grants and loans, domestic resources and bank borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The national budget, placed in the parliament by the finance
minister on June 8, was severely battered by the opposition
parties for its enormous deficit.
</P>
<P>
To protest the unilateral passage of the national budget in the
parliament, the four-party opposition alliance has announced a new
program to call on countrywide hartal (destructive strike) on July
2.

BERLIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrived
here Thursday for an official visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered upon his arrival at
Schoenefeld Airport, the Chinese premier said his current visit is
aimed at further deepening the development of bilateral ties,
enhancing mutual understanding and trust as well as strengthening
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said in recent years, Sino-German relations have witnessed

economy, science and technology, culture, education and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the good development of bilateral ties

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven months after he was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean by
passing fishermen, Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned from the U.S.
to Cuba on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House narrowly approved a Republican plan to provide
prescription drug coverage to senior citizens as the Republican
Party sought to associate itself with a popular issue in this
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia has issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul the
country's economy. It would slash subsidies that have kept
utility rated outrageously low, devise a new energy policy and
wipe out unpaid wages, tax breaks and other obligations that have
sapped government spending power.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in a New Jersey case,
said the government cannot bar doctors from using a procedure
widely known as "partial-birth control," because it may be the
most medically appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Fed left short-term interest rates unchanged but warned
that it would resume efforts to slow the economy if growth
rebounds this summer.
</P>
<P>
-- Sprint is not giving up on its merger with Worldcom, even

Department suit aimed at blocking the transaction on antitrust
grounds.

<HEADLINE> Centuries-old Chinese Writing Tools Survive Country's Development ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Meihong, director of the
Oldhukaiwen Inkstick Factory in east China's Anhui Province, surfs
the net almost every day to check out what's happening in the
global stationery industry.
</P>
<P>
He also e-mails his clients in more than 20 countries,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, the United States,
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's factory, which always smells of burning vegetable and
animal oil, turns out Huizhou inksticks, the premiere Chinese ink
made of soot, using the same techniques that craftsmen employed 2,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Inksticks, along with writing brushes, inkslabs and Xuan paper,
also known as rice paper, all invented in China, have been
referred to as the "four treasures of study" since the Song
Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
They have made a remarkable contribution to the recording of
Chinese history, promoting culture and boosting social progress,
and have long been regarded as symbols of the 5,000-year-old
Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have confirmed that the designs on painted
pottery made in the Neolithic Age were drawn with writing brushes,
and that the inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells of the
Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century B.C.), the earliest Chinese
characters were carved from patterns made by writing brushes and
Chinese ink.
</P>
<P>
The late Professor Zong Baihua, a scholar at Beijing University,
once said that calligraphy created with the "four treasures of the
study" is the symbol of Chinese culture, while architecture and
sculpture symbolize Western culture.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac called calligraphy "the art of
Chinese art."
</P>
<P>
As China develops, more people are leaving their nation's
writing heritage behind, switching instead to fountain pens,
computers and the Internet as more convenient communication tools.
</P>
<P>
Some people fear the "four treasures of study" may someday fade
away -- just as the quill pen did.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Seek Business Opportunities in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DONGGUAN, (Guangdong), June 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Taiwan
investors gathered together here in Dongguan, a major electronic
equipment production base in Guangdong Province in south China, to
seek new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2,000 investors who are attending the two-day
Guangdong-Taiwan Exchange Meeting for Economy, Technology and
Trade, more than 1,000 people are on the first visit to this
mainland city to make investment inspections, said organizers for
the meeting, which will be close today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
also deputy head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
told participating Taiwan investors to seize the chances and to
make greater efforts in promoting cooperation and development of
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan investors are now facing three opportunities: the
development of China's western region; the adjustment of the
industrial structure of the mainland and China's accession into
the World Trade Organization this year," Tang explained, adding
that he hoped Taiwan investors could further expand economic and
trade cooperation with Guangdong and other areas of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two cities of Guangdong Province have sent their
business delegations which have brought along a long list of
projects in pursuit of investment and cooperation to the meeting.
Special introductory workshops were organized to brief Taiwan
investors about investment environment and policies in those
cities.
</P>
<P>
While holding informal discussions with some Taiwan investors,
both Li Changchun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and also Party
Secretary of Guangdong Province, and Governor Lu Ruihua pledged
that they would go all out to help Taiwan investors solve problems
and difficulties in business.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Taiwan investors have become Guangdong's second
largest source of overseas investment after Hong Kong. They have
set up 11,700 enterprises in Guangdong Province, and have pumped 8.
1 billion U.S. dollars into Guangdong by investing in these
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Guangdong and Taiwan amounted to 13.
95 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, accounting for 10 percent of
Guangdong's total foreign trade.

However, Zhou said that his factory, the largest of its kind in
the country, has more business now than it has in 200 years.
</P>
<P>
"These four tools are not only writing tools of today but also
a symbol of culture and art. They are especially indispensable
tools for calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting, and with
the increasing worldwide interest in these artistic forms, there's
a bigger demand for them," said Guo Haitang, president of the
Association for Producers of Writing Brush and Paper, Ink Stick
and Slab.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in China alone, at least 20 million people
practice calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting. An
increasing number of universities have offered calligraphy courses,
including some for doctorate degrees.
</P>
<P>
Bae Gyu Ha, from the Republic of Korea, is now studying for a
Ph.D. in calligraphy at Capital Normal University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by an uncle who is a Sinologist, Bae became adept at
using writing brushes as a child.
</P>
<P>
"Calligraphy is a visible symbol of Chinese culture, so I've
made the study of calligraphy my career," said the 39-year-old Bae,
who has already published two books on calligraphy in his country.
</P>
<P>
Bae added that Chinese culture would not have as deeply
influenced Japan, the Republic of Korea, and many southeast Asia's
countries if there had been no writing brushes, Chinese ink, Xuan
paper and inkslabs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has developed more than 1,000 new
products with high artistic value, such as inksticks and huge
inkslabs engraved with pictures of scenic spots and characters
recording major social events.
</P>
<P>
Liulichang Street in downtown Beijing, known as a "window to
Chinese culture" and flanked with more than 100 art shops selling
various writing brushes, inksticks and inkslabs, has now become a
major attraction in Beijing for domestic and overseas tourists and
art collectors.

<HEADLINE> China Gets Two WB Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) approved on
Tuesday two loans to China totaling 360 million U.S. dollars,
according to sources from WB's China Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used for two projects, namely the Yangtze
Dike Strengthening Project (210 million U.S. dollars) and the
Hebei Water and Environment Project (150 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first project, with a total investment of 545 million U.S.
dollars, aims to help protect the river bank of the flood-prone
Yangtze River against erosion and improve critical sections of
existing main dikes by strengthening the river bank and flood
protection dikes.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Gunaratnam, project task manager of WB, said that this
project will help China improve its systems of flood protection
and response, dike management and operation along the Yangtze, "in
order to help mitigate terrible social and economic costs."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the work will benefit an area of 21,000
square kilometers, and improve the quality of life for over 15
million people.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei Water and Environment Project, with a total
investment of 293 million U.S. dollars, is expected to create an
environmental setting capable of sustaining the long-term economic
growth of urban areas in this north China Province.
</P>
<P>
The project will do this by supporting the province in
implementing a long-term urban environmental service improvement
program that will help Hebei recover from past degradation of
water and land resources and provide an adequate supply of safe
water to its population and economy.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Russian Duma Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), told a senior
member of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia here
today that China pays great attention to its friendly relations
with Russia and believes the relations will grow further.
</P>
<P>
Li said during a meeting with Dmitry Rogozin, chairman of the
International Affairs Committee under the Duma, and his party, who
arrived here on June 25 at the invitation of the NPC's Foreign
Affairs Committee, that China-Russia relations will have new
development under the joint efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"China-Russia relations have grown rapidly over the past few
years," he said. "We have scored remarkable achievements in the
cooperation in areas of politics, economy and trade, science and
technology and international affairs as the state leaders of our
two countries exchanged visits frequently."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin, since taking office, has
repeatedly said that Russia will continue to push forward its
strategic cooperative partnership with China. The Chinese side
highly values his remarks and believes China-Russia relations will
develop to new highs under the joint efforts of both sides, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese parliament chairman said that both
China and Russia support building a mutli-polarized world instead
of a single-polarized one, adding that single-polarization is a
dangerous trend, and harmful to world peace.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia also oppose the deployment of national missile
defense system (NMD) by the United States, he noted. The
deployment of NMD is a concept inherited from the Cold War
mentality, and is threatening world peace.
</P>
<P>
Rogozin said Russia and China share the same stand and attitude
on many issues. He stressed that he hopes the two countries and
parliaments of the two strengthen their cooperation in various
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian chairman said he and his delegation were deeply
impressed with the changes in China after the country adopted the
policy of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Zeng Jianhui, Vice-
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Peiding, and Russian Ambassador to
China Igor A. Rogachev were present at the meeting.

BAGHDAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes bombed
targets in southern Iraq on Thursday morning, killing one woman and
injuring another.
</P>
<P>
The hostile planes shelled Rumaillah region in the southern
province of Basra and "led to the martyrdom of one woman and injury
of another", the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say whether Iraqi ground forces confronted

Iraq claims the frequent air raids by the U.S. and British
planes over the two so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq have killed nearly 300 people and injured nearly 1,000 others
since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the
Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies imposed no-fly zones over northern

<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese Finance Ministry said in a statement that
the government income in the first five months of 2000 was 1,829.7
billion liras (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) against a spending of 3,
794.7 billion liras (2.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami stressed here on
Tuesday more attention should be paid to industry as it serves as
the "foundation and stronghold of human society."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the role of industries in national
development, the president also underlined the importance of
guaranteeing investment in manufacturing and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Grounds should be prepared for attracting and guaranteeing
security of investment by both Iranians and foreigners, Khatami
said. He also highlighted research and standardization of
industries in the modern competitive world and liberalization of
banking facilities for investment.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Medhat Hassaneen said
the cash liquidity shortage is on the way to an end as the
government is able to repay dues to companies.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Al-Ahram newspaper quoted the minister as saying the
volume of overdue arrears has hit 12.6 billion Egyptian pounds (3.
65 billion U.S. dollars). With the 1999/2000 fiscal year (started
on July 1, 1999) to end on June 30, the government will have paid
off 8.6 billion pounds (2.49 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as baseless reports that the government's return to
borrowing from abroad was due to the replacement of foreign debts
with domestic debts, reiterating that they are not related to each
other. To achieve a growth rate of 6.5 percent, local and
international savings should be used, together with an increase in
investments at a rate of 24 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's domestic debts now hit 146.2 billion pounds (42.38
billion dollars), accounting for 50 percent of the GDP, while
foreign debts reaching 28.2 billion dollars. And foreign debt
service stands at 1.5 billion pounds (434.7 million dollars) per
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's foreign trade deficit hit 2.152 billion U.S.
dollars in the first five months of this year, down by 7.56 percent
from 2.328 billion dollars during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Lebanese Customs Electronic
Center, the volume of imports totalled 2.448 billion dollars during
the five-month period, down by 4.38 percent from 2.56 billion
dollars during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports volume stood at 296 million dollars, up by
21.62 percent from 232 million dollars of last year.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Freed After Being Detained by Fiji's Coup Leader EDS-Updates with Speight's Comments, Military Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Nine journalists were released on
Thursday after being held by Fiji's coup leader George Speight in
the country's parliamentary compound, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted Speight as saying the nine journalists, who were
reported to have been taken hostage, have now safely left the area.
</P>
<P>
After about an hour in parliamentary compound, the journalists
were escorted out the front gate by several Speight's gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The reporters, mostly from international media, had attended a
regular nightly press conference where Speight attacked military
plans to cordon off the suburbs around the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speight said that at the end of the conference he told the
journalists if they wanted to leave, they could - but he did not
recommend it.
</P>
<P>
He said his guards had been advised not to let anybody in or
out, as they had received threats from outside the complex.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ABC quoted the journalists as saying that when
they tried to leave, the rebels told them they could not guarantee
their safety once they walked through the gate and they could be
shot if they approached a military checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fiji's military law authorities confirmed plans to
set up a military zone surrounding the compound where Speight has
been holding hostages since May 19, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Military officers were expected to announce an order Friday for
the evacuation of residents in an area up to two kilometers around
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only Red Cross staff would be allowed through to take daily
supplies and food to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The move was said to be part of a military plan to isolate the
coup group, the ABC said.

<HEADLINE> New Social Safety Net Urged for Thailand to Protect Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand needs a new social safety
net since the rural poor were proven the hardest hit in the
economic crisis and the agriculture sector's ability to reabsorb
low-skilled urban labor during recession turned out to be limited,
a report on the impact of the 1997 crisis on Thailand's rural
sector said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Mekong Environment and Resource
Institute in collaboration with the World Bank and the agriculture
and cooperatives ministry of Thailand, surveyed more than 1,600
households in the north, northeast and central regions of Thailand
during the 1995-1996 and 1998-1999 crop years.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the poor have borne the brunt of the
crisis, with their expenditures and income falling both in real
terms and when comparing to those of the rich.
</P>
<P>
Opposite to hypothesis that urban unemployment resulted in a
large emigration back to the rural areas and in a sharp decrease
in remittances, the study found that there is actually little
signs of a massive urban to rural migration, although a slowdown
in rural emigration does exist.
</P>
<P>
Although net remittances declined for all but the richest
households, the study found that the poor are less reliant on
remittances than the rich. However, overall off-farm income,
including remittances, declined for the poor, but not for the rich.
</P>
<P>
The central region performed much better in terms of
consumption and income compared to both the north and northeast,
with the north particularly hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
These findings are consistent with the fact that the poor
derive most of their income from the labor market rather than from
farming, whereas the situation is reverse for the richer farmers.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that there is no evidence of a credit
crunch during the crisis as expected, and neither large decline in
outstanding loans is found in the data.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that poverty alleviation measures that
focus on price supports and credit subsidies will only have a
limited impact on the rural poor because they derive only small
share of their income from crop cultivation.
</P>
<P>
It urges the Thai government to establish temporary social
programs to alleviate the effect of recessions on the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
In the medium and long term, measures to increase access to off-
farm employment, such as by developing rural infrastructure and
increasing the flexibility of the rural labor force, should be
adopted to improve the well-being of the rural poor, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> World Marketing Conference to Help Thai Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The third World Marketing
Conference, which is being held here from June 29 to 30, is
believed to help Thai businessmen to enhance their competitiveness
in the world market, a Thai marketing expert said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for Thai businessmen to share the
marketing experiences with international colleagues, and upgrade
their marketing skills," Supat Tansathitikorn, the chief organizer
of the meeting and a local marketing expert, told Xinhua after the
opening ceremony of the two-day forum.
</P>
<P>
About 1000 marketing experts, marketing managers and business
executives from Thailand and other parts of the world are
attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The speakers at the meeting include experts and executives from
world's top companies such as the Microsoft, the Compaq Computer,
the Motorola and the Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
Supat, who is also the honorary chairman of the Marketing
Association of Thailand, said, "We hope this conference will help
the Thai businessmen and marketing professionals to become more
market-oriented, and well-equipped with ideas to map out their
global marketing plan."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants will focus on the issue of
how to develop advanced marketing strategies to stay ahead of the
challenging competition at the regional and world level, according
to him.
</P>
<P>
Topics such as on-line marketing, marketing innovation, image
marketing and marketing management are also on the agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
The world marketing conference is a biennial international
meeting sponsored by the World Marketing Association, and the
first meeting was held in Chicago, the United States, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Next meeting will be hosted by Singapore two years later.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Power Company Black out Governor's Office for Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Total black-out descended on to the
governor' s office Wednesday in the southern Nigerian state of
Osun when the country' s National Electric Power Authority (NEPA)
made real its promise to entertain no "sacred cow" in collecting
overdue electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Thursday quoted NEPA officials as saying that
Osun state government owed a 36 million naira (360,000 U.S.
dollars) electricity debt to the state-owned power company.
</P>
<P>
Affected in the mass disconnection are the Governor's Office,
government agencies, the state secretariat and House of Assembly
complex.
</P>
<P>
An official of NEPA disclosed that the power cut exercise was
resorted to after Governor Adebisi Adebayo repeatedly reneged on
several promises to pay the three million naira (30,000 U.S.
dollars) monthly bill since the inauguration of his administration
over a year ago. Black-outs are commonplace for average
citizens in Nigeria, the most populous African nation, which makes
the NEPA an easy target for severe criticism from the public.
</P>
<P>
But the NEPA recently refuted that the delay or non-payment of
the electricity bills sometime leave it in a plight of having no
money for the maintenance, thus causing collapse of the national
power grid from time to time.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Publishes Report on Key Issues of SAR's 3rd Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A report highlighting the key
issues of the third year of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) was released Thursday by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong SAR - the Key Issues 1999/2000," which follows two
similar reports released in 1998 and 1999, will be distributed
widely overseas and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 32-page report, in Chinese and English, carries a foreword
by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, and includes chapters
on the economy, the 2000/2001 Budget, the rule of law, tourism,
the environment and constitutional development.
</P>
<P>
In his foreword, Tung said Hong Kong's economy had seen a
revival of fortunes in the past 12 months after two very difficult
years in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted reforms in the financial services sector,
increased efforts to improve the environment and opportunities
arising from China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to push ahead with our reforms to maintain
Hong Kong's position as a premier Asian financial center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said China's eventual entry into the World Trade
Organization, hopefully later this year, would present significant
opportunities in a wide range of sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take Hong Kong's role as a conduit for trade
and investment to new heights.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that, in the years ahead, Hong Kong will stamp its
mark as Asia's World City," he said.

</P>
<P>
The blue chips opened up 35.98 points at 16,474.40 in the

<HEADLINE> Double-digit Economic Growth Expected in HK This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Standard Chartered Bank has
revised the real GDP growth forecast of Hong Kong in 2000 to 10
percent, from its previous prediction of eight percent made in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic figures released in recent months showed that trade
continues to perform very well in Hong Kong. Retained imports are
growing strongly in recent months, signifying that domestic demand
is set to remain firm in the coming months, according a press
release of Standard Chartered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economic upswing in China's mainland is having an
increasingly positive impact on Hong Kong, particularly through
trade, stock market activities and tourism, the press released
said.
</P>
<P>
"Worries of rapid increases in interest rates and a 'hard
landing' in the United States have subsided," said K.C. Kwok,
regional chief economist of Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates on
hold Wednesday. The market consensus is expecting an increase of a
further 25 basis points in interest rates in the second half of
this year, rather than 75 basis points or more as predicted a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
"The 10 percent growth forecast for the year 2000 as a whole is
a relatively conservative one," said Kwok. "The market is always
worried about the downside risk. But increasingly, the surprise is
likely to come on the upside."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission (HKSFC) Thursday launched the Electronic
Investor Resources Center, a website aimed to educate investors to
help them make informed investment decision.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the website -- www.hkeirc.org, unlike other
financial portals, does not give investment advice. It is
dedicated to empowering investors to acquire knowledge on the
different aspects of investing.
</P>
<P>
Targeting at investors with different investing profiles, the
center is designed as a virtual library covering a wide range of
topics.
</P>
<P>
It is linked to over 400 websites of regulators, market
institutions and Internet content providers.
</P>
<P>
New links will be added to each section on an ongoing basis in
order to keep investors abreast of new developments and references.
</P>
<P>
HKSFC Chairman Andrew Sheng said the center is a cost effective
and easily accessible way for the investors to get hold of timely
and good quality information.
</P>
<P>
"As markets become more complex, investors must evaluate their
own risk appetite and understand and appreciate the risks of their
investments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheng hoped that more and more investors would take advantage
of this new website.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip, secretary for financial services of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, officiated the launch of the center.

<HEADLINE> HK's Tourist Arrivals Continue to Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The strong growth in tourism to
Hong Kong continued in May when arrivals reached 1,069,168, up 18.
1 percent over the same period of last year, according to the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of tourist arrivals for the first five months
of 2000 is 5,178,936, the HKTA added.
</P>
<P>
The buoyant situation is reflected in hotel occupancy figures,
which averaged 81 percent in May for all categories of
accommodation, compared to 76 percent a year ago. The average
occupancy rate for the first five months of 2000 is 82 percent, up
form 78 percent in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Virtually every market recorded a strong growth last month,
said HKTA. Topping the list was South Korea, which registered a
year-on-year increase of 39.2 percent, fueled by a strong economy
and a successful special promotion by HKTA, Cathay Pacific Airways
and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland remains Hong Kong's biggest source market,
accounting for almost a third of all visitors in May and showing a
27.9 percent increase in numbers over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the May figures, HKTA Executive Director Amy
Chan said Hong Kong is well and truly back on the world map as a
top travel destination.
</P>
<P>
"Our marketing of the lesser known treasures of Hong Kong is
giving leisure visitors new reasons to come, while our improving
economy is attracting many more business visitors who also see
Hong Kong as the natural gateway to the Chinese mainland and the
rest of Asia," she explained.

<HEADLINE> Rural Power Grid Renovation Project Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide power grid
renovation project in China's rural areas, which started two years
ago, has begun to boost the economy in those areas and the
national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The project has brought down electricity prices in rural areas,
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development Planning
Commission, said today at a televised conference, adding that the
changes have helped to save 23 billion yuan for farmers annually.
</P>
<P>
As a result, an increasing number of farmers now can afford
electric home appliances. In 1999, total electricity consumption
in rural areas rose 9.7 percent, higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, some 80 billion yuan had been
injected into the project to complete the power grid rehab
projects in 512 counties. And another 54.64 billion yuan has been
earmarked to wind up similar projects in over 1,000 counties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 1.5 million people are involved
in the work, which has helped to ease the country's unemployment
problem.
</P>
<P>
To support the strategy of developing China's western areas,
the central government has decided to change the loans in treasury
bonds into appropriations for the project in the west to increase
investment returns.
</P>
<P>
Zeng called on localities to speed up the project, tighten
control over project quality and acceptance, ban any unauthorized
fee charging, and set standard electricity prices for both rural
and urban residents.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Giant to Build China's Largest Fertilizer Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp. (CNOOC) plans to invest three billion yuan to build the
country's largest fertilizer plant in Dongfang City of Hainan
Province, South China, and will put it into operation in late 2003.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer plant is expected to produce 450,000 tons of
synthetic ammonia and 800,000 tons of urea annually, according to
a senior CNOOC official.
</P>
<P>
It will use gas to be turned out by the Dongfang 1-1 gas field
in the South China Sea as raw material. The gas field is expected
to start providing gas supply in September 2003.
</P>
<P>
The upstream gas field development and the downstream
fertilizer plant construction will demand total investment of
eight billion yuan, the official added.

<HEADLINE> China-Related Act in U.S. Senate Strongly Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua)-- China today voiced strong
dissatisfaction with and opposition to the China Non-proliferation
Act put forward by several U.S. senators, denouncing it as
wantonly attacking and slandering the country.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the issue that the U.S. Senate would
on July 10 discuss and vote on the act, which also includes
certain retaliatory measures, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao pointed out that China has actually made great
contributions to the global non-proliferation cause.
</P>
<P>
China has always opposed the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and has exercised strict and effective control over
related articles according to its policies on military trade and
non-proliferation as well as related international commitments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman pointed out, certain U.S. senators, who
are prejudiced and hostile toward China, cling to the Cold War
mentality and are trying to turn the act into law so as to block
the development and improvement of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Their actions, which totally disregard China's sincere efforts
in non-proliferation, go against the basic norms of international
relations, and their motives are highly suspect, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China urges the U.S. Senate not to discuss and vote on this act,
which interferes in China's internal affairs, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China also demands that the U.S. Government oppose the act and
immediately take practical measures to stop it from becoming law,
so that no new obstacle gets in the way of advancement of
bilateral relations, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Follow One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua)-- China today urged the Taiwan
authorities to strictly abide by the common understanding reached
in 1992 between the mainland's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation
(SEF) that each of the two organisations should express verbally
that "both sides of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the One-China
principle."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a press
conference that the Taiwan authorities have misinterpreted the One-
China principle.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of such a move by the Taiwan authorities is try to
inject separatist ideas into the common understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always held that contact and
discussion should be resumed as early as possible based on the One-
China principle, and the key problem now is that the Taiwan
authorities do not recognize the One-China principle and are not
sincere about improving relations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Once the Taiwan authorities make a commitment to abandon the "
two-state" idea and to follow the common understanding reached in
1992, negotiations can begin, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Leading Metropolis Has 235 Centenarians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- She witnessed the fall of China's
last feudal dynasty in 1911 and the start of the People's Republic
in 1949. She experienced numerous wars and disasters. She has seen
her hometown of Shanghai revel in prosperity in the 1920s, only to
decline in later years, and now re-emerge as a gleaming metropolis
in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sun Duanqing, who at 109 is the oldest citizen in this city of
13 million in east China, has become a symbol of longevity.
</P>
<P>
Sun, born in 1891, was recently determined to be the oldest of
Shanghai's 235 centenarians. That total is nearly three times the
1990 figure, according to a report in today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Female centenarians outnumbered the males 199 to 36. The 103-
year-old Zhang Zongying and 102-year-old Huang Ouxin are the only
married couple in the lot.
</P>
<P>
"The extension of human life can reflect economic, scientific
and medical development of one country, and is a token of the
improvement of senior citizens' living quality," the newspaper
quoted an unnamed expert on population aging as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of centenarians in Shanghai soared from only one in
1953 to 208 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The leading industrial and commercial city also took the lead
in China to become a graying society at the end of the 1970s; the
life expectancy of local residents is now 75.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were 284,900 people age 80 or above
in Shanghai by the end of last year, making up 12 percent of its
population of people 60 and above.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists have urged the government and society to pay more
attention to the daily care and health promotion of the elderly,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The elderly, especially those living alone, should enjoy better
and free services such as house keeping, medical care and
financial assistance, said Zhu Jiming, deputy director of the
Shanghai Research Center of Geriatrics.

<HEADLINE> China to Start Gene Sequencing of Pigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China will start a gene sequencing
project to upgrade breeds of pigs and promote studies on xeno-
transplantation and biological drugs, said a Chinese scientist in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
This is a follow-up to Chinese scientists' successful
completion of one percent of the sequencing of the human genome,
said Zhang Meng, a spokesman of the Human Genome Research Center
of the Genetics Institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that though Germany, Denmark and other European
countries have already started similar joint research projects,
Chinese scientists see greater potential in their own undertaking.
</P>
<P>
Pork is the major source of animal protein in the Chinese diet,
and China has the largest pork output in the world. Scientists
hope that with a working draft of the pig genome map, they will be
able to upgrade the breed of pigs and promote the pig raising
industry.
</P>
<P>
The project is also the second project of the China biological
resources genome program. The first was the China hybrid super
paddle genome project, which was launched last month.
</P>
<P>
The pig gene sequencing project has drawn interest from Danish
scientists, entrepreneurs and government officials, who have
suggested that they cooperate with Chinese scientists in the work.
</P>
<P>
Genetic technology is regarded as one of the most important
advanced scientific technologies in the world. Many scientists
believe that the technology will have an even deeper impact on
humankind than information technology.

<HEADLINE> WTO Must Adapt to Global Trade Trend: Supachai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- As the global trade trend is
changing due to advanced information technology, the World Trade
Organization WTO) must adapt itself to the new environment,
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the WTO Director-General-in-waiting and
Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The World Trade Organization must change its rules and
functions in order to be relevant and effective, " he said, when
delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Third
World Marketing Conference, which is being held here on June 29 to
30.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rapid development of the information and
communication," he said, "goods, services, investment, and
information are now being traded in a much cheaper and faster
manner."
</P>
<P>
More business activities, such as marketing, sales and delivery
of goods and services, and payments, will be conducted
electronically with the revolution in e-commerce and internet, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"So far on the global scale, the WTO has already done
prominently well to promote e-commerce trend with certain
agreements such as the Information Technology Agreement signed in
1996, " he remarked.
</P>
<P>
Despite those positive aspects of the WTO, he said, certain
improvements are necessary.
</P>
<P>
The fact that more than 30 nations are awaiting their WTO
accession is a "true testimony" for the importance of the
organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those nations, Supachai pointed out, China's accession to
the WTO is attracting the most media attention, and will have a
great impact to the world trade system.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 14 years, China has showed its strong
determination to become a WTO member," he noted, "and has made
many significant concessions on tariff reduction."
</P>
<P>
"This shows that it is very important for the WTO to include
all the nations, and China's membership will have a great global
impact, politically and economically," he stated.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the organization will help set up a new
balance in the multilateral world trade system, and will also
offer many new trade opportunities for other countries with its
huge domestic market, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the top priority for the WTO is to strengthen
confidence among its 136 members, especially those developing
countries, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO will certainly continue to assume the leading role in
promoting trade liberalization while providing the necessary rules
and disciplines for global stability, transparency, and security
in today's complex international place," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- India must re-examine its China
policy as part of a wider Sino-India understanding since there are
no major contradictions between the two countries, a famous Indian
scholar said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"India and China have close view points regarding the stability
of the region, terrorism and noninterference," said Professor M.D.
Nalapat director of the School of Geopolitics Manipal Academy.
</P>
<P>
Nalapat, also former editor-in-chief of Times of India, is
visiting Sri Lanka to study the island's long-running ethnic
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that the consensus was in fact proved when
the Chinese embassy was bombed in Belgrade last year as well as on
the issue of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem with China is our providing shelter to the
Dalai Lama and 120,000 Tibetans who do not accept one China" while
the Indian government accepts the one China policy and recognizes
that one China is the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Nalapat, who visited China last month, is an organizer of the
first India-China Track Dialogue in Manipal scheduled for November
1-4 this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Albright Ends Shuttles, Three-Way Summit Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright wound up her shuttles between Israel and Palestine
Wendesday night, failing to clear doubt over a much-anticipated
Washington summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who returned to the region Tuesday evening, held a
first meeting with Barak, in which Barak briefed her about his
positions on all key issues in the final-status talks and the two
assessed the possibility of holding the summit.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Albright first held talks with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy, then travelled to the West Bank city of
Ramallah for a two-hour session with Arafat. In the afternoon, she
returned to Jerusalem for another meeting with Barak, who had been
pushing hard for the summit that he believes could conceivably
culminate in a settlement of Israel's half-century conflict with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although all parties concerned refrained from saying outright
that Albright's current shuttles failed to produce positive
results, they indicated that her mission ended with delay of
holding the summit at least.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had rejected Barak's suggestion that the
summit be held in early July, asking instead that another round of
talks be held in the U.S. next week between negotiators from the
two sides before they are ready to decide whether to hold the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials said Arafat is unwilling to go to a
summit without a prior assurance as to the outcome, and Arafat is
demanding first to know how far Barak is willing to compromise on
matters of borders, Jerusalem, refugees and other key issues needed
to be settled in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Arafat also demands that the leftover interim issues,
such as the release of more Palestinians from Israeli jails and the
third West Bank redeployment, be implemented before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly complained during his talks with Albright that
Israel is willing to give back all the territories demanded by
Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, but is unwilling when it comes to the
Palestinians' demand.
</P>
<P>
Barak gave a different explanation about the summit, saying "the
talks between negotiating teams at this point amount to nothing,
and that the only way forward is for him to sit down with Arafat
and Clinton and make the difficult decisions needed for a deal."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed "the process will go forward if, and only if,
there is a summit."
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Prime Minister's Office sided with Barak,
saying there is "no chance" of satisfying the Palestinians'
expectations regarding the interim issues at this point, and that
Barak does not intend to set out his positions until he is at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Barak at the conclusion of
their meeting Wednesday afternoon, Albright noted both sides are
continuing serious negotiations on the permanent status agreement
and understand the historical opportunity at hand to reach an
agreement, cautioning both sides against trying to get 100 percent
of their demands met.
</P>
<P>
She also promised to report her findings about the possibility
of holding the summit to Clinton, who will decide when it is
appropriate to hold the summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it has adopted a market specialization approach that
would match fund sources with potential house owners.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, President Joseph Estrada said
he expects the system to benefit overseas Filipino workers, trade
union members and private sector employees.
</P>
<P>
"Under this initiative, the Social Security System will serve
workers in the private sector while the Government Service
Insurance System will handle the requirement of government
employees and teachers," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Home Development Mutual Fund will serve the needs
of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the
Philippine.
</P>
<P>
Aside from this, the president said, the government is seeking
to establish a secondary mortgage market to ensure sustainability
of housing funds.
</P>
<P>
Under this initiative, he added, housing agencies would develop
the secondary housing market, with the help of private
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Estrada noted, this would develop the sustainable
liquidity of the socialized housing sector.
</P>
<P>
Mass housing remains one of the president's centerpiece
programs,alongside food security, peace and order, the right
against graft and corruption, and electoral reforms.

<P>
GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
take more concrete actions in promoting developing countries'
social development, said Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, who is
here attending the United Nations General Assembly's special
session on social development.
</P>
<P>
Although progress has been made since the Copenhagen summit on
social development in 1995, the international community is still
far from realizing all the goals of common development and
prosperity, said Wen at his meeting with President of the U.N.
General Assembly Theo-Ben Gurirab, foreign minister of Namibia, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Chinese vice premier briefed Gurirab on
China's progress in implementing the Copenhagen Declaration and
Program of Action. The Chinese government is willing to work with
other countries to contribute to the common development and
prosperity of the mankind, he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab, also elected as president of the current special
session, said that China set a good example to other countries in
implementing the Copenhagen Declaration and Program of Action. He
expressed belief that the current session would not be unworthy of
the expectations of people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said that it is particularly important for developing
countries to be united and cooperative in the current world
situations. He said he hoped that the China-Africa Forum scheduled
for October in China would make active contributions to the
promotion of the friendly and cooperative relations between China
and Africa and to the strengthening of South-South cooperation.

PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- French serial killer suspect Sid
Ahmed Rezala committed suicide Wednesday night in a Portuguese
prison where he has been detained for six months, said the French

Rezala could be sentenced to 30 years in prison if convicted of
his crimes under the French law.

</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

qualified to export natural gas as it enjoys huge gas reserves at
high competitive prices. In a meeting with members of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Cairo Wednesday, Fahmi said several draft
agreements were signed for export of gas to Europe which is the
main target market.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:

<HEADLINE> Economic Reform Target "Attainable": Turkish Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Recep Onal, Turkish state minister
for economy, has said it is unnecessary to revise targets of a
three-year economic stability program, adding the program
objectives remain "attainable."
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after Turkish State Planning
Organization (DPT) reported Wednesday that in the first quarter,
the drop in inflation was below program objectives, the current
account deficit and foreign trade deficit were higher than
predicted, Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has implemented its economic program, supported by a
four-billion-U.S. dollar stand-by deal signed last December with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), without any concessions so
far.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Turkey pledged to reduce its chronic
inflation and budget deficits, undertake a comprehensive
privatization program and carry out reforms in the agricultural
sector within three years.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Onal just concluded his talks with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Council of Ministers in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said "OECD members believe that Turkey's stability program is
very coherent and its chronic economic problems could be overcome
only through this program."
</P>
<P>
The minister indicated all OECD members have completed their
privatization of state-run enterprises and for that reason Turkey
should be accelerating its privatization precess.
</P>
<P>
Although DPT's less promising briefing, the Central Bank said on
Wednesday the disinflation program is "firmly" on track.
</P>
<P>
It said Turkey has met the end-1999 performance criteria on both
fiscal and monetary fronts as part of the three-year stand-by deal,
so the confidence in the business sector has improved.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the head of IMF's Turkey desk, Carlos
Cottarelli, also said Turkey's chronic inflation will drop
significantly by the end of the year if Ankara sticks to the tight
IMF-backed program that has already begun to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"If the current trend continues, Turkey will very much be near
to the targeted inflation level," determined as 20-25 percent, he
said during his review of the program in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"But this, of course, depends on the continuation of the current
policies," he added.

<HEADLINE> Interpellation not to Topple President: Indonesian Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Indonesia's House
of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung said here Thursday that a
motion for interpellation which has just passed by the House is
not intended to topple President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the passage of the motion, Tandjung
made it clear that, "This motion for interpellation is not
intended to unseat President Abdurrahman Wahid. Not at all. This
is just intended to give political education."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the motion "will not be intended to clear the
way for the People's Consultatives Assembly's (MPR) special
session in August."
</P>
<P>
"This motion also will not endanger the position of Abdurrahman
Wahid as a president. But may be this will be a kind of progress
report from the House. We will submit this to the MPR as an input,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to safeguard the leadership of President Wahid, but we
have to give him a critical opinion over his policies including in
the case of the dismissal of cabinet minister," he added.
</P>
<P>
The House passed a motion for interpellation of President Wahid
on Thursday. Of the 431 existing votes, the motion gained 332
votes, rejected by 63 while 36 votes abstains.
</P>
<P>
The motion which was sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI Perjuangan) and the Golkar party is aimed
at summoning and seeking explanation from the president over the
dismissal of his two cabinet ministers namely Laksamana Sukardi (
from the PDI perjuangan) and Yusuf Kalla (Golkar Party).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the President said that the dismissal of the two
ministers on April 25 was made due to the alleged involvement of
Sukardi and Kalla in corruption practices. But however, the two
rejected such an allegation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syamsul Ma'arif of the Golkar Party said that the
House will conduct an internal meeting to set a schedule to summon
the president.
</P>
<P>
"We will hold a meeting on July 3. And it is expected that the
president will be able to meet our summon before July 21," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we finds evidences confirming the involvement of Sukardi
and Kalla in corruption cases, they should be tried. But if not,
and the president can not also give any evidences confirming
corruption practices of Sukardi and Kalla, then the president
should rehabilitate their names," Ma'arif added.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the motion will be the first time for the country
's political history where the president was summoned by the House
through a motion for interpellation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Assembly,
the country's parliament, Thursday afternoon approved President
Kim Dae-jung's appointment of Lee Han-dong as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The 273-member parliament ratified the appointment with 139
voting for the appointment, 130 against, two abstentions and one
invalid.
</P>
<P>
Attending the vote were all 119 lawmakers of the ruling
Millennium Democratic Party, 133 from the Grand National Party (
GNP), 17 from the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) and three
independents.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 273 lawmakers, Chung Mong-joon was the only one
who failed to appear at the vote. Chung, president of the Korea
Football Association, is on a business trip to attend a meeting of
Federation of International Football Association.

<P>
The balloting was held just after the plenary session of the
National Assembly heard the report on the outcome of the first-
ever parliamentary confirmation hearing for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
At the voting session, the main opposition GNP reaffirmed its
opposition to Lee's appointment, citing suspicions of alleged real
estate speculation and sensitive political issues.
</P>
<P>
President Kim nominated Lee as prime minister on May 22 this
year after Park Ta-jung resigned over a tax evasion scandal.
</P>
<P>
Lee, the 66-year-old president of the ULD, is a six-term
lawmaker who started his political career with the now-defunct
Democratic Justice Party (DJP), established by then President Chun
Du-hwan in 1981.
</P>

A graduate of the law school of Seoul National University, Lee
worked as judge, prosecutor and lawyer before entering the
political circle.
</P>
<P>
Lee served as secretary general, chief policy-maker and floor
leader of the DJP, minister of home affairs and chairman of the
GNP before he quit from the GNP to join the ULD last January.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returned to
Washington Thursday after finding that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are not yet ready to
hold a summit.
</P>
<P>
Although all the main players involved refrained from saying
outright that the summit will not take place, Palestinian officials
said they have rejected a suggestion that it be held on July 15,
proposing instead that another round of talks be held in the U.S.
next week between the negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
For fear of being pressured by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Barak on matters of territory, refugees and Jerusalem, Arafat is
demanding first to know how far the Israeli government is willing
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has asked Knesset
(Parliament) member Dan Meridor from the Center Party to join his
government as a minister without portfolio and take responsibility
for the Mossad, the Shin Bet security service and the Atomic Energy
Commission, which until now have been under the direct
responsibility of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Meridor, who is currently the chairman of the
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and is a former
justice minister and finance minister, will take part in the
meetings of the security cabinet and in ministerial panels that
will deal with the negotiations with the Palestinians and perhaps
with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Meridor has already turned down an earlier proposal by Barak,
according to which he would have become tourism minister in place
of Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who was this week appointed transport
minister in place of Yitzhak Mordechai who resigned after being
indicted on sexual assault charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that "within
36 hours" he will announce a way to bring about an end to the
doctors' strike, which goes into its 113th day on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Barak intends to bring the wage and working conditions issues to
arbitration, which was recommended by the non-binding mediators who
have been hearing from both Health Minister Shlomo Benizri and the
Israel Medical Association for a month.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman, on a visit to Ashkelon, a port city in
the south, Wednesday called on the government to bring a quick end
to the strike, saying it was "pathetic" to see empty hospitals and
that the sanctions endangered lives.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Wednesday decided not to
take any action at present to stop the construction work at the
Temple Mount by the Moselm Wakf (or Islamic religious trust).
</P>
<P>
Barak held an urgent meeting to discuss the security situation
on the Temple Mount in light of the protests over the construction.
</P>
<P>
He also instructed the authorities to allow archaeologists from
the Antiquities Authority to the site and to prevent the
construction work from developing into more extensive construction
activity.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks Power Plant Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has appealed
to bidders to supply emergency thermal power plants to help reduce
the dwindling power supply, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has applied for credit from the International
Development Association to finance the supply.
</P>
<P>
Available documents indicate that the government is asking for
a 75- megawatt plant and a 30-megawatt plant to be installed in
the capital Nairobi on a short-term basis for six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The plants are required to be operational by August and until
April next year when the long rains are expected.
</P>
<P>
The prospective suppliers are to submit their bids to the
Energy Ministry by July 10 and the plants are expected to be
operational within six to 10 weeks from the award of contracts.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has experienced a long-spell drought, resulting in low
water levels of reservoirs which affects the power generation.
Currently the country is facing a shortage of 100 mega watts.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Change on Zimbabwe's Political Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A big change has taken place in the
Zimbabwean political arena with a new opposition party posing a
threat to the 20-year-domination of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth parliamentary election on June 24-25, the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) won
narrowly with 62 seats against 57 seats for the Movement for
Democratic Change, which was formed nine months ago. It was the
first time the ruling party lost many seats to a opposition party.
</P>
<P>
From the country's independence in 1980, Zanu-pf, which fought
a bitter war against British colonialists, had enjoyed support
from the majority of people due to its efforts in improving its
peoples' lives by building schools and hospitals, providing free
primary education and creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the just-ended election, Zanu-pf still had massive backing
from people in the rural areas, but lost heavily in towns because
of the difficult economic situation greatly affecting urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
But, when the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
demanded Zimbabwe to introduce economic structural adjustment
program in the early 1990s, the hard economic times were triggered
off. Unemployment soared. Interest rates shot up. Foreign
investment flowed out of the country. The prices of basic
commodities, such as bread and cooking oil, rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Many people, especially those in towns, began to complain that
Zanu-pf had forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) took advantage of
the situation and launched the new party, the Movement for
Democratic Change, which turned out to be "a black horse" in the
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the working class, MDC challenged the once
unchallenged Zanu-pf and reaped its first victory when it
mobilized supporters to vote against the proposed constitutional
reform draft during the referendum in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the MDC has surged ahead with bold confidence.
</P>
<P>
When President Robert Mugabe announced that the election would
be held in June this year, MDC made it clear that it would field
candidates for all the 120 contested seats. The MDC did give
Zanu-pf a hard time during the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
However, Zanu-pf is still in control of the parliament since
President Mugabe is empowered by the constitution to appoint 30
people to Parliament. This allows Mugabe to form a government
merely from his Zanu-pf.
</P>
<P>
But political observers have urged him to form a coalition
government which he did with Zimbabwe African People Union (Zapu)
at independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
After the marginal victory in the parliamentary election, the
government is faced with the big job of reversing the slowdown of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the pressing issue that the Zanu-pf should tackle is land
distribution. Only 4,500 whites own 70 percent of fertile land
while more than 12 million people are still living on very poor
soils in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Just before the election, the freedom fighters, who fought for
independence, occupied about 1,500 farms owned by whites, saying
Zanu-pf was taking too long in getting back the land from British
settlers.
</P>
<P>
These veterans have vowed to remain on the occupied farms until
the government buys enough farms to settle them.

<HEADLINE> IBM Builds World's Most Powerful Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) announced Wednesday it has built the most
powerful supercomputer in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to IBM's news release, the new computer can perform
12.3 trillion operations per second, three times faster than the
next-fastest computer.
</P>
<P>
The system was made for the Department of Energy's Accelerated
Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) and could ease congressional
opposition to the United States' signing the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, banning all actual nuclear weapons testing worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Without underground testing, we need simulations to make sure
the stockpile is safe, reliable and operational," said David
Cooper, a member of the President's Council on Computing and chief
information officer of Lawrence Livermore Labs in California,
where the system will be run.
</P>
<P>
Called ASCI White, it will churn factors involved in a nuclear
detonation, including the weapon's age and design. This could
eventually allow U.S. government to manage its entire stockpile of
nuclear weapons without any real nuclear tests, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which paid 110 million U.S. dollars for
the system, sought development of such a computer in the early
1990s in anticipation of a ban on underground nuclear testing,
which President Bill Clinton imposed this year, according to a
report by CNN.
</P>
<P>
Previous versions in the ASCI program have included the red
series by Intel, and the blue series by SGI/Cray and IBM. Although
each was the most powerful of its time, the new White version for
the first time allows scientists to factor in a host of variables
when running a simulation, CNN said.
</P>
<P>
The ASCI White is also powerful enough to process an Internet
commerce transaction for every person on Earth in less than one
minute, industry analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
That's three times more powerful than the previous champ, IBM's
ASCI Blue Pacific, and 1,000 times more powerful than "Deep Blue,"
the computer which defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in
1997, they added.
</P>
<P>
The complexity of the new system will boost IBM's marketing
efforts more than the computer will impact the earnings and
revenue for the company which is already the leading supplier of
supercomputing systems with 30 percent of the global market share
in 1999, said Debra Goldfarb, an analyst with technology research
firm International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
Smaller versions of this computer are already used in weather
forecasting and tracking credit card fraud, said David Turek,
IBM's vice president for deep computing. A smaller version of the
ASCI computer also helped scientists map the human genome, said
David Nowak, deputy associate director of Livermore Labs.
</P>
<P>
IBM officials and analysts said parts of the design of ASCI
White, which connects 512 separate computers together with high
performance switches and software, could be built into computers
used for everything from electronic business to designing cars.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Cult Member Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court on Thursday
sentenced a former member of the AUM Shinrikyo cult to death for
his role in two sarin gas attacks including one on the Tokyo
subway system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yasuo Hayashi, 42, is the third sentenced by the court among
five former AUM members who have been indicted for releasing sarin
on the Tokyo subway, following one who received life imprisonment,
and the other the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the ruling, Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Kimura said
Hayashi played a leading role in the subway gassing, which killed
12 people and injured more than 5,400.
</P>
<P>
In the Tokyo subway attack, Hayashi, a senior member of the
group's "science and technology" section, was one of five AUM
members who separately released sarin gas in five trains on March
20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hayashi also played a key role in the 1994 sarin gas attack in
Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture in central Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the Matsumoto gas attack, Hayashi was charged with abetting
murder by helping to build a car to release sarin gas in a
residential area of the city in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
Seven residents died in the attack, which was carried out near
a dormitory for judges and court officials of the Matsumoto branch
of the Nagano District Court. The attack is believed to have
targeted judges who were handling a suit involving the cult at the
time.
</P>
<P>
In last December, Japanese prosecutors demanded the death
penalty for Hayashi on charges of murder, attempted murder and
abetting murder in connection with the two gassings, in addition
to other charges.

<HEADLINE> China Casts Shadow of Asian Financial Crisis (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the Asian financial crisis, China's exports dropped from
a 20 percent growth rate in 1997 to 0.5 percent in 1998. The
amount of foreign investment in China also dived to its lowest
point in the previous two decades.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of depreciation of currency in many Asian countries,
the Chinese government made a bold decision of keeping its
currency, the Renminbi, stable. It later adopted a series of macro-
control policies including measures to lower interest rates of
bank loans and issue more state bonds.
</P>
<P>
Although China saw a drastic drop in exports, the macro-control
measures have stimulated domestic demand and promoted exports.
China's economic growth rate was therefore faster than other Asian
countries, said Zhou Tianyong, a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
China's economy showed signs of recovery in the latter half of
last year. A slump in exports gradually saw an increase to 6.1
percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has continued to pursue an active
financial policy this year. It has launched a nationwide campaign
to accelerate the development of its western regions and made
positive measures to become a WTO member. These factors have lead
to a significant growth in investments, exports and consumption.
</P>
<P>
In addition to steady growth in export and commodity retail
sales, the industrial sector has improved greatly. In the first
five months of the year, industrial enterprises across China
gained a profit of 125.4 billion yuan, 1.3 times more than the
same period last year.

Qiu Xiaohua, deputy director of the National Bureau of
Statistics, said that China's economy will continue to be stable.
Its economic growth rate this year is expected to be higher than
the 7.1 percent rise last year. Economists at home and abroad
predict that China's growth rate will be 7.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese leaders have repeatedly noted that there are
also some problems. The slow restructuring of China's economy and
poor domestic demand are two such problems. China will strengthen
reforms and revitalize the country by promoting and developing
science and education.

<HEADLINE> Beet Webworms Hit N. China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Insects are devastating farms
in north China's Hebei Province, threatening the growth of
agricultural crops, grassland and forests.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Provincial Agricultural Department said that
beet webworms have devastated Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Qinhuangdao,
Tangshan and other areas in Hebei since May.
</P>
<P>
The insects pose serious threats to the growth of maize, potato
and vegetables, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The beet webworms have damaged 8.5 million mu (about 567,000
hectares) of farmland, grassland and forests, including 2.5
million mu which was seriously affected. Some farmland will have
no yields this year.
</P>
<P>
Since May, it has rained several times in Zhangjiakou and
Chengde. The rains and moderate temperature have provided an ideal
breeding ground for insects.
</P>
<P>
In seriously affected areas, a square meter of land has as many
as 1,000 beet webworms.
</P>
<P>
In Wanquan and Huaian counties, beet webworms, locusts and
cabbage moths destroyed grassland and farmland, turning thousands
of hectares of maize and potato into barren fields.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has galvanized people and allocated
money to fight beet webworms, and is doing all it can to prevent
the further spread of the insects.

<HEADLINE> China Casts Shadow of Asian Financial Crisis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- While the economy of many Asian
countries is showing initial signs of recovery, China's economy
has spiraled up for quite a long period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said at the 21st Century Forum held
in Beijing this month that "China's economy has freed itself from
the impact of the Asian financial crisis and is showing signs of
improving"
</P>
<P>
Many economists fully endorsed Zhu's viewpoint. They agree that
China's economic growth has reached its best stage. This has been
verified by new figures released by the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, China's export soared 36.
8 percent to reach 92.3 billion U.S. dollars compared with the
figure a year ago, setting a record high since 1997. The gross
domestic product registered a 8.1 percent rise on the basis of a 8.
3 percent growth during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, attributed the good economic performance to a series
of macro-control policies taken by the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Dropping prices and drought will
reduce wheat planting areas by nearly one quarter in China during
the spring season.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the National Bureau of
Statistics NBS) today planting areas of spring wheat dropped by
780,000 hectares, or 23.6 percent from last year to 2.55 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas of spring rice also dropped by 850,000 hectares,
or 11.1 percent to 6.8 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese government scrapped protective prices for
surplus and poor quality spring rice and wheat, market prices have
been spiraling down, forcing grain growers to shift to other crops
that will bring in higher economic returns. The most severe
drought in a decade this spring also disrupted sowing in many
places.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas of sugar plants dropped by 142,000 hectares to 1.
276 million hectares, while jute decreased by 14,000 hectares to
34,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Chinese farmers are increasingly responsive to
market demands and more ready to adjust crops mix in line with
government policy.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas of cotton continued to recover this spring due
to market optimism and China's pending accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.524 million hectares of cotton have been planted, 59,000
hectares, or 1.7 percent more than in last year.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas of tobacco also grew by 33,000 hectares to 973,
000 hectares as more farmers shifted from grain growing to cash
crops.

<HEADLINE> China to Close Down 50 Small Steelworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China announced today the list of
50 small steelworks that will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Metallurgical
Industry (SAMI) said China plans to shut down 225 small steelworks
in the next few years, and has set this year's target at 103.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.58 million tons of out-dated steel production
capacity will be eliminated by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 1,000 unqualified steel plants, with an
annual production exceeding 5 million tons. These mills are
generally heavy polluters and high energy consumers, and their
products are of a low quality.
</P>
<P>
To avoid construction accidents, SAMI and the State Bureau of
Quality and Technical Supervision joined hands recently to curb
fake and substandard steel products nationwide. Industry, commerce
and public security departments will also lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
China's energy and finance sectors will stop supplies of fuel,
power, and loans to steelworks to be closed down. Licenses of some
steelworks will also be revoked by the authorities.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday night freed 450 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs), 12 years after a bloody war between the
two countries ended.
</P>
<P>
The POWs were released on the border spot of Khosrawi in the
western Kermanshah Province, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the release of this batch of POWs, Iran has freed a total
of 3,389 Iraqi POWs since the beginning of the current Iranian year
(which started March 20), said Asghar Azizi, head of Iran's POW
commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the release ceremony was attended by representatives of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, which since the end
of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988 has supervised repatriations of almost
98,000 POWs from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The fate of thousands of captives is among the thorniest issues
hindering the improvement of ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has documents showing more than 3,000 Iranian POWs
are still being held in Iraq, while Baghdad maintains Iran is still
holding thousands of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year war has claimed the lives of some 1 million
people and severely damaged the two countries' economy.

"We need to see why and where our shortfalls are, what needs to

Malaysia from June 29 to July 2 held in conduction with the
ongoing 27th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM) here.
</P>
<P>
He said the first step is to have the will and sincere desire
to synergize efforts for building and developing the Islamic world
and this should be followed by bridging the wide information gap
existing among the Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Once the information on what each Islamic country has to offer
and its needs, with regards to exports, imports, investments,
transfer of technology, know-how and others are bridged, the
countries would be in a better position to know that their needs
could be fulfilled from within the Islamic world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no reason as to why Islamic nations could not
collectively be a challenging force as they do not lack anything,
being rich in resources, manpower, experience and know how.

<HEADLINE> China Cultivates Colored Hot Peppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Hot pepper is basically green or red,
but a Chinese company has succeeded in cultivating a variety of
colored peppers.
</P>
<P>
In the Fengle Seeds Industry Company laboratory in east China's
Anhui Province, you can find white, purple, yellow and black hot
peppers. Even in one plant you can have hot peppers in several
colors.
</P>
<P>
Dai Zuyun, an agriculture scientist, said that no other
companies in China has been successful in cultivating such
colorful hot peppers, although the Netherlands, Spain, Bulgaria
and Israel have been successful in cultivating different colored
hot peppers as well.
</P>
<P>
The company has tried to introduce foreign varieties in China,
but attempts have failed as China's climate, soil, and infestation
of insects are different from those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the company started to develop its own technology.
After three years of experiments, it finally succeeded in planting
different colored hot peppers using hybrid and directive breeding
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Dai said colored hot peppers are a kind of cash crop which are

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Health Status Ranks 150th in World: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The total government expenditure on health is only 26 percent
in Nepal while total private expenditure stands at 74 percent,
which is significantly higher compared to some 25 percent in
industrial countries, said the World Health Report 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nepal spends as low as 3.7 percent of its GDP on health, said
the report, the first ever analysis of the world's health systems
carried out by WHO.
</P>
<P>
The report recorded average life expectancy of a Nepali woman
at 57.8 years while that of a man at 57.3 years, compared with an
average level of over 70 years in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's health system is not so responsive but a positive note
is that the government has made attempts to provide the health
services to the outlying districts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
WHO's assessment system is based on five indicators: overall
level of population, health indisparities within the population,
overall level of health system responsiveness (a combination of
patient satisfaction and how well the system acts), distribution
of responsiveness within the population and the distribution of
financial burden within the population.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes Motion for Interpellation of President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The motion gained 332 votes, rejected by 63 votes and 36 votes
abstains. A majority of votes in the 500-seat House is needed for
the motion to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The motion, supported by the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) and the Golkar Party, is aimed at summoning and
seeking an explanation from the president over the dismissal of
State Minister of Investment and State Enterprises Development
Laksamana Sukarni and Minister of Trade and Industry Yusuf Kalla.
</P>
<P>
Laksamana is high up in the ranks of PDI-P while Kalla is a
Golkar Party senior member.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P faction chairman Arifin Panigoro maintained that the
interpellation was not aimed at questioning the president's
prerogative to dismiss the ministers, but on the grounds of making
such a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is aimed at questioning the inconsistency of the reasons
stated by the president for the ministers' dismissal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president earlier said that the replacement of Laksamana
and Kalla on April 25 was aimed at harmonizing his economics team.
But later, the president, during a closed-door consultative
meeting with House leaders, claimed that they were axed because
the two were allegedly involved in graft.

The exports which contributed most to the export earnings were
food items, beverages and tobacco, textiles and apparels,
petroleum products, leather and rubber, a Central Bank official
told the newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from food, beverages and tobacco recorded 44.14

</P>
<P>
The textile and garment exports have contributed largely
throughout to industrial export earnings. The export earning last
year stood at 4,600 million U.S. dollars which was 4 percent below
the previous year's earnings due to low commodity prices that
prevailed in the world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Competition from East Asian countries also contributed to the
low prices of the major export products, textiles and garments,
said the official, adding that natural rubber and rubber products
too were affected for the same reason.

<P>
WARSAW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski will pay a working visit to Moscow and meet his
Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on July 10, the presidential
office announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have been strained since Poland joined NATO
in March 1999 and deteriorated early this year by Poland's
expulsion of nine Russian diplomats accused of spying and the
attack on the Russian consulate by pro-Chechen protesters in
Poznan, Poland.
</P>
<P>
Putin said at the end of last year that he would visit Poland
this spring but the plan was shelved following the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
The coming visit by Kwasniewski sends another signal that
leaders of the two countries hope to heal their cooled relations.
</P>
<P>
On March 6, Kwasniewski called the then Acting President Putin
and thanked him for the liberation of two Polish women scientists
from Chechen captivity.
</P>
<P>
Following Putin's victory in presidential election on March 26
both countries have repeatedly stated their desire to improve
relations.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation on March 29, Kwasniewski
congratulated Putin on his victory and invited him to visit Poland.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, Putin called his Polish counterpart and both
presidents said they will improve bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Intel Launches Pentium IV Computer Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Industry analysts believed that the Pentium IV far outpaces the
processing power of Athlon chip running at 1 billion bits of
information per second, recently announced by rival Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. (AMD).
</P>
<P>
Computers operating at such speeds are essential in a world
where new generations of Internet commerce, gaming and
entertainment require greater processing power, Intel's chief
executive, Craig Barrett, said while unveiling the new name at
Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Intel's fastest chip until now has been a Pentium III that
processes information at 850 megahertz, slightly more than half as
fast as the new Pentium IV.
</P>
<P>
The Pentium IV will be introduced in the second half of this
year and is aimed at offering faster performance, as well as
enhanced graphics, video and other capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said consumers should wait until software
developers catch up with chipmakers before spending additional
money on computers using such high-performance chips as the
Pentium IV.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, as Intel moves Pentium IV down market, into mid-
range PCs, it will replace the Pentium III as the company's main
volume chip, according to other analysts who also predict the
Pentium III will be around for some time, lasting into 2002 in
mobile applications.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the Pentium III, Pentium IV is tuned for much
higher clock speed performance. At the same time, it also offers a
wider 400 MHz system bus, the pipeline that connects the chip to
memory and other system components. The current Intel standard is
133 MHz now offered with the Pentium III chip. Pentium IV will
also have a larger on-chip cache, which will help improve
performance.

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Viewers worldwide will have a
chance to watch the tide of the Qiantang River, one of China's
natural wonders, on their television sets on September 15.

The tide of the Qiantang near Haining, a booming city in east
China's Zhejiang Province, is one of the country's most amazing
phenomena. Scientists say that the bell-shaped mouth of the
Qiantang River near the city helps form the not-to-be-missed "
Haining Tide," which has a crest as high as 3.5 meters.
</P>

An international tide watching festival has been held annually
since 1994 and has attracted millions of domestic and overseas
tourists.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rejects WHO Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has rejected a report on
world health for the year 2000 issued by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Geneva on June 21, which ranks Myanmar near
the bottom of the list despite significant gains made by the
country's health system in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the Myanmar Ministry of Health available
here Thursday said the WHO report is highly objectionable, blaming
that unreliable methods have been employed to arrive at the
assessment.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is aggrieved that its unrelenting efforts to improve
health system performance have not been given the recognition it
deserves but instead discredited, the press release stated,
charging that the report is an egregious misrepresentation of the
overall health system performance of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The press release also charged that compilations made by the
WHO in assessing the health system of performance of Myanmar are
biased deviation from the pertinent data published by the
government and are found to be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The press release vowed that Myanmar will proceed on its chosen
path of implementing all aspects of modern health service for the
benefit of all citizens.

<HEADLINE> Georgia to Reduce 9,000 Army Servicemen in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian parliament Wednesday
passed a bill on cutting down the national armed forces from 47,
500 to 38,400 servicemen by the end of this year, reported the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting at a plenary session of the legislature in
Tbilisi, Revaz Adamiya, chairman of the parliamentary committee
for national defense and security, said the reduction has become
necessary as a radical reform is being carried out in the defense
sector recently.
</P>
<P>
The reform aims to modernize the army of the former Soviet
republic to meet the military standards of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to pave the way for gaining a full NATO
membership by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reduction will mainly focus on cutting down logistic
personnel. The staff of the combat units will remain unchanged.
Under the reform, Georgia's armed force will be further cut down
to 13,000 or even 12,000 people by 2004, said Georgian First
Deputy Defense Minister Zhoni Pirtskhalaishvily.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian government cannot afford the existing scale of
defense sector owing to the budget crisis, observers said. And
worse still, the servicemen of the Georgian army have not received
their pay for 14 months, according to the parliamentary opposition.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's defense budget is reportedly no more than 20 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Ethnic Albanians Stage Anti-KFOR Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo ethnic Albanians staged
their first demonstration against the KFOR international
peacekeeping force to protest against the destruction of a huge
arms stash belonging to former rebels, KFOR official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crowd up to 1,000 ethnic Albanians used trucks to block the
way into the village of Lapusnik late Tuesday and waved banners
saying "KFOR out of Kosovo" and "These weapons belong to the
Albanian people," said the KFOR spokesman, who was quoted by the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the first time ethnic Albanians have
demonstrated against KFOR since the NATO-led force was stationed
in Kosovo last year, and added that the rally was certainly well-
organized.
</P>
<P>
KFOR troops found four bunkers filled with weapons and
explosives, which belonged to the former Kosovo Liberation Army (
KLA), earlier this month in the central village of Klecki. A huge
amount of them were later destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. Resolution 1244, which was not well implemented, the
KLA should have been disbanded by last September. They have only
turned in a small amount of their weapons so far.

<HEADLINE> Online PC Sales to Increase Rapidly in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of personal
computers (PC) U.S. consumers purchase online will increase
rapidly over the next five years, an American market research firm
predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), just eight
percent of all PCs were sold to U.S. consumers, or fewer than 1.4
million sets, via the Internet in 1999. In 2004, close to 40
percent of all consumer PC sales in the United States or almost 9.
3 million sets, will be made online.
</P>
<P>
The IDC estimates 50 percent of U.S. homes owned at least one
PC last year and almost 36 percent have Internet access. "Given
the current penetration of PCs in the home and the rapid rise in
the percentage of home accessing the Internet, a greater number of
consumers will utilize the Web as a commerce tool when shopping
for a new PC," the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Targeted marketing efforts, convenience, growing comfort with e-
commerce and price will all help to drive consumer PC sales over
the Internet, the IDC said. But PC manufacturers would have to
rely on Internet channel partners rather than relying on direct
sales online.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, the most successful computer sellers will
be those that offer a combination of online and brick-and-mortar
sales.

<HEADLINE> Elian returns to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The six-year old Cuban boy Elian
Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane
Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven-
month long bitter custody battle.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the Cuban National
Assembly of People's Power, Elian's family members in Cuba and his
classmates are among the several hundred people welcoming him at
Jose Marti airport where the plane landed at 7.45 p.m. local time
(2345 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The plane took off at Washington Dulles International Airport
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal by Elian
relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Elian's custody battle began after he survived a shipwreck that
killed his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants on November
22, 1999. The boy was soon in the center of a campaign to bring
him back to Cuba by his father and relatives in Cuba and to keep
him in the United States by his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Elian's return constitutes a major victory to President Fidel
Castro and the Cuban people who have time and again demonstrated
to demand the return of the shipwreck survivor boy to his
Caribbean homeland in Cuba, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> White Paper Reflects a True Tibet: Tibetan People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- All walks of life in Tibet refuted
in succession the prattling of the Dalai Lama clique that "Tibetan
Culture has become extinct," while hailing the issuance of the
While Paper on "The development of Tibetan Culture" by the
Information Office of the State Council last week.
</P>
<P>
Danzim Cering, a research fellow of the Tibetan Art Research
Institute, said that folk artists and 95 percent of serfs in Tibet
had a low social status before the democratic reform in 1959. They
roamed about begging and had no time to think about how to inherit
and carry forward Tibetan art.
</P>
<P>
Since the democratic reform, the central and local governments
have devoted a lot of manpower and money to protecting Tibetan
folk art, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wangdui Cering, director of the Tibetan Press and Publication
Bureau, said the white paper presents a true picture of Tibetan
culture to the people world-wide. The development of Tibetan press
and broadcasting mentioned in the white paper shows that the Dalai
Lama serves as a loyal tool of the overseas anti-China force.
</P>
<P>
Lobu, chairman of the Lhasa Youth Federation, said that that
traditional culture of Tibet have taken root among local young
people. At present they have got used to dress in traditional
costume and dance with national music during holidays and
festivals.
</P>
<P>
Qamba Puncog, chairman of the Tibet Federation of Literary and
art circles, said a contingent of Tibetan artists and literary
workers has been fostered. They combine Tibet's traditions with
modern art to establish a new school of thought generally
acknowledged in the world. The Tibetan Folk Art Association has
compiled a three-volume book on folk stories, ballads and proverbs.

HEFEI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, a major
grain producer of the country, has used a growing amount of
overseas investment this year.

<P>
Recent statistics show the province approved the establishment

business people since the beginning of last year, and they include
measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of
overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Control Eases Asia-Europe Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Satellite and digital navigation
technology may have improved air safety over western China,
allowing planes to go from Southeast Asia to Europe using a
relatively direct flight path.
</P>
<P>
A successful trial flight indicated that China had reached a
milestone in modernizing its air traffic control facilities, today
's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, an Australia Qantas airliner with passengers
aboard embarked on the new flight course, entering China at the
border with Kazakhstan. It flew over air traffic control regions
in Urumqi, Lanzhou, Chengdu and Kunming before leaving China over
the Laotian border.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, another Qantas flight flew from Frankfurt to
Singapore via the same route.
</P>
<P>
The new route is made safe with a leading air traffic control
system called Communication Navigation and Surveillance/Air
Traffic Management.
</P>
<P>
This 3,200-kilometer route shortens flight distance from
Southeast Asia and Oceania to Europe, said Chen Haiju, director of
the Air Traffic Management Bureau under the Civil Aviation
Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
Europe-bound planes from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
Australia and New Zealand will cut their flights by 15 to 45
minutes by using the new route, said Lu Xiaoping, another bureau
official.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Shows Positive Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, JUNE 29 (Xinhua) -- China's economic performance is
showing positive signs that may nudge the country out of a long
period of deflation, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
Latest NBS statistics indicate that China's economy developed
in a stable and healthy way in the first five months of the year,
with its gross domestic product (GDP) expected to reach 7.5
percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial enterprises reported 125.4 billion yuan in
profits during the period, of which the state-owned and state-
holding enterprises contributed 55 percent, or 69.2 billion yuan,
3.1 times that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial added-value accumulated to 890.4 billion yuan,
up 11 percent, with the industrial performance composite index
climbing to 101.8, the highest level in recent years.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, the investment expectations were
rising again owing to newly-started projects. The fixed assets
investment of state-owned and other economies rose 9.5 percent in
the period to hit 523.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the central government's stimulus policies for
consumption have had positive results. And urban retail sales of
consumer products rose 11.5 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's consumer confidence index increased for the
fifth consecutive month in May, a sign that consumers are
optimistic about future economic development.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade also grew at a high speed in the first
half of the year, with imports and exports volume totaling 174.1
billion U.S. dollars, up more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves continued to increase, and have
amounted to 158 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the better performance of China's economy
mainly to the implementation of the pro-active fiscal policy in
the past two years. However, they believe that this is just the
beginning of the positive trend of the overall economic
development, and it will take some time before faster economic
growth can be registered.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- World-renowned retail giants are
investing more in China, with the optimistic view of a better
investment environment and the hope of garnering a bigger slice of
the huge pie.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Wal-mart, the world's No.1 retailer and the second in the
world's 500 giants, announced here this week that it will continue
to purchase goods from China in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"In our investment plan, Wal-mart will increase its annual
purchase from China by 25 percent or more," said Li Chengjie, vice-
president of Wal-mart Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wal-mart opened its first store in Shenzhen in 1996 and became
the first overseas retailer permitted to establish joint ventures
in China. To date, its investment in China has surpassed 900
million yuan (108.4 million U.S. dollars) and its annual purchase
of goods from China has reached 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Parkson Group, the biggest department store and chain store
company in Malaysia, has opened 19 Parksons in China. Sales from
its Beijing branch topped 800 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Fusheng, president of Parkson (China), said that Parkson
has an ambitious plan, namely to open 100 Parksons in China by the
year 2005, with distribution centers established in all Chinese
provincial capitals.
</P>
<P>
Parkson's two other joint ventures are under construction in
Huhhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
and Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan Province in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Wal-mart and Parkson, other retail giants like Price
Smart of the United States, Carrefour of France, Makro of the
Netherlands and Metro of Germany all have clear investment
timetables. Many of these companies have achieved success in
investing in coastal China and are now eyeing the country's vast
western region.

<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) jointly issued
a regulation late last year, allowing overseas investors to
establish joint ventures in all provincial capitals, autonomous
regions and a number of designated cities. Previously this
activity was just confined to 11 coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
"China encourages overseas investors to invest more in the
commercial sector, and China's attitude toward opening up has
always been consistent," said Yi Hui, director of SETC's overseas
fund management department.
</P>
<P>
Retail giants have shown enthusiasm in applying for new
projects since the introduction of these new regulations, and as a
result, the number of State-approved retail joint ventures has
increased from 21 to 29. Another 277 joint retail companies have
been authorized by local governments.
</P>
<P>
China is considered one of the world's largest markets, with
annual retail sales hitting some 3 trillion yuan, but overseas
investment only accounts for 2.5 percent of all retail sales, said
Jiang Ming, secretary of the China General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the inflow of overseas capital will benefit
domestic retailers in the way that they bring modern marketing
patterns and advanced management to China.

<HEADLINE> Norman Crashed as Seeds Scattered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Belgian qualifier Olivier Rochus
produced the day's biggest surprise at the Wimbledon on Wednesday
when he defeated world number two Magnus Norman in five sets.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old sent the Swede into a total frustration in the
match, in which he lost 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-7 and 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, playing his 55th match of the year, was so
dispirited by the penultimate game of the defeat that he asked a
ball girl to play a rally for him.
</P>
<P>
Seven men's seeds have now fallen in the first three days of
the championships - six of them in the top half of the draw which
means defending champion Pete Sampras has only one seed,Thomas
Enqvist of Sweden, between him and the final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, going for a record 13th Grand Slam title, beat
Slovakia's Karol Kucera 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in failing light on
Center Court after having his left ankle strapped heavily in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old American was taken to hospital after the match
where his inflamed foot was given a scan. His injury will be "re-
evaluated" on Thursday morning, organisers said.
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova, away from the All England Club for five
years since her retirement, returned to partner Mariaan de Swardt
to a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 victory over Amanda Hopmans and Lubomira
Bacheva in the first round of the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
The nine-times singles champion played as though she had never
been away as she took her first step towards a record-equalling
20th Wimbledon title, aged 43.

LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- American controversial boxer Mike
Tyson has been summoned to appear before the British Boxing Board
of Control, in the wake of his controversial fight with Lou
Savarese in Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
Tyson has been called before the BBBC's 'committee of the
stewards' in London on August 8 for throwing several punches after
referee John Coyle had stopped the fight at Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
He will also be asked to explain his comments aimed at Britain'
s WBC and IBF heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis moments after his
victory.
</P>
<P>
The American took just 38 seconds to dispose of Savarese last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a possible clash against Lewis, he replied: "I want
your heart. I want to eat your children.
</P>
<P>
"He is no match for me when I am right. I want to rip out his
heart and feed it to him," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jayson Williams Quits NBA for Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 32-year-old big rebounder lamented in a statement that "
this has been a hard choice for me. I loved playing basketball, I
loved being a Net and I loved the fans in New Jersey. But I know
from the pain in my knee and what my physicians have told me that
my injuries won't allow me to return."
</P>
<P>
Williams has not played since April 1, 1998 when he sustained
the career-ending injuries in a game against Atlanta. He attempted
a comeback late last season but broke his left foot during
practice.
</P>
<P>
However, the team will have to wait until April 1 to petition
the NBA to remove his salary from the team's cap. Williams is in
the second year of a six-year, 85 million U.S dollars contract.
</P>
<P>
He spent his first two NBA seasons in Philadelphia before being
traded to the Nets in 1992. He started to blossom in 1995-96 with
a run of four straight years, averaging more than 10 rebounds a
game.
</P>
<P>
Williams was named an All-Star in 1997-98 when he averaged 13.4
points and 13.5 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Change on Zimbabwe's Political Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A big change has taken place in the
 Zimbabwean political arena with a new opposition party posing a
threat to the 20-year-domination of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth parliamentary election on June 24-25, the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) won
narrowly with 62 seats against 57 seats for the Movement for
Democratic Change, which was formed nine months ago. It was the
first time the ruling party lost many seats to a opposition party.
</P>
<P>
From the country's independence in 1980, Zanu-pf, which fought
a bitter war against British colonialists, had enjoyed support
from the majority of people due to its efforts in improving its
peoples' lives by building schools and hospitals, providing free
primary education and creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the just-ended election, Zanu-pf still had massive backing
from people in the rural areas, but lost heavily in towns because
of the difficult economic situation greatly affecting urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
But, when the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
demanded Zimbabwe to introduce economic structural adjustment
program in the early 1990s, the hard economic times were triggered
off. Unemployment soared. Interest rates shot up. Foreign
investment flowed out of the country. The prices of basic
commodities, such as bread and cooking oil, rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Many people, especially those in towns, began to complain that
Zanu-pf had forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) took advantage of
the situation and launched the new party, the Movement for
Democratic Change, which turned out to be "a black horse" in the
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the working class, MDC challenged the once
unchallenged Zanu-pf and reaped its first victory when it
mobilized supporters to vote against the proposed constitutional
reform draft during the referendum in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the MDC has surged ahead with bold confidence.
</P>
<P>
When President Robert Mugabe announced that the election would
be held in June this year, MDC made it clear that it would field
candidates for all the 120 contested seats. The MDC did give
Zanu-pf a hard time during the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
However, Zanu-pf is still in control of the parliament since
President Mugabe is empowered by the constitution to appoint 30
people to Parliament. This allows Mugabe to form a government
merely from his Zanu-pf.
</P>
<P>
But political observers have urged him to form a coalition
government which he did with Zimbabwe African People Union (Zapu)
at independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
After the marginal victory in the parliamentary election, the
government is faced with the big job of reversing the slowdown of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the pressing issue that the Zanu-pf should tackle is land
distribution. Only 4,500 whites own 70 percent of fertile land
while more than 12 million people are still living on very poor
soils in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Just before the election, the freedom fighters, who fought for
 independence, occupied about 1,500 farms owned by whites, saying
Zanu-pf was taking too long in getting back the land from British
settlers.
</P>
<P>
These veterans have vowed to remain on the occupied farms until
the government buys enough farms to settle them.

<HEADLINE> NIgerian Government to Mediate Lagos Workers' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government will
mediate the trade dispute between the Lagos state government and
workers, who embarked on a strike here seven days ago over the
minimum wage, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As both sides to the dispute remain entrenched in their
positions, the Federal Ministry of Employment, Labor and
Productivity is expected to refer the dispute to the Industrial
Arbitration Panel (IAP), according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the strike has to be called off and the state
 government must also cease to lock out workers," a source in the
ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The state governor, Bola Tinubu, has in the meantime directed
an immediate resumption of the negotiation between the government
and the workers.
</P>
<P>
State lawmakers have advised the government to withdraw a suit
against the workers at a Lagos High Court, and the workers to call
off the strike.
</P>
<P>
The workers embarked on the strike Thursday to pressure the
government to pay them a monthly minimum wage of 7,500 naira as
against 5,500 naira offered by the state government (about 100
naira is equal to one U. S. dollar).

<HEADLINE> France Reaches Final after Sudden-death Win over Portugal </HEADLINE>

<P>
"Out objective was not to be in the final. It is to win the
final," said Zidane. "It will be even tougher Sunday."
</P>
<P>
France is trying to be the first world champion to become a
European champion at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Both sides started out very hesitantly, keeping most players
well behind the ball and crowding midfield as much as possible. It
made combination play near impossible and playmakers Zidane nor
Luis Figo had space to show off their skills.
</P>
<P>
Finally the match started living up to its billing, with Figo
starting to move more freely and the French smoothly pushing the
ball around.
</P>
<P>
Zidane started using the newfound space to spin magic. A deep
ball to Henry and a curling cross to Anelka deserved better than
two botched attempts on goal.
</P>
<P>
Both players had been expected to play after fine performances
so far in Portugal's Euro 2000 drive. The team announcement an
hour ahead of kickoff appeared purely tactical, since Coelho had
declared all 22 squad members fit Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
French president Jacques Chirac was a guest of honor among the
50,000 fans at the king Baudouin.

<HEADLINE> Coelho quits as Portugal Coach after Semifinal Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Humberto Coelho will quit as
Portuguese coach after his team was beaten 2-1 by France in a
dramatic Euro 2000 semifinal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"From July 31 I will no longer be Portuguese coach. I think
now is a good time to let you know," he said after the match.
</P>
<P>
"We need time to prepare for the next battle to have a new
coach. I wish all the best to my successor."
</P>
<P>
Coelho's appointment in December 1997 caused an outcry because
a poor track record as a trainer had forced him to take up a
business career.
</P>
<P>
But after he successfully steered Portugal through to the
finals, Soccer Federation chief Gilberto Madail said his
controversial choice was vindicated.
</P>
<P>
Aged 50, Coelho was considered one of Europe's leading liberos
and picked up four Portuguese championship medals from his days
with Benfica between 1968-75.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA to Launch Airline Maintenance Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement came as the FAA reported that Alaska Airlines,
under intense scrutiny since a January crash off the coast of
California, has made sufficient improvements to continue doing
maintenance on its planes.
</P>
<P>
The agency had threatened to strip the airline of the right to
do maintenance -- a step that could have eventually grounded all
its planes -- unless its programs were improved.
</P>
<P>
Nick Lacey, FAA director of flight standards, said three teams
of a half-dozen safety inspectors each will fan out starting July
17 to look at the maintenance programs of the nation's nine other
major carriers.
</P>
<P>
The hope, Lacey said, is to identify successful programs and
safety practices so airlines can share them with one another. If
problems are found, however, he said, the FAA will not hesitate to
act.
</P>
<P>
The close inspection of Alaska Airlines was launched after the
January 31 crash of Flight 261 in the Pacific Ocean off Los
Angeles, killing all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of unsafe maintenance work, which first surfaced in
1998, were thrust back into the spotlight. The cause of that
accident remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Maintains Dominance Over L. American Poultry Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States has a dominating
position in the Latin American poultry market and damages the
producers, Latin America Poultry Producers Association (ALA)
chairman Fernando Ikeda Matsukawa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said in Lima that being a big producer, the United States
exports the surplus of its national consumption at very low prices,
damaging the poultry activity in the zone.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of all the region are getting together to demand
fairness, and we think that this is an abuse of dominance by the
United States," said the Peruvian businessman, also manager of the
San Fernando poultry enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The ALA representative announced that the regional organization
is preparing the documents to file a demand before the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that the negotiations for the Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) establishment will start in April of 2001,
so we still have time to present the documents to support our
position," said Ikeda.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said that the unfair competition made the first five
months of this year difficult for the poultry industry enterprises.

<HEADLINE> NATO Secretary Visits Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary George Robertson
visited Germany on Thursday and had talks with German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Robertson and Fischer both stressed the bilateral ties between
the NATO and Russia. They discussed also the European Union's ties
with the NATO, European security policy.
</P>
<P>
Robertson praised that Germany would make a greater
contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO)through the reform
plans of its armed forces. Robertson stressed also the leading
role of Germany in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The German cabinet approved the reform plans offered by German
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping on June 14, on the basis of his
reform plans the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, will cut its
numbers from currently 320000 soldiers to 255000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
As an important force of the NATO German armed forces played a
key role during the time of the Cold War. After the end of the
Cold War the NATO will further enlarge towards east and former
members of Warsaw Pact Czech Republic and Hungary had been
admitted into the NATO last March. The enlargement of the NATO
will undoubtedly threaten the security of Russia. Therefore the
improvement of the bilateral relations of the NATO and Russia is
quite important in the future.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Unveils 700 Mln C. Dlrs for Atlantic Canada Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien unveiled an Atlantic Canada strategy of 700 million
Canadian dollars (about 473 million U.S. dollars) Thursday to
narrow the region's development gap with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chretien told a press conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that
the five-year funding in the form of Atlantic Investment
Partnership came at the time when "Atlantic Canada's economy is
changing."
</P>
<P>
"The traditional resource dependent economy is becoming more
knowledge-intensive. And economic growth is being driven more and
more by innovation, technology, tourism and exports," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Atlantic Canada has lower levels of productivity and less
investment in research and development. It does not export as much
as other regions of Canada. And unemployment is still too high,"
according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A flagship initiative to narrow that development gap is an
Atlantic Investment Fund of 300 million Canadian dollars (about
203 million U.S. dollars), which will be used to build technology
and research facilities, ranging from universities to institutes.
</P>
<P>
Two of the other initiatives include the Partnership for
Community Economic Development and the Partnership for Trade and
Investment.
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Canada is composed of the country's eastern provinces
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland.

<HEADLINE> Economic Boom Leaves U.S. Working Poor Behind: Report </HEADLINE>

<P>
Poverty has grown in both overall number and as a percentage of
people employed full-time and year-round since 1973, according to
the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
Close to 3% of all full-time workers are living under the
poverty line, defined as 13,000 U.S. dollars for a family of three,
in 1998, the latest year for which data is available, the Board
said in its new study.
</P>
<P>
"Including dependents, this could be upwards of 5 million
people," it said.

The study finds that poverty in the U.S. fell dramatically in
the 1960s and 1970s but "the lasting gains have not materialized
since".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drought to Trigger Energy Price Increases in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- As well as the damage to
agriculture, the current drought in Romania could trigger
increases in the energy prices, if going on for another month, the
Romanian Minister of Trade and Industries Radu Bercenu said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The drought will pose energy problems since a great chunk of
the energy produced, about 2,000 MwH, is generated by water plants
at low costs. Because of the drought, the energy generated by
these plants decreases a lot, and this has a negative impact on
prices,"Berceanu said.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices are calculated as a median of the prices for
power generated by water plants, thermoplants and the power
produced by the Cernavoda nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
"If the water plants generate just 1,000 MwH, instead of 2,000
MwH, at 15 U.S. dollars/MwH, the remainder 1,000 MwH will have to
be compensated for by thermal power at 50 dollars/MwH, which will
push the median upwards," Berceanu said.
</P>
<P>
Romania is suffering the worst drought in the past 50 years;
most of the crops in the eastern and southeastern parts are
expected to yield no harvest. The drought has brought till now a
direct economic loss of more than 2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector in Romania Has Biggest Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The private sector has the
biggest volume of arrears in the Romanian economy, with a total of
61,000 billion lei (2.87 billion U.S. dollars), the local media
Thursday quoted a Finance Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Second in this classification of debts comes the sector of
mixed property (state and private), with 44,632 billion lei (2.10
billion U.S. dollars) worth of arrears. The state sector comes
last, with 40,335 billion lei (1.90 billion U.S. dollars), State
Secretary of the Finance Ministry Iosefina Morosanu added.
</P>
<P>
As for the state sector, the state secretary said it held 27.5
percent of the total arrears, 21 percent of the arrears to social
security contribution, 34.7 percent of the arrears accumulated to
the health insurance, 33.95 percent of the ones to the additional
pension, 42 percent of the arrears to the unemployment fund, 40
percent of the arrears to the state budget, 32 percent to the
local budgets, and 11 percent to bank credits.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the big volume of arrears in the private
sector is caused by delaying the payment of the duties to the
state and suppliers because of the private economic agents'
shortage of financial sources. More than half of the arrears in
the private sector are to suppliers and 21 percent to the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the arrears, the Finance Ministry has taken measures
to improve the collection, to reschedule the outstanding payments
and to turn the debts to the state into shares, the official also
said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not Optimistic Over New Round of Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece was not optimistic over the
result of the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored talks between Cyprus' two
communities in Geneva on July 5.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that nobody can talk about optimism. We cannot
have high expectations because of the completely negative attitude
of the other (Turkish) side," Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said at a press briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, the Greek Cypriot side led by
President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot side led Rauf
Denktash have held two rounds of indirect talks in New York and
Geneva respectively, and the third round of such talks is expected
to take place in Geneva on July 5, but Denktash had been
threatening not to go to Geneva because of the non-inclusion of an
addendum in the U.N. secretary general's report with a Turkish
Cypriot demand for separate consultations with the U.N. Peace-
Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that they should show the international community
that the Turkish side was the one to blame for the deadlock in
efforts for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Clerides will visit Greece next Monday to
discuss with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis the Geneva talks
he will have with Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clerides' talks with Simitis would be
substantive.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has signed a joint defense agreement with Cyprus,
and Cyprus support the reunification of the island in a federation
formula in line with the U.N. resolutions while Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot side demand that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up on the Mediterranean island.

<HEADLINE> New BSE Fears in Britain After Cow Infected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) - Fresh fears over the spread of BSE
in cattle have been sparked by an announcement that a cow
developed the disease even though it was born after strict
controls were introduced.
</P>
<P>
Nick Brown, British Agriculture Minister, told parliament
Thursday: "An animal born on August 25, 1996 was confirmed as a
BSE case on June 27 this year."
</P>
<P>
"Experts have always foreseen a few cases of BSE could be
confirmed in animals born after August 1, 1996," Brown said. "
There is no risk to food safety as a result of this case."
</P>
<P>
However, food safety experts fear the disease could have had
passed on by the animal's mother - a method of transmission not
previously proven.
</P>
<P>
An EU-wide export ban on British beef was imposed in 1996, at
the height of the crisis over "mad cow disease"after Britain
admitted there was a link with a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
that has killed dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association called for a thorough and
transparent investigation on how the cow became infected and any
implications for public health.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said: "This again reinforces the fact that many
uncertainties still remain regarding BSE. We need to ensure that
vigorous and effective controls are in place."

<HEADLINE> Cuba To Honor Migratory Accords with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government announced
Thursday that it will continue honoring the migratory agreements
signed with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is also willing to resume talks on the theme "when
conditions will permit it."
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez said at her
press conference that "Cuba continues committed to the strict
compliance with the migratory agreements signed with the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Washington and Havana have an agreement in force since May of
1995 that seeks to facilitate a legal, ordered and safe emigration.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that when conditions are adequate, her
country will be willing to resume the migratory talks with the
United States, which had been scheduled for June 16-29 in New York,
but were suspended by Havana 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that when Cuba announced the suspension of the
talks, it had said that the conditions were not adequate not only
because Elian Gonzalez was in the United States, but because there
are other discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
Elian returned Wednesday to Havana after nine months of
retention in the United States, after surviving a wreckage of
illegal emigrants, in which his mother and stepfather drowned.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman mentioned among the discrepancies between
Washington and Havana the Law of Cuban Adjustment and the
propaganda of radio stations, which encourage from Florida the
illegal emigration of Cubans.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Adjustment Act in force since 1966 permits Cuban
emigrants who illegally set foot on U.S. soil to obtain residence
and work permits, which has been denounced by the Cuban
authorities as a tacit encouragement to illegal emigration.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Britain Wants to Join Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday said his country would take part in the euro zone, but
would do so only if "the economic tests were pleasing."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who arrived in Germany on a working visit, discussed
the future of Europe with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in
the evening in Potsdam near Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held private talks focusing on French
President Jacques Chirac's proposals for a "European basic law
framework" and for a "pioneer group" in European integration.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Chirac gave a speech at the German
parliament urging Germany and France to lead deeper integration by
some member states.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he agreed with France on a "common European basic
law framework," and Britain should be afraid of being excluded
from the European integration.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's speech is "not talking about a hardcore Europe, but
talking about expanded cooperation. There is no reason at all why
we should be sensitive about this," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
"We should be a full player in Europe," he stressed, adding
that Britain was interested in docking with the euro successfully.
That was important for Britain's job market, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Leaders Call for Senate Action on PNTR in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business leaders Thursday
again called on the Senate to vote in July on the bill granting
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
"If PNTR is lost ... America will pay the consequences for
decades," said Thomas Donohua, president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable,
and the Information Technology Industry Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott to
schedule a final vote in July on a the PNTR bill, warning that a
delay of vote could hurt the interests of American companies and
cause a set-back for U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
"PNTR is an essential national priority, not just for economic
reasons, but because it will set the stage for U.S.-China
relations in the decades to come," said Samuel Maury, president of
the Business Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
"It is important enough not to be delayed," he said. "If PNTR
is deferred much longer, we may squander a historic opportunity to
set U.S.-China relations on a positive course for the 21st century.
"
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Senate leadership to set a firm date in July for
the vote on PNTR," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the
National Association of Manufacturers. "We believe there is a
strong, bipartisan support for PNTR in the Senate and there is no
reason to wait any longer to move this historic legislation
forward."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the PNTR bill by a
vote of 237-197 on May 24.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. business community hoped that the House-passed bill
will give American companies long-sought access to China markets.
</P>
<P>
Trent Lott of Mississippi said earlier this month that he
expects the Senate to vote on the PNTR bill in July, but he has
not set a specific date yet.

their earnings will miss analysts' expectations in the second
quarter. Among them were Unisys and Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
The announcements hurt the market which was already cooled off
by the warnings of inflation from the Federal Reserve at the end
of policy-making meeting Wednesday. The warnings led investors to
believe that the Federal Reserve would raise rates again at the
August 22 meeting if the danger of inflation is increasing.
</P>
<P>
J.P. Morgan and Citigroup on the financial sector fell. LSI
Logic and Cisco on the technology side were also lower.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve decided to leave rate unchanged Wednesday
after six hikes in rates in the past year in an effort to cool off
the U.S. economy and keep inflation under control. Analysts did
not rule out the possibility of one more action on rates following
the Federal Reserve's warning of inflation.

The NYSE index fell 1.46 at 642.75 and the Russell 2000 index

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on

unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.10 billion shares from 1.05 billion

<HEADLINE> 21 Indian U.N. Peacekeepers in S. Leone Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Thursday
announced the release of 21 Indian U.N. peacekeepers who had been
trapped by rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said that the group
was now at a Liberian border town and expected in the Liberian
capital Monrovia shortly, according to reports reaching here from
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Liberia hoped the release would lead to a
negotiated solution to the war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
About 200 peacekeepers are thought to be still surrounded by
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in the east.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah said earlier that the peacekeepers, including a senior
British military observer, should all be released by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Liberian president had recently received
envoys from the United Nations and India, who asked him to solve
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the imminent release of the remaining peacekeepers was
part of a deal under which the Sierra Leone rebels have been
promised a ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels originally took hostage about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers in May.

<HEADLINE> Argentines To Sue U.K. for Malvinas War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The relatives of Argentine
sailors who died in the sinking of the General Belgrano cruiser by
a British submarine during the 1982 Malvinas War will sue the
United Kingdom for damages.
</P>
<P>
One of the lawyers said Thursday that the relatives of two of
the 323 sailors killed in the sinking will present Tuesday the
case before the Strasbourg, France, Human Rights International
Court.
</P>
<P>
The denunciation will be directed to the British government, in
the person of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her war
cabinet, for the violation of the right to life.
</P>
<P>
The accusation says that according to the law applied in armed
conflicts, the goal of the belligerents is to put the enemy out of
combat, but it must not constitute any danger for the belligerent.
</P>
<P>
It says that the sinking was out of the theater of war
operations and of the zone of exclusion established by the United
Kingdom, violating the conventions established for wartime in The
Hague in 1907.
</P>
<P>
The denunciation says that at no moment the Argentine cruiser
entered the zone of exclusion, but that on the contrary, in the
early hours of that day it moved in the direction of the Isla de
los Estados, completely opposed to the war operations scenario.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk on May 2, 1982,
with 1,093 men aboard, by torpedoes launched by the British
submarine Conqueror, 36 nautical miles out of the exclusion zone
of 200 miles established by Britain around the Malvina Islands.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser that was sunk was at the moment of the attack at
some south latitude of 55 degrees 24 minutes and west longitude of
61 degrees 32 minutes, meaning 91 miles from the Argentine coasts
of the Isla de los Estados, and out of the 200 mile zone around
the Malvinas Islands Georgia del Sur and Sandwich del Sur.

<HEADLINE> Russian Police Detain 75 New Fascists in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian police arrested 75 new
fascists making trouble at the Savyolovsky Park in central Moscow
Wednesday evening, reported Russian news agencies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at around 21:20 Moscow time (1820 GMT)
Wednesday when a group of about 100 young skinheads giving Nazi-
style salutes gathered near a disco bar in the downtown park after
a rock concert and got into affray and fights, the Moscow Main
Internal Affairs Department told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The patrol police of the district, who arrived at the scene at
alarm, became the targets of hurled stones and bottles. One
policeman was injured during the clashes, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said at least four cars were badly damaged, one with
blood spattered on the bonnet.
</P>
<P>
The police had to draw their weapons and fire several warning
fires into the air but failed to stop them. The group then surged
into adjoining areas where they were confronted by riot police
reinforcements dispatched to the scene. The crowd was frightened
and tried to flee, but 75 of them were seized.
</P>
<P>
Extreme right-wing groups have a measure of influence among
some groups of disaffected young people in turbulent post-Soviet
Russia. Interest in many groups focuses on cult rock groups, some
performing in Nazi regalia.

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Get More Oil Income This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- High oil prices could give
Mexico additional income close to three billion U.S. dollars this
year, said Jose Antonio Rojas Nieto, a professor at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that if the volume of exports and a quotation of
around 22 dollars per barrel are maintained, the Mexican
authorities will obtain big profits with their crude exports, the
El Financiero newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This can be attributed to the fact that the income from exports
could surpass that of 1999 when 8.859 billion dollars were
received as the result of a daily average sale of crude abroad of
1.553 million barrels a day (bpd), said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
The analyst said that by the end of this year, if an average of
exports similar to last year's is maintained, with a price of 22
dollars per barrel, income for 13 billion dollars, could be
obtained, meaning 1.117 billion dollars more than the programmed.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is not member of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), but one of the main producers and
exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mexico produced three million barrels of oil a day during the
first five months of 2000, according to a Petroleos Mexicanos (
Pemex) bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Pemex, the state-owned oil company, earned 5.786 billion
dollars from crude exports in the first five months of this year.
