 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Fourteen months ago, Virginia Tech lost to Temple at home in what
the Hokies now call ``Black Saturday.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that loss was an aberration. Virginia Tech football is among
the top programs in the nation, thanks in part to defensive end
Corey Moore, freshman quarterback Michael Vick and coach Frank
Beamer. All contributed heavily to the Hokies' 11-0 1999 regular
season with Moore earning the Lombardi Award and Vick being the
youngest-ever Heisman Trophy finalist.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason honors kept rolling in for Virginia Tech on
Thursday night at the Westin Galleria Hotel as Beamer won the Bear
Bryant Award, which goes to the nation's top college football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can win an honor in his name, with his name on it,
that's special,'' said Beamer, 53, who guided the Hokies to their
best season. ``Growing up, coach Bryant was the guy. If you said
`college football coach,' Bear Bryant would be the guy you said.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more seasons like 1999, and someone might one day have an
award bearing Beamer's name.
</P>
<P>
   A Nokia Sugar Bowl loss in the national championship game
Tuesday night aside, the Hokies probably were college football's
biggest story this season.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech finished the season ranked No. 2, which set up
Tuesday's showdown with Florida State in New Orleans in which the
Seminoles erased a 29-28 third-quarter deficit to win 46-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great year, and you can't let the fact you had a
disappointing finish erase all the great moments and great wins
that we had throughout the year,'' said Beamer, who last month was
named the Walter Camp Coach of the Year, the Associated Press Coach
of the Year and the Big East Coach of the Year. ``We played hard in
the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just that Florida State made more big plays than we did
and they did the things to win a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer was all smiles Thursday. As one of seven finalists, he
beat out a quality field of coaches honoring the late Paul ``Bear''
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like the less I coach, the more awards we win,'' said
Beamer. ``I'm so thankful. It says something. It says we have a
great staff and great players. You don't see too many people
nominated for Coach of the Year honors that don't have great
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, there's a thin line between being OK and not
being OK. Tonight I feel like we're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists were Bobby Bowden, Florida State; Bob
Pruett, Marshall; Glen Mason, Minnesota; June Jones, Hawaii; Mike
DuBose, Alabama; and Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   All were in attendance except Bowden and Alvarez. Bowden's wife
fell and fractured her arm Wednesday at an airport and is in a New
Orleans hospital. Alvarez has had surgery on his knee twice this
season and aggravated the joint while walking the sidelines with
the aid of a cane in Saturday's Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer wasn't the only one honored Thursday. Former University
of Texas football coach Darrell K Royal was presented the lifetime
achievement award. Former President George Bush was the keynote
speaker at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer said he was proud that Virginia Tech is one of only eight
teams in the nation to have gone to a bowl the last seven years and
wants to keep the program at the top level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a consistent program,'' Beamer said. ``We feel
real fortunate that we've gone to seven straight bowl games, and
hopefully we can go to seven straight in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``And get to the point when you ask anyone in any part of the
country, `Name the top 10 programs in the country,' maybe Virginia
Tech will be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over at Virginia Tech in January 1987 from Bill
Dooley, Beamer has compiled an 88-59-2 record after inheriting NCAA
sanctions with reduced scholarship numbers. The Hokies have
averaged nine wins per year since '93.
</P>
<P>
   The Bryant Award and dinner benefits the American Heart
Association, the nation's largest voluntary health organization
dedicated to the reduction of disability and death from
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is a great time for old friends to get together and
support a worthy cause,'' Beamer said.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When the Buffalo Bills found out this week they
would play the Tennessee Titans in the first round of the playoffs,
the wild-card game rekindled memories of the greatest game in
franchise history, a game forever etched in the psyche of sports
fans in Western New York.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bills' 41-38 overtime victory over the Houston Oilers is
famous in New York and infamous in Texas. Buffalo made the biggest
comeback in NFL history, overcoming a 35-3 third-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the NFL announced that game had been voted the
fifth-most memorable in league history.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are playing at Adelphia Coliseum on Saturday morning
in the first game of the weekend. Although the Oilers moved to
Nashville and became the Titans, the first playoff game between
these teams since Jan. 3, 1993, has caused local and national media
to focus on that last playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a fan of the Oilers, you will never forget the game
that became known as ``The Choke.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of the Bills, you will never forget the game
that became known as ``The Comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was a defining moment in the Buffalo Bills'
history,'' Buffalo receiver Andre Reed said this week. ``It was
such a special game for everyone who played and everyone who
watched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who became the second-leading receiver in NFL history in
the last game of the regular season, caught three touchdown passes
to ignite the comeback, which was not televised in Buffalo because
the game didn't meet the NFL blackout deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Actual attendance was 75,141, about 4,000 shy of capacity at
what was then Rich Stadium but has been renamed Ralph Wilson
Stadium after the team's owner. At halftime, fans headed for the
exits. In the third quarter, the stadium was only half full.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, every seat was taken and the parking lot
was overflowing with fans who wanted to be part of a history-making
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills had lost the last game of the regular season to the
Oilers in the Astrodome. Quarterback Jim Kelly and outside
linebacker Cornelius Bennett didn't play because of injuries. Coach
Marv Levy was replacing Kelly with Frank Reich.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers, coached by Jack Pardee, led 28-3 at halftime.
Quarterback Warren Moon threw four touchdown passes, two to Haywood
Jeffires and one each to Webster Slaughter and Curtis Duncan.
Buffalo's only score came on Steve Christie's 36-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bills' first series of the third quarter, safety Bubba
McDowell intercepted Reich and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown
to make it 35-3. At that point, the Bills' comeback began. And it
began innocently enough with a one-yard run by Kenneth Davis.
</P>
<P>
   When Buffalo recovered an onside kick the Oilers weren't
prepared for, the Bills became excited. After Reich threw a 38-yard
touchdown pass to Don Beebe, the Bills trailed 35-17. The touchdown
shouldn't have counted, because Beebe ran out of bounds and came
back in, which should have made him an ineligible receiver, but the
infraction went uncalled.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Murphy's Law took over for the Oilers. They did
nothing right. Reich threw three touchdown passes to Reed to give
Buffalo a 38-35 lead late in the game. The Oilers had to drive to
the Bills' 12 for a chance to win. Moon's passes into the end zone
were incomplete, and Al Del Greco's 26-yard field goal with 12
seconds remaining tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, cornerback Nate Odomes intercepted Moon, and
Christie won the game with a 32-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! Are all playoff games like this?'' Christie said in the
dressing room after participating in the first playoff game of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you reside, whether in the Buffalo or Houston
area, you probably have a story about that incredible afternoon
that, in Bills lore, was ``Un-Bill-ievable'' as the headline in the
Buffalo News blared the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, you've probably heard a thousand
stories from Oilers fans. Now, here are some stories told from the
other side _ from members of the Bills organization and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tasker, former Bills receiver and special-teams star,
played in the game. He is now an NFL analyst for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our part of the country,'' Tasker notes, ``that game is
like, `Where were you when JFK was shot?' But it's, `Where were you
when the Bills came back to beat the Oilers?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When they had us down 35-3, we thought it was over. We were
coming off two Super Bowls in a row, and we had a lot of pride, and
even though the game was over, we wanted to leave with some dignity
if we could.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made it 35-17, I thought, `Well, at least we won't get
blown out now and look like total idiots.' Then we scored again.
And again. We went from trying to preserve our dignity to trying to
be respectful to trying to win. It seemed like one supernatural
thing after another kept happening. The Oilers had turned off the
afterburners, and they couldn't turn them back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking into the stands in the third quarter and
seeing so many empty seats. But when we made the comeback, people
were climbing the fence trying to bust back into the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that was so special about that game _ about our
team, really _ is that after games, the whole team would go to Jim
Kelly's house. Jim has a great house. His basement is like a huge
bar with pool tables and big-screen TVs. We got to Jim's house and
watched the game, and what a feeling of euphoria that was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that game was so big in Western New York that it
became ingrained in the consciousness of everyone. It became
legendary, woven in the fabric of the Buffalo Bills. It became
bigger than the Ice Bowl and the Immaculate Reception in our part
of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   John Butler is the Bills' general manager. He was the personnel
director in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it,'' Butler says, ``but I remember thinking,
`It's been a great year, and they just got us today.' When they
made it 35-3, I got an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach. I
started thinking about bringing in some players in the offseason
and what we were going to do with the roster, things you always
think about at that time of season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a game of emotion like I've never
experienced. When we scored a couple of touchdowns, I thought how
proud I was that the guys had the heart to go down fighting. Then,
when we went ahead, and they were on their last drive with a chance
to win, I said to myself, `Oh, God. To come this far and not win
would be so bitter. It'd be too tough to take.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, it was phenomenal. People were singing in the
dressing room and celebrating like I'd never seen. I couldn't sleep
that night. I had no strength left because I was emotionally
drained. The game was just a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning, I had to get on a plane and go to the
East-West Shrine Game in Palo Alto (Calif.). When I got out there,
everyone wanted to talk about the game. I tried hard to be
humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman Thomas plays running back for the Bills. The Houston
native started the playoff game but was injured in the first half
and watched the rest of the game on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family back in Houston was watching the game on
television,'' Thomas remembers. ``When we got so far behind, my
mother left and went to the store. She was gone and didn't know we
had come back. When she came home, she asked my dad what the final
score was, how bad the Oilers had beaten us, and when he told her
what had happened, she didn't believe it at first. When they
convinced her it was true, she started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called home that night, she said, `Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I left.' I told her it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't think there was any way we
could come back and win. I was on the bench thinking about when I'd
be leaving Buffalo and coming home to Houston and how much grief
I'd have to take from my family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe we actually won. Sometimes it just
doesn't seem real. People seem to forget that we had to win at
Pittsburgh and Miami to go to our third straight Super Bowl. After
we lost the Super Bowl (52-17 to Dallas), I went home to Houston a
couple of days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared for everyone to give me a hard time about us
losing another Super Bowl, but the subject hardly came up. All they
wanted to talk about was the Oilers game. That was fine with me. I
preferred to talk about that game instead of the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Berchtold is the Bills' vice president of communications.
He was the director of media relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard so many stories over the years,'' Berchtold says.
``I think 250,000 people will swear they were at that game. I've
heard so many stories from people who left. One guy even said he
left in the second quarter and drove 90 miles home, then turned
around and sped back in time for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that really stands out for me is that at halftime
all the Houston writers were getting on the telephone and making
reservations for the next game in Pittsburgh. But I remember
thinking that we still had a chance. I even told one guy that, and
he looked at me like I was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 28-3 at halftime. I asked one of my interns to look up
the biggest comeback in playoff history. When they scored to make
it 35-3, I started thinking about things like the end-of-season
interviews the next day. When we scored and got the onside kick and
scored again, the intern told me that if we won, it would be the
biggest comeback in NFL history, not just NFL playoff history. I
didn't tell anyone for a while. I didn't want to jinx us.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think back, I can still see everything going on in the
press box. When we'd score, there'd be a collective roar from the
media on the Buffalo side of the press box. It wasn't a cheer, just
something like a disbelieving roar. At the same time, there'd be a
collective groan on the Houston side. We had to announce three
times the NFL rule that there was no cheering in the press box.
After a while, we just gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``During practice last week, the televisions in the dressing
room were showing parts of the comeback, because it had been voted
the fifth-most memorable game in NFL history. The players just
stopped and watched it. The young guys all knew that game. They
started talking with (defensive end) Bruce (Smith) and Thurman and
Andre about it. Rather than their teammates, the young guys were
looking at them as heroes again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I remember is that at halftime, our backup
quarterback, Gale Gilbert, reminded Frank Reich that he had
engineered the biggest comeback in college history (for Maryland
vs. Miami in 1984). Frank kind of nodded, like, `Yeah, right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``During the comeback, we had a fourth-down play. Marv had
wanted to kick the field goal, but Frank talked him out of it on
the sideline. Frank convinced Marv that he had a play that would
work. It was a pass to Andre down the middle. Marv changed his
mind. And it did work. Not only did we get a first down, but Andre
caught the pass down the middle for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, Frank was at his locker room doing more
interviews. I remember him telling the media that, other than
getting married and having his children, it was the greatest day in
his life. And I remember Kelly standing behind the camera trying to
break him up by putting his finger down his throat as if Frank was
making Jim gag with those kinds of remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, Charles Osgood wrote a poem about the comeback
and read it on CBS Radio. I still have a tape of it. It was about
never giving up in life. It was almost like a Casey at the Bat for
football. He used the Buffalo Bills as an example of guys that
refused to give up against tremendous odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Carucci is a writer for NFL Insider. He was the Bills beat
man for the Buffalo News in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Oilers led 35-3, I was talking to my editor about
plans for Marv's postseason press conference the next day,''
Carucci says. ``We had to worry about the game, plus our
end-of-the-season wrapup. When you're covering a blowout, you don't
tend to take notes as thoroughly as usual, and when the Bills
started scoring, I really had to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Bills started coming back, I was awestruck. When they
looked like they might actually have a chance to win, we had to
scramble. We had to change our coverage. Every time the Bills did
something right and the Oilers did something wrong, I had to blink
my eyes to make sure it was really happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really get ourselves together until after we came
back upstairs and had a meeting to see what we had and how we were
going to use it. People remember our headline _ `Un-Bill-ievable.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard so many interesting stories. One friend left, and
when he got to his subdivision, he saw cars turning around. He
thought there was a wreck. He was so mad at the Bills, he didn't
have the radio on. He turned it on to try to find out about the
accident, and every station was talking about the comeback. He said
he turned around immediately and came right back. I know a lot of
people who did the same thing but just won't admit it.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros are moving to what figures to be a hitter-friendly
ballpark, they traded their best pitcher from a year ago, and their
most promising young starter is rehabilitating from surgery and has
yet to begin throwing with spring training less than six weeks
away.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who are betting against the Astros' four-peating as
champions of the National League Central understandably believe
pitching will be what ails them.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a doctor in the house? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros signed veteran righthander Dwight ``Doc'' Gooden to a
minor-league contract Thursday and invited him to spring training
as a non-roster player. For all intents and purposes, Gooden
represents an insurance policy in the event Scott Elarton is unable
to start the season on time, not to mention potential depth in an
unsettled starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, if Gooden proves during spring training that
there still is some magic left in his once-golden right arm, the
Astros will find a place for him on their pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold any illusions of grandeur that at 35 years old we
are going to see the Doc Gooden of 27 or 28 years old. But knowing
Doc, I'll take my chances when he's on the mound,'' said Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker, who was in the Mets organization
during Gooden's heyday in New York. ``He still has that competitive
fire, and you know you're going to get an honest effort from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps himself in incredible physical condition. The arm
strength is still there, and he still has good breaking stuff. He
has a lot of confidence in his ability, and that all adds up to a
pitcher who I believe can come into camp and really make a
significant contribution to our ballclub this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros aren't so sure with regard to Elarton, who pitched
through pain throughout the second half of the 1999 season and
required rotator-cuff surgery this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elarton has not picked up a ball yet,'' Hunsicker said. ``He's
coming back to see our doctors here in Houston next week, and at
that point he'll hopefully get the go-ahead to start playing catch.
This is going to be a situation very similar to Chris Holt of two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not going to know what we have until halfway
through spring training _ until he gets on the mound, starts
throwing and starts putting his arm through the rigors of pitching
day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the main reason Hunsicker has been searching for an
experienced starter, but in Gooden he signed a pitcher capable of
making the team on his own merit and not just as the beneficiary of
an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc Gooden is going to get every opportunity to make this
ballclub, first and foremost as a starter because that is where he
is most effective,'' Hunsicker said. ``As far as I'm concerned,
(Shane) Reynolds and (Jose) Lima are the only two names that I'm
willing to pencil in that rotation right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Elarton is healthy, that means we've got four guys for
three spots. The odd man out probably will go to the bullpen, but
we haven't talked much about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Elarton is healthy, the four pitchers competing for the
final three spots in the rotation are Elarton, Gooden, Holt and
Octavio Dotel _ one of the players the Astros acquired in the trade
that sent 22-game winner Mike Hampton to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden made a name for himself with the Mets, compiling a .649
winning percentage in 11 seasons with them. He also appeared in
four All-Star Games, was named NL Rookie of the Year in 1984 and
won the NL Cy Young Award in 1985 when he was 24-4 with a 1.53
earned run average. At 20 years old, he became the youngest pitcher
to win the coveted award for pitching excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden missed the 1995 season while serving a drug suspension
and resurfaced with the Yankees, pitching two seasons in the Bronx
and throwing the only no-hitter of his career in 1996. He spent the
past two seasons in Cleveland, where he pitched respectably despite
injuries _ most notably a shoulder strain that limited him to 22
starts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy, and I'm looking forward to trying to win a spot
in the rotation and help this team get to the next level,'' said
Gooden, whose 188 career victories rank fourth among active
pitchers behind Roger Clemens (247), Greg Maddux (221) and Orel
Hershiser (203). ``There's no doubt in my mind that I can do that.
I'm looking forward to coming back to the National League and
joining a team that already is put together well. Hopefully, I can
be the missing piece to the puzzle. When my agent told me the
Astros were interested, right away my mind was set. This situation
fits me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between now and my early days when I had
an overpowering fastball is that when I got behind in the count,
everyone knew what was coming. Now, I'm more of a complete pitcher,
a smarter pitcher. I just don't have the velocity I had at one
time. I rely more on setting hitters up, moving the ball around and
maybe throwing a breaking ball every now and then when I'm behind
in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Gooden's first career start was at the Astrodome
in 1984. He recalled being so nervous that he walked about four
miles from the team's hotel headquarters to the ballpark and jumped
the fence to get onto the grounds. He got the third degree from a
security guard who had no idea who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, his name is among the most recognizable in
the game. Whether Gooden can approach his success of the 1980s
remains to be seen, but the Astros believe he is worth the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited about this,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
``Obviously, when we lost Mike Hampton, it created a void in our
rotation, and to be able to fill that void with a pitcher of this
caliber is a very good opportunity for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had pretty good success with our pitchers over the last
few years, and I think we have a pretty good program for them. I
have no reason to think that he can't fit right into that program
and be a productive pitcher for us.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THERE is always something poignant, a little sad, a little hopeful,
about a once-great pitcher trying to recapture the flame of his
youth. The Astros hope Doc Gooden can do it, for at least one year,
which is why they signed him Thursday to a minor-league contract.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't really old at 35, but he has 15 seasons behind him. He
needs 12 wins to reach 200 for his career. It is the stuff of
summer wishes, winter dreams. At a social gathering in Houston, a
night or two before the New York Mets opened the 1984 season, a
writer mentioned to Davey Johnson that he had covered Nolan Ryan's
first big-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had played college ball at Texas A&AMP;M and feels at
home among Texans, became animated. ``Are you working Saturday
night?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scribe said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you ought to come out to the stadium anyway,'' urged
Davey. ``We're starting a kid named Dwight Gooden. Someday you may
want to be able to tell your grandkids that you saw both Nolan Ryan
and Dwight Gooden in their major-league debuts.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of advice reporters normally get from
managers or coaches, and the friendly tip was appreciated. Gooden,
in five innings of work, beat the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The season turned out to be a spectacular one for the teen-ager
from Tampa. He won 17 games and finished with 276 strikeouts and an
earned run average of 2.60. At 19, he was the National League
Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the media and fans quickly anointed him ``Dr. K,''
a partial tribute to Julius Erving (``Dr. J'') and a play on the
symbol for a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be no limit to what Gooden would accomplish.
In 1985, he posted a 24-4 record, 268 strikeouts and a 1.53 ERA. At
20, he won the Cy Young Award. He was a specimen not exactly common
among pitchers, a splendid athlete, quick with his glove and his
bat.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the 1986 season, he had beaten the Astros on two
hits for his 13th career shutout, driving in two runs with a
triple. He was not yet 22.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was what baseball always promises but seldom delivers:
baby love. It wasn't simply the way he overpowered the league. Tom
Seaver, Vida Blue, Fernando Valenzuela and others captured the fans
in their impressive freshman seasons. What made you marvel at
Gooden was the fact he made the jump virtually out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Shea Stadium fans began bringing placards with the letter K
imprinted on them to tabulate his strikeouts. A section of the
bleachers began to be identified as the ``K Korner.''
</P>
<P>
   When a creature of this caliber arrives, you check for possible
weak spots. Gooden was 6-3, 198 pounds and still growing. If you
questioned anything, it was whether he could maintain the pace,
especially in New York, where the fans are often so eager to devour
their young. Would he fall victim to the too-much-too-soon
syndrome? Would the big city, bright lights snare him?
</P>
<P>
   He was in awe of nothing. He had been around major-leaguers all
his life, going to spring-training games in Tampa with his father.
He was quiet and modest, with a solid family base.
</P>
<P>
   Wise observers held their breath. ``We don't have pitching stars
anymore,'' said Frank Cashen, the Mets' general manager. ``They're
more like meteors.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he was not immune to the kind of cosmic explosion that too
often awaited the golden children. The signs began to creep in. He
began to show up late for appointments or miss them altogether. He
missed the Man of the Year banquet in his honor in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Now his whole private life was front-page news. There was a
nasty scrape with the police in his hometown. The police report
said they spotted a new Mercedes weaving through traffic. Gooden,
the driver, and a friend were described as ``combative.'' Witnesses
said they saw the officers beating two men on the ground without
resistance. Rumors began to float. But his teammates were shocked,
even those with drug problems of their own, when Doc Gooden checked
himself into a clinic in New York for treatment of cocaine abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The fans felt betrayed. The famed Stage Delicatessen scratched
the young pitcher's pocket sandwich from its menu. As one social
critic noted, it was just another town without pita.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gooden's first start after finishing his rehab, the crowd
gave him a standing ovation. He struggled with drugs, missed the
1995 season, pitched his first no-hitter in 1996 for the Yankees,
and was lightly used the past two seasons in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Now Doc is reaching for one more chance, perhaps a last chance.
Having lost Mike Hampton, the Astros are in a position to give him
one. May he make the most of it.

WITH CLINTON PRESENT, PACE OF ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS IS SAID TO PICK
UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 1st and 4th grafs for updating) 
(bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton on Thursday spent a
third day coaxing Israel and Syria toward the framework of a peace
accord. U.S. officials reported Thursday evening that the pace of
talks had begun to pick up, with Clinton promising to cancel
commitments in Washington and return early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving here late Thursday afternoon, Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and, in a separate meeting Thursday evening,
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. Under the terms of a
news blackout surrounding the talks, administration officials
declined to discuss the specific state of talks over the return of
the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the Arab-Israeli war in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   But James Rubin, the State Department spokesman who had
complained Wednesday of the dead-slow pace of the talks, said
Thursday night, ``Maybe we've moved from chugging to trotting.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was unclear what, if anything, Clinton accomplished in
his six-hour visit here on Thursday, which ended at 10 p.m., it
seemed likely that he cut through procedural disputes over how the
talks would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides have been portrayed by the U.S. mediators
as moving at a glacial pace, that may partly be posturing for their
domestic constituencies. The rough outline of a deal for the return
of the Golan Heights, the buffer zone that Israelis have long
contended is vital for their security, has been fairly well
understood since talks between Israel and Syria that date from the
summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The big questions have centered on where exactly the new borders
would be drawn, how Syria and Israel would share access to water
and what other security measures _ from early-warning stations to a
reduction of military forces on both sides of the border _ would
complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks sputtered on and off and were suspended in 1996.
This week has marked the first substantive discussions in nearly
four years, with Israel, Syria and the United States agreeing here
to set up four committees to negotiate the most contentious issues.
The two committees dealing with the most sensitive issues, borders
and access to water, have yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said Thursday that those meetings were superseded by
the sessions the president was holding, ``where many of the same
substantive issues are being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's clear hope is to emerge from this set of talks with
what the State Department is calling a ``framework agreement'' _
something more concrete than a set of objectives but far less
complete than a treaty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rubin said that document, already being drafted, is partly based
on the 1995 and 1996 discussions of Israelis and Syrians in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the working document will be published at
the end of this round of talks, which could easily extend into the
weekend and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The slowness of both sides to engage on the hardest issues
suggests that the negotiations may take far longer than Clinton and
Albright hoped. Israel may be carefully gauging the chances that
any final deal would win approval in a national referendum, in
which the conservative opposition is bound to fight any effort to
return the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Americans, it is standard operating procedure to
underplay the prospects of success, in an effort to portray any
agreement, no matter how vague, as a momentum-building step toward
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in several years, the parties _ Israel,
Syria and the Palestinians _ have a common goal in sight, and the
common sense to see that they have a historic opportunity to
achieve it now,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger in a
speech Thursday to the National Press Club.

HUNDREDS IN MIAMI PROTEST INS DECISION TO RETURN BOY TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 2nd graf to correct number of protesters arrested) 
 (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hundreds of Cuban-Americans, energized by a new cause,
shut down much of Miami on Thursday with waves of civil
disobedience, blocking access to the Port of Miami and choking
traffic on dozens of busy streets, to protest the Clinton
administration's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 protesters were arrested by riot police officers, who
led them away peacefully in plastic handcuffs as the crowd chanted,
``Libertad Elian, libertad Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking for is that this boy have his day in court,
and that the boy's father come here to ask for his son without
pressure from the Cuban government,'' said Jose Basulto, the
founder of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, before
being taken into a police van.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, the mayhem spread from downtown Miami to other
pockets, bringing many cars to a standstill at rush hour and
leading Gov. Jeb Bush to suspend tolls on several major highways,
something that is usually done only when hurricanes are
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, a commuter rammed a car through lines of
demonstrators who were linking arms to block an intersection,
knocking down two protesters. They were taken to a hospital. In
another incident, a police officer who was hit by another motorist
suffered broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14.
The decision came more than a month after the unseaworthy boat
Elian, his mother, his stepfather and 11 other people took capsized
en route to Miami. Eleven of them died, including his mother and
stepfather. Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez, said he did not know the
boy was leaving the country and wants the boy sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Elian soon found himself in the middle of a sensitive diplomatic
tug-of-war between Cuba and Miami, between his father on the island
and his relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign that the boy's return to Cuba by Jan. 14 may not
proceed as smoothly as the administration would like, lawyers for
the boy said that immigration officials had not asked his Miami
relatives to turn Elian over and that the relatives may not do so
without a deportation order from the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS doesn't want to do the dirty work of deporting the
boy, and after not even being heard, we may not be inclined to help
them,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, one of a phalanx of lawyers
representing the family. ``There is no order to turn the boy over.
We think they have to initiate deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said the agency would not
forcibly remove the boy, and added: ``This is not a deportation.
This is an attempt to honor the wishes of the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Along block after block, in cafeterias and storefronts, Elian's
case has served as a clarion call for Cuban exiles here, a group
that over the last decade has grown considerably older, wearier and
more fractured since the death two years ago of one of its most
vocal leaders, Jorge Mas Canosa.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing unites Cuban-Americans like a good brawl with Fidel
Castro, and this one _ the story of a boy who watched his mother
die at sea as they fled Cuba by boat _ carries just the right mix
of politics and drama to embolden the community.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in Cuba, where Castro has used the case as a
patriotic rallying cry to re-energize the Cuban people against
Americans who have ``kidnapped'' the boy. The father said he did
not know his former wife and his son were leaving the country for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Garcia, security director for Alpha 66, a paramilitary
group that has sought for decades to overthrow Castro, said: ``This
has unified the community in the last few days. It has unified the
community in Miami in an incredible way. People had grown distant
from the cause. Time has passed. People had lost their will, their
enthusiasm. Now people are fighting shoulder to shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that
she saw no basis for reversing the decision by the immigration
service to return the boy to his father in Cuba. But Reno said she
could not absolutely rule out a change of mind ``if any information
we are not privy to'' comes to light.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials interviewed Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, on two separate occasions, the first to listen to his
plea that his son be returned, and the second to ensure that he
truly wanted his son back in Cuba without pressure from Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied he is speaking for himself,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has declined a American offer to let him pick up his
son in Florida and has asked the INS to have the National Council
of Churches, a group that met with Gonzalez in Cuba, act as
intermediary in the boy's return, Bergeron said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Immigration experts and INS officials maintain that Elian's
Miami relatives have no legal standing to overturn the decision
since Elian's father is the one who speaks for him.
</P>
<P>
   But many Miami exiles disagree. They point to the fact that the
immigration service initially agreed that the case should be
handled as a custody matter by state courts. And they point an
accusing finger at President Clinton, saying he caved into
political pressure from Castro, who threatened to turn the incident
into a migraine headache for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton said politics did not enter into the
administration's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Clinton doesn't mind breaking the law, but there
are laws in this country,'' said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a
Republican who represents Miami in Congress. ``This is illegal.
Only a court of law can decide this.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who has been living with his paternal great-aunt and
great-uncle, was sheltered for the most part from the commotion.
When he returned home from school, which he began attending this
week, he flashed a smile and waved to cheering fans from atop his
great uncle's shoulders. Relatives said they were heartbroken about
having to tell him of the INS decision. They said they would try to
broach the subject on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he doesn't want to go,'' said Alfredo Martell, one of
Elian's many cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family said on Thursday they want immigration
officials to issue a deportation order for Elian in the hopes that
the case would then go before an immigration judge. ``We would be
perfectly willing to go along with that,'' said Spencer Eig,
another lawyer for the family.

 TEXAS DEFENSE PUTS CLAMPS ON BAYLOR (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By MIKE JONES c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The question was whether] Baylor was trying to shorten
the game, or was Texas' defense just too tall?
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in trying to push the ball and get the quickest shot
we could,'' said Bears guard Tevis Stukes, who frequently was
looking for an open man with 10 seconds left on the shot clock.
``But they kept moving our offense out to the half-court line. And
that gave us problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Big time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-ranked Longhorns (9-3) dominated Baylor defensively on
the way to a convincing 71-43 victory last night before an
announced Erwin Center crowd of 10,495.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it better when we were playing against cheerleaders,''
Baylor coach Dave Bliss joked, referring to a games he coached in
the Southwest Conference at SMU when former Texas coach Bob
Weltlich recruited a cheerleader when players were bailing out of
his program in his first season (1982-83).
</P>
<P>
   Texas held Baylor to a 34.9 shooting percentage last night in
handing the Bears (9-3) their 19th consecutive Big 12 loss. The
Longhorns forced 23 turnovers while holding the Bears to 22
rebounds and limited the visitors to four points in the last 13
minutes of the first half. Baylor twice was whistled for 35-second
violations and once could not get the ball over half-court in the
required 10. And Texas held Baylor's top two scorers _ Stukes and
Terry Black _ to a combined 27 points, nine below their combined
averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Barnes has been talking to us about what is going to be
our identity,'' Texas point guard Ivan Wagner said. ``We've decided
to make defense our identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Longhorns perhaps were trying to make a statement
to No. 2 Connecticut, where Texas plays on Monday, Wagner said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was out to make a statement to UConn,'' he said.
``Maybe to the rest of the Big 12 as to what they can expect night
in and out. Hopefully, we got our point across.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas held an opponent to less than 40 percent shooting for the
sixth time this season and the 20th time in 44 games under Rick
Barnes. Texas is 15-5 in those games, 6-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm not a good offensive coach,'' Barnes said. ``But I
believe in defense. I believe you can create offense with defense.
Defense can be there every night and, if it is, you've got a
chance. Defense can overcome turnovers, poor free throw shooting _
a multitude of sins.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas broke from a 13-all tie to outscore the Bears 17-4 and
take a 30-17 halftime lead, the lowest point total in a half for an
opponent this season.
</P>
<P>
   Center Chris Mihm led a balanced attack with 15 points and eight
rebounds in 27 minutes. Nine Longhorns played at least 12 minutes
and no one played more than Wagner's 28. That is in stark contrast
to last season, when four members of the eight-player rotation on
the Big 12 regular-season champions averaged more than 31 minutes
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bench was the difference in this game,'' Barnes said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KAPALUA, Hawaii _ A year ago, David Duval blew through a
defenseless Plantation Course at Kapalua for a nine-stroke victory,
finishing with a remarkable 26-under-par total at the Mercedes
Championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday, Kapalua blew back.
</P>
<P>
   In '99, the trademark trade winds were absent and the palm trees
were barely ruffled. But in the first round of the 2000 PGA Tour
season, gusts over 30 mph ensured nobody would embarrass this long,
hilly, lush resort.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik tried. He was 6 under par after 11 holes. But
the course got even soon enough, extracting a couple of double
bogeys before Parnevik steadied himself for a 4-under-par 69 that
left him one stroke ahead in the PGA Tour's season-opening event
for 1999's winners. Duffy Waldorf was a stroke behind at 70, but
guess who was breathing down their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's the same guy who won everything in sight in the second
half of '99. Tiger Woods, who is shooting for a fifth consecutive
PGA Tour win, shot 2-under on the back nine and was tied with Ernie
Els for third at 2-under 71.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the torrid pace set in '99. But considering
the windblown conditions, the scores Thursday were impressive in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps telling me that this is normal,'' said Hal
Sutton, who struggled to a 4-over 77. ``But if this is normal and I
had to play in this every day, I'd quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blowing me all over the place. And I don't know what
all the skinny people were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter whether you were tall or short, porky or trim.
Everybody had to battle the breeze. Only eight players broke
par-73. Parnevik was alone in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew a little,'' understated Woods. ``For example, on the
first hole, I had 242 yards and hit a soft 7-iron. Then on the 10th
hole, I had 136 yards and hit a soft 7-iron. Over 100 yards'
discrepancy in those holes, but I hit the same club (on his second
shots).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way this course is supposed to play. Under these
conditions, you've just got to keep plugging along. Six under par
obviously is wonderful playing. But you just have to remember that
there's so many holes left to be played. When it's blowing that
hard, marginal shots won't get it done. You just need to keep
making pars and plodding along, make a few birdies, and you'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Woods isn't panicking in the face of a two-shot
deficit after only one round.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parnevik ruled the day with his shotmaking _ which was
mostly good, but some weren't so good.
</P>
<P>
   He was a master on the grainy, sloping Kapalua greens, making
four birdie putts of 15 feet or longer. His 25-footer at the par-3
11th got him to 6 under par. At that point, he was six strokes
ahead of Woods and four ahead of his closest pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the fun started,'' Parnevik said.
</P>
<P>
   The downwind 12th was his first problem. His wedge came up short
of the green, and then he three-putted after chipping up past the
hole. On the 13th, which was a head-butt into the wind, Parnevik
had 150 yards to the hole and ``absolutely killed a 3-iron that
came up 20 yards short of the green.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I got too cute with the chip shot and left it short in
the bunker, blasted out and two-putted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's recovery was just as spectacular as his collapse. He
birdied the 14th and 15th holes from short range and offset a bogey
at the 17th with a tap-in birdie at the 663-yard finishing par-5.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the wind and the elevation changes at Kapalua proved
troublesome for all the players.
</P>
<P>
   As Notah Begay III said: ``You've got all these variables to
factor in within 45 seconds. It's like being on a game show.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, somebody will win $522,000 at the end of this show.
But they will earn it, judging from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is the grain on the greens. It's so strong,
it will push balls uphill, particularly if the wind is blowing with
the grain, as it often is. All of which combine to make last year's
tournament record by Duval a distant memory that is undoubtedly out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's real safe,'' said Jim Furyk, who shot 1-under
72. ``And I've seen it blow worse than this here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least all the long holes are downwind, downhill and
down-grain. This is the way the course is supposed to play. But at
the top of the hill on the 16th and 17th greens, the ball didn't
want to stay stationary.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk and playing partner Brian Henninger had to get rulings on
the 17th green, which is near the highest point on the course, as
their balls began to roll after they had been respotted on the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon, one of the few under par at 1-under, said he hit a
9-iron 65 yards into the wind on the par-5 ninth. He later hit the
same 9-iron 190 yards downwind on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, Parnevik got it around the course better than
anybody else. He even managed to steal a little of the fans'
spotlight from Woods by wearing some fire-engine red slacks. As he
reached the 18th green, Parnevik knew he had made an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcer, he announces what clothes you're wearing,''
Parnevik said. ``He goes, `In the wild red pants from Sweden ' So
one guy in the crowd screams, `Hey, if you knock it in the hole, we
don't care what color pants you have.' It was a fun day,
interesting.''

DAVIS' NEW LIFE FAR FROM UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTCHESTER, Calif. _ Last year Baron Davis carried the UCLA
basketball team. This year he's lugging the Charlotte trainer's
black medical kit. The Bruins? They weren't heavy, they were his
brothers. But Terry Kofler's black bag is !ital!a load!off!.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was almost out the gym door after the Hornets' practice
Thursday at Loyola Marymount when Kofler corralled him. ``Hey,
Baron, you take this one,'' he said, pushing in Davis's path a bag
big and bulky enough to be holding a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Davis picked the bag up without complaint, the way it says to in
the unofficial NBA rookie handbook, and dragged it toward the bus.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a sight, Davis coolly trying to carry the bag and
carry on a conversation and keep his sweat pants _ the ones with
the dead elastic waistline _ from gathering in a pool around his
ankles while a few Hornets who weren't already on the bus tried
hard not to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what rookies are for, comic relief?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Los Angeles native has adapted better than many
people thought he would to the highs, lows and hazing of NBA life.
Davis, 20, is enjoying a hearty laugh at the expense of, as he put
it, ``a lot of doubters who thought I'd be a big disappointment in
the NBA because of my (surgically repaired left) knee and because
I'm so young.''
</P>
<P>
   He is averaging 20 minutes and 6.2 points off the bench for a
Hornets team that's flexing its muscle and arm-wrestling Indiana
for control of the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Davis knows his place among a veteran group that includes Eddie
Jones, Anthony Mason and Derrick Coleman, though he's not above
stealing the spotlight occasionally with one of his space jams.
Everyone from David Wesley to David Stern was agog last month when
the 6-foot-3 Davis dunked over 6-foot-11 Kevin Garnett during a win
at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the soundness of his left knee. It obviously had
recovered by then from a bone bruise Davis suffered in November.
</P>
<P>
   The dunk led the weekly NBA highlight reel and nearly a month
later, players continue to sidle up to Davis and say, ``Whassup
with that dunk on Kevin Garnett?''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins fans have seen it all before. Indeed, he often gave them
reason to feel like they had shown up for a personal screening of
Davis' highlight film and a game broke out. Davis played as if he
was updating his resume on every possession. He was in such a hurry
to get to the NBA, he cut short his collegiate career by two years.
</P>
<P>
   The restlessness he wore like baggy shorts at UCLA is gone,
Davis said, discarded along with that goofy white headband he
favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm very patient,'' he said and why not? ``I'm on a
good team and I'm around great guys who are teaching me the little
tricks of the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   People can criticize Davis for not staying at UCLA, but the way
he looks at it he never left school. He's simply accruing advanced
credits in his chosen career field _ basketball _ while serving one
heck of an internship.
</P>
<P>
   ``College was fun,'' Davis said, ``but as far as learning about
being a better basketball player the NBA is a great place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Hornets practice on this day, we could see what he
means. Davis was paired with Jones on a shooting drill and later
got a few technical tips from a braying Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Davis hasn't at times second-guessed himself.
Every now and then, he gets a pang in his side. It's a nostalgia
cramp and sometimes it takes a lot of deep breaths to make it go
away.
</P>
<P>
   Said Davis, ``There are days when I think, `Oh, man, I should
have come back, we would have had a great team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis averaged 30.7 minutes, 15.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and 5.1
assists as a sophomore. For better or worse, he was the Bruins'
go-to guy. Because he also played the point, there were people who
complained his presence was overpowering. They are the same people
who projected a better season this year for the Bruins without him.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely UCLA, which opened Pacific-10 play Thursday
at Washington, would have lost to Colorado State, been blown out by
Gonzaga and barely escaped from South Florida's clutches with Davis
in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to have been the Man for another year or
two. But Davis likes what he is in Charlotte just fine: the porter
in charge of delivering the future.

 Former physician asks to withdraw pleas in killing two of her
children  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claiming that her thinking was clouded by medication and mental
problems, former physician Debora Green asked Thursday to withdraw
pleas of no contest to killing two of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Green was sentenced in May 1996 to life in prison for setting a
fire that raced through her family's suburban Kansas City, Mo.,
home in Prairie Village, Kan., in 1995, trapping the children
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   She also was sentenced for the attempted murder of a third
child, who climbed out a window to escape, and for trying to kill
her then-husband by poisoning his food.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading no contest to the charges, she avoided a trial and
possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But in documents filed Thursday in Johnson County (Kan.)
District Court, Green said that she was ``unduly influenced'' by
the advice of her attorneys to take the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She now seeks that trial and a chance to post bond while the
case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita, Kan., attorney Kurt Kerns, who filed the action on
Green's behalf, did not respond to an interview request Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Morrison, who prosecuted Green, said her
motion was ``without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those actions are very common,'' he said. ``It comes as no
surprise. We'll oppose it obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Such requests rarely result in new trials.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is now 48, is being held in maximum security at the
Topeka Correctional Facility in Kansas. She will be eligible for
parole consideration in 2035.
</P>
<P>
   Green's case drew national media attention and was the subject
of a book by Seattle author Ann Rule.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Green was sent to the penitentiary and taken
off the medication that she recognized the effect of her medical
conditions and the drugs on her ability to make decisions,
according to her motion.
</P>
<P>
   The petition stated that she suffered from severe depression,
severe anxiety, psychosis and bipolar disorder with manic episodes.
She was being treated with antidepressants, antipsychotics and
anticonvulsants, the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of mental illness and drugs made her unable to
understand what was happening and unable to communicate with her
attorneys ``in a rational and meaningful sense,'' according to her
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was incompetent to make those decisions, her
petition said, she was denied her right to a fair trial and due
process of law.
</P>
<P>
   She was represented at the time by Dennis Moore, now a U.S.
congressman, and Kevin Moriarty.
</P>
<P>
   Both said Thursday that they had not seen the motion yet and
could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   At Green's plea hearing in April 1996, District Judge Peter
Ruddick questioned her about the drugs she was taking and whether
she was able to understand what was happening in court.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew what she was doing and didn't want to compound
the suffering of her family and surviving daughter by taking the
case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it is best to end this now so that we can begin
to heal from this horrible loss,'' she said in court that day.
</P>
<P>
   At her sentencing in May of that year, she read a statement that
cautioned against ignoring the signs of alcohol abuse and mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol, psychiatric illness and even more basic communication
failures within our family set the stage for this tragedy,'' she
said in court. ``I do not seek to use that fact to escape my
personal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's former husband, Mike Farrar, nearly died from the
complications of the poisoning attempts that occurred in the months
before the fatal fire, and had to undergo surgery a number of
times.
</P>
<P>
   He has since remarried, and he and his surviving daughter, now
15, are doing well, he said Thursday. He said he spoke to Morrison
about the motion and was ``not particularly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tremendous amount of faith in Paul Morrison and his
office,'' Farrar said.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing date on the motion has not been set yet.

PALFFY'S BACK, AND LOOKS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ziggy Palffy played Thursday night against the
Florida Panthers, even had an assist. But the Los Angeles Kings
know his sore lower back isn't going to be healed any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who missed Tuesday's game in St. Louis after his back
flared up in pregame warmups, worked out Thursday morning but was
not cleared to play until minutes before game time.
</P>
<P>
   One day after seeing a soft-tissue specialist and a doctor for
the discs in his lower back, Palffy appeared to have the form that
has made him the club's leading scorer (35 points).
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, he broke in on Panthers goaltender
Mike Vernon. Palffy's wrist shot hit Vernon's pads and popped out.
Luc Robitaille took a whack in front, but Len Barrie poked it in
for his second goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Palffy's 21st assist of the season. It also was a much
better situation than the Kings had two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his back stiffened up just before the game and the
Kings had to go scrambling for a body to fill his roster spot.
Enforcer Steve McKenna already was in street clothes in the press
box when he received word that Palffy was out and he was in.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite a difference between McKenna, who has no goals
and just four points, to Palffy's 14 goals. Tuesday night, the
Kings' first line consisted of Barrie and wingers Marko Tuomainen
and Vladimir Tsyplakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors say there can't be further damage,'' said Kings
coach Andy Murray, who thought of holding Palffy out until Tuesday
night against Ottawa. ``Three days isn't going to make a lot of
difference. He could use three months. We're preparing like he's
not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vote of confidence: Murray met with the Kings before the morning
practice and singled out defenseman Jaroslav Modry as a key
contributor in Tuesday's 1-1 tie against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Modry, who scored late in the second period Thursday to give the
Kings a 3-1 lead, was coming off a terrible game Monday night in
Dallas. His failure to control the puck early in the game resulted
in a short-handed goal for the Stars. But Tuesday, he set up
newcomer Bob Corkum on the Kings' first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Modry was not a favorite of former coach Larry Robinson, and
despite an impressive training camp he was benched after Mattias
Norstrom returned from a contract holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Modry has played sparingly this season, but scored a goal Dec.
30 in the Kings' 8-2 rout of Edmonton. Thursday, he played in place
of defenseman Frantisek Kaberle, who also has played on the power
play with Garry Galley (concussion), but has been scratched the
past few games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the skate, I took Modry as an example of what we
want,'' Murray said. ``He recovered from a very bad game in Dallas
to have a very good game in St. Louis. We want Kaberle to have a
rest and Modry to have a vote of confidence.'' &QL;

 `Amazing Grace' retires from fast-food job at 90  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARA ROSE WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nearly a dozen years ago, when she was 79,
Grace Staab walked into an Independence Taco Bell for lunch. In a
sweet, grandmotherly way she scolded a manager for having an untidy
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Before she knew it, she had left with a full stomach and a
part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was after the noon hour the day I walked in there,''
recalled Staab, of Raytown. ``The place was a bit trashed. The
shift manager came out and said to me, `How's everything?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said everything is fine, but this would be an easy job to
keep these tables wiped up. Then they just talked me into that job.
I just went in there for a taco.''
</P>
<P>
   She thought she would try the hostess job for a week or two, but
weeks turned into years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Staab _ now 90 _ threw herself a retirement party
at the Taco Bell in Raytown, where she has worked since leaving the
Independence Taco Bell about five years ago. More than 80 persons
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace has been saying for a long time that if she makes it to
the year 2000, she would finally retire,'' said Glen Pitts, who
hired Staab at the Raytown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a great work ethic. It's not so much her keeping the
lobby clean, but she's great for public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Staab has greeted every customer who came through the door.
She's carried trays, helped mothers with cranky babies, decorated
the restaurant with flowers from her garden, and bounced from table
to table chatting with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they have to wait too long in line, I help them pass
the time by telling jokes,'' Staab said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder her regular customers call her ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy and Pat Voyles have eaten at the Taco Bell once a week since
Staab started there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves this lady,'' Roy Voyles said. ``She is the
life of the party. She always has time for you. She could be
feeling bad, and she'll make you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Staab has worked since she was 8 years old, when she washed
dishes for 25 cents a load. In the 1930s and '40s, she checked
coats.
</P>
<P>
   When she accepted the Taco Bell job in September 1988, she
already had two others. She worked from 6 to 10 a.m. at her
grandson's bakery in Independence, and from 4 to 8 p.m. at another
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Taco Bell filled the empty hours between 11 a.m and 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Staab can still drive her 1975 Buick Park Avenue during the day,
but she gave up the other jobs when she could no longer see well at
night. Emphysema, she said, has now slowed her down.
</P>
<P>
   Since meeting Staab five years ago, Mildred Wash has driven once
a week to the Taco Bell from her home near Swope Park. She's amused
by the notion that Staab might be losing her energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humph!'' Wash said. ``At her age, she really moves like a
young person. She can work circles around most people. She really
keeps this place clean, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Staab loves to work, she still finds time to do a lot
more.
</P>
<P>
   She's traveled to China, Korea, Mexico and Alaska. And she has a
large family: three children, 24 grandchildren (including spouses
of her grandchildren), and 26 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Staab said she will miss the people at Taco Bell, but will find
plenty to keep her busy at home. Great-grandson Ben Premoe said
he's not worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at her house, she never sits down,'' he said.
``I'm surprised she stops long enough to go to bed at night.''

A FORAY FAR FROM HORSEPLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Solomon Feingold describes himself as a longshot
bettor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely hate favorites,'' says the 59-year-old
grandfather from West Hills. ``I'm not interested in putting down
$2 to win $3.40.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on past performances, he should be considered one of
the favorites in the first-ever national horse-race handicapping
tournament today and Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said he has won more than $250,000 in handicapping
tournaments over the past 15 years. That includes the $125,000 he
received in October for outwitting 700 other players at the Orleans
Casino in Las Vegas to qualify for this weekend's event.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of 160 qualifiers from among 45,000 competing at 40
racetracks, simulcast facilities and casinos around the country for
what could be called the horseplayers' U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants run the gamut from professional handicappers
like John Conte of New York, turf writer Bob Randazzo of the
Cleveland Plain Dealer and trainer-statistics analyst Frank Tate of
Oceanside, to a blind man from Minnesota and a 68-year-old retired
preschool teacher who qualified at New Hampshire's Rockingham Park
by winning the first tournament she ever entered.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who runs an advertising agency in Agoura, lands
somewhere in between those extremes. He's not a professional or a
full-time horseplayer, but a dedicated racetracker who's been
playing the races since he was a teen-ager in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling was part of the upbringing,'' said Feingold, although
he notes that his parents didn't gamble. ``We bet with bookies on
the games and the horse racing. We had the illegal numbers, which I
played maybe a couple times in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold didn't become a cards player, he noted wryly, because
``I don't like smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   He gravitated toward the racetrack because there a gambler can
put up a small amount of money to win a lot, and because the
parimutuel system makes winning and losing a matter of skill in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a thrill,'' Feingold said. ``It's not the money as
much as(the chance to say), `Wow, I beat everybody.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon at the track, he said, he's content to take a
table for one in the dining room and watch the races on the
television screens. He'll risk about $2,000 a day on a mixture of
win, place, exacta, trifecta, pick-three and pick-six bets.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to check horses' recent efforts with the help of the
tracks' video replay machines. Mostly, though, he looks for clues
in the Daily Racing Form past-performance charts that he believes
other bettors will miss.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for big fields in cheap races on the theory that
they'll produce more longshot winners.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers horses stepping up to tougher competition to horses
diving in class, because the ``public'' is a sucker for droppers.
</P>
<P>
   He likes horses trying a distance after fading in sprints,
because the slower pace of the longer races might keep them going.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't play hunches or listen to tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make money by betting favorites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold believes his natural preference for longshots gives him
an advantage in handicapping tournaments, in which the winner is
the player whose horses produce the highest total payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Orleans tournament last fall, Feingold played 36 races
beamed in from Santa Anita, Bay Meadows, Louisiana Downs, Belmont
Park and Calder and picked six winners returning between $18 to $45
on $2 bets.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, Feingold stopped competing in tournaments
because, increasingly, they required players to bet on races from
places other than the California tracks with which he's familiar.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided to play the Orleans qualifier last fall,
Feingold called on a pair of ``consultants,'' friends from Las
Vegas and El Paso who follow racing nationwide. They led him to
half his winners. He cut them in for a share of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants will be available to Feingold again this weekend
on sort of a ``Phone a Friend'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, sponsored by the Daily Racing Form, promises a
$200,000 purse. The champion will receive $100,000 plus a
``Handicapper of the Year'' award that will be presented at the
Eclipse Awards dinner at the Beverly Hilton on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The rules require each player to take stabs at 20 races each day
10``mandatory'' races selected by tournament organizers, and 10 of
the player's choosing. The player with the highest total payoffs on
$2 win bets will be the champion.
</P>
<P>
   For contest purposes, payoffs will be capped at 20-1, so one
fluke longshot won't decide the whole thing.

   Feingold limbered up for the tournament with a trip to Santa
Anita one day last week. He played a $148 pick-six ticket and hit
for $7,800.

<P>
   ``I'm ready,'' he declared. ``I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Anita: The weekend features the first local 3-year-old
stakes of 2000.

<P>
   Saturday's San Miguel Stakes has drawn Del Mar Futurity winner
Forest Camp, switching from David Flores to Chris McCarron for his
first start since finishing sixth as the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
favorite at Gulfstream Park. The Bob Baffert-trained colt will
break from post 1 which hasn't produced a 6-furlong winner at the
Santa Anita meet against five opponents who include impressive
maiden-breaker Swept Overboard.

<P>
   Sunday's Santa Ysabel finds D. Wayne Lukas-trained Surfside, the
3-year-old filly with the best chance of taking on colts in the
Triple Crown preps, returning in just 20 days from her seven-length
victory under PatDay in the Hollywood Starlet. The field for the 1
1/16-mile race will be set today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Kent Desormeaux,
10 wins; Corey Nakatani, 9; David Flores, 7; Chris McCarron and Pat
Valenzuela, 6. Trainers: Bob Baffert and Ron McAnally, 5; Bobby
Frankel, 4; John Dolan, Neil Drysdale and Bill Spawr, 3. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: Since front-runners went winless in 14
main-track sprints in the first three days of the Santa Anita meet,
they held on to win a strong 7 of 17 of those races in the
following four days. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: today, $100,000 Survive
Stakes, California-bred fillies and mares age 4 and up, 5 furlongs;
Saturday, $100,000 San Miguel, 3-year-olds, 6 furlongs; Sunday,
$100,000 Santa Ysabel, 3-year-old fillies, 1 1/16 miles. At
Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $100,000 Broward Handicap, 3-year-olds
and up, 1 1/16 miles; Sunday, $100,000 Mac Diarmida Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1 3/8 miles. &QL; 
Mileposts: Frank Stronach, whose company owns Santa Anita, Golden
Gate Fields and Gulfstream Park, has dropped his threat to pull his
five U.S. tracks out of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association at least until next January. NTRA officials have
promised to think about Stronach's recent demands a clearer mandate
for the organization, a democratically selected board and a
commitment to ``free enterprise'' in the industry. It's thought
that the two-year-old NTRA would have been crippled without
Stronach.... Laffit Pincay will receive a ``Special Eclipse Award''
at the Eclipse dinner Jan. 17 at the Beverly Hilton, recognizing
his achievement in breaking Bill Shoemaker's career-wins record
Dec. 10 at Hollywood Park.... Pincay returns Saturday from a
three-day suspension.... Pat Day wound up leading the national
jockey standings for 1999 with $18.1 million in purses, about
$800,000 more than Jerry Bailey. Bob Baffert led the trainers with
$16.8 million, about $4.7 million ahead of D. Wayne Lukas. Dubai
World Cup winner Almutawakel ($3.29 million) was the richest horse
who raced at least once in North America. Storm Cat, whose
offspring earned $9.6 million, was the top sire.... Karl Korte, 65,
a jockey on and off since 1953, stretched his career into a sixth
decade when he rode in a race at Gulfstream Park on Monday. If
that's a record, it may not last long: Ray York, 67, who won the
1954 Kentucky Derby with Determine, is preparing to make a brief
comeback at Santa Anita in February and notch his seventh decade.

BUSH VOWS TO CUT TAXES AS HE AND OTHER CANDIDATES TRADE BARBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Eight years after his father learned the hard way
about making promises on taxes, Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday
night offered an unequivocal pledge never to raise taxes and _
going even further than the former president _ promised to cut
them.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a fierce competition with Sen. John McCain less than a
month before the presidential primary in New Hampshire, Bush, of
Texas, sought to overcome his father's famous reversal of a ``no
new taxes'' pledge. Conservatives never forgave then-President
George Bush for that move, which cost him critical support in the
1992 primary here and haunted his campaign against Bill Clinton
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only no new taxes,'' Bush said in a debate with
his five rivals for the Republican presidential nomination at the
University of New Hampshire. ``This is tax cuts, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Rather than create more government, I think we ought
to pass money back to the working in people in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's promise was a dramatic point of an hourlong debate in
which he and McCain, of Arizona, abandoned their months of
cordiality and sparred aggressively over their prescriptions for
campaign finance and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain clung to portraying himself as the reform candidate, even
as he was alled upon to defend his recent intervention with the
Federal Communications Commission in a matter that ultimately
benefited a major campaign contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I've worked so hard for campaign finance reform
because all this money washing around Washington and all those
uncontrolled contributions taint all of us,'' he said, smiling
broadly, as he did throughout the questions about his conduct. ``No
matter what we do we are under a cloud of suspicion, and I am one
of those as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, the fourth featuring all six Republican candidates,
was the most spirited, and at times the most entertaining, of the
party's campaign. McCain suggested that Bush was behind an
independent group's advertising campaign attacking him. Bush, in
turn, scolded McCain for backing a campaign finance bill that ``Al
Gore is applauding.''
</P>
<P>
   The tense moments between Bush and McCain set the tone for an
increasingly strained competition between the two politicians, who
are neck and neck in the polls here, in the run-up to the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 1. The competitors will meet three more
times in the next four days _ at a debate on Friday in South
Carolina, a dinner on Sunday in New Hampshire and another debate on
Monday in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain battled each other, their four opponents,
struggling for attention, sought to portray them as not
sufficiently conservative for Republican primary voters. They
seized on the issue of homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Every candidate took issue with comments on Wednesday night by
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley _ standing on
the same stage at the University of New Hampshire _ that strongly
endorsed the right of homosexuals to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   But some contenders argued that McCain and Bush did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we accept the radical homosexual agenda,'' said Alan Keyes,
a former State Department official, ``be it in the military or in
marriage or in other areas of our lives, we are utterly destroying
the concepts of family.'' He added, ``those candidates up here
unwilling to face that fact and playing games with this issue are
doing so irresponsibly at the price of America's moral
foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said he objected to comments by Bush, who did not rule out
appointing openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what their policies are,'' Bush said. ``Depends on
what their views are.'' Referring the the administration's current
policy on gays, he said, ``I'm a don't ask, don't tell man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also voiced support for the current policy, saying, ``I
would make sure that a policy that's working and is working and
should work was continued.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 60 minutes to share among the six of them, the
candidates often interrupted one another and often ignored the
questions posed by the moderator, Tim Russert of NBC News, and
three local journalists. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah replied to a
question about Internet taxation by talking about the U.S. policy
toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between McCain and Bush was notable because for
months, the two had hardly seemed like rivals. They were even
praising each other in debates. But on Thursday night, McCain
turned to Bush and suggested that he was behind an advertising
campaign by a conservative antitax group that has broadcast
commercials attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, a supporter of yours is running ads morphing Bill
Clinton's face into mine,'' McCain said. Then, seeking to inject
some levity into his accusation, he added, ``And by the way, ask
him to get a better picture, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said, ``I don't think you have an idea of how
important campaign finance reform could restore the confidence of
young Americans in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back: ``What you don't need to do is tell me what I
have an idea about or not.''
</P>
<P>
   This state has a tradition of opposing taxes, and Bush has made
his $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan a centerpiece of his
campaign here. In the first major policy dispute with McCain, Bush
this week accused McCain of shortchanging the middle class on tax
cuts. But McCain argued that the governor's proposal would go to
tax breaks for the upper class _ at the expense of money for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, McCain said, ``Governor Bush said the other
day we're awash in cash. We've got a $5.6 trillion debt that we're
saddling young Americans with. We ought to pay down the debt. But
we also ought to make Social Security solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher who advocates the abolition
of the current tax code, took issue with Bush's drive to come
across as a tax cut crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He signed a pledge in 1994 promising not to put in a business
tax or to raise the state sales tax,'' he said of Bush's record in
Texas. ``Two years later he violated that pledge.'' He added, ``We
know what happens in the Republican Party when we violate no-tax
pledges.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes repeats that attack in his first _ and long anticipated _
caustic commercial of the campaign. In the commercial, Mary C.
Williams, who runs an organization in Texas called Taxpayers for
Accountability, said Bush's ``record as far as taxes are concerned
is a record of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their sharp exchanges, Bush refused to be drawn into
questions about McCain's dealings with the FCC on behalf of a major
contributor, Paxson Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objection with John is not how he conducted himself as
chairman of the Commerce Committee,`` Bush said. His concern, he
explained was that the senator's campaign reform plan would, ``hurt
the Republican cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Often on Thursday night, the other contenders were eclipsed by
Bush and McCain. Forbes was asked why, after spending millions of
his fortune on his campaign, he had not made inroads in the polls.
Asked by one reporter if he was too aloof, Forbes drew laughs when
glanced at McCain and replied, ``Maybe you want me to give a hug to
John.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad to, Steve,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary L. Bauer, who is also battling for the conservative vote,
cast himself as more responsive to those voters than Bush. He
accused President Bush of making ``a colossal mistake'' by
appointing David Souter to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Governor Bush would defend his father, Bush said,
``Listen, I'm the only one on stage who's appointed judges.'' He
added, ``My dad can defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate the candidates spent time joking,
interrupting one another, swapping put-downs and complaining that
they were not drawing adequate attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush flashed his quick humor when he was asked, based on his
past comments about his belief in Christ, whether as president he
would think to himself ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take an expression into the Oval Office of, `Dear God
_ help me!''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Keyes deadpanned, ``So would we, governor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't very Christian of you,'' Bush complained.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, it was Bush and McCain needling each other.
McCain said that Bush's plan for a tax cut dissipated the federal
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it doesn't,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No it doesn't, yes it does,'' Bush mimicked.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Keyes and Russert engaged in a semitense
standoff as Russert implored the candidate to stop talking, while
Keyes refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes ultimately sniped, ``The format of this debate is a little
strange. I begin to wonder when Mr. Russert will declare his
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, too, seemed to feel overlooked. ``I'm going to stay here
and take some time myself,'' he insisted when one of his efforts to
make a comment bucked up against a time limit. ``I'm taking this
microphone, I tell you right now.''  &QL;

 Woman accused in robbery attempt is ordered held without bond  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pheng Siriboury's botched attempt Friday to hold up an suburban
Kansas City, Mo., bank was an ``act of desperation'' after she ran
up more than $100,000 in debts, her attorney told a federal
magistrate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Johnson County, Kan., woman was ordered held
without bond on charges of attempting to rob the Bank of America in
Olathe, Kan., brandishing a firearm in a crime of violence and
taking hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Some bank employees who were taken hostage were held for eight
hours until a hostage disarmed Siriboury about 1 a.m. Saturday. No
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury's attorney, Michael Harris, a federal public defender,
said that she should be released on bond to her parents. Saying she
was unlikely to commit another crime, Harris asked for electronic
monitoring, psychiatric counseling and a curfew. He said he would
seek a private psychiatric analysis to back up his request.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Siriboury, a native of Laos, suffers from bipolar
disorder and a chemical imbalance. She needs treatment she can't
get in jail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Streepy opposed release, saying
she was a danger to the community and a risk to flee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate David J. Waxse said he would revisit the bond
matter if Harris could bring in sufficient evidence that Siriboury
was not likely to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Harris told Waxse that Siriboury's parents brought her to the
Kansas City area from Laos when she was 2 years old. She dropped
out of Olathe North High School as a sophomore, he said, and ran
away from home after arguments with her parents. She spent about a
month in a juvenile psychiatric facility in early 1993 and dropped
out of high school for good in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She was married in 1997, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Siriboury was ``addicted to gambling'' and had run
up debts _ ``maybe as high as $150,000'' _ part of it on credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her gambling addiction ruined her and her husband
financially,'' Harris said, adding that she was living with her
``estranged husband'' in Leawood, Kan., at the time of the bank
robbery. It was that situation that led to her ``act of
desperation,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury said nothing during the detention hearing, which
lasted about 30 minutes.

 Employers relieved after Labor Department rescinds at-home work
policy  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chris Long, president of Associated
Industries of Missouri, looked forward Wednesday afternoon to a
nice, relaxing airline flight to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Stubblefield, vice president of Creative Courseware Inc.,
celebrated an escape from what could have been the death of her
company as she knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Both were relieved that the U.S. Department of Labor _ in an
unusually quick turnaround _ rescinded a policy letter that only a
day earlier had been causing coast-to-coast panic among employers
who had employees working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Relief came when Labor Secretary Alexis Herman withdrew a
7-week-old ``guidance letter'' that had said employers were
responsible for meeting the same Occupational Safety and Health
Administration standards for at-home workers as for employees
working in the employers' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unfortunate letter,'' Long said of the initial opinion,
which was dated Nov. 15 but received national attention only this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling employers that their liability would have extended to
situations where employees worked at home would have finished any
at-home opportunities,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Long said his association, which represents about 1,500 of the
largest employers in Missouri, sent one of many negative responses
about the guidance letter to the federal agency. He said it
``speaks well of the department that they listened to public
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Courseware officers did not formally respond to the
guidance letter, but it caused trepidation, Stubblefield said.
</P>
<P>
   The company specializes in performance consulting for businesses
and develops training materials, computer software support
materials, online help systems and computer manuals. This type of
work allows several employees to work from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have drastically altered the way we do business if we
would have suddenly had to provide office space for whatever
contractors happened to be working for us on the project of the
moment,'' Stubblefield said.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect could have been cost-prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had to go out and rent one of those buildings
Sprint is vacating,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   Or, she added, ``we would have had to put contract stipulations
in each contract as to the conditions in home offices. The
oversight would have been a nightmare. We would have had to have
some right of access and inspection. It would have opened the door
to all kinds of legal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield said a pall placed on employers' willingness to
allow at-home workers would have harmed working mothers especially.
Many of them are in the labor force only because of the opportunity
to work at home, she said, and they might not be employed if they
didn't have that option.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's announcement Wednesday emphasized that the advisory
letter (which responded to questions asked in August by a company
in Texas) never had been intended as a statement of policy for all
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, though, many such guidance letters have been made
public and served to alert other companies as to the prevailing
regulatory winds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million Americans are thought to work regularly in
their homes, which means many employers would have been affected if
they were given responsibility for ensuring OSHA safety standards
in home offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Policy Foundation, a research organization in
Washington, estimated that applying OSHA regulations to home
offices would have cost $22.5 billion in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it would have cost employers to remove hazards,
install safety equipment and signs, and do other things necessary
to bring home offices in compliance. Subsequently, an additional
$8.8 billion a year would have been spent on inspections and
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   In rescinding the guidance letter, Herman noted that
``family-friendly, flexible and fair work arrangements, including
telecommuting, can benefit individual employees and their families,
employers and society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the safety of at-home workers is a concern, the labor
secretary said she would convene a task force that includes
representatives of the Commerce Department, the Small Business
Administration, Labor Department and others to examine ``the broad
social and economic effects of telecommuting.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial query about employer liability for at-home workers
came from CSC Credit Services in Houston. The company asked OSHA to
respond to five principal questions:
</P>
<P>
   - What is the employer's obligation within the home work
environment?
</P>
<P>
   - Is the employer responsible for compliance with the home
itself?
</P>
<P>
   - Is the employer required to do periodic compliance inspections
in the home, which may include safety, health, fire and
environmental issues?
</P>
<P>
   - What would be OSHA's inspection procedures in a private home?
</P>
<P>
   - Does the employer have to include these home locations in its
file regarding record-keeping (for OSHA)?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the responses from OSHA's compliance office said that
OSHA regulations applied to anywhere an employee worked and that
employers had responsibility for inspecting and ensuring safe
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sentences such as this raised public ire: ``For example, if work
is performed in the basement space of a residence and the stairs
leading to the space are unsafe, the employer could be liable if
the employer knows or reasonably should have known of the dangerous
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman's subsequent retraction of the letter did not get into
details about what parts of the advisory may or may not survive.
Those decisions may evolve from the work of the task force she
convened.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ If need be _ and a few moments of fantasy are beginning to
seem necessary _ Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich can always imagine
his summer reward for the dues paid in a sinking season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had he blurred his vision just a little Thursday night and
looked closely at Heat center Alonzo Mourning demolishing an
outmanned frontcourt, Tomjanovich could have easily pictured
himself coaching the United States Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He could have watched the Miami Heat overpower what is left of
his Rockets and imagined the Dream Team routs to come. It wouldn't
even have been hard to imagine Rockets guard Steve Francis' flights
into the teeth of the Heat defense as one of those underdog
challenges against the Dream Team that becomes the highlight of
mundane routs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton one night. Mourning another. And the Rockets were
left Thursday looking much like the sort of undermanned teams to be
whipped in Sydney. But after the Heat settled for a 111-99 win not
nearly that close, Tomjanovich at least knew where and when he
could reverse his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he knows what he has to work with this summer,''
Mourning said. ``I expect to have a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning seemed to be having about as much fun Thursday as he
ever shows. So caught up in his current problems after a loss to
the Grizzlies on Tuesday, the day he was named to the Olympic team,
Mourning had forgotten who would be his Olympic coach. That changed
when Tomjanovich offered his congratulations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning then scored 28 points _ one shy of the 29 his future
Dream Teammate Payton hit the Rockets with Tuesday _ on 12-of-15
shooting. He needed just three quarters to block a season-high nine
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason (Payton and Mourning) are on the (Olympic) team is
they're good,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He's damn good. There was
nothing we could do. We had nobody to stop Mourning. He was
phenomenal at both ends of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   With center Kelvin Cato joining Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
and Tony Massenburg as unavailable Rockets big men, the Heat met
little resistance inside. Carlos Rogers, still badly weakened by a
respiratory infection, fell into quick foul trouble and played just
19 minutes. Thomas Hamilton was not nearly quick enough to slow
Mourning defensively. Kenny Thomas, a 6-7 rookie, switched to him
but was not nearly strong or tall enough inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about P.J. (Brown) and (Tim) Weatherspoon,''
Thomas said. ``I think I can guard guys in the post. But he
(Mourning) is big, and he's strong. He's taller than me, of course.
I was just trying to play him straight up, and the coaches told me
to give him jump shots. That's all I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat was so dominant inside that it outscored the Rockets
60-30 in the paint. And having lamented its mediocre board work of
late, Miami outrebounded the Rockets enough to outscore them 16-10
on second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough with all our injuries to our big men,'' said
Rockets forward Walt Williams, who had 17 points off the bench.
``It's tough inside all the time. Olajuwon, Barkley, Tony
Massenburg, Kelvin Cato. That's a big part of this team.
Establishing ourselves down low right now is hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the benches were emptied, the Heat had taken a
27-point lead in the third quarter. Mourning played just three
minutes in the fourth, watching as the Rockets cut a 24-point lead
in half in the final seven minutes with every Heat starter on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not feeling (undermanned),'' Tomjanovich said. ``I know we
are. We're sort of in a rebuilding deal. Cato is a big part of
that. Not having the guy in a game like this is devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Rockets hope was to penetrate enough to draw Mourning
and either finish over him or pass outside to shooters left open.
Francis pulled off one example of beating Mourning, soaring to
score over him for a three-point play early in the second half.
Francis finished with 22 points and six assists, easily leading the
Rockets in both categories. And he might have been the only person
in the building unimpressed by Mourning's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fouling me every time,'' Francis said. ``He fouled me
every single time. I was over the rim and just lost the ball. I'm
definitely going to lift tomorrow, so I'll get my legs stronger and
put it on his head five times instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did act for much of the night as if they expected to
come up with such an inexplicable result. Though within two points
six minutes into the second quarter, they were outscored 14-5 to
end the half, making just two of 12 shots in six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, they could barely get shots, and when they
did they made few. The Rockets made five of 15 shots as their most
consistent offense became drawing illegal defenses, and the Heat
pulled away easily.
</P>
<P>
   Miami attacked the basket, making 14 of 22 shots in the decisive
third quarter and rarely shooting outside unless via penetration
and a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was to go straight to the basket and make
plays,'' Mourning said. ``When you take the ball aggressively to
the basket, it forces the defense to help. If they don't help, you
get high-percentage shots. We got it on the floor and took it to
the basket. We need to continue to pound the ball inside and use
our size.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning didn't say it, but he might just memorize that little
speech. It sounded just about right for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Tomjanovich) said it was going to be fun,'' Mourning said.
``I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   His summer coach must surely know how he feels.
</P>

 KCP&AMP;L merits kudos, not carping  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Speaking as a Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
customer and interested observer of the local business scene,
KCP&AMP;L's decision to scrap its planned merger with Western Resources
was as welcome as the flowers in spring.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the leading local power company in a deal playing
second banana to a Topeka, Kan., company never did seem fitting.
Nobody would say as much, but it downgraded Kansas City's image as
the dominant regional economic force.
</P>
<P>
   Most area residents probably don't think of KCP&AMP;L as the city's
most dynamic enterprise _ when they think of it at all, that is.
When locals think of KCP&AMP;L, it's mostly when their lights go out.
When the lights come back on in relatively short order, as is
usually the case, the company's promptness is taken for granted.
Meantime, this efficiency doesn't predispose the community to cut
KCP&AMP;L much slack when Mother Nature contrives to make service
restoration a long and difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   Although KCP&AMP;L is one of the area's most important companies, it
is also the most underappreciated. Nobody gives it bouquets for its
highly dependable service, but when things go extraordinarily wrong
the media and most customers are always quick to carp.
</P>
<P>
   This is too bad because KCP&AMP;L's record for filling the local
economy's electricity needs has been nothing short of spectacular.
While it has taken its public relations lumps for doing what's
necessary to keep up with rising power demand, it never gets the
thanks it deserves when the added capacity saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   As those blistering summer peak-demand periods pass without any
need for rolling brownouts, credit is never given where it's due.
Nobody ever says, for instance, ``It's a good thing KCP&AMP;L pushed
successfully for the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant years ago,
despite much protest, because otherwise we'd be in real deep
trouble about now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most people never stop to think about the symbolism of
the name: Kansas City Power &AMP; Light. It's a metaphor for what
inspires local pride and progress. To imagine Kansas City without
an eponymous power company is a depressing prospect. This symbolism
wasn't lost on those seeking to revitalize downtown when they
decided to call their project the Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   Even the company's erstwhile art deco headquarters remains to
this day the most distinctive edifice downtown. They don't build
'em like that anymore, and it would be a sad day if this beautiful
monument to Kansas City's 20th century vigor became known as
anything other than the Power &AMP; Light Building.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to tell where KCP&AMP;L will go from here, or what shape
it will take. Deregulation is changing the face of the electric
power industry, although not as rapidly hereabouts as some other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future brings, though, those served so reliably by
KCP&AMP;L should never lose sight of the fact that their quality of
life has benefited immensely from the efficiency of this company
and the dedication of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever happens, it would be gratifying to see the name
survive in perpetuity as the symbol of a city so exciting it was
once celebrated in songs.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Unified has launched an 11th hour
campaign with help from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to win
hundreds of millions of federal dollars to wire every classroom for
the Internet and two-way video conferencing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious telecommunications endeavor comes only six weeks
after district administrators admitted they were perilously close
to missing the federal funding deadline -- for the second year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller said the district
will meet this year's deadline and also submit applications for far
more schools than originally planned. The cut-off date for the
Federal Communication Commission's E-Rate funding is less than two
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the most technologically advanced school district
in the U.S., regardless of size, in terms of its electronic video,
data, and voice interconnections,'' Miller predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative represents a drastic change in the scope of Los
Angeles Unified's efforts to link its classrooms via fiber optic
cable and broadband wires. The proposed technological improvements
would give the nation's second-largest school district the capacity
to put a computer with high-capacity, high-speed telecommunications
connections on every child's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Miller could not immediately provide an exact figure on the
amount of E-Rate money the district will seek, but said it would be
``hundreds of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the district planned to apply for $180 million to
wire 170 schools. Miller said that was a ``piecemeal'' effort that
will be dwarfed by the new initiative, which would bring technology
improvements to all of the district 790 campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified's applications will compete with public
school and libraries across the country for a portion of $2.3
billion set aside by Congress to fund E-Rate.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to guarantee that the district's applications are
submitted on time, Miller signed an agreement with the Army on
Monday to manage LAUSD's funding request and oversee the
installation of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the Army to receive $687,120. If the federal
funding is received, the technology improvements would to start
this July and run through June 2001. The Army, however, will be
paid in advance, receiving all its fees by March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, chairman of the Proposition BB bond oversight
committee, praised the district Thursday for finding a way to meet
this year's E-Rate deadline, but criticized Miller's decision to
bring in the Army and pay the federal agency before all of the work
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff's dissatisfaction with the agreement could prove to be
a stumbling block for the district, if it decides to ask the
Propostion BB oversight commission to release local bond money for
a required monetary match of the federal E-Rate funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having one huge bureaucracy sign a contract with another huge
bureaucracy and agreeing to pay them in advance without any
competition for the work is the LAUSD's old way of doing business.
And it's wrong,'' said Soboroff, a candidate for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough big players in this highly competitive
technology business where you can get this work done very
cheaply,'' he added. ``This contract is open-ended, it doesn't look
to be competitive... and it doesn't meet the oversight criteria for
using BB money.''
</P>
<P>
   At November's Proposition BB oversight committee meeting,
Soboroff doggedly questioned several LAUSD technology personnel,
who eventually admitted the district would likely miss this year's
for E-Rate deadline unless more staff were assigned to compile
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Exacerbating the problem, the technology staff told Soboroff
that last year's school board and outgoing Superintendent Ruben
Zacarias failed to insert money in the district's $7.4 billion
budget to meet the required match for the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations were especially shocking since the district lost
$60 million in 1998 after missing that year's deadline because of a
lack of planning and coordination.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the school board, led by a new reform majority,
passed an emergency measure to set aside the money needed to match
the E-Rate funds, and IBM agreed to help the district complete its
applications for no fee.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said he wants the district to convince the Proposition
BB bond oversight committee that the Army has the experience to
manage the telecommunications program and that its fees are
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   At a December bond oversight committee meeting, Soboroff and
Miller got into a nasty exchange over the school board's decision
to hire the Army to manage the E-Rate work and the district's
billion-dollar school construction program. The board approved the
agreement with the Army, negotiated by Miller, without seeing the
contract or consulting with the bond oversight committee.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is scheduled to appear before the Proposition BB
committee Jan. 19 -- the same day the E-Rate applications are due
-- to field questions from Soboroff and other committee members. He
has shown no sign of backing down from his decision to use the
Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If LAUSD winds up with outstanding state-of-the-art
technology,'' Miller said Thursday, ``the corps of engineers will
deserve full credit.''

HUNDREDS IN MIAMI PROTEST INS DECISION TO RETURN BOY TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 2nd and 4th grafs for updating) 
 (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hundreds of Cuban-Americans, energized by a new cause,
shut down much of Miami on Thursday with waves of civil
disobedience, blocking access to the Port of Miami and choking
traffic on dozens of busy streets, to protest the Clinton
administration's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   About 135 protesters were arrested by riot police officers, who
led them away peacefully in plastic handcuffs as the crowd chanted,
``Libertad Elian, libertad Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking for is that this boy have his day in court,
and that the boy's father come here to ask for his son without
pressure from the Cuban government,'' said Jose Basulto, the
founder of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, before
being taken into a police van.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, the disturbance spread from downtown Miami to
other pockets, bringing many cars to a standstill at rush hour and
leading Gov. Jeb Bush to suspend tolls on several major highways.
Later, riot police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of
protesters from one intersection.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, a commuter rammed a car through lines of
demonstrators who were linking arms to block an intersection,
knocking down two protesters. They were taken to a hospital. In
another incident, a police officer who was hit by another motorist
suffered broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14.
The decision came more than a month after the unseaworthy boat
Elian, his mother, his stepfather and 11 other people took capsized
en route to Miami. Eleven of them died, including his mother and
stepfather. Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez, said he did not know the
boy was leaving the country and wants the boy sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Elian soon found himself in the middle of a sensitive diplomatic
tug-of-war between Cuba and Miami, between his father on the island
and his relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign that the boy's return to Cuba by Jan. 14 may not
proceed as smoothly as the administration would like, lawyers for
the boy said that immigration officials had not asked his Miami
relatives to turn Elian over and that the relatives may not do so
without a deportation order from the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS doesn't want to do the dirty work of deporting the
boy, and after not even being heard, we may not be inclined to help
them,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, one of a phalanx of lawyers
representing the family. ``There is no order to turn the boy over.
We think they have to initiate deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said the agency would not
forcibly remove the boy, and added: ``This is not a deportation.
This is an attempt to honor the wishes of the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Along block after block, in cafeterias and storefronts, Elian's
case has served as a clarion call for Cuban exiles here, a group
that over the last decade has grown considerably older, wearier and
more fractured since the death two years ago of one of its most
vocal leaders, Jorge Mas Canosa.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing unites Cuban-Americans like a good brawl with Fidel
Castro, and this one _ the story of a boy who watched his mother
die at sea as they fled Cuba by boat _ carries just the right mix
of politics and drama to embolden the community.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in Cuba, where Castro has used the case as a
patriotic rallying cry to re-energize the Cuban people against
Americans who have ``kidnapped'' the boy. The father said he did
not know his former wife and his son were leaving the country for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Garcia, security director for Alpha 66, a paramilitary
group that has sought for decades to overthrow Castro, said: ``This
has unified the community in the last few days. It has unified the
community in Miami in an incredible way. People had grown distant
from the cause. Time has passed. People had lost their will, their
enthusiasm. Now people are fighting shoulder to shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that
she saw no basis for reversing the decision by the immigration
service to return the boy to his father in Cuba. But Reno said she
could not absolutely rule out a change of mind ``if any information
we are not privy to'' comes to light.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials interviewed Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, on two separate occasions, the first to listen to his
plea that his son be returned, and the second to ensure that he
truly wanted his son back in Cuba without pressure from Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied he is speaking for himself,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has declined a American offer to let him pick up his
son in Florida and has asked the INS to have the National Council
of Churches, a group that met with Gonzalez in Cuba, act as
intermediary in the boy's return, Bergeron said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Immigration experts and INS officials maintain that Elian's
Miami relatives have no legal standing to overturn the decision
since Elian's father is the one who speaks for him.
</P>
<P>
   But many Miami exiles disagree. They point to the fact that the
immigration service initially agreed that the case should be
handled as a custody matter by state courts. And they point an
accusing finger at President Clinton, saying he caved into
political pressure from Castro, who threatened to turn the incident
into a migraine headache for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton said politics did not enter into the
administration's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Clinton doesn't mind breaking the law, but there
are laws in this country,'' said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a
Republican who represents Miami in Congress. ``This is illegal.
Only a court of law can decide this.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who has been living with his paternal great-aunt and
great-uncle, was sheltered for the most part from the commotion.
When he returned home from school, which he began attending this
week, he flashed a smile and waved to cheering fans from atop his
great uncle's shoulders. Relatives said they were heartbroken about
having to tell him of the INS decision. They said they would try to
broach the subject on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he doesn't want to go,'' said Alfredo Martell, one of
Elian's many cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family said on Thursday they want immigration
officials to issue a deportation order for Elian in the hopes that
the case would then go before an immigration judge. ``We would be
perfectly willing to go along with that,'' said Spencer Eig,
another lawyer for the family.

GOVERNOR'S THREAT HAS MTA SWEATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Terri Hardy  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- Under Gov. Gray Davis' ``use it or lose it''
crackdown on highway funds, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority could forfeit up to $447 &UR;  &LR; million in unspent federal
funds intended for buses, street and freeway improvements,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected bombshell dropped during his State of the State
address Wednesday night, Davis warned that if local transit
agencies throughout California do not spend $1.7 billion
``languishing'' in their accounts by July 31, the state would
``reprogram'' the money for them.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' remarks set off a firestorm of concern Thursday among Los
Angeles area transportation officials, but his staff was unable to
provide details on the money at risk or on how the governor intends
to carry out his ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   David Yale, the MTA's director of capital planning and
programming, said the agency already is hard-pressed to meet new
state deadlines that went into effect this year. The MTA had mapped
out a three-year plan of action that now must be completed in the
next seven months -- a task that could prove impossible if Davis
carries out his threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we sit on our hands we could lose this money,'' Yale said.
``L.A. County agencies will have to respond by expediting
transportation improvements even more quickly than we
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the MTA would have to buy 370 critically needed
buses and carry out a host of improvements to major streets,
creating of diamond lanes, installation of freeway ramp meters and
freeway improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Yale said he believes Davis eventually will ease the deadline to
something more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is using a bully pulpit to get transportation
agencies to focus on getting projects done faster,'' Yale said.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's get-tough message -- a key provision in his
overall transportation plan -- was clouded Thursday by conflicting
and vague information when his office was pressed for details.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor, could not provide
a breakdown by region showing how much money was unspent, and
little information was available on the types of transportation
funds under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   And in a hastily convened meeting with members of the governor's
administration, frustrated representatives from city and county
associations said no verification of the ``languishing'' funds was
provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out of that meeting more confused than when we went
in,'' said DeAnn Baker, a legislative representative for the
California State Association of Counties. ``There is no way that we
are sitting on $1.7 billion. We asked them to show us the money and
they couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker acknowledges that a significant amount of money is
unspent, sometimes because of poor communication or planning. But
in many other instances the reasons are good, or out of the local
agencies' control, including putting aside money for potential cost
overruns or receiving money late from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Davis administration officials told the group -- but provided no
written documentation -- that cities and counties were holding on
to $500million in capital project money known as ``STIP'' funds;
$800 million in federal Regional Surface Transportation Program and
Congestion Management Air Quality funds; and an additional $300
million that could not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Harrison, a spokesman for the state Department of Finance,
said late Thursday that the $1.7 billion figure was taken from a
document produced 18 months ago by the state controller, but the
breakdown of types of funds was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A regional chart showing unspent money was included, showing Los
Angeles County holding $113 million and Los Angeles City holding
$17.8 million far below the MTA's own figure.
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear to the cities and counties was the governor's
ability to somehow take away federal transportation funds.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the governor at this time is not empowered to
``reprogram'' those funds, and legislation changing the law would
be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   During the Wilson administration, legislation was drafted to
give cities and counties more control and planning over how their
transportation funding was spent. But Baker said there is a sense
that the Davis administration would like to see more control.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AB 1012, a bill that required speedier deadlines and
added the threat of losing transportation money, was signed into
law.
</P>
<P>
   During a day of uncertainty Thursday, the only thing that could
readily be agreed upon was that transportation financing, with its
host of funding sources, rules and new deadlines, is almost
impossible to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   MTA's Yale said his agency is operating under strict deadlines
imposed under AB 1012 that would set amounts of the $447 million to
be spent by Sept. 30, 2002. But an official in the office of
Assemblyman Tom Torlakson, D-Martinez, the author of AB 1012, said
no such restrictions apply to those MTA funds.

<P>
   TEACHER-INCENTIVES (Undated) _ On Wednesday, only hours after
New York's Gov. George Pataki asked lawmakers in Albany to
subsidize tuition for anyone who commits to teach in a New York
public school, Gov. Gray Davis of California addressed the
legislature in Sacramento with what, in effect, amounted to a
counteroffer. California, Davis proposed, should offer candidates
for its teaching jobs $10,000 home loans, $30,000 bonuses if they
attain advanced certification and $11,000 to repay college loans if
they agree to work in low-performing schools. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-OBRIAN (Undated) _ Patrick O'Brian, the Anglo-Irish
novelist whose stirring tales of the British navy in the Napoleonic
Wars made him a literary celebrity at an age when most writers have

84. By Frank J. Prial.

   BUSH-DEATH-PENALTY (Houston) _ In his five years as governor of
Texas, George W. Bush has presided over the executions of 111 men
and one woman, nearly one of every five carried out in the United
States since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in
1976. By any measure, Bush's commitment to capital punishment is
unquestioned. But as he runs for president as a more compassionate
kind of Republican, his death penalty record also offers insights
into his distinct views of mercy and justice. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GAYS-MILITARY _ When Clinton administration officials
interviewed Gen. Charles Krulak for the job of commandant of the
Marine Corps in 1995, he recalls, no one asked him for his views on
any social issue facing the military. And so he said he was
dismayed when he read that the two Democratic candidates for
president, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
would require their appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
support allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. Gore
went even further than Bradley to say it would be a litmus test for
any nominee he selected. By Steven Lee Myers.

   RUSSIA-ECON (Moscow) _ Relatively little is known about Vladimir
Putin's views on what kind of economic system should evolve in
Russia. The acting president has said little about the country's
enormous debts, or the cronyism and favoritism that have alienated
many foreign investors. On Thursday, though, Putin took a few steps
that suggested he was beginning to deal with Russia's economic
problems. By Neela Banerjee.
</P>
<P>
   BOND-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ When a show is providing a thrill
a minute, there is a risk that the competing act down the block
will be ignored. Given the recent stock market, that is what has
happened to the least risky _ and therefore least exciting _
investment around: inflation-indexed bonds. By Floyd Norris.

   NY-DIORAMAS (New York) _ The painted backgrounds of the dioramas
at the American Museum of Natural History have a curious place in
the hearts of almost everyone who has grown up in New York City
during the last century. They are some of the most elaborate
landscape paintings in the city and some of the most frequently
viewed pictures anywhere, but almost nobody knows who did them or,
in a sense, even seems to notice them when they're staring straight
at them. Are they art? Of course. Moreover, diorama painting is a
dying art, dioramas being relics from the days when verisimilitude
was a necessary skill among painters, and artists were the ones who
provided the world with pictures from abroad. By Michael Kimmelman.

   BROADWAY-DANCE (New York) _ Dance is upfront on Broadway this
season, very possibly because dance expresses what words cannot. Or
as Isadora Duncan put it, ``If I could write it, I wouldn't need to
dance it.'' More than ever, the all-dance show has virtually become
reality. From ``Swing!'' to ``Tango Argentino,'' by way of
``Fosse'' and ``Contact,'' so-called dance-driven shows are posing
a challenge to the conventional musical. Current revivals that
integrate song, dance and plot (``Kiss Me, Kate'' and ``Annie Get
Your Gun'') and their not-so-integrated new counterparts
(``Footloose'' and ``Saturday Night Fever'') also make room for
dance. Add the naturalness with which dancing weaves through the
parlor setting of ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' and the dance
aficionado can count the ways in which show business acquired new
meaning in 1999. By Anna Kisselgoff.

   NH-MEETING-CANDIDATES (Dover, N.H.) _ There are many idealized
notions about American presidential politics, and they start in the
state of New Hampshire. Here, by popular conception, is where the
race for president begins, the place with the first-in-the-nation
primary, where the candidates are methodically questioned by
informed citizens whose decisions guide a nation. And here, most of
all, is the last remaining spot in the nation where a regular
citizen can shake hands and converse with someone who might very
well be the next president of the United States. By Adam Nagourney.

   FILM-CRITICS-AWARDS (New York) _ Which turn-of-the-year movie
horse race do you follow? The one at the box office? Or the
stampede of critical 10-best lists that nudges prestigious films
toward Academy Award consideration? A year ago when ``Saving
Private Ryan'' won many critics' polls and did slam-dunk business,
it looked as if Hollywood was gearing up to steal back some of the
critical thunder that has increasingly accrued to independent
films. But this year, the tables have turned again. On Sunday
evening when the New York Film Critics Circle distributes its
annual awards, mainstream Hollywood will be given a mostly frigid
shoulder. By Stephen Holden.

UCLA FALLS TO WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Neither of UCLA's games this weekend is on TV, and
based on its performance Thursday night against Washington, the
blackout is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of ineptitude is not meant to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   There are good losses, there are bad losses, and then there is
Washington 63, UCLA 62, in front of 9,012 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Bruins hurt as badly as they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. I can't put it into words,'' said
teary-eyed freshman Jason Kapono, whose last-second jumper was
ruled a 2-pointer, not a 3-pointer, thus sealing UCLA's defeat.
``We should have never been in that position. We should have never
been in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game the Bruins (8-3, 0-1) seemingly had to win to
compete for the Pacific-10 title. And it was a game they should
have won given Washington's inferior talent, inferior record (6-7,
1-0) and injury-riddled roster.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UCLA had victory within its grasp when it took a 60-56
lead with 1:20 remaining. Then, collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the stretch, once we got a four-point lead, we didn't
execute our offense and we weren't able to get stops defensively,''
Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``In a possession-by-possession
game, that's going to be the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's demise was filled with errors in judgment. First, Ray
Young committed a bad foul on Washington's Will Perkins, a mediocre
player who was attempting a difficult shot. Perkins had no trouble
with the free throws, however, which trimmed UCLA's lead to 60-58.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the game's biggest mistake. Defended closely by Senque
Carey, UCLA guard Earl Watson committed an inexcusable five-second
violation near midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was that close,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Deon Luton, who had a game-high 26 points and
baffled UCLA's defense all night, drained a 3-pointer from the left
corner with 39 seconds remaining to give the Huskies a 61-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso made UCLA's next mistake _ an ill-advised
3-pointer that he attempted !ital!after hesitating for a
second.!off! He knew it was a bad shot, and he took it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 seconds left, the Bruins frantically fouled Luton, who
hit both free throws for a 63-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Watson raced downcourt and missed a 3-pointer. UCLA grabbed the
rebound, and it was Kapono's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hop back to get the 3-pointer,'' said Kapono, who
led the Bruins with 19 points. ``I thought I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Bill Kennedy didn't hesitate in calling Kapono's shot a
2-pointer, and Lavin did not complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 3, I was standing right next to him,'' Watson said.
``But that's how Pepperdine felt (after a blown call in Pauley
Pavilion). What goes around comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Washington played well, and that's the most
ominous sign for the Bruins. They faced a bad team on a bad night
and still couldn't get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies shot 39 percent from the field; they shot 52 percent
from the foul line; and they had no scoring threats except Luton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were so sloppy they couldn't take advantage. At
times, they acted like they'd never seen a zone defense before.
They committed 19 turnovers. They shot 42 percent from the field.
They shot 47 percent from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they lost in Seattle for the third consecutive
season, and Saturday's game at Washington State suddenly becomes
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough one to take,'' Watson said in a quiet locker
room. ``This was a win we definitely needed. We're starting behind
(Stanford and Arizona).''
</P>
<P>
   After Luton's dunk gave Washington a 55-54 lead, Moiso and Dan
Gadzuric teamed up for UCLA's best play of the night. Moiso,
standing at the foul line, passed to Gadzuric, who had sealed his
man in the low post, for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, Gadzuric deflected a pass, sprinted
downcourt, then found Young for a dunk. Washington closed to 58-56
on Luton's free throw, then Gadzuric gave UCLA a four-point lead
with a layup. At that point, the Bruins unraveled.

BARRIE LIFTS KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Len Barrie wasn't around the last time the Los
Angeles Kings played the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most painful game of the young season when the Kings
lost after blowing a two-goal lead in the final three minutes. But
with just one victory in the last nine games, times seem far more
desperate now.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie, who opened the season with minor-league Long Beach,
recorded the first two-goal game of his career in a 4-2 victory
Thursday over the Panthers, the runaway leaders in the NHL's
Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie's second goal matched his season total. It came in the
second period when the Kings fired 26 shots on Panthers goaltender
Mike Vernon, tying a club record. It also was the most ever in one
period against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   When Jaroslav Modry added a power-play goal late in the period,
the Kings appeared to carry over the solid effort from Tuesday's
2-2 tie against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's victory opened a three-game homestand for the Kings.
It also marked the start of a three-week stretch where the Kings
will play six of seven games at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike three months ago, when the Kings got out to a solid start
that included a strong power play, the offense has been sputtering.
They ended a six-game losing streak last Thursday with an 8-2
victory over Edmonton, but in the two road games that followed, the
Kings went 0 for 7 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers came in after a 5-1 victory Wednesday against the
Mighty Ducks and looked ready to sweep Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:06 gone in the game and Modry off for tripping, Ray
Sheppard rebounded a Robert Svehla shot past Kings goaltender
Stephane Fiset for the game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie tied it less than three minutes later, but the Kings
already were setting a tone. The Panthers had just two shots on
Fiset in the period.
</P>
<P>
   They added only five more in the second, but that wasn't the
story. The Kings peppered Vernon at a record pace in the period.
That tied a club record set just two days apart, Oct. 12 vs. the
New York Islanders and Oct. 14 against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy, who missed Tuesday's game in St. Louis with
continued lower back problems, had three shots, including a wrist
shot that rebounded off Vernon and was converted into a goal by
Barrie with three minutes gone in the period.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear right then that the Panthers might not come back
in this game. Even when Svehla made it a one-goal game with 8:46
left in the third period and Kings coach Andy Murray called a
timeout, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers haven't done well in California the past two years
and it was tough to come back after playing the night before. After
getting just seven shots in the first two periods, Florida's
frustration bubbled over in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Whitney, the club's second-leading scorer with 38 points,
butted Marko Tuomainen early in the third period and drew a
five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered to Barrie, who played two games with the
Panthers during the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of his career Barrie has floundered in the NHL
after being a prolific scorer in the minors. Previous stops in
Philadelphia, Florida and Pittsburgh netted five career goals and
talk that he couldn't play at this level.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jozef Stumpel was sidelined for five weeks after
abdominal surgery, Andy Murray had another idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Barrie's NHL experience came on the third line, better
know for defense than scoring. Murray thought Barrie was playing
out of position and put him on the Kings first line with Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   The results were disappointing. Until Thursday.

NORTHRIDGE BEATS NORTHERN ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was deft in the final minute. But after the
game, that's when Markus Carr came up just as big.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that saying?,'' Carr asked himself. Then, in a moment,
it came to Cal State Northridge's hero of the night: ``Admit it,
learn from it, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr admitted the CSUN men's basketball team had an off night.
He suggested a solution. And no one will forget the way he played
in the final 20 seconds of the Matadors' 69-66 victory over
Northern Arizona Thursday night at Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   Carr made the winning basket, a turnaround jumper from 10 feet,
with 19.4 seconds left, then blocked Ross Land's 3-point attempt
with one second left, preserving a thrilling win in front of a
season-high crowd of 1,369 in CSUN's Big Sky Conference opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markus showed a lot of poise and executed the (winning) play
perfectly,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Braswell was just as impressied with Carr's blocked shot on
Land, the Lumberjacks' best shooter. Land is 6-foot-5. Carr is 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game, to make that play,'' Braswell said.
``He made a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (9-3) has won seven of its last eight games. The Matadors
opened conference last year with a 96-79 overtime loss at NAU in
which they were outscored 21-4 in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, CSUN went on a 9-0 run with less than eight
minutes to play in the second half, and tied NAU (6-7, 0-2) at 61
with 5:19 left. Neither team led by more than two the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between this year and last year _ we lost that
(game),'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN looked well on the way to a loss after the first 10
minutes. Starting center Dan Read was already on the bench with two
fouls and the Matadors were shooting horribly (4 of 15 at one
point).
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hadn't played since a 94-86 win over Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo on Sunday, and Braswell also said a change in practice time,
from 2 p.m. to 11 a.m., may have upset the players' rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably had the worst two days of practice of the year
this week,'' Braswell said. ``(Then) we played lethargically in the
first half.''
</P>
<P>
   After a late first-half run by CSUN cut NAU's double-digit lead
to just three _ 44-41 _ at halftime, the Matadors let down again
and let the Lumberjacks build 57-47 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired play by three reserve guards _ Marco McCain, Craig
Calloway and, most notably, Carl Holmes _ helped propel CSUN to its
final charge.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes had nine points and four steals in the second half.
McCain clamped down defensively on Cory Schwab, who made all five
of his shots in the first half but was only 2 of 5 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, our bench played well,'' Braswell said. ``Carl
and Marco were phenomenal tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN travels to Idaho State Saturday for its first Big Sky road
game, and the first game away from home for the Matadors since they
lost to Texas-El Paso on Dec. 22.

SPORTY MODELS, SUVs RULE AT L.A. AUTO SHOW 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Chris Sieroty 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES-- The buzz as the 96th Greater Los Angeles Auto Show
opens Saturday, Jan. 8, is all about style.
</P>
<P>
   The styling of several new roadsters making their world or North
American debut at the auto show. The European styling of some
American and Japanese sedans making their premier appearance. And
the new, smaller sport-utility vehicles that will roll out this
spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   All told, in fact, nearly three dozen cars, trucks or SUVs will
make their debut in Los Angeles this weekend. The number of new
cars -- plus the hundreds of retooled cars also at the Convention
Center -- indicates the importance of the Southern California
market to the world's auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's show will give the North American Auto Show in
Detroit a run for its money,'' said George Peterson, president of
AutoPacific Inc., a Tustin-based automotive and marketing research
and product consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its climate and love for the automobile, Los Angeles is
establishing its position as one of the premier shows. It has moved
ahead of New York and Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why so many vehicles are making their world or North
American debut in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sports cars premiering at this first major international auto
show of the new year include: the Audi TT Roadster, Acura's CL
sports coupe and the BMW Z8 roadster, featured in the recent James
Bond movie ``The World is Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a myriad of new SUVs on display at the Los Angeles
Convention Center, among them the Mazda Tribute and Pontiac's
five-door Aztek, the company's first-ever SUV. Daewoo also joins
the SUV market with its Korando, along with the Hyndai Santa Fe and
the Infiniti QX4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other cars, including BMW and Porsche, have sex appeal and
that draws them to the display but it's not what people want to
buy,'' Peterson said. ``People appreciate expensive automobiles but
will leave the auto show and buy a sport-utility vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the SUVs receiving the most hype at this year's auto show
is the 2001 Tribute from Mazda. After a five-year absence from the
market, Mazda hopes its new model will become the leader among
smaller SUVs with its V-6, 260-horsepower and sports sedan
handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribute cuts across several levels of the SUV market,''
said Richard Beattie, president and chief executive officer of
Mazda North American Operations, at a media preview held Thursday.
``With the Tribute, we've invented a whole new class of SUV,'' he
said. ``It's more functional and powerful than a mini-SUV and more
maneuverable and efficient than a truck-based, compact SUV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have been at a disadvantage without a four-door
SUV.''
</P>
<P>
   Beattie wouldn't say what the Tribute's sticker price will be,
only that: ``I think consumers will be pleasantly surprised by its
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson says Mazda will find the SUV market a crowded one.
``Between now and 2005, the number of SUVs sold will double,'' he
said. Initially, the new sport-utility vehicle will be sold only in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the price scale, Porsche is introducing its
model-year 2001 911 Turbo at the L.A. show. With a 415-horsepower
twin engine and updated styling, the new 911 will take its place at
the top of the model line when it goes on sale in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2001 911 Turbo is the next step in the evolution of this
legendary model,'' said Fred Schwab, president and chief executive
officer of Porsche Cars North American.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Carlson, spokesman for Porsche Cars North America Inc., said
Porsche decided to introduce the new 911 Turbo at the Los Angeles
Auto Show because 17 percent of all Porsches are sold in Southern
California. California also has the largest number of Porsches
registered in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big consumer show,'' Carlson added, ``so it makes sense
to debut our top model in one of our top markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said the 911 goes from zero to 62 miles per hour in 4.2
seconds and tops out at 189 miles per hour. He said it is the first
911 Turbo to be fitted with a liquid-cooled, rather than
air-cooled, engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Porsche, which makes it an icon, and it's a turbo,
which makes it a really fast icon,'' said Jim Hall, vice president
of AutoPacific's Detroit office. ``It's the fastest production
model Porsche has ever sold and one of the most expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't announced its price plan for the new 911
Turbo, said Carlson. However, the sticker price should be slightly
higher than the $105,000 the German automaker charged for the 1998
model of the 911 Turbo.
</P>
<P>
   A little less expensive than a Porsche is the redesigned Saturn
SC, an updated three-door coupe for the 2001 model year. The only
three-door coupe in the world, the Saturn SC features a new
exterior along with a number of interior improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Trudell, chairwoman and president of Spring Hill,
Tenn.,-based Saturn Corp., said some of the interior changes
include an extensive update in the electronic systems, new security
features and reduced engine noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Saturn's mildly wedge-shaped body and smooth surfaces
continue to form the basis of the distinctive Saturn swoosh,''
Trudell says, ``all body panels below the beltline are new on the
2001 coupe, giving the car a fresh exterior appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that smaller vehicles are usually part of what he
calls the ``fashion market,'' meaning they are hot sellers for 18
months and then their popularity diminishes. ``The Saturn SC has
broken that rule,'' he said. ``The new Saturn SC is really
important to the company in terms of volume. If it wasn't a
three-door sports coupe, it would fit into the category of a ho-hum
vehicle.''

RYLAND TO MOVE OFFICE IN CALABASAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Home builder Ryland Group has found its own new
home in the Calabasas Park Centre office complex in suburban Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded company, now based in Columbia, Md., will
employ 100 in its corporate headquarters when it reaches full
staff, spokeswoman Anne Madison said Thursday. The company expects
to take occupancy by July.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 15 of the company's 100 employees in Maryland will move
to Calabasas, about 28 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and
the company will initially employ 40 to 50 people, Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryland signed a six-year, $6 million deal to occupy 32,000
square feet of the 100,000-square-foot building, said Andy
Fishburn, senior vice president of leasing for Kilroy Realty, the
building's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking some prime space, the top floor, for their
corporate headquarters,'' Fishburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The building is the first phase of a two-phase project, Fishburn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison said Ryland chose to move to Southern California because
most of its construction activity is taking place in the western
part of the nation. She said Ryland plans to build 1,000 to 1,500
new homes in California in 2000, and 500 in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made particularly to take advantage of
favorable economic and business conditions that exist in
California,'' Madison said. ``California's really the place to be.
The majority of our housing starts will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The company already had begun its westward trend before
announcing the move of its corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Ryland completed the move of its mortgage
headquarters to Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the company's move was what Madison called
``a larger, talented labor pool in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryland has 12 active projects in California, including the
Hometown development in Rancho Cucamonga. It has completed several
others, including 271 homes in three developments in the Santa
Clarita Valley: Canyon Crest, Hawks Point and Falcon Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ryland plans to maintain a presence in Maryland, with a
corporate office of 10 people, but its headquarters will be in
Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   The company builds a total of 10,000 homes per year nationwide,
Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Ryland deal, Phase I of Calabasas Park Centre is 85
percent preLeased, Fishburn said. The popularity of the first
building has triggered construction of the second phase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishburn said he expects the second building to be ready for
occupancy in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ryland was represented by Jim Travers and Lawson Martin of
Travers Realty, while Bill Inglis and Michael Slater of CB
Commercial Realty represented the building's owners.

IS HE REALLY OFF HIS ROCKER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News    Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig Thursday ordered Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker to undergo psy- chological testing. Selig may
yet dis- cipline Rocker for making idiotic re- marks about
minorities and homo- sexuals.
</P>
<P>
   This is a slippery slope. Rocker, in his recent Sports
Illustrated inter- view, managed to offend virtually ev- ery
minority group in this country, but Rocker does not make his living
on the basis of his opinions and it's not against the law to be an
ignorant pig.
</P>
<P>
   ``If saying stupid things was a crime, there would be no talk
radio,'' notes Globe radio-TV critic Howard Manly.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Milwau- kee Thursday night, Selig said,
``Ob- viously, I've given this a lot of L thought. I'm sensitive
about the L ramifications and I understand the ramifications, and
I'll make my fu- ture decisions based on what I per- ceive those
ramifications to be.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, most of you have prob- ably read Rocker's stupid rant in
SI. Lowlights include: ``Imagine having to take the (No.) 7 train
to the ball-H park, looking like you're (riding L through) Beirut
next to some kid with purple hair next to some queer with AIDS
right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth
time next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing .
. . The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not
hear anybody speak- ing English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese
and Indians and Rus- sians and Spanish people and every- thing up
there. How the hell did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   He also called a black teammate a ``fat monkey,'' and said,
``How bad are Asian women at driving?''
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared several L weeks ago and prompted public
out- cry and a limp apology from Rocker (who has since been ordered
to keep quiet by his agents, the Hendricks brothers). Rocker said
he was not a racist. Now he's going to have to prove to baseball
that's he's not crazy, either. Selig is a firm believer in social
responsibility and it appears he wants to punish the pitcher, but
only if Rocker is deemed mentally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare for a pro athlete _ one not under arrest _ to be
ordered to undergo psychological testing. In L 1986, the Red Sox
ordered Oil Can Boyd to be examined by a psychia- trist. Two years
later, when Wade Boggs went on television and told the world he was
addicted to sex, the Can asked, ``Who needs the psychia- trist
now?''
</P>
<P>
   There is some disagreement re- garding the Players Association's
L role in the Rocker edict. The com- missioner's release said the
order was issued ``following consultation with the Major League
Baseball L Players Association,'' but PA execu- tive Gene Orza said
the organization did not authorize the release.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Selig said, L ``There's no question about that
(con- sultation with the Players Associ- ation) and I don't think
you'll see any more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   What now? It's one thing to L dump Wil Cordero when he beats his
wife. It's logical to dump Christian Peter when his record of
crimes against women is disclosed. An-L nouncers Jimmy the Greek
and Ben Wright lost their jobs because of comments that were deemed
racist or sexist. But Rocker is not an an- nouncer and he hasn't
committed any crime. Baseball found it difficult to dump Reds owner
Marge Schott for saying that Hitler was a swell guy.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Rocker needs some L help. Sadly, he said things that
a lot of other people think and say in pri- vate, but few
individuals are stupid enough to go public with such trash.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have turned the case over to Major League Baseball.
At- lanta team president Stan Kasten said his first inclination was
to re- lease Rocker, but Braves executives met with the pitcher and
said he was extremely contrite. Rocker has re- portedly started
calling teammates to apologize. During his years in the minors, he
lived with at least three players who would qualify as ``for-
eigners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Players Association is also on thin ice. The PA normally
fights all fines and suspensions, but this is a case in which an
association mem- ber has offended just about everyone in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Rocker will be shunned. He should at
least do some serious community service with the disenfranchised.
And may- be he should swallow a 100-mile-per- hour comebacker off
the bat of Sam- my Sosa (one of those ``Spanish peo- ple'').
</P>
<P>
   Kasten is the son of Nathan Kas-H ten, who was hauled out of his
native Poland in 1939 and ordered to build a concentration camp
called There-H sienstadt. He worked in the camps for six years and
carried bodies to the incinerator at Auschwitz. Of the 53 Kastens
taken to camps, Nathan Kasten was the only survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Nathan's son said this about John Rocker:
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time he goes to New York, he needs to take a trip to
the Statue of Liberty.''

   No defense.
</P>
<P>
   There was no defense for the way the Bruins played Thursday
night against the Carolina Hurri- canes at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   There was no defense, literally, played at any time. There was
no de- fense for the turnovers, the hideous passing, the missed
coverage. There was nothing redeemable about this contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins stunk out the joint, folks. They only lost, 7-3, but
it was every bit as disgraceful as the 9-3 loss to Chicago Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   After an ugly but convincing win over the Islanders Tuesday, the
Bru- ins said all the right things about trying to build on it
after the victory ended a seven-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the drop of the puck there was no emotion from this club
at all,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``Why, I don't know. Three goals
used to win us hockey games. It's not the question of winning or
losing hockey games, it's the way you're losing. It just sickens
your stomach. They were all over us. They were completely all over
us. We looked like we were standing still.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes took a 1-0 lead on a goal by Martin Gelinas at
5:59 of the first. After stoning the Bruins at the other end,
Carolina made it 2- 0 at 13:05 on a strike by right wing Sami
Kapanen.
</P>
<P>
   As shaky as the Bruins looked in their end, they stormed back to
tie it on goals six seconds apart. Team personnel couldn't confirm
if it was a club record, but the league record for back-to-back
goals is four sec- onds, shared by four teams.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Murphy pulled the Bruins to within 2-1 with a power-play
goal at 17:32. Anson Carter tied it with an unassisted goal when he
lost the faceoff, got the puck back, and beat Arturs Irbe for his
16th tally of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building on that mo- mentum and hunkering down on de-
fense, the Bruins got even worse in their zone, which didn't seem
possi- ble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that would carry right over,'' said Burns. ``It was
a hell of a goal. We bust down the ice and put ourselves back in
the game. But our second periods have just been hid- eous, awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 36 seconds into the middle period, left wing Gary Roberts L
worked a give-and-go with center Jeff O'Neill. O'Neill, in the left
circle, relayed the puck to Roberts and the confused Bruins defense
stood there while Roberts just tapped it in for the 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rallied to tie it at 3:36 on Kyle McLaren's fourth of the
year. Center Marquis Mathieu, just called up from Providence
because of an in- jury to Joe Hulbig, beat Robert Kron in the right
circle. Antti Laak-H sonen got the puck and relayed it back to
McLaren at the right point. McLaren's shot pinballed its way into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   At 14:18, the Hurricanes went ahead for good on Paul Ranheim's
first of two goals.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams skating four on four, Kron scored at 1:49 of the
third and Ranheim picked up his second at 3:48, making it 6-3.
Defenseman L Glen Wesley, a former Bruin, added insult to injury
with an unassisted power-play goal at 13:00.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said it was difficult to put his finger on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' said McLaren. ``It's frustrating,
to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, trying to keep a stiff up- per lip amid the chaos and
turmoil, said he wasn't devastated by the out- come, just unhappy.
If this keeps up, devastated likely isn't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our home games have been hor- rendous. We are not masters of
our own building,'' said the coach. ``We let other teams take
advantage of us, we let other teams outhit us, other teams come in
here and are comfort- able. When the opposing team comes in and
feels fine about playing in the FleetCenter, that's not a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many good signs anywhere at the moment.

 MAVERICKS OWNER-TO-BE KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN

Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On paper Monday, Mark Cuban lost almost $600 million in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   How did he lament the loss? A few hours later he went out and
agreed to pay $280 million for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cuban must take stock of a Mavericks franchise that has been
the laughingstock of the NBA for nearly a decade. And for starters,
he must determine who is going to coach this team next season.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the possible candidates likely will include Iowa's
Steve Alford, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, Denver assistant coach John
Lucas, New York Knicks assistant coach Don Chaney, former NBA coach
Del Harris, and Isiah Thomas, who helped build the Toronto Raptors
and currently is the commissioner of the Continental Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, a graduate of Indiana University, said he's going to wait
until after the season to hire a new coach. Even though Alford,
Thomas and Krzyzewski all have IU connections, that doesn't
necessarily mean one of them will be the next Mavericks coach,
Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I've ever met Isiah is when he put a move on me
playing basketball at IU,'' Cuban said. ``And I'm still looking for
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isiah wouldn't know me if he saw me. The Raptors have a lot
better IU connections than anything I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford, a former Mavericks player, helped put Southwest Missouri
State on the map before moving on to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met Steve, but I don't know him,'' Cuban said. ``It's not
even something I'd really consider at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he also won't consider hiring another IU alumni,
Quinn Buckner, as the Mavericks coach. Buckner, a friend of
Cuban's, coached the Mavericks to a 13-69 record during the 1994-95
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said it's not a definite that Mavericks coach//general
manager Don Nelson will be back next season as the team's GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the conversations I have with
Nellie,'' Cuban said. ``We've got to feel each other's pulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no definites; there's no anything at this point
and time, because I don't know enough. I can't just walk in and
say, `OK, let's just change everything, or let's plan for next
season already,' because I haven't educated myself on enough stuff
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has two years left on his contract as the Mavericks'
general manager, with one year at the Mavericks' option.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has already had a two-hour meeting with Nelson, and
likewise with Terdema Ussery, the Mavericks president and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Terdema and I like Terdema; he's a great guy,'' Cuban
said. ``He's a quality guy, but I don't know anybody yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Cuban doesn't know anybody, he said he's not going
to make changes just for the sake of making changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, who has had Mavericks season tickets since 1994, said he
wants to make the game fun again for the fans. Minority owner Frank
Zaccanelli, who is trying to decide whether to sell his 3 percent
stake in the Mavericks, said he has no doubt Cuban will turn the
Mavericks into a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've seen and heard over the last three days leads
me to believe Mark is doing all of the right things,'' Zaccanelli
said. ``I know he's going to do everything in his powers to bring a
winner to Dallas, and he's going to make everyone who is a fan of
the Dallas Mavericks very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is an owner with deep pockets, much like Portland owner
Paul Allen. He also will be a hands-on owner, much like the
Cowboys' Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe from a geek perspective, yeah, I've got some
Paul Allen in me,'' Cuban said. ``From a money perspective, you can
make that comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a Portland Trail Blazers perspective, and the way he
brought those players in, amen. If I can do the same things that he
did and bring in those type of players, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
Money is not the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper is also expected to have a position in the
Mavericks front office. However, Cuban said he has yet to decide
what that will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are moving along at a turtle's pace as
everybody figures things out,'' Cuban said. ``I haven't had a
chance to talk to people to see exactly what his role is going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Cuban is just tired of the jokes about the
Mavericks being the worst pro sports team of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 90s are gone,'' Cuban said. ``It might take a year to turn
it around, it might take two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't buy this team for the money. I did this to win.
Maybe I'll end up being a moron, and people will think I'm a fool.
But I'm going to give it everything I've got, and I'm going to
learn everything that I can.'' nn

 NO. 22 TULSA MAKES TCU OFFENSE DISAPPEAR (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By ARTHUR GARCIA c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Scoring 130 points against the likes of
North Texas and Grambling State is one thing. Playing against No.
22 Tulsa is something else.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs' scoring revival ended two games after it
started, as Tulsa came into Daniel-Meyer Coliseum and put on a
clinic at both ends of the court. The Golden Hurricane, deliberate
on offensive and tenaciously guarding the basket, humbled the
Frogs, 94-73, in the Western Athletic Conference opener for both
teams before a season-high 5,260 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane (14-1, 1-0) players passed and passed and passed
until they found an open shot, which usually found the bottom of
the net. Brandon Kurtz, a 6-foot-10 Tulsa center, did the most
damage, dropping in nine of 11 shots for 21 points, but he wasn't
the only one knocking them down. Eric Coley was 9-of-13, David
Shelton 8-of-11 and Marcus Hill 6-of-10. As a team, Tulsa connected
on 39 of 63 (61.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an excellent ballclub and they proved that
tonight,'' Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said. `'I'm disappointed with
the team. I didn't feel we really battled.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU (9-7, 0-1) never found the rhythm or the easy baskets that
were so plentiful in its past two outings. The Frogs, who have lost
three of their past five home games, needed an Estell Laster jumper
in the last minute of the first half to avoid their lowest-scoring
half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't prepared to run our offense the way it needs to be
run,'' said Tubbs, who has now lost four regular-season home games
for the first time at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' full-court trap failed to produce timely turnovers,
as Tulsa's guards calmly broke the pressure. The Hurricane finished
with 20 turnovers, but had only five when the game was decided in
the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a team that for the most part gets off to a good
start,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``That was the case tonight,
and TCU was never able to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs fell behind 14-7 four minutes into the game as Tulsa
made six of its first seven shots. TCU got as close as 14-12, but
the visitors quickly got their advantage into double figures.
Tulsa's hot shooting eliminated the Frogs' fast break, their
offensive staple, and turned the game into TCU's Achilles' heel, a
halfcourt affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun when they're making shots and you're missing,''
said Laster, who topped TCU with 19 points. ``It alters tempo, and
it alters momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU did make some mini-runs at Tulsa in the first half, the last
to get the lead down to nine (35-26) on Myron Anthony's layup with
four minutes left in the half. Tulsa, however, scored the next 10,
effectively settling the outcome before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs didn't get much production from the frontcourt, with
Anthony and Marquise Gainous both falling prey to foul trouble.
Anthony looked frustrated after picking up two early charges and
wasn't the force he has been in recent games. He had a quiet 12
points and 13 rebounds _ his fifth consecutive double-double _ and
fouled out with 3:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs did point out that Anthony and Laster played hard, but
``we also had some no-shows.'' Tubbs also said: ``We had no signs
of guarding anybody in the paint.'' Tulsa made 20 layups.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous, the Frogs' leading scorer, was a total nonfactor,
having more fouls (four) than points (three) in 23 minutes. Bingo
Merriex, making his second consecutive start at forward, also had
just three points.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs came in on a high, running up two of the highest
scoring games in school history in the past eight days and suiting
up all 12 players for the first time this season. They left the
floor last night with a number of questions heading into Saturday's
nonconference game at Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use this as a measuring stick on what we need to do,''
Laster said.

FEISTY MAVS CAN'T KEEP UP WITH JAZZ

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A scenario only the imaginative could envision unfolded
Thursday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson, assistant coach and son of general manager/coach
Don Nelson, actually assumed the reins of the Mavericks under the
watchful eye of owner-to-be Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Mavericks' general manager/coach for creating the
improbable scene during Utah's 105-92 victory. The emotional,
48-minute contest included eight technical fouls, three ejections
(Don Nelson, Mavericks center Shawn Bradley and Jazz coach Jerry
Sloan) and an on-court confrontation between Don Nelson and Jazz
forward Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize he's an older fellow, but I'll tell you what,''
Malone said, ``he'd probably be overmatched with this one right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson declined to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Malone chose otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're totally out of line to get into a player's face
like that,'' said Malone, who scored 14 of his team-high 24 points
in the third quarter. ``I think it's a fine line that you don't
cross, and I think he crossed that line. I have no respect for that
in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to apologize for, and I will not apologize to
anybody for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson went onto the court after being ejected by official
Scott Wall with 6:04 remaining in the third quarter. Nelson
objected to Malone putting a knee into the abdomen of center Shawn
Bradley while driving toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Malone defended his physical play by saying ``I know when a guy
is going to block my shot or when he's going to commit a hard
foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The collision forced Bradley to leave the game, but he returned
later. Nelson and Malone engaged in a verbal exchange before the
coach bumped the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have to jump on his back and hold him
down,'' Donnie Nelson said of his father. ``That's what he is. He's
a competitor, and he's feisty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who trailed by only three points after three
periods, matched their coach's feistiness on the court before the
Jazz put the game away with a 34-point fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed,'' Sloan said. ``We kept our concentration. That's
been our biggest problem all year. We're not a very good team when
we lose our concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, who has agreed to purchase controlling interest in the
franchise for $280 million, watched the Mavericks extend their home
losing streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance at the end, and we didn't come through,''
guard Erick Strickland said. ``That's the way it's been going.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley led the Mavericks with 30 points, Dirk
Nowitzki added 24, and Cedric Ceballos scored 21. But the
injury-depleted Mavericks received only seven points from their
bench while playing with a seven-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just were not able to sustain it,'' Donnie Nelson said.
``The guys were dragging out there and just lost momentum toward
the end. I thought that we played hard for 45 minutes.'' nn

BARRIE GOOD WIN FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The game looked easy Thursday night when Len
Barrie was scoring goals and the Los Angeles Kings were taking
shots at a record pace. The important stuff happened later, when
they were challenged to fight. And maintain their focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 4-2 victory over the Florida Panthers was much harder
than it appeared. It always is when a team has just one victory in
its past nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie had given the Kings the lead with his first two-goal game
of his journeyman career. The Kings tied a club record with 26
shots in the second period. But the game actually seemed to turn
when the Staples Center crowd of 14,114 shifted its attention to a
huge fight in the stands midway through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was some yelling behind the Panthers' bench between
players and fans. Security guards were just breaking up the first
brawl when the second altercation took off.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings watched it all and then watched the Panthers, the
runaway leader in the Southeast Division, make it a one-goal game
when Robert Svehla scored midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a position where we play six of our next seven at
home,'' captain Rob Blake said. ``Getting off on the right foot
means a lot. We've got a chance to get back on track and we needed
to stay strong at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was Blake doing going off with a penalty after mixing it
up with Panthers' enforcer Peter Worrell with three minutes left
and the Kings leading by a goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Worrell did what he is supposed to do, go after our best
player and try to get him out of the game,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said. ``You don't see Peter Worrell on the ice in the final
3{ minutes in the game unless he is doing that. But we survived.
We'll see what it means down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray could breathe easier after Glen Murray added an empty-net
goal with 35 seconds remaining. But a critical stretch has just
begun. Five of their next six games are at home, but all are
against playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Kings were playing a team that wiped out the
Mighty Ducks 5-1 the night before. They have a 13-point lead over
Carolina in their division, not to mention high-scoring Pavel Bure,
who was NHL Player of the Month for December.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, the Panthers beat the Kings in the
season's opening week with perhaps the most painful game to date.
The Kings had a two-goal lead with three minutes left and lost 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie wasn't around for that one.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie tied the game in the first period and put them ahead
three minutes into the second. Entering the game, he had two goals
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie who played briefly for the Panthers during the 1993-94
season, had talked to Florida last summer, but a deal could not be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there was little incentive when a team tells you they
don't want you,'' Barrie said. ``I'm just glad I could help out
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of his career Barrie has floundered in the NHL
after being a prolific scorer in the minors. Previous stops in
Philadelphia, Florida and Pittsburgh netted five career goals and
talk that he couldn't play at this level.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jozef Stumpel was sidelined for five weeks after
abdominal surgery, new Kings coach Andy Murray had another idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Barrie's NHL experience came on the third line, better
known for defense than scoring. Murray thought Barrie was playing
out of position and put him on the Kings' first line with Ziggy
Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   The results were disappointing. Until Thursday.

 SCIENTISTS REVEAL ELUSIVE ELEPHANT SEALS' SECRETS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The elephant seals and sea lions that swim and
dive for food by the thousands in California's cold coastal waters
have long posed major mysteries for scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Now two groups of researchers have solved some of the puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Using implanted radio transmitters, satellites and
microcomputers, one group has tracked dozens of the huge seals to
reveal the first details of their long migration patterns and
feeding behavior as they swim from their breeding grounds at A &LR; n &LR; o
Nuevo Island near Santa Cruz, Calif., to Alaska's icy Aleutians.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of scientists, using ultra-sensitive molecular
detective techniques, has identified a powerful nerve poison that
killed hundreds of California sea lions in spring 1998 and left
countless others with severe brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The team that tracked the daily movements of 47 elephant seals
by satellite was led by marine biologists Burney LeBoeuf and Daniel
P. Costa at the University of California at Santa Cruz. They have
been reporting on their quest at several recent research meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a year of tracking studies, the Santa Cruz team
found marked differences in the migration routes of the monster
male elephant seals and the smaller females.
</P>
<P>
   The males, some weighing more than three tons, swam directly
north offshore along the coast, where they risked deadly attacks
from voracious sharks and killer whales. And when they dived to the
ocean bottom _ sometimes as deep as 5,000 feet _ they probably
preyed largely on fish such as skates, rays, ratfish, small sharks
and hagfish, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The much smaller females, by contrast, ranged across a far wider
area of the North Pacific during their annual migrations from the
A &LR; n &LR; o Nuevo rookery where they breed and nourish their young pups.
The primary food for the females appeared to be free-swimming prey
higher in the water column _ primarily squid, the Santa Cruz
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Both males and females spend months at sea to feed and build fat
for their bodies. In general, they are at A &LR; n &LR; o Nuevo from December
to March. After that, they migrate north, return once in late
spring or summer and head north again until December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago,'' said LeBoeuf, ``we knew woefully little
about the diving and foraging behavior of marine mammals. We knew
the seals entered the sea to feed and returned at predictable
times, but we knew nothing about what they did and how they did it.
Technological advances in instrumentation, microcomputers and
satellite technology have changed all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A very different and far more numerous species of marine mammal,
California sea lions, suffered a mysterious disaster in May and
June 1998 when more than 400 of them died and countless others
suffered severe brain disorders from a cause no one could
determine.
</P>
<P>
   The creatures, scientifically named Zlophus californianus,
suffered all the symptoms of severe brain disease _ repeated
seizures, weaving heads, muscle spasms, depression and abnormal
scratching. Seventy were treated at the Marine Mammal Center in the
Marin Headlands, but 48 died despite the best efforts of rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute led a
team of more than 25 researchers investigating the disaster, and
what they found is reported in this week's scientific journal
Nature by Christopher A. Scholin of the institute, Frances Gulland
of the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito and colleagues at 14 other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the disease among the sea lions was caused by
the sudden bloom of algae that produced a deadly neurotoxin called
domoic acid, capable of killing the large mammals but proving
harmless to anchovies and other small fish on which the sea lions
prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a very tightly coupled food web to cause such
deaths,'' Scholin said in an interview Wednesday. ``You need the
particular toxin-producing algae blooming just at the right time
... _ in this case it was Pseudo-nitzchia australis _ and then you
need the plankton-eating fish to take up the toxin without harm,
and finally you need the predators coming in to eat the fish _
exactly what happened in the spring of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   That spring was also marked by the appearance of El Ni &LR; n &LR; o, when
Monterey Bay's waters warmed to an unusual degree while freshwater
runoff from the land increased. The runoff and the warm ocean water
may have added to the problem, Scholin said, but so far a
connection between El Ni &LR; n &LR; o and the sea lion catastrophe cannot be
proven.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, some suggestive evidence from 1991, when the
warm water phenomenon also occurred and an unusual number of deaths
was reported throughout Monterey Bay among the pelicans and
cormorants that fed largely on anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were also anecdotal reports of peculiar behavior among
some sea lions, and that alerted us that something was going on,
although there was precious little documentation,'' said Scholin, a
molecular biologist.
</P>
<P>
   To make the connections along the food chain this time, however,
Scholin called on the varied specialties of his colleagues to do
the most precise kind of toxicology, chemical analyses and DNA
probes to identify the algal bloom and to track the toxin levels
through varied fish and mussel species to the sea lions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marine Mammal Center, Gulland said volunteers brought
more than 200 sick and dying sea lions to the center during a
period around Memorial Day 1998. Most were starving and emaciated,
she said, because El Ni &LR; n &LR; o's warm waters had driven the fish on
which they normally feed to colder waters far from the animals'
feeding grounds close to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of their body fluids and the anchovies they had eaten
showed all the signs of poisoning by high levels of domoic acid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rapid and dramatic nature of the 1998 mortality event
suggests that even a short `pulse' of DA (domoic acid) in the food
web, lasting only days or weeks in a localized area, may be
sufficient to kill or sicken marine wildlife,'' the team's report
concluded.

 BLACKS NARROW THE EDUCATION GAP  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   African Americans have made striking gains in earning college
and graduate school degrees during the past decade, according to a
new report by the United Negro College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the steady growth, they still have a long way to go
in closing the gap in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The number of African Americans earning bachelor's degrees
increased 63 percent from 54,996 in 1987 to 89,412 in 1996,
representing a rise from 5.5 percent to 7.7 percent of all college
graduates, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``More progress needs to happen, but progress is happening,''
said Kimberley Edelin Freeman, executive director of the Frederick
D. Patterson Research Institute, which released the report
Thursday. The institute is the research arm of the United Negro
College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans have made even larger gains in graduate
degrees, with an 87 percent increase in master's degrees earned
from 13,144 in 1987 to 24,552 in 1996. The number of doctoral
degrees awarded to African Americans increased 54 percent during
the past decade, from 1,016 in 1987 to 1,569 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   African American women are making greater strides than their
male counterparts, with the number earning bachelor's degrees
rising 73 percent during the past decade, compared with 47 percent
for African American men. Similar strong gains by women exist at
the master's and doctoral levels.
</P>
<P>
   John Douglass, a research fellow at the University of California
at Berkeley's Center for Studies in Higher Education, said the new
figures were encouraging but that more progress is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A higher education degree is becoming more and more important
with every decade, and it is extremely important that the higher
education community continues to make efforts to increase these
rates'' among African Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edelin Freeman said the reasons behind the rise include an
expansion of outreach programs, increased access to financial aid
and affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dramatic gains, African Americans continue to be
underrepresented at graduation time, receiving 7.7 percent of
bachelor's degrees although they are 14.3 percent of the
traditional college age population, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   They represent 6 percent of the master's degree recipients and
3.5 percent of the doctoral degree recipients, although they are 13
percent of the graduate school age populations.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that more attention needs to be directed toward
developing successful transition programs to increase transfer
rates from community colleges, where 45 percent of African
Americans start college work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, educators should create programs to help minority
high school students do better on standardized admissions exams and
to ensure that they take the courses they need to earn a four-year
degree, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many students who have the ability and academic
potential for college work but who do not receive the critical
guidance to apply to college prior to their high school
graduation,'' the report says.

BUCHANAN VISIT TO S.F. BAY AREA TOMORROW OPENS HIS CALIFORNIA 
 CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By PAMELA J. PODGER and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his first California visit since joining the
Reform Party, conservative commentator and presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan will swoop into the Bay Area Saturday for a
fund-raising bash.
</P>
<P>
   The former Nixon White House aide will be feted at a
$150-per-person reception at 12:30 p.m. in a private home in
Pleasanton. He will remain in San Francisco over the weekend, but
is not scheduled to make any public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan will return to the Golden State on January 18 _ after
visits to Utah, Colorado and Iowa _ and is expected to give a
speech on immigration issues at the Nixon Library in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's appearances in California are expected to
energize his supporters in the Reform Party, who say his stance on
trade and economics are crucial to America's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have noticed about Buchanan, and I've observed him
at several meetings, is that he has taken on more of the Reform
Party economic focus, and made it more central in his campaign,'' a
switch from his fiery social rhetoric, said Valli Sharpe-Geisler,
the former Reform Party chair of California.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Dattner, a leading California Reform Party activist, said
many newcomers to the party supported Buchanan in the recent
process of submitting names to an internal governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hopeful sign, and a very interesting opportunity
to build from the bottom up, and build something new for the
American people,'' Dattner said. ``We're going to see how it shapes
out. His statements on trade and lifting sanctions are very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has appeared at gun shows and galvanized the
militia with his ``Lock and Load'' campaign, is a thrice-failed GOP
candidate whose anti-abortion conservatism and anti-trade populism
could draw off votes from both the Republican and Democratic
candidates, political observers say.
</P>
<P>
   His campaigns in 1992 and 1996 hurt the Republican
front-runners, yet Buchanan failed to break out of second-tier
status.
</P>
<P>
   Now Buchanan hopes to win the Reform Party nomination and the
$12 million in federal money reserved for the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Reform Party in late October, Buchanan denounced the
two-party system as a ``snare and delusion, a fraud upon the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically asked in early November that his name not be
included on the California ballot, with his spokesman Neil
Bernstein issuing a statement that the campaign wasn't going to
spend money on a ``beauty contest out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign for the Reform Party nomination, he is running
against potential rivals New York tycoon Donald Trump and former
1980 Independent candidate John Anderson. As of November 1, federal
campaign disclosures show Buchanan has raised about $3.88 million.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials are squabbling over where the party will hold
its August national convention. California is favored by party
founder and Buchanan-backer Ross Perot, and Minnesota is favored by
supporters of Gov. Jesse Ventura, who appears to be leaning toward
Trump and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's task will be to woo votes from the Reform Party
followers who are disenchanted with mainstream politics. But their
wide-ranging views range from militia activists to the party's 1st
Congressional District candidate, Pam Elizondo of Laytonville in
Mendocino County, who describes herself as an ``environmental
healing advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has railed against the World Trade Organization, unlike
Anderson, who dreams of a new world political order that lobbies
for global laws and universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Buchanan will appeal to voters who hold such divergent
views, Bernstein said, ``Pat has a number of stances that mesh with
the mainstream of the Reform Party, in fact the majority of the
Reform Party when you're dealing with the budget and trade
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   While some gun owners hold Buchanan in high esteem, he has
failed to win over others, including Rohnert Park resident Clayton
Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, who heads the 500-member Sonoma County chapter of the
National Rifle Association, said he dislikes the ``nativist'' tone
to Buchanan's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeals to some gun owners,'' Cramer said. ``But his
position on gun control is about the only thing I have agreement
with him on, and he has real hostility toward free trade and fairly
irritating views on immigration.''

FLORIDA'S NEW ROLE MODEL _ TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Down in Florida, where executing condemned
prisoners is a mom 'n' pop operation, the state Legislature just
voted to offer an alternative to Old Sparky, the electric chair.
<P>
   Old Sparky has never quite achieved UL-approved status.
Sometimes the chair works OK, other times it causes blue flames to
shoot out of the victim's skull, which is acceptable, really, only
on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature decided to let prisoners choose lethal
injection. Yep, they can trade Old Sparky for Old Rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that we become more like Texas,'' said Brad
Thomas, the governor's policy adviser on the death penalty. ``Bring
in the witnesses, put them on the gurney, and let's rock 'n'
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   So apparently they're going to execute the witnesses, too. Had
they done that all along, there wouldn't have been anyone around to
gripe about Old Sparky.
</P>
<P>
   STILL TRICKLING IN: The bitter and desperate pleas of the folks
who belong to what might be called the Flat Millennium Society.
</P>
<P>
   The New Millennium, they point out, is still a year away; it
starts the first day of 2001. I thought the worldwide millennium
celebration would suck the wind out of these people's sails, but
no.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal, you 2001ers: Technically, logically,
mathematically, this is the last year of the old millennium. We all
know that. But we don't care. We couldn't wait. We were sick of the
old millennium. Many of us wanted to start the new millennium in
1973, but with the aid of medication we were able to relax and wait
for a round number.
</P>
<P>
   LOST ARTS of the 20th Century Dept.: One recent evening, a man
rushed into the neckwear department of the downtown Macy's. He was
fully dressed in tux and was waving a black ribbon of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone help me tie my tie?'' he pleaded. ``I've been
trying for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Several salespeople huddled, fiddled, twisted and finally
produced,  &UR; voila,  &LR; a long, twisted black ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   They sent the man to men's suits on the fourth floor, where
salesperson David whipped the bow tie into a neat &AMP; natty knot,
natch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that such basic sartorial skills have been lost by
the microwave generation.

   Bills at Titans,
</P>
<P>
   12:30 p.m.,
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, ABC
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where: Adelphia Coliseum, Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Records: Bills, 11-5 (second AFC wild card); Titans, 13-3
(first AFC wild card).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Series: Titans lead 22-15.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last meeting: Titans won 31-14 (as the Oilers) in Memphis on
Nov. 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlook: This could be the most intriguing first-round match.
The Titans won four games in a row to finish 13-3 and won all eight
home games in their first season with a new stadium and new name.
The Bills have won three in a row, including a 31-6 pasting of the
AFC East champion Colts on Sunday. The Bills, who were 5-3 on the
road this season, might have a quarterback controversy. Backup Rob
Johnson, who was injured and lost his job to Doug Flutie last year,
passed for 287 yards and two touchdowns to snap the Colts' 11-game
winning streak. Bills' coach Wade Phillips said Flutie will start
at Tennessee. The Titans are on a roll offensively, averaging more
than 34 points in their past four games

   Dolphins at Seahawks,
</P>
<P>
   4:05 p.m.,
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, CBS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where: Kingdome, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Records: Dolphins, 9-7 (third AFC wild card); Seahawks, 9-7
(AFC West champs).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Series: Dolphins lead 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last meeting: Seahawks won 22-15 in Miami on Oct. 6, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlook: On paper, this game, the last one ever in the
Kingdome, figures to be the worst first-round match. Both teams
backed into the playoffs after losing five of their last six games.
The Dolphins had made the playoffs before they kicked off on
Sunday, after Seattle lost to the New York Jets 19-9 at the
Meadowlands. The Seahawks thought they were eliminated, but then
Kansas City blew a fourth-quarter lead to Oakland and lost in
overtime. That gave Seattle the AFC West title and the third seed
in the playoffs. There will be some intriguing story lines. Is this
Dan Marino's final game? Will Jimmy Johnson return next season?

 &HT;    Mediocrity marks the wild-card round
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson's team lost six of its past eight
games. But he prefers the Dolphins' position to that of the 19 NFL
teams that aren't playing in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt in a while,'' Johnson said. ``We're
in the playoffs. That's reaching one goal. It's not the ultimate
goal, but that's reaching one goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning only once since Nov. 21, the Dolphins (9-7) will
play Sunday in an AFC wild-card game at Seattle (9-7). The Seahawks
also used a back door into the postseason, losing five of their
past six games. Seattle is in the playoffs for the first time since
1988, ending the league's longest playoff drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited for the whole franchise and everybody to be
able to go to the playoffs,'' Seahawks running back Ricky Watters
said. ``But when you lose five of the last six, there's got to be a
bad taste in everybody's mouth. We have not been getting the job
done. I hope everybody feels the same way. If we keep playing the
way we've been playing, is it going to matter? We're going to get
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks and Dolphins aren't alone. In a postseason marked
by mediocrity, several teams will be looking to rebound from
late-season swoons. In the NFC, the Cowboys finished 8-8 after
losing three of their last five games. The Lions (8-8) lost four in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   But Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown insists that none of it
matters in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been invited to the dance, you can take the prom
queen home,'' Brown said. ``You're in the dance. Everybody has a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not much of a chance. No team with a .500 record or
worse has ever won an NFL playoff game. And only five wild-card
teams have advanced to the Super Bowl. The 1980 Oakland Raiders and
1997 Denver Broncos were the only wild-card teams to win world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see what happens in these
playoffs,'' Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``A lot of people
thought that we shouldn't get in and didn't deserve to get in, and
we weren't even the last team to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowest NFC seed is Detroit, which plays Saturday at 10-6
Washington, where the Lions have lost 17 games in a row. Detroit
will have to do it without quarterback Charlie Batch, who won't
play because of a fractured thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which plays Sunday at Minnesota (10-6), has lost seven
road games in a row. The Cowboys haven't won a non-divisional road
game since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Dallas carries some confidence into the postseason.
On Nov. 8, the Cowboys were beating the Vikings 17-0 in the first
half of a Monday night game. But after running back Emmitt Smith
broke his hand, and Aikman suffered a concussion, Minnesota rallied
for a 27-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we go into, we feel like we can play well and win
games,'' Aikman said. ``We're not taking a psychology course this
week to tell ourselves that, 'We can do it, guys.' We know we can
do it. We've just got to go out and play.''

   &QR;  Last meeting: Vikings won 27-17 in Minneapolis on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlook: The Vikings didn't repeat as NFC Central champions,
but they rallied from a 2-4 start to earn the NFC's fourth seed.
Meanwhile, Dallas lost three of its last five games but beat the
Giants on Sunday to qualify as the fifth seed. Quarterback Jeff
George rescued the Vikings, throwing 23 touchdown passes after he
replaced starter Randall Cunningham in the sixth game. Minnesota
receiver Cris Carter has been hobbled by a high ankle sprain, but
George hasn't missed a beat with Jake Reed and second-year
sensation Randy Moss. Moss will likely draw the coverage of
Cowboys' cornerback Deion Sanders.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last meeting: Lions won 33-17 in Detroit on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlook: The Redskins may have drawn the easiest first-round
game, as the Lions have lost four games in a row and may be without
starting quarterback Charlie Batch. Detroit, playing without
retired running back Barry Sanders for the first time since 1988,
opened the season 6-2 under head coach Bobby Ross. But the Lions
lost six of their final eight games to finish 8-8. Batch, a
second-year pro, made only two starts since Nov. 7 after breaking
his right thumb. Batch reinjured the thumb in Sunday's 24-17 loss
at Minnesota. Until losing at Detroit in December, the Redskins had
won 18 in a row against the Lions. Washington is making its first
playoff appearance since January 1993.

 &HT;    Most playoff teams will make major roster changes in offseason
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a long, hard look at this year's NFL playoff teams. Chances
are their rosters won't be the same next season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 teams competing in the march to Super Bowl XXXIV in
the Georgia Dome, all but three could undergo extensive makeovers
before the 2000 season. Only Indianapolis, with just one starter
eligible for free agency, St. Louis and Tennessee figure to have
many of the same players next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins must decide whether to bring back quarterback Dan
Marino, who is nearing the end of his Hall of Fame career.
Buffalo's veteran trio of receiver Andre Reed, defensive end Bruce
Smith and running back Thurman Thomas could be victims of the
salary cap next season. And Minnesota probably will have to cut
loose one of its top two quarterbacks _ free agent Jeff George or
former starter Randall Cunningham _ because the Vikings can't
afford both.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins could make the biggest splash in the offseason.
With one of the league's smaller payrolls this season, Washington
is projected to be $15.4 million under the salary cap next year.
The cap should increase $4.9 million to $62.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also holds three first-round picks in April's draft,
including the No. 2 choice, obtained from New Orleans in last
year's Ricky Williams trade. The Redskins also own pick Nos. 12 and
24. Former Washington general manager Charley Casserly, who was
bumped into a consultant role last year by new owner Daniel Snyder,
deserves much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley put that team in contention this year and for years to
come,'' Colts general manager Bill Polian said. ``Not only did he
get a great quarterback (Brad Johnson) when most people were afraid
to pull the trigger, but then he leaves them with three No. 1
picks. That ain't luck. That's expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins must re-sign several key players, including running
back Stephen Davis, who led the NFC with 1,405 rushing yards and 17
touchdown runs. Fullback Larry Centers, defensive end Marco Coleman
and three starters on the offensive line _ center Corey Raymer,
guard Keith Sims and left tackle Andy Heck _ also become
unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Polian and the Colts aren't in bad shape, either. Indianapolis
is projected to be $13.82 million under the salary cap next year.
Tight end Ken Dilger is the only starter eligible for free agency,
and Indy might designate him its ``franchise player.'' A team then
would have to give the Colts two first-round picks to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, projected to be more than $5 million over the cap,
figure to endure a tumultuous offseason. Several key defensive
players _ linebacker Randall Godfrey, free safety George Teague and
defensive ends Alonzo Spellman and Kavika Pittman _ become
unrestricted free agents. Wide receiver Michael Irvin also becomes
a free agent, but he might retire because of a neck injury.

 &HT;    A grim return to war-torn Sierra Leone
 &HT;    (Editor's note: Hap Cawood retired Dec. 31 after many years as
editorial page editor of the Dayton Daily News. His final project
was this report on his visit with a congressional delegation to the
African nation of Sierra Leone, which has been rocked by a very
uncivil civil war.)
 &HT;    (Photos are available by calling CoxNet at 404-526-5456.)
 &HT;    By Hap Cawood
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The girl is maybe 2 years old. Her
smile sparkles against the backdrop of her more reserved
countrymen, about a hundred men and women, young and old, who stand
as willing displays of a barbarity hard to fathom. Each one has had
some limb cut off by machete.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl doesn't seem to miss her right arm, which was
slashed off a few inches below the shoulder by a rebel, probably a
teenager, one of the thousands of children kidnapped and
brainwashed to mutilate and kill.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is in the arms of a visitor, whose blue cap catches her
eye. Her left hand scoops away the hat and plops it on her head,
and the girl giggles triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   We all laugh; not long, but for a moment. Laughing was the last
thing we expected to do at the Murray Town Amputee Camp in
Freetown, Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   We turned to a grim, pregnant teenage girl, who looked straight
ahead at no one in particular. The fullness of the girl's midriff
was accented by her two arm stubs. The rebels had raped her, then
finished their work with the blade, cutting off her arms above the
elbows.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is one of thousands _ more than 10,000 by one count _
cut apart in a civil war whose killers are supplied, in part, by
the likes of Libya's Moammar Khadafy and Liberian President Charles
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   These victims are what brought me here as part of the entourage
of my congressman, U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio), and U.S. Rep.
Frank Wolf (R-Va.).
</P>
<P>
   I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone in 1962-64, during
that nation's years of early independence from Great Britain. I
knew these people as kind, loving and industrious; I never imagined
the nightmare that would eat the nation alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you could see face-to-face the darkness of human madness
wrought on these people, your heart would ache into your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   If you could see the courage with which the innocent people of
this country endure the nightmare wrought by countrymen who have
failed and betrayed them, if you could see the determination with
which Sierra Leoneans and others struggle to heal and restore, you
could not help but measure your life against theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The victims
</P>
<P>
   If luxury and leisure are your pleasure, forget going where
Congressmen Hall and Wolf go. A few times a year, they rumble
around ditch-deep ruts to places where suffering commands their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   On this three-day trip in early December they would meet
mutilated and starving victims, angry and hopeless citizens,
powerful and powerless lawmakers, and an architect of the killing
who blithely denied everything.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Lynch, Anglican bishop of the diocese of Freetown, gave
us a taste of what he had experienced during the rebels' January
assault on Freetown. The child-soldier rebels, conscripted,
kidnapped, brainwashed, given weapons to assuage any sense of
powerlessness, were further wired for savagery by wads of cocaine
stuffed beneath skin flaps cut on their foreheads and patched over
with a bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch told us how rebels came to his house, where some of his
congregation had sought refuge. After one of them put an automatic
rifle to Lynch's head to restrain him as the rebels carted off
three boys (two were executed), the fear-shaken Lynch went upstairs
to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a spiritual wave of guidance and confidence that still
amazes him, and against the advice of his dumbfounded staff, Lynch
went down the hill to the rebels' headquarters, which was
rollicking with loud music, girls and drugs. He asked the startled
guards to take him to their commander. Lynch said he told the
commander that the people of his church were nonviolent and
innocent. The commander ordered his charges not to bother the
rectory. The bishop's refuge withstood the devastation all around.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less fortunate. In the hallway of the tiny Holy Mary
Clinic, run by a young Sierra Leon his Italian wife and
subsidized by friends, sat girls holding their babies. Some of the
mothers were maybe 13 or 14. Many had been among the 3,000 swept up
and kidnapped in the January attack. Girls over 12 had been used as
sex slaves. The boys had been used as spies, soldiers and
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred abducted girls had returned to the community served
by the clinic. Now many were giving birth. Traumatized, they were
lucky by comparison: Some girls who bore their babies while on the
run with rebels escaping the ECOMOG forces had to see their babies
buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   At the next stop, the National Workshop Displaced Persons Camp,
a bubbling mass of scantily clad little children sang songs of
welcome and peace. Here the extremes of suffering and compassion
roiled in yet another setting.
</P>
<P>
   On the concrete floor of one warehouse-sized building, hundreds
of people sleep. They are fed in lines, given water through
makeshift outdoor pumps, accommodated by latrines a few minutes'
walk away. In another tentlike, dirt-floor building made of plastic
sheets, children are taught. Classes are held in different corners
_ with simple benches, a table for the teacher and a little
blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the pressing conditions, one must ask: What if this
camp were not here? What would happen to the hundreds of thousands
of people without food, water, health care, schools, vocational
training, safety, a place to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   This camp was built and run thanks to the International Rescue
Committee, an American nonsectarian volunteer agency serving
refugees worldwide in calamitous circumstances. About five other
American-aided agencies also helped.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the United Nations provides and coordinates a
lifesaving network of aid from Europe and elsewhere. Governmental
and nongovernmental agencies help rehabilitate child soldiers.
American agencies provide disaster relief and help for rape
victims. UNICEF rescues children. CARE delivers food _ the list
goes on and on, a countervailing force against the more visible and
dramatic evils of the world and calamities of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hall tried to broker compromises so his congressional
colleagues would approve U.S. payment of its U.N. dues. This is
why. He has seen the mammoth and difficult lifesaving work at the
end of the line, in places like this.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful yet powerless
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, led by a truckload of red-beret Nigerian peacekeeping
soldiers, the ambassador's bulletproof car ascended the hill
overlooking the bay of Freetown. We entered the residential
compound of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. Four of us followed Hall
and Wolf into a handsomely appointed parlor, then through smaller
rooms and a metal detector into President Kabbah's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, sturdy and easy in his manner, Kabbah greeted the group
with a soft voice. A retired U.N. diplomat, he had been elected
president, had been overthrown by a junta, then was brought back
after Nigerian soldiers from ECOMOG, or Economic Community of West
African States Monitoring Group, overthrew the junta and put Kabbah
back in place. He is, in short, Sierra Leone's hope.
</P>
<P>
   After welcoming remarks, Kabbah invited comments. As is the
norm, Hall talked and acted with a president or ambassador the same
as he would with a constituent in Dayton: straightforwardly,
simply, politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago I brought a Dayton delegation of 20 people to
Sierra Leone seeking a special relationship,'' Hall said without
raising his voice. ``The delegation included people from the
university, businesses and nonprofits. We weren't just interested
in a visit. The people of Dayton wanted to help make a difference.
When I went back, I helped Sierra Leone get a World Bank loan and
food and medicine. We were received nicely here, but when we tried
to do things, corruption got in the way. And this was before all
the fighting. Frankly, I got so disgusted with Sierra Leone that I
washed my hands of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appeal to you to change that position,'' Kabbah
said, offering thanks for the assistance. Kabbah agreed
emphatically, saying how ashamed he was at how corruption had
crippled the country before anarchy took it down for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   Hall asked Kabbah what help he needed. Kabbah told him.
</P>
<P>
   Winding down the hill from the president's compound, we headed
for the worn Parliament building. Seated at the edge of the head
table facing a cavernous committee room, Hall laid out his power
card.
</P>
<P>
   He described the ``conflict diamonds'' bill he and Wolf are
pushing. The bill would require the origin of diamonds to be
certified. It would ban the U.S. import and sale of diamonds from
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and the Congo, where diamonds
proceeds are used by rebels to commit mayhem. The ban would stick
until the governments got control of their diamonds and declared
them _ by listing them and paying government royalties on them _ so
that income could be used to support schools, hospitals, roads,
services for the people. Some parliamentarians applauded. Others
sounded skeptical, questioning whether this approach could work.
Doubts had been raised in the United States when Hall announced the
measure, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect bill,'' Hall replied. ``It's not a perfect
solution. But it has the attention of diamond miners and dealers.''
Hall then told them he had gone to the headquarters of the world's
largest legitimate diamond dealer, De Beers Corp., and De Beers
pledged not to buy undeclared diamonds from Sierra Leone or the
other conflict countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the hurt, the sickness, the killings,'' Hall said in
his closing comments to the mining ministry officials. ``I am sick
of it, and I know you are sick of it yourself. You had minerals and
didn't declare them. With its resources, this country has the
ability to be one of the richest in the world, yet it has made
itself one of the poorest. I hope that I can help. Please let me do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the members of parliament or the Ministry of Mineral
Resources saw Hall and Wolf's offer as naive and presumptuous or as
a hopeful tool for reform, I don't know. President Kabbah saw the
leverage it offered and said he supported it. One of Kabbah's
requests to Hall and Wolf was that they exert what pressure they
can to help the Commission for the Management of Strategic
Resources succeed. Success means getting control of the diamonds
that are smuggled through Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after hearing that conversation with Kabbah, I was back
in Dayton reading an international wire report. It detailed the
Dec. 15, 1999, letter by Wolf and Hall asking U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke to push U.N. sanctions on any diamond mined in
Sierra Leone that is not certified by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leaders
</P>
<P>
   The two main rebel leaders who had been brought into the
government as part of the truce were invited to meet Hall and Wolf
at different times at the ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The youngish Johnny Paul Koroma, the former army major who
headed the coup that overthrew President Kabbah in May 1997, didn't
look like a rebel. Sitting in a small circle of chairs in the
hallway of the ambassador's residence, Koroma was smooth. Pressed
about the atrocities, he said research and history would prove that
the barbarity had been committed by the Revolutionary United Front,
headed by Foday Sankoh. It just so happened that, in the coup,
Koroma had joined up with Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Wolf pressed Koroma on how quickly and thoroughly he
would get his troops to disarm. Koroma said his soldiers were
coming in from the bush as we spoke. The congressmen said they
would look for the results of that.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Koroma, Sankoh _ whose RUF deliberately maimed civilians
to instill fear and frustrate elections _ didn't accept the
Hall-Wolf invitation to meet at the ambassador's residence at the
time given.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh had gotten a similar invitation from Secretary of State
Madeline Albright when she visited Sierra Leone in October,
offering $55 million in U.S. support for efforts to uphold the
shaky peace pact. Sankoh had agreed to meet her _ if she came to
his headquarters. She went.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh sent U.S. Ambassador Joseph Melrose Jr. the same response
to the Hall-Wolf invitation: Sankoh would meet with them if they
came to his headquarters. Hall told the ambassador, ``No. I'm not
here to play games. He knows my schedule. He knows where to find
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, as Hall and Wolf headed for the door to leave,
someone knocked. It was Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's chief of staff, Rick Carne, and others at the meeting
summarized it for me.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, leaning forward, aggressive in manner, eyes alert,
uneducated but street-wise, denied everything. When Hall and Wolf
asked about the atrocities, Sankoh said it was all a fabrication of
a propaganda machine. When pressed about the kidnappings, the use
of young girls as sex slaves, Sankoh said no rebel would do that,
that this would hurt the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh said he wanted peace. In essence, the parting words of
Hall and Wolf were: We'll see; prove it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous and desolate thing to fabricate one world and
kill in another. But people like Sankoh are not the only such force
in the world. In this truth, and in the power of the spirit that
unites and uplifts mankind, Hall and Wolf are absolutely confident
and, if so called, will go to the ends of the earth in its service.

 &HT;    A grim return to war-torn Sierra Leone
 &HT;    (Editor's note: Hap Cawood retired Dec. 31 after many years as
editorial page editor of the Dayton Daily News. His final project
was this report on his visit with a congressional delegation to the
African nation of Sierra Leone, which has been rocked by a very
uncivil civil war.)

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The girl is maybe 2 years old. Her
smile sparkles against the backdrop of her more reserved
countrymen, about a hundred men and women, young and old, who stand
as willing displays of a barbarity hard to fathom. Each one has had
some limb cut off by machete.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl doesn't seem to miss her right arm, which was
slashed off a few inches below the shoulder by a rebel, probably a
teenager, one of the thousands of children kidnapped and
brainwashed to mutilate and kill.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is in the arms of a visitor, whose blue cap catches her
eye. Her left hand scoops away the hat and plops it on her head,
and the girl giggles triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   We all laugh; not long, but for a moment. Laughing was the last
thing we expected to do at the Murray Town Amputee Camp in
Freetown, Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   We turned to a grim, pregnant teenage girl, who looked straight
ahead at no one in particular. The fullness of the girl's midriff
was accented by her two arm stubs. The rebels had raped her, then
finished their work with the blade, cutting off her arms above the
elbows.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is one of thousands _ more than 10,000 by one count _
cut apart in a civil war whose killers are supplied, in part, by
the likes of Libya's Moammar Khadafy and Liberian President Charles
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   These victims are what brought me here as part of the entourage
of my congressman, U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio), and U.S. Rep.
Frank Wolf (R-Va.).
</P>
<P>
   I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone in 1962-64, during
that nation's years of early independence from Great Britain. I
knew these people as kind, loving and industrious; I never imagined
the nightmare that would eat the nation alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you could see face-to-face the darkness of human madness
wrought on these people, your heart would ache into your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   If you could see the courage with which the innocent people of
this country endure the nightmare wrought by countrymen who have
failed and betrayed them, if you could see the determination with
which Sierra Leoneans and others struggle to heal and restore, you
could not help but measure your life against theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The victims
</P>
<P>
   If luxury and leisure are your pleasure, forget going where
Congressmen Hall and Wolf go. A few times a year, they rumble
around ditch-deep ruts to places where suffering commands their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   On this three-day trip in early December they would meet
mutilated and starving victims, angry and hopeless citizens,
powerful and powerless lawmakers, and an architect of the killing
who blithely denied everything.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Lynch, Anglican bishop of the diocese of Freetown, gave
us a taste of what he had experienced during the rebels' January
assault on Freetown. The child-soldier rebels, conscripted,
kidnapped, brainwashed, given weapons to assuage any sense of
powerlessness, were further wired for savagery by wads of cocaine
stuffed beneath skin flaps cut on their foreheads and patched over
with a bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch told us how rebels came to his house, where some of his
congregation had sought refuge. After one of them put an automatic
rifle to Lynch's head to restrain him as the rebels carted off
three boys (two were executed), the fear-shaken Lynch went upstairs
to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a spiritual wave of guidance and confidence that still
amazes him, and against the advice of his dumbfounded staff, Lynch
went down the hill to the rebels' headquarters, which was
rollicking with loud music, girls and drugs. He asked the startled
guards to take him to their commander. Lynch said he told the
commander that the people of his church were nonviolent and
innocent. The commander ordered his charges not to bother the
rectory. The bishop's refuge withstood the devastation all around.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less fortunate. In the hallway of the tiny Holy Mary
Clinic, run by a young Sierra Leonean and his Italian wife and
subsidized by friends, sat girls holding their babies. Some of the
mothers were maybe 13 or 14. Many had been among the 3,000 swept up
and kidnapped in the January attack. Girls over 12 had been used as
sex slaves. The boys had been used as spies, soldiers and
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred abducted girls had returned to the community served
by the clinic. Now many were giving birth. Traumatized, they were
lucky by comparison: Some girls who bore their babies while on the
run with rebels escaping the ECOMOG forces had to see their babies
buried alive.
</P>
<P>
   At the next stop, the National Workshop Displaced Persons Camp,
a bubbling mass of scantily clad little children sang songs of
welcome and peace. Here the extremes of suffering and compassion
roiled in yet anotherg.
</P>
<P>
   On the concrete floor of one warehouse-sized building, hundreds
of people sleep. They are fed in lines, given water through
makeshift outdoor pumps, accommodated by latrines a few minutes'
walk away. In another tentlike, dirt-floor building made of plastic
sheets, children are taught. Classes are held in different corners
_ with simple benches, a table for the teacher and a little
blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the pressditions, one must ask: What if this
camp were not here? What would happen to the hundreds of thousands
of people without food, water, health care, schools, vocational
training, safety, a place to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   This camp was built and run thanks to the International Rescue
Committee, an American nonsectarian volunteer agency serving
refugees worldwide in calamitous circumstances. About five other
American-aided agencies also helped.
</P>
<P>
   In Siene, the United Nations provides and coordinates a
lifesaving network of aid from Europe and elsewhere. Governmental
and nongovernmental agencies help rehabilitate child soldiers.
American agencies provide disaster relief and help for rape
victims. UNICEF rescues children. CARE delivers food _ the list
goes on and on, a countervailing force against the more visible and
dramatic evils of the world and calamities of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hall tried to broker compromises so his congressional
colleagues would approve U.S. payment of its U.N. dues. This is
why. He has seen the mammoth and difficult lifesaving work at the
end of the line, in places like this.

UNDIVIDED ATTENTION: THAT'S WHAT RAISING A DISABLED CHILD
REQUIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Christine Perlinger of Overland Park, Kan., sat down to
eat her bowl of cereal one morning this week, she heard her two
young sons, Brendan and Noah, whooping it up in their bedroom down
the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving her cereal on a living-room table, Perlinger carried her
4-month-old daughter, Gretchen, down the hall to the boys' room.
</P>
<P>
   She found that 3-year-old Noah, a chubby-cheeked bundle of
energy, had climbed out of bed and was playing with his plastic
``Toy Story'' action figures. Four-year-old Brendan was yelling for
Noah to hand over Woody the cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   But Brendan hadn't climbed out of bed because he can't climb.
Brendan has cerebral palsy and relies on others to lift him, carry
him, sit him up or stand him up on his own two feet. This morning
his mom had already unhooked him from the feeding tube that each
night carries a liquid nutritional supplement into his stomach as
he sleeps. Brendan lay on his back, waiting for his mom to help him
make his first move of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-eyed Brendan, a mere 35 pounds, has lived with the tiny
tube in his belly for nearly two years. He was only a few months
old when doctors told Perlinger and her husband, Daniel, a computer
consultant, that their firstborn has cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us he'd never walk, he'd never talk, he'd be in a
vegetable state forever,'' says Perlinger, 33. ``Can you imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   Their lives now revolve around Brendan, who communicates with a
lot of pointing, eye contact and the 80 or so sounds he uses as
words. During the day, while her husband is at work, Perlinger
feeds, bathes, dresses and watches Brendan constantly, as she does
for her newborn daughter. Like any mom with three young ones in the
house, the former day-care provider is in constant motion.
 &LR; brk:Judge not
</P>
<P>
   When Perlinger saw recent news accounts about a Pennsylvania
couple that left their 10-year-old son with cerebral palsy at a
Delaware hospital because they felt they could no longer care for
him, she says she wasn't horrified, just sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought was people can't judge,'' Perlinger, 33, says.
``I'm not saying they were right. But you can't judge unless you're
in their footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local parents of children with disabilities share the
sentiment. While they don't condone what the couple did, they fall
short of condemning them.
</P>
<P>
   As onlookers, these parents suggest that the couple had reached
some sort of crisis, a desperate place that some of them know all
too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I didn't have a child with a disability, I'd
probably feel angry,'' says Janet Dailey of Grandview, Mo., the
mother of 5-year-old Shelby, who has cystic fibrosis, and
3-year-old twin boys. ``But if you know some of the stresses, some
days it really is hard to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional, physical and financial toll of caring for a child
with a severe disability can crush families. These parents learn to
do without _ without sleep, without evenings out, without baby
sitters because lots of people are afraid to care for children with
medical needs. They're all members, as one parent put it, of a club
they never wanted to join.
</P>
<P>
   And there's this grim yardstick: Research often cited by
health-care professionals contends that the divorce rate is higher
among couples that have children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Burnout, which most parents deal with at one time or another,
has even more dire consequences for parents whose children need
their undivided attention 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family has its own level at which it says I can't do
this anymore because this is a constant demand,'' says Doris Weber,
who runs LifeCare Planning Inc., a nonprofit group in Kansas City
that helps parents make long-term plans for their children with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have to be very cautious when we're working with
families to be looking for that, because families are very
reluctant to tell you they are there. By the time they are there
... parents are just exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned to be very cautious in my criticism, because
none of us knows what that endurance level is for each family.''
 &LR; brk:Support and sustenance
</P>
<P>
   It's that stress that often sends parents seeking information,
counsel and consolation from support groups and even in Internet
chat rooms, where parents now can log on and commiserate in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Developmental Disabilities Resource Center in
Kansas City, a clearinghouse of information on disabilities
available to parents and the public, started a chat room for
parents on its Web site last year.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals who work with the families say that simply
reaching out and talking to someone else, other parents, their own
family members, friends, social workers, is critical.
</P>
<P>
   There is a plethora of support groups available to parents in
the Kansas City area, and new ones spring up often. Children's
Mercy Hospital later this month will begin training volunteers to
staff a Parent-to-Parent group for families caring for children
with cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, parents are too embarrassed or uncomfortable
to talk about their own needs. ``I would have a hard time having
empathy for this family, because there are a lot of supports out
there,'' Jenny Hatfield-Reed, who works in the family support
department at the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Greater
Kansas City, says of the Pennsylvania parents who abandoned their
son..MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not choose to look any further when they reached the
end of their rope. What's the old saying? `When you reach the end
of the rope, tie a knot and hang on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Arnold of North Kansas City wanted to throw a lifeline to
other families like hers when she started the Families Supporting
Families group in 1995. She is the mother of 7-year-old Matthew,
who has severe cerebral palsy. Matthew cannot speak, has limited
use of his hands and negotiates his world, including his
first-grade classroom, in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's group, which helps more than 100 families in the
metropolitan area, meets once a month, sometimes over potluck
dinner and often with a guest speaker.
</P>
<P>
   They don't meet to wallow in self-pity. Rather their purpose is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we gather together as parents, there's always someone to
lift you up,'' says Arnold, 32, an administrator in grant
development at the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Institute
for Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Perlinger finds much of her support closer to home,
from her husband, other family members and her Roman Catholic
faith. Often the boost comes from Brendan himself.
</P>
<P>
   After the year of crying and feverish research that followed her
son's diagnosis, Perlinger and her husband decided to think
positively.
</P>
<P>
   No, Brendan can't sit up by himself, can't feed himself and is
almost certain to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. But
his smile is wide when he sits in the colorful choo-choo train
chair built by his dad and plays on his laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   And he giggles when his mother hangs him upside-down, part of
his physical therapy routine designed to stretch his leg muscles.
</P>
<P>
   His parents saw joy in his eyes when he was a baby. ``We knew he
had a personality. I guess that's what kept me going, knowing
something was in there,'' Perlinger says.
</P>
<P>
   It is her sustenance. On this day she certainly didn't get it
from her bowl of cereal. It sat soggy and uneaten all morning.

 &HT;    A quick scorecard of the new wave of game-shows
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If, as TV personality Fred Allen said nearly 50 years
ago, ``Imitation is the sincerest form of television,'' then this
weekend will find TV at its most sincere. ABC juggernaut ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' returns; NBC and CBS debut their own
game shows, trying to jump-start the same kind of pop-culture
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who isn't admitting to being a copycat is a liar,''
admits Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, with unusual
candor for a TV exec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's running to copy (`Millionaire'), and we are,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television and the game show are made for each other,'' says
Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television. ``The miracle is it didn't happen a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit _ or blame _ ``Millionaire,'' the fuse that set off the
explosion. When it debuted in August, it was seen as a cheap summer
substitute program. By its second run in November sweeps, it was a
national obsession, seen by more than half the country at least
once, averaging 24 million viewers and knocking off top 10
stalwarts such as ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America didn't fall in love with the game show,'' says
Thompson. ``It fell in love with this particular game show.''
</P>
<P>
   Four game shows in prime time will be the most since the early
'60s. Although the quiz show scandals of 1958-59 wiped most of them
out, panel shows such as ``What's My Line?'' and ``I've Got a
Secret'' remained popular.
</P>
<P>
   Now, networks see game shows as quick fixes for their scheduling
problems. And like newsmagazines, which proliferated in recent
years (and now are mostly seeing their audience drop away), game
shows are much cheaper to produce than sitcoms or dramas, even with
the money they give away.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's convergence is just part of the story, though.
This summer, CBS will run ``Survivor,'' in which 16 regular folks
will be stranded on a desert island in the South Pacific, then vote
to eliminate each other one by one, with the winner at the end
getting $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardy!'' and ``Wheel of Fortune'' continue to rank as the
most popular syndicated shows, and ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' on
Comedy Central has the best categories (``Keep Your Hands Off My
Falkland Islands,'' ``50 Ways to Leave Your Louvre'').
</P>
<P>
   Even Game Show Network, a small cable channel with limited
distribution, is building a cult following with its
``Inquizition,'' a laughably cheap ($500 for first place) but
fast-moving and addictive show in which a mysterious host, whose
face is never seen, fires rapid questions at a panel of citizens
and mocks them as they are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone loves the current trend. ``Game shows are just
white noise in life,'' says Harry Knowles, Web master of the
entertainment site Ain't It Cool News. ``They create the desire to
get rich quick. By making the game easy and the prize value high,
(they) create a feeling of success and self-esteem in the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, audiences and advertisers love them, says Allen
Ginsberg, executive vice president of media for the Atlanta-based
ad agency BBDO South. Even though he predicts that ``the majority,
if not all, of the imitators will stumble or fail,'' he admits he
could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had put Regis (Philbin) in front of me six months
ago,'' Ginsberg says, ``I wouldn't have thought that was going to
be a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, of the Center for the Study of Popular Television,
agrees that the current mania may quickly fizzle, including,
possibly, ``Millionaire.'' ABC executives have agonized over how to
best use their unexpected hit, fearing that audiences would burn
out on it quickly as a regular series. But that's what
``Millionaire'' becomes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of game shows is that once you're tired of them,
there's nothing the network can do to bring you back,'' says
Thompson. ``With a drama like `ER,' it can be fixed or beefed up if
it starts to lag. With a game show, it is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC may have won the November sweeps with ``Millionaire,'' but
it didn't use the show to launch a single new series, and in fact
pre-empted shows such as ``Sports Night'' that are having trouble
building an audience. Such herky-jerky scheduling angers viewers _
why should they commit to a show if the network won't? _ even if
those viewers are flocking temporarily to game shows.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the big networks _ their reason for being _ is
still entertainment series, the dramas and comedies that run for
years. Viewers are amazingly loyal to these TV families. In the
long run, the current craze for game shows may hurt the very
networks that are rushing them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWENTY ONE''
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Maury Povich
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC's ``Twenty One,'' a remake of the '50s show that was at
the center of the quiz show scandals (and the 1994 movie ``Quiz
Show''), debuts at 8 p.m. Sunday and has three more one-hour
specials (Jan. 16, 19 and 26). Maury Povich hosts the show, which
will once again stick competitors in soundproof isolation booths so
they don't know the score as they try to reach 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``WINNING LINES''
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Dick Clark
</P>
<P>
   _ CBS' ``Winning Lines'' premieres at 8 p.m. Saturday for a
six-episode run. Hosted by Dick Clark, ``Lines'' is a knockoff of a
British show (as is ``Millionaire'') that starts with 49
competitiors but quickly narrows it down to two people vying for $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . .MILLIONAIRE''
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Regis Philbin
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the show that started
it all, returns at 8 p.m. Sunday for a run of eight straight
nights, then settles into a thrice-weekly schedule on Sundays,
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``GREED''
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Chuck Woolery
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's ``Greed,'' the first of the ``Millionaire'' rip-offs,
settles into a permanent (for now) time at 9 tonight. It has yet to
award its $2 million top prize.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S IN THE MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, if the latest slate of big-cash game shows is any
sign. But will it last?

 &HT;    The rise, fall and rise of a celebrated TV genre
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ June 20, 1946: The Dumont Network debuts ``Cash and Carry,''
the first TV game show series.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feb. 2, 1950: ``What's My Line?'' debuts on CBS, running in
prime time until 1967.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 26, 1956: ``The Price Is Right'' debuts on CBS. Through
several time, network and host switches, it's still on the air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 28, 1956: Charles Van Doren makes his first appearance in
the isolation booth on NBC's ``Twenty-One.'' He is later at the
center of the quiz-show scandal and is publicly humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1958: The game show is the most popular genre in television;
23 of them air in prime time, and during one week, eight of the top
10 programs are quizzes. Allegations that some shows are fixed lead
to congressional hearings. Eventually, most game shows are canceled
in the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 30, 1963: ``Let's Make a Deal'' debuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ March 30, 1964: ``Jeopardy!'' debuts as a NBC daytime quiz
show, with Art Fleming as host, Don Pardo as announcer. The first
``Final Jeopardy'' ever: (Famous Quotes) ```Good night, sweet
prince' was said to him.'' (Who is Hamlet?) The daytime version
runs through 1975.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oct. 17, 1966: ``Hollywood Squares'' debuts, with Peter
Marshall as host. Paul Lynde did not become a regular until 1968.
The original version ends in 1981, but in 1997, a new syndicated
version debuts with Whoopi Goldberg in the center square.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan. 6, 1975: ``Wheel of Fortune'' debuts with host Chuck
Woolery and hostess Susan Stafford. Pat Sajak becomes host in 1981,
Vanna White replaces Stafford in 1982, and by the '90s, numerous
international versions make it one of the most popular shows in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 14, 1976: ``The Gong Show'' debuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ September 1984: The new syndicated version of ``Jeopardy!''
debuts, with host Alex Trebek.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aug. 16, 1999: ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' debuts in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ January 2000: Sparked by the success of ``Millionaire,'' a
second age of game shows begins, with four in prime time.

 &HT;    Trying to get a grip on hammer of the future
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is only fitting that we venture into the new
century with what is presumably the world's first left-handed
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Beside me as I write is a thing called the RIDGID RoboHammer.
RIDGID, the tool purveyor wedded to Home Depot, called it ``the
world's most ergonomically designed hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be noted that in fine woodworking there is little use
for a hammer. Mallets, rubber or composite deadblow hammers, yes,
but nails, the common target of a hammer, are not among our
preferred fasteners.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a hammer is one of the most basic tools in every
household, and since the folks at Home Depot sent me this thing, I
shall attempt to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   RoboHammer certainly looks like the hammer of the future,
although there is nothing Robo about it. You still have to grasp
the handle, lift it and strike manfully with it in order to achieve
any result.
</P>
<P>
   The shaft and the head are more or less one piece of steel. I
say more or less because the head is split and dovetailed for half
its thickness just in front of the shaft. This, presumably,
provides the ``shock-absorbing technology that minimizes recoil and
focuses more energy at impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The shaft is cranked, or bent, twice, putting the striking
surface a bit farther ahead of the handle than on my trusty old
all-steel True-Temper. The lower two-thirds of the shaft is covered
with material that provides a secure grip.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the shaft of the right-handed version, right
where you grip it, a large swelling appears on the left edge of the
back, with a corresponding concavity to its right. For lefties,
this arrangement is reversed.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement is supposed to make gripping the hammer more
comfortable, although I find it no more comfortable than a
traditional hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The RoboHammer is fairly heavy at 30 ounces. Its claw
arrangement seems perfectly standard to me. As with all things new,
a really good test of this hammer would require a lot of use,
because old habits and old comforts are hard to break. I can't just
pick the RoboHammer up and start whacking a nail like I can with my
old hammer because I need to fuss with my grip to get hold of it.
The leaden feel when it hits a nail doesn't make me happy, either.
</P>
<P>
   But then I'm nothing if not a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   The RoboHammer, at ``under $30'' in either left or right hand
models, may be the wave of the future. Who knows _ the left-handed
monkey wrench may not be far behind.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I'm essentially a mid-20th
century Southerner, spoiled by things like the old downtown Rich's
department store, where the customer was always right, where
salespersons communicated from behind a counter rather than reading
a spiel into a telephone, where reason rated above fine print and
when you called on a telephone, you actually got a human being.
Those are some of the things I think I will miss most as we
progress into the new millennium. (Jim Minter is a former editor of
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Voter turnout even in presidential elections has
been dwindling for 20-plus years, and now polls find that although
the presidential primaries are all but upon us, a uniquely large
number of potential electors aren't paying the slightest attention.
The prospect thus reappears of another president elected by less
than half the electorate or even, if the Reform Party gets up a
plausible campaign, of a president chosen by only a plurality of a
minority, a la Bill Clinton. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent
for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Coca-Cola announced that the bottoms of their
new bottles will carry the names of 12 U.S. cities. This is a
return to the days when Coke's embossed city-named bottoms were the
source of playful workplace gambling, much as is the football pool
today. Office staffs can start gearing up. (Howard Kleinberg is a
columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ The recent flap over making firms
responsible for the safety and health of their at-home workers
spotlights how muddled the so-called ``work and family'' issues
have become at the turn of the new century. (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRALEONE _ FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ When her baby is born,
the teenage girl won't be able to hold it. That's because after the
rebels raped and impregnated her, they hacked off her arms at the
elbow with a machete. If you could see face to face the darkness of
human madness wrought on these people, your heart would ache into
your sleep. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone from
1962-64, during that nation's heady years of early independence
from Great Britain. I knew these people as kind, loving and
industrious; I never imagined the nightmare that would eat the
nation alive. Nor did I ever expect to return there, especially
after the last decade of coups and fighting. But life has its pulls
and patterns. (Cawood, Dayton Daily News)

Charlotte's corporate community, art is blooming on an 11-block
stretch downtown. Fancy lobbies and chic restaurants beckon from
wide promenades. There's little retail yet, but with almost 8,000
people living in the vicinity, the stage is set. Folks in Charlotte

   DIRECTOR-JEWISON _ ATLANTA _ Movie director Norman Jewison has
never championed the populist, sure-to-make-money film. ``In The
Heat of the Night,'' ``Fiddler On The Roof,'' ``Moonstruck.'' His
are quality films, and often Oscar winners. This month, his ``The
Hurricane,'' starring Denzel Washington, has opened in metro
Atlanta and it's a role of such drama and power it could bring the
actor another Oscar nomination. We interview Jewison, who recently
visted Atlanta, about the making of ``The Hurricane,'' based on the
real life saga of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the boxing phenom
wrongly imprisoned for two decades on a false murder charge.

   RELIGION-GAYS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ As a gay man, it is no surprise
that the Rev. Mike Castle supported a recent failed effort to
extend the Dayton's anti-discrimination ordinance to include
homosexuals and poor people. Last Sunday(1/2), he invited the
author of that proposal, City Commissioner Mary Wiseman, to speak
to his congregation at Cross Creek Community Church. The
congregation, about half of whom are gay, gave Wiseman a warm
welcome. ``Jesus showed up at city hall, and all hell broke
loose!'' proclaimed Castle. Those who successfully opposed the
amendment would agree that, indeed, Jesus showed up at city hall.
But he was on their side. (Dayton Daily News). 27. WITH PHOTO.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I'm essentially a mid-20th
century Southerner, spoiled by things like the old downtown Rich's
department store, where the customer was always right, where
salespersons communicated from behind a counter rather than reading
a spiel into a telephone, where reason rated above fine print and
when you called on a telephone, you actually got a human being.
Those a of the things I think I will miss most as we
progress into the new millennium. (Jim Minter is a former editor of
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Voter turnout even in presidential elections has
been dwindling for 20-plus years, and now polls find that although
the presidential primaries are all but upon us, a uniquely large
number of potential electors aren't paying the slightest attention.
The prospect thus reappears of another president elected by less
than half the electorate or even, if the Reform Party gets up a
plausible campaign, of a president chosen by only a plurality of a
minority, a la Bill Clinton. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent
for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Coca-Cola announced that the bottoms of their
new bottles will carry the names of 12 U.S. cities. This is a
return to the days when Coke's embossed city-named bottoms were the
source of playful workplace gambling, much as is the football pool
today. Office staffs can start gearing up. (Howard Kleinberg is a
columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ The recent flap over making firms
responsible for the safety and health of their at-home workers
spotlights how muddled the so-called ``work and family'' issues
have become at the turn of the new century. (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRALEONE _ FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ When her baby is born,
the teenage girl won't be able to hold it. That's because after the
rebels raped and impregnated her, they hacked off her arms at the
elbow with a machete. If you could see face to face the darkness of
human madness wrought on these people, your heart would ache into
your sleep. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone from
1962-64, during that nation's heady years of early independence
from Great Britain. I knew these people as kind, loving and
industrious; I never imagined the nightmare that would eat the
nation alive. Nor did I ever expect to return there, especially
after the last decade of coups and fighting. But life has its pulls
and patterns. (Cawood, Dayton Daily News)

at Albany International Airport hope to duplicate that success when
the airline begins service in early May. By KERI P. MATTOX.

   WASHINGTON _ Russia remains a fragile democracy, as evidenced by
the message Acting President Vladimir Putin felt compelled to
deliver in televised remarks to his country as 1999 became 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming power from Boris Yeltsin following the old man's
abrupt retirement on Dec. 31, the 47-year-old Putin began the
traditional New Year's address from the Kremlin with a chilling
warning: Anyone who might perceive a power vacuum and take
advantage of it by violating the constitution would be ``decisively
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   To Western ears, it sounds ominous. But in Russia, with its long
history of tsars and communist dictators, they like their leaders
hard. Tough words are particularly welcome after the past decade of
wearying political and economic upheaval, rampant corruption and
the ailing Yeltsin's absences.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of talk that got Putin where he is today, and has
made the former KGB spy and domestic security chief the most
popular Russian politician since Yeltsin stood atop the tanks in
1991 and led the democratic reformers toward the break-up of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Putin need not worry about coups, at least not now. He has
inherited the vast powers of the Russian presidency, what amounts
to a throne under the current Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Putin enjoys unprecedented popularity after four months as prime
minister while leading the popular and brutal war against the
breakaway republic of Chechnya. Now, as acting president, he is
almost certain to win the presidential election in March with a
mandate to steer Russia where he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin's agenda for Russia appears to consist of two
basic components: stability for Russia and power for himself.
Ideology does not figure in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Soviet Union's collapse, there is a
sense in Russia of optimism and national purpose. The notion of
Russia's obligatory choice between its communist past and a
democratic future has been supplanted by a strong patriotism,
embodied in Putin, that says Russia can choose its own middle
course free of Western advice or influence.
</P>
<P>
   Putin reflected that thinking in a political treatise he
published last month: ``For perhaps the first time in the past 200,
300 years, we face a real threat of becoming a second- or
third-rate state. To avoid this, we need an enormous concentration
of the nation's intellectual, physical and moral forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will do it for us,'' he concluded. ``Everything depends
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tract, published and placed on an Internet Web site, is
short on specifics of how Putin intends to achieve Russia's
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   His first priority is power, and consolidating his image as a
national leader in the face of creeping setbacks in recent weeks in
the war in Chechnya and continuing economic woes across Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's image-makers were hard at work in the first week of his
presidency seeking to sustain the high public approval rating he
gained since he was appointed prime minister in August.
</P>
<P>
   His tough talk was supplemented with humane and empathetic
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in the new millennium _ thanks to the devotion of
people like you _ humankind will be gentler and more courageous.
That means taking greater care of the weak and defenseless,'' he
said in a televised address. ``I think politicians should listen
more closely to the alarm signals you are sending.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually stern Putin also conceded in another interview last
week that he had struggled to fight back tears when Yeltsin, 68,
announced his resignation. Putin said Yeltsin reminded him of his
own father, who was reluctant to retire from his job as a factory
foreman until forced to quit at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, along with the political treatise, are designed to
expand Putin's range and depth as a politician. His popularity has
come almost solely from the war against the Islamic separatists in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   His rapid and unexpected rise to become world leader is not
necessarily a good thing in the short term for Russian democracy.
The coming presidential elections will not be a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's surprise resignation triggered early elections set for
March 26 (rather than mid-summer, when Yeltsin's term was scheduled
to end), giving Putin a clear advantage over his primary rivals,
who include: Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov; Grigory
Yavlinsky, of the pro-reform Yabloko party; former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov; and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant
nationalist politician.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will benefit from his incumbency, positive coverage on
Russia's state-controlled media and the financial backing of a
corps of business tycoons _ the so-called ``oligarchs'' _ that
aided Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Putin's much publicized firing last week of Yeltsin's
daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, from the Kremlin staff, and the
re-assigning of other top aides, the changes were more cosmetic
than substantial, many Russia analysts believe. It served to
distance Putin from the unpopular and scandal-tainted crowd who
steered Yeltsin's presidency. But the Kremlin inner-circle
``created Putin from zero'' and he will need them to win the
election, noted Andrei Piontkovsky, director of the Center for
Strategic Studies in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky last week sounded like a man fully expecting to lose.
``Right now, it isn't serious to speak about anybody other than
Putin winning the election,'' Yavlinsky told a radio interviewer.
``But if we ever want to change things for the better in our
country, if we want to preserve openness and democracy, other
people also must run in the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is an unpredictable place. Over the next 11 weeks of the
campaign, Putin could fall as fast as he rose to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely. Putin and the Kremlin have fashioned a
winning combination of power, patriotism and the political
organization Yeltsin relied upon to win reelection in 1996 and
retain his office during the depths of unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Putin offers something Russians have been yearning for:
a leader whom they can feel good about, and an articulated policy
that promises no great highs and risks no new lows. That may be the
kind of breather Russia's shaky democracy needs to survive in the
long run.

&HT;     A BIG PICTURE IS BURIED SOMEWHERE IN LENGTHY `MAGNOLIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's in the humble opinion of this narrator that strange
things happen all the time,'' intones the stentorian male
voice-over to ``Magnolia,'' and if ``strange things'' include
three-hour movies with wacko Biblical climaxes, he's right. There
are stranger films, and there are better ones, but few take
strangeness to such tragic depths. And few involve airborne frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' is writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up
to ``Boogie Nights,'' that breathless merry-go-round masquerading
as a movie about the porn industry. It's only his third feature _
his first was ``Hard Eight,'' a simple, gripping tale of gamblers _
and Anderson's gifts are already so well-formed that he's managed
to develop a few bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   One is the urge to stuff everything he thinks and feels, every
last Faulknerian twitch, into a single strand of celluloid. Among
other things, the film offers discourses on life, death, childhood,
parenthood, cancer, suicide, love, hate, infatuation, addiction,
celebrity, obscurity, intelligence, stupidity, prophecy, destiny,
Exodus, coincidence, regret and the past.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is fascinating, bits of it are flecked with genius
and some of it actually coheres. Much does not.
</P>
<P>
   The result is as maddening as it is impressive, a failure of
such insanely grand ambitions that it still comes closer to pure
art (and giddy revelation) than movies with more modest goals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a virtual hit parade of tragic characters. Not content to
focus on one or two protagonists, ``Magnolia'' gives us a young
woman (Melora Walters) addicted to coke; her lonely swain, an
earnest cop (John C. Reilly); her estranged father (Philip Baker
Hall), an iconic quiz-show host who's dying of cancer; a wan little
boy (Jeremy Blackman) who's an ace contestant on the icon's show; a
pathetic, lonely, has-been ``quiz kid'' from an earlier era
(William H. Macy); a snarly old man (Jason Robards), also dying of
cancer; his kind nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman), desperate wife
(Julianne Moore) and estranged son (Tom Cruise). The latter is a
sleazeball sex guru who pitches a course for wannabe Don Juans
called ``Seduce and Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film leap-frogs from storyline to storyline, finding points
of junction and threads of shared fate that unite at the end in a
loose knot. The many-petaled flower of the title refers to Magnolia
Boulevard in California's San Fernando Valley, where all of the
action takes place, and to the multifold fortunes of life. But in
cramming so many plots into one film, Anderson sacrifices meaning
he sacrifices the potency, intimacy and cohesion of a single human
tale. He uses too many bells and whistles. On too many occasions
his own, ripe virtuosity stands in the way of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes are short (they're really mini-scenes, or scenelets),
the camerawork is splashy (lots of zoomy close-ups), the editing is
sharp and the acting is simply extraordinary _ particularly Cruise,
in a tour-de-force of inspired narcissism, and Robards as his
regret-plagued father.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of undeniable brilliance. A sequence set to
Aimee Mann's ``Wise Up'' (one of nine Mann songs on the soundtrack)
is both hilarious and profoundly heartbreaking. As for the frogs _
you've heard of deus ex machina? Try Ranidae ex machina. Frogs from
a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Magnolia'' is a bit like pressing your nose against
one of those ``Magic Eye'' pictures in the Sunday funnies: You keep
waiting for the big picture to pop out of the maelstrom. Somewhere
in the midst of this extraordinary, infuriating, indulgent
mishy-mash of a movie there may indeed be a big picture, but it
would take more than one sitting to find it. And your eyes might
cross in the meantime.

 &HT;     A FIGURE BEHIND iMAC's SUCCESS DEALS IN TINTS AND HUES  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the designers of the Apple Macintosh were
hunting for that perfect color _ those lollipop shades that
highlight the translucent skins of the popular iMac line _ they
would drive to a small, fume-filled shop in an industrial section
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There, these hotshots of a new era of industrial design sought
the expertise of a former supermarket bagger and auto body shop
manager whose eye for color is fueling a revolution in the consumer
computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Flores, Apple's color guru and the owner of R. Flores Color
Design, is an unlikely industrial design icon.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't take himself seriously, for one thing. His belly
shakes when he laughs, which is often. He corrals his long ponytail
with a rubber band to keep it from dipping into an array of paints,
tints and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, 35, is modest about his role in the growing trend of
converting the beige utilitarian computers of yesteryear into
vibrant, user-friendly fashion statements.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut in 1998, the iMac and its bright cousins have
been topping the bestseller lists, based in part on their bright
cases. Other computer manufacturers, including Compaq and Gateway,
are now trying to play catch-up with their own high-style boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do what I do,`` Flores said of his role in this design
movement. ``I love color, and I love bringing color alive in
products.``
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, designers with Cupertino-based Apple Computer
Inc. will stop by Flores' paint shop seeking his advice and his
color mixes.
</P>
<P>
   The process of how these colors are eventually melded into the
Apple product line is a zealously guarded secret.
</P>
<P>
   But Flores does hint at how he works with other designers to
arrive at just the right color. One industrial designer asked him
to see whether he could match the color of an early morning sun
hitting an office window.
</P>
<P>
   However it happens, the end result is apparently pleasing to
Apple's designers, who credit Flores with helping to make the new
Mac line a success.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Howaarth, one Mac designer, scribbled ``You're a bloody
genius`` on a product picture hanging on Flores' wall. Apple
executives, notoriously closed-mouthed about the company's
manufacturing processes, declined to comment about Flores' role in
their business.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unlikely success story for Flores, who would not
disclose how much he has been paid by Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a keypunch operator, he remembers that he always
played with color, painting pictures of nude women on cigarette
lighters and customizing plastic models with wild hues.
</P>
<P>
   His lifelong love affair with color began during the summer of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   During his shift as a supermakert bagger, he spotted a candy
apple burgundy Camaro as a low-rider pulled into the parking lot.
The driver was a regular customer who owned a car paint shop. After
serving an unpaid apprenticeship and then graduating from a trade
school, Flores managed a body shop in San Francisco. But arguments
over insurance coverage and other administrative chores drove him
to start his own paint shop.
</P>
<P>
   His first solo work was designing and painting business signage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Apple color consultant was referred to him to figure
out how to perfect the metallic sheen of the 20th anniversary
Macintosh, a futuristic machine with a then-unusual flat panel
display.
</P>
<P>
   According to Flores, Apple designers found his take on color
refreshing and unpretentious, and they began working with Flores
directly.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to the company in 1997
brought the iMac into being, and Flores' career as a premier
industrial colorist began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are a driving force in consumer choice, there's no
doubt about it,`` said Chris Smith, a San Francisco industrial
designer and Web consultant. ``Apple has staked their brand on
their industrial design, and the colors are a major part of that.``
</P>
<P>
   For Flores, color is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really see the completed computers,`` Flores said.
``I'm too busy mixing for the next project.``

&HT;     THE WORLD THROUGH THE MAGIC OF PBS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the early 1950s, when television and I were
but kids, there was a popular phrase that had not yet become a
clichi or a joke. Usually it preceded a live broadcast from some
celebrity's living room _ Edward R. Murrow's ``Person to Person`` _
or from what was then considered an exotic locale _ like Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase explained how it was possible to bring millions of
people into Grace Kelly's home or onto the sand in front of the
Fontainbleu Hotel. It was ``through the magic of television.``
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in about 40 years, the magic of television
was again alive on the day of New Year's Eve as I watched as much
as I could of the 25-hour ``Millennium 2000`` on the Public
Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the image was of loin-cloth-clad Maori warriors, wading
ashore from an ancient canoe in New Zealand, or of an all-girl, Big
Band quartet in Prague, singing a Czech-accented ``Beer Barrel
Polka,`` the PBS celebration repeatedly drove home the fact that
television has indeed made planet Earth a global village.
</P>
<P>
   And because the marathon broadcast was interrupted only by
commercials for PBS itself (unlike ABC's millennium presentation),
I was reminded that public broadcasting is truly one of our
country's most precious treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium 2000`` was the inspiration of Zvi Dor-Ner, the
executive producer at PBS' shining star, Boston station WGBH.
Unprecedented in the history of television in length and scope, the
live broadcast was coproduced by WGBH, the BBC and a consortium of
58 nations. According to PBS, more than 2,000 cameras, sending
images through 60 satellite paths and thousands of miles of
fiber-optic cable, were used to circle the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an astounding journey, both visually and
emotionally. Everytime I sat down to take in another sunrise,
midnight celebration, interpretive dance or adolescent's poem,
tears welled up and rolled down my cheeks. During one segment, in
which cartoon-like dancers in white suits and fedoras hopped
merrily up and down on every level of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, I
darn-near suffocated from laughing AND crying.
</P>
<P>
   Since the broadcast, I have searched the half-century of my
over-stuffed memory bank for any other media presentation that made
so clear an oft-denied reality: Despite our diversity and habitual
miscommunication, humanity is really one big family, much more like
one another than we are any other species on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the bank comes close to ``Millennium 2000.``
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast also offered ample evidence of why all the
millennial doom-sayers were dead wrong in their predictions of
violence and disaster. Performer after performer, presenter after
presenter, each woman, man and child faced the PBS cameras and
delivered the same essential message:
</P>
<P>
   Here is my personal gift in honor of THE world. We're all in it
together.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to pick one image that best symbolized the magnificence
of ``Millennium 2000,`` it would be that of an older, gray-haired
Chinese man who performed a slow, graceful dance during the sunrise
of the first day of the new century in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white silk martial arts-like robe and flowing
pants, the man was a striking contrast to the deep green grass on
which he danced. Then, in a move that took my breath away, the
segment's producers switched from a ground camera to one in a
helicopter for the proverbial bird's eye view: The man was dancing
alone at the edge of a mountain top.
</P>
<P>
   I have since learned that the venue was Mount Tai, the most
revered of the five Taoist mountains of China. According to the
``Lonely Planet`` travel guide, it is ``a place where most Chinese
come at least once in their lifetime.``
</P>
<P>
   About 500 years before the first Christian millennium began,
Confucius climbed the 6,600 steps that lead to Mount Tai's
1,400-meter summit. There, he is reported to have looked down and
declared, ``The world is small.``
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years later, PBS proved his simple but
profound observation still to be true _ proved it through the magic
of television.

&HT;     A WILY FOX WOULD LEAVE `MALCOLM' ALONE

<P>
   Memo to Fox:
</P>
<P>
   Don't screw up ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' This sitcom is too
good.
</P>
<P>
   You somewhat choked on ``Action,'' an achingly funny comedy that
got only a handful of viewers (all of whom loved it) before you
pulled the plug. You should have done something to keep it on life
support, if just a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   (That said, Fox must still get some credit for putting that
skewed Hollywood comedy on in the first place.)
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' The show was not
technically listed as a mid-season replacement _ it was always
slated to start after the football regular season _ but you network
folks must be harboring strong hopes for the show debuting Sunday.
That is why it was moved from its initial 7 p.m. listing to the
more coveted post-``Simpsons'' time slot of 8:30 p.m. (bumping
``Futurama'' to 7 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are well placed. We thought ``Malcolm in the Middle'' was
among the funniest new sitcoms in an extremely weak comedy year
when we first saw the pilot way back in July. After seeing the next
two episodes as well, there is nothing to discourage that first
impression.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox does anything well, it is presenting sitcoms with wildly
messed up families (the Simpson clan and the Bundys of ``Married
with Children''); functioning, if not well, then passably in
contravention to social norms. (Ironically, while the network wants
this family to become a touchstone like its Fox predecessors,
Malcolm's clan does not have a known last name, or a hometown,
though it appears to be California.)
</P>
<P>
   Mired in a nightmare season of low ratings and widespread
cancellations (``The Badland,'' ``Harsh Realm,'' the half-hour
version of ``Ally'' and the never-seen ``Manchester Prep'' are
among the others), Fox goes back to its strength once more, and
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) is an average kid, the third of four
brothers. He is a little coarse, of course, but what 9-year-old
isn't? His oldest brother is in military school, his next oldest is
always in fights, and his youngest is usually the subject of some
benign torture from his older siblings.
</P>
<P>
   To Malcolm's horror, and his parents' shock, the kid discovers
that he is no average kid, but rather the astounding brains of a
rather dim family. He possesses a photographic memory and an IQ of
165. When his mom is told he is going to be placed in a ``special''
class, she at first suspects it's because he is slow rather than
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm balks, because he knows being placed with the nerdy
advanced kids _ the ``krelboynes'' (named after the departed
teacher who started the gifted program years ago) _ makes him a
marked man on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm at times tells the story-within-the-story through the
conceit of talking to the camera (not as obnoxious as you might
think). Jane Kaczmarek as mom Lois and Christopher Kennedy
Masterson (brother of Danny Masterson of ``That '70s Show'') as
older brother Francis stand out in a wonderfully bizarre cast of
characters. But it is Muniz who people will be talking about most.
</P>
<P>
   Provided that you, Fox, don't screw it up.

CONNER READY TO RUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ ``I've got a pretty wife, 29 boats, I'm
sailing fast and having fun here. Life can't get much better than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So quoth Dennis Conner, who on Tuesday afternoon gave four
blasts on the boat horn over his compound, startling his crew and
everyone within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   There was no particular reason for the blast. It was just that,
after nearly four months of being largely overlooked on this
waterfront, he wanted to say, ``We've arrived!''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Day 2 of a scheduled 10 rounds of racing to
determine who among the six challengers will ascend to the finals,
then to the America's Cup match in February.
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes had just beaten Prada, the glamour team in this
regatta, by a convincing 1 1/2 minutes, and by midweek the Conner
team was on the move, 3-0, by Wednesday. Topping the points table
with seven races to go.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quarter century ago that the 32-year-old Olympic dinghy
sailor from San Diego was trimming main for Ted Turner on
Courageous in Newport. Sailing the critical starts that year, he
helped spark the US to a victory over Australia, his first of seven
America's Cups.
</P>
<P>
   So much water under the keel since then . . .
</P>
<P>
   But Conner blew his horn the other day to let this waterfront
know that _ far from being the gentrified elder statesman here to
sell a few souvenirs that some make him out to be _ he is still a
scrapper and here to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly more elder and more of a statesman now, Conner was
sounding the attack. Stars &AMP; Stripes, the midnight blue boat built
a bit wider and larger than most this year, had soundly thrashed
Prada _ the favorite of the 11 challengers that started trial
racing last October.
</P>
<P>
   While the extremely changeable weather here creates unexpected
upsets, Stars &AMP; Stripes beat Prada in a traditional race in which
picking the correct side of the course, then choosing tactics _
whether to play wind shifts or cover the moves of the boat behind _
is the match-racing tradeoff.
</P>
<P>
   As Stars &AMP; Stripes was towed slowly into the harbor with its
ecstatic sailing team aboard and well-wishers awaiting at the dock,
Conner stepped out of his second-story dockside office and blasted
the cannon four times across the harbor. Shades of Fremantle: Big
Bad Dennis had it rolling again!
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this America's Cup, Conner is not on the boat
to make the calls. With his $12 million budget _ a quarter that of
Young America's, for instance, and a fifth of Prada's _ he needs to
run the campaign from the office, mostly in the function of dialing
for dollars _ fund-raising calls back to the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm also the one who has to deal with the insurance
company when someone dents one of the cars,'' he says. ``Roger
Pensky doesn't drive his own car anymore, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better analogy is with Red Auerbach. Long after he had
stopped riding the bench in the Celtics' halcyon years, Red was
still the team's driving force, as Conner is the force behind Stars
&AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss him on the boat, really miss him,'' says Tom Whidden,
Conner's best friend of 20 years and still the tactician credited
with almost always having Stars &AMP; Stripes in the right place on the
race course. ``Dennis is still the key to the whole team. His will
is still there driving the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's skipper, Ken Read, describes his boss and mentor's
effect on the team. ``He's the kind of leader who is a real
leader,'' says Read, a J-24 Olympic champion who has won the
presigious Rolex Yachtsman of the Year award. ``He hires the best
professionals he can find, gives us anything we want and need, then
lets us make our own decisions. He never second-guesses us.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trials, Conner was on the boat, largely because
Whidden had not signed on to the team as senior member of the
afterguard. But, says Whidden, who was busy running North Sails in
Connecticut, ``Dennis kept the pressure on. He called me every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Whidden did agree to team up with his old friend, Conner
got off the boat and let the team of Whidden, Read, Peter Isler,
and Peter Holmberg act as the afterguard _ one of the most
experienced in Auckland. And though all agree that the combination
of experience and enthusiastic youngsters in the front of the boat
works to a tee, Conner is not as happy riding a swivel chair. ``I
would obviously rather be sailing than doing anything else,'' he
says. ``But those guys are doing great. They don't need me there,
but up here paying the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes is still a long shot in a regatta in which
budgets range from $20 million to $80 million, in which teams
having two boats and huge crews allows for development and
advancement between rounds. But New Zealand is different, says
Conner, who created the two-boat program as early as 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, a two-boat program doesn't work,'' he says. ``The wind
is so shifty and the speed varies so much that you'd sail 100 yards
and have to change sails. You can't test two boats in a straight
line for very long, which is what you have to do in a two-boat
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this could just be Conner blowing smoke, putting his
spin on matters. Stars &AMP; Stripes is a one-boat program, pure and
simple. It also was late in starting, and the boat had to be
all-purpose, in this case heavier fittings and less refinement than
so-called ``glamour'' programs such as Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sports figures, Conner is somewhat superstitious and
believes in omens. Sail numbers are assigned to boats in order of
when they are commissioned, so when he was assigned No. 55 for
Stars &AMP; Stripes, he believed it was an omen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-five was the number of Stars &AMP; Stripes in '87,'' he
said. ``It's a very positive omen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Conner's career has been, Fremantle will always be
the high water mark. Having lost the Cup in 1983 in Newport, Conner
asked for support from the New York Yacht Club to field a
challenger campaign to get it back. After New York turned him down,
he fielded his own campaign with the backing of his hometown San
Diego Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   At one point as the team worked on development in Hawaii, he
recalled, ``We didn't have enough money to pay the milk bill for
the crew. We had to keep saying, `We'll pay you next week.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But when he did show up in Fremantle with his gunsmoke-blue
12-meter, Stars &AMP; Stripes, the challenger trials quickly became a
struggle between Conner and New Zealand, which was sailing
America's Cup for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Conner came face to face with another brash newcomer to the Cup,
22-year-old Chris Dickson, who reminded him of himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the ESPN cameras whirring, Conner and Dickson became fierce
rivals and mutual admirers. They fought on the water with the
Australian winds and big seas, and in the press center where their
nightly sparring became as ferocious as the big winds.
</P>
<P>
   The largest issue came down to New Zealand's fiberglass
12-meter. All the other twelves were built from aluminum, which
became the preferred medium after wood. The theory developed that
fiberglass could be molded in such as way as to allow builders to
put more of the weight in the center with less in the ends.
</P>
<P>
   The added stability, especially in choppy water, allowed a
lighter (faster) boat to have the stability of a heavier one. New
Zealand naturally denied it, but Conner's line remains one of the
better known in Cup history: ``Why would you build a boat out of
fiberglass unless you wanted to cheat?''
</P>
<P>
   As the showdown between Dickson and Conner drew near, as each
side tried to rattle the other, Dickson made the following
characterization: ``If you got into a duel with Dennis Conner and
he had two bullets in his gun, he'd put the first one right between
your eyes. But if he had just one bullet, he'd be too rattled to
shoot straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Conner quickly cut through the hype by trouncing his
young meancer, 4-1, in the semifinals, Whidden conceded that there
was some truth to Dickson's observation and that it was Whidden's
job in part to ``keep Dennis in his comfort zone. When he's there,
there's no better sailor at the wheel of a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   After the semis with New Zealand that year, Stars &AMP; Stripes' 4-0
drubbing of Australia's Kookaburra was anticlimatic. And before a
huge international audience watching sailing on ESPN for the first
time, Dennis Conner became the best-known sailor in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the day after Stars &AMP; Stripes went up, 3-0, in the
semis, the feeling was loose and casual at the compound. Because
the French had caused a collision, damaging the Stars &AMP; Stripes
stern, the midnight blue boat sits in the shed being fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Read wanders into the hospitality tent, grabs an espresso,
and joins Whidden for breakfast. Conner ambles in, making jokes
about the danger of talking to reporters. He is deply tanned, and
wears the red-white-and blue team gear, the same Canterbury gear he
sells in the Stars &AMP; Stripes retail shop adjoining the compound.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanders into the shop, several tourists crowd him for
autographs. Some get their picture taken with him. It's a natural
gesture for him to put his arm around people he poses with. A
typical hot morning around the Stars &AMP; Stripes dock _ summertime
and the livin' is easy. There's not even a security guard at the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having the time of my life,'' says Conner, who is already
planning his next Whitbread (round-the-world) campaign, not to
mention some Etchells racing back in the States next summer. ``And
right now,'' he adds, speaking of Etchells, ``I'm going pretty damn
fast. Life is sweet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With conference play getting under way this week, it seemed
appropriate to take a quick look at how some of the major
conferences should look in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East has no surprises. Despite the University of
Connecticut's loss to Notre Dame Wednesday night, the Huskies are
still the class of the league. The home loss to Notre Dame proved,
however, that the rest of the conference is starting to catch up
and is close to reaching the on-any-given-night stage where the
Huskies have to do more than just show up to be assured of victory.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's problem _ if it can be called that _ is that it knows
the important part of the season comes in March.
</P>
<P>
   As defending national champions, coach Jim Calhoun doesn't have
the trump card of casting his team into a unit that needs to work
harder to achieve the ultimate goal of winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   No team can play at its highest level every game. Like the
preseason NIT loss in November to Iowa, which served as the first
wake-up call of the season, UConn will find games in which less
talented teams will play above their heads and beat the Huskies _
even at home.
</P>
<P>
   The other Big East power is Syracuse. Again no surprise. Jim
Boeheim's teams always compete. What's unusual this season is that
the team is not only unbeaten, but has yet to play a game outside
the Carrier Dome. The Orangemen will get their first real test
Saturday when they visit Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Big East becomes a free-for-all of teams with
St. John's the best of the rest. Providence might be a team to
watch; they visit Boston College Saturday at Conte Forum. Since
7-foot-2-inch Karim Shabazz became eligible last month, the Friars
have turned into a different team, beating Arkansas and the
University of Massachusetts. ``I hope we don't expect too much of
him,'' Friar coach Tim Welsh said when Shabazz transferred to PC
from Florida State. Too much? It's become not enough since Shabbaz
averaged 19 points and 11.3 rebounds and blocked 18 shots in his
first three games back.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the conferences:
</P>
<P>
   ACC _ Surprise, surprise. Duke has retooled and has not lost
since back-to-back opening losses in the preseason NIT. North
Carolina and Maryland are lurking.
</P>
<P>
   SEC _ Auburn was the preseason favorite and Florida was right
there with them. Nothing has changed. Both are in the Top 10 in
this week's polls. The surprise has been the shaky play of
Kentucky, which is only a marginal Top 25 team. Tennessee, which
won 13 of its first 14 games, needs to be watched.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten _ From bottom to top the toughest conference. How good
is this league? Consider: Michigan State has a 9-4 record and is
still in the Top 10. Indiana. Iowa. Purdue. Illinois. Ohio State.
Try to find an easy night in this conference.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 _ Kansas, the perennial leader, might have company.
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State won 22 of the first 24 games between
them. And no one wants to play an Eddie Sutton-coached Oklahoma
State team in March. Texas, with center Chris Mihm coming to
Hartford for a showdown against the Huskies' Jake Voskuhl, has
drawn the attention of NBA scouts. The UConn sports information
office has requested 19 credentials from NBA scouts for Monday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA _ Cincinnati is head and shoulders above
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 _ Unlike its brethren in football, the conference is
loaded with quality teams. Stanford. Arizona. UCLA. Washington.
Arizona State. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain West _ Utah struggled at first, but with Hanno Mottola
healthy, the Utes should be the class of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic 10 _ Temple and Xavier are the front-runners and
everyone else is chasing. Dayton bears watching.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy _ Penn and Princeton. Same as it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   America East _ Hofstra is the best team. But Delaware has the
home-court edge with the conference tournament being played there
each March. It's vital for Hofstra to win the regular season to get
a home-court edge over the Blue Hens in the America East title
game, which is always played at the home court of the highest
seeded remaining team.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University and Northeastern? Forget about it. It's been a
horrible year for both schools, who play each other Saturday. But
there is a difference. BU has been riddled with injuries, but has a
harmony on the squad that wasn't there a year ago. The Terriers are
in a rebuilding mode and coach Dennis Wolff doesn't have to worry
about internal problems. It's different at Northeastern, where
internal problems continue to smolder with the potential of tearing
the entire program apart. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Cal's next step? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on ex-UMass coach John Calipari. Coach Cal has told
friends that he now is more likely to return to college coaching
than the NBA. Memphis has been courting him for months and that
remains a possibility while Cal spends the season as Larry Brown's
assistant with the Philadelphia 76ers. Money is not a problem _ at
least right now _ since Cal is still getting money from his
contract with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Stability is. Cal has three childern and reportedly likes a
college environment where he and his wife can raise their family.
He also wants to be at a program where he can win. Memphis might be
a good starting point, but by waiting to the end of this season,
Cal can see what college job opens and pick the best offer. He
won't come cheap _ probably somewhere in the $500,000 to $800,000
range per year, but there will be programs out there willing to pay
the price . . . Only three unbeaten teams remain _ Stanford,
Syracuse, and LSU, while there are only three winless teams,
Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Howard, and Delaware State. Since Howard and
Delaware State are both in the MEAC, someone has to win . . .
Oklahoma's 12 wins in its first 13 games is the best for the
Sooners since 1989-90 . . . While the upset of Wright State over
Michigan State was amazing, so is the fact that two of Wright
State's starters were freshmen who each played 40 minutes . . .
Indiana is off to a quick start with 11 wins in its first 12 games,
which could be a sign the Hoosiers are back. But consider this: The
Hoosiers were 13-2 last season and finished with a 9-7 Big Ten
record. They were 13-1 in 1996-97 and finished with a 7-9 Big Ten
record . . . Nice scheduling award goes to FSU, which beat Wake
Forest, 66-64, Tuesday night, the same night the Seminoles beat
Virginia Tech for the national championship. It was a Seminole
night no matter how you looked at it because the FSU win was its
first at Wake Forest in seven seasons . . . Kansas is getting
people excited with its 11-2 start. But as most Jayhawk fans note,
March is the time coach Roy Williams's team is held most
accountable for its actions . . . Watch out for Seton Hall. Tommy
Amaker has things going for the Pirates, who have won nine of their
first 11 games; he has arguably the best recruiting class in the
country coming in next season and he has made peace with point
guard Shaheen Holloway, who was in and out of Amaker's doghouse
much of last season. Holloway's steady play has been a key reason
for the Pirates' early season success . . . Although it's a little
early to be talking about Ratings Percentage Index figures, which
are used as a strong guideline by the NCAA selection committee in
choosing the 64-team field, it is interesting to note that some
early RPI rankings have Kent and Ball State, a couple of mid-major
teams, ranked in the Top 10 . . . When you have a bad day, you have
a bad day, which is what happened to BU the other night after its
loss to Drexel in Philadelphia. The Terriers were three hours into
their return trip to Boston when their bus broke down _ in the
South Bronx, a very dangerous area. The driver took off to find
help _ which did come _ but only after a 3 1/2-hour wait. Instead
of getting home at 2 a.m, coach Dennis Wolff and his team arrived
back at BU for the morning commute at 6:30 a.m.

BOTH DEMOCRATS LACK STAGECRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither man closed the sale Wednesday night in the fourth Al
Gore-Bill Bradley debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley got the better of it by a slim margin on my card; he's
easier to listen to over an up-and-down hour. But for Democrats
shopping for the guy who can hold on to the Oval Office, there was
nobody on stage in Durham, N.H., who could out-schmooze William
Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If you were looking to be swept off your feet with soaring
rhetoric, clever body language or flat-out salesmanship, you're
still waiting. Doughy chunks of indigestible policy-wonkery on
health insurance and abstruse Medicaid financing obscured the
simple fact these two fellows are much closer to each other than
they are to any Republican foe. But personality, not policy,
provided the contrasts. Bradley seemed older, calmer, baggy-eyed,
more lugubrious, if you just dwelt on his flat affect, less
uptight, but also more aloof. You could see Bradley shrugging and
going back to private life if he loses. Al would take losing harder
than Bill, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Gore looks younger, more energetic, wound tighter, and more
programmed. You can imagine the clicks and whirring in the Gore
brain pan as he scrolls through his responses from debate prep.
Bradley looks more comfortable in his baggy old dark suits. Gore
looks as if he's wearing this suit, shirt and, necktie for the
first time, and wonders how they strike people.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is stuck on explaining who he is, Gore with where things
stand in a partisanly divided Congress. Bradley brags of being for
handgun licensing and registration in a bold-new-FDR-like scheme he
likens to passing Social Security. Gore, weathering seven years of
hostile congressional fire on guns, health care, and tax cuts, is
less sweeping, more cautious, offering pragmatism more than
big-idea promises.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's I-can-get-further-left-of-you on guns, gays in the
military or sympathy for poor people will not help much in
November, but it's Feb. 1 in New Hampshire that counts now.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's claim to the mantle of leadership is still pretty thin
gruel. Hearing him list the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as his progeny
is like listening to the second trombone take credit for composing
the symphony. Yo, Bill: It's hard to discern your fingerprints from
those of fellas named Reagan, O'Neill, Rostenkowski, Mitchell,
Greenspan etc.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for some inexplicable reason, seems incapable of reminding
New Hampshire folk in pithy fashion just how badly they were
bleeding till he and Clinton rode in eight years ago and won here
by promising _ and delivering _ prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech flows easier than Gore's slow-talking, somewhat
choppy declamation, which goes down better in the South. Some
watchers proclaimed afterward their conviction that Bradley would
be a tougher foe for Texas Governor George W. Bush than Gore, whose
saddlebags groan with baggage labeled ``Clinton fatigue . . .
Buddhist nun contributors.'' Bradley deftly left his disdain for
Clinton understated but plainly marked. Gore talked lamely about
how ``reprehensible'' Clinton's dalliance with Monica, and
subsequent subterfuges, had been. It was apparent that the
Democrats running for president have not yet achieved the closure
evidenced earlier in the week by Ms. Lewinsky herself, slimmed
down, perked up, chatting gamely with CNN's Larry King, and getting
on with life, which is more than the politicians are doing.
</P>
<P>
   It is wearing thin, hearing Bradley trying to persuade us that
Gore doesn't care about the poor people without medical insurance,
Gore arguing Bradley could blunder us into recession or maim
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward I mused how riveting it would have been if Bill
Clinton bounded onstage in the last five minutes, elbowed Peter
Jennings aside, and hijacked the show, Clinton-style. ``Fellas,
let's agree right here, right now, that either one of you is better
than George Bush, whose promise of a $2,000 tax cut to every family
of four making $50,000 is a flat-out election-year lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaws agape, speechless at his cheek, Gore and Bradley stand
there, in my fantasy, while Clinton segues into a riff about Bush's
pro-gun policy. Bush signed the infamous right-to-carry law that
gives Texans legal cover to walk, drive, work, drink, and carouse
with a concealed handgun on their person. ``If you think what
America's schools and workplaces need is more people packing
heat,'' says Clinton drolly, with that patented eyebrow-raise he
uses to signal that his punchline is a-comin', ``then you should
vote for Mr. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But little of that Clintonseque stagecraft, the shrewd manuever,
the sly strategy, the simple pitch artfully delivered, was on
display. Both Gore and Bradley are getting better. But they've yet
to close the sale. Bradley, outspending Gore, 2-1, on TV, probably
has to win New Hampshire to survive. Gore, a less-adept campaigner
than Bradley in the six months of preliminary skirmishing, is in
danger of letting Bradley break through here or in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a chance to slam the door on Bradley here; failing to
do that may mean a costly, drawn-out battle. Gore has to raise his
game.

FOX'S `MALCOLM' AN OFFBEAT TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE 
Starring: Frankie Muniz, Jane Kaczmarek, Bryan Cranston,
Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield, Erik Per Sullivan 
On: Fox 
Time: Sunday at 8:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a sitcom arrives without the ridiculous riot of
Frankenlaughter that we've learned to take for granted, you know
there's something funny going on. You know that the network _ in
this case Fox _ has enough confidence in its new comedy _ in this
case ``Malcolm in the Middle'' _ to think that viewers will give up
a few chuckles without the abrasive insistence of a tin-can laugh
track.
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out that Fox's faith in ``Malcolm in the Middle''
is very well founded indeed. The blessed absence of metallic mirth
is only one of the reasons to be happy about this twisted family
sitcom, which premieres Sunday night at 8:30 after weeks of
relentless Fox hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm'' is an instantly likable series, as it takes
conventional TV-family material and gives it a good old-fashioned
goose. It's a worthy descendent of sitcoms like ``The Wonder
Years'' and ``Roseanne,'' and it even nods to the neighborhood high
jinks of ``The Little Rascals'' (minus the racist overtones). But
``Malcolm'' is also refresingly surrealistic and irreverent. In a
TV season notably lacking in worthwhile comedies, ``Malcolm'' is a
nice treat _ a nice, gonzo treat.
</P>
<P>
   The show's territory is a messy suburban home swarming with
rough-and-tumble boys. In fact, creator Linwood Boomer has said
that his second choice for the show's title was ``Fighting in
Underpants,'' an activity these kids either do or are close to
doing at all hours. Malcolm appears to be the only sane one in his
family. A 9-year-old Everychild who just wants to be normal and fit
in, he often suffers from preteen social angst. But he is also a
certified genius, the owner of an IQ of 165. One minute he's
distraught because Mom is forcing him into a playdate with a
wheelchair-bound nerd, the next he's performing arithmetic wonders
at record speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling recklessly around Malcolm are Reese, his scamp of a
next-oldest brother, and Dewey, a little tyke who is ``trapped
somewhere between toddler and hampster.'' Francis, the wily oldest
brother, was sent to military school for discipline, although he
appears regularly on the show _ often by telephone. And of course
Malcolm's parents are everpresent, particularly his chaotic, weary
mother, Lois, who has given up her dignity to get down in the
trenches with her boys. Beautifully played by Jane Kaczmarek, she
is a no-nonsense kook always focused on containing the insanity.
Dad, on the other hand, walks through his days like the most
contented of zombies. He's clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Fox sent three episodes to critics, and each is built around
standard plotlines _ the school bully, Mom's mysteriously burned
dress, the class picnic. But the perspective of the show is so
wonderfully inventive and stylized, it all feels quite original.
It's as if creator Boomer has taken ordinary suburban life and
turned up the exaggeration meter a few notchs, pushing all the
authenticity over into the realm of absurdity. Even the camerawork
is used to make wacky jokes, with well-placed close ups and wide
angle shots.
</P>
<P>
   One gimmick has Malcolm repeatedly addressing the camera,
breaking the fourth wall to comment on the action. It's a risky
technique, but it works remarkably well here, cementing our bond
with Malcolm, the show's anchor. After he complains about having to
join the gifted class to his mother, she tells him: ``Just
remember, any kid who makes fun of you is a creepy little loser
who'll end up working in a car wash.'' He then turns to the camera
_ and us _ and confesses, ``That shouldn't make me feel better. But
it does.'' It's a sweet, intimate moment, and it balances the
show's mostly frenetic tone. As Malcolm, Frankie Muniz is wonderful
and sympathetic, particularly as worry furrows his delicate brow.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's episode, there are a few racy bits. A frazzled
Lois answers the door without wearing a top, and Hal, almost
preternaturally hairy, stands naked in the kitchen while Lois
performs her monthly body shave. (All nudity is obscured.) Don't
let these trademark Fox scenes keep you from giving ``Malcolm'' a
chance, even if you are inclined to click away from ``edgy'' TV.
They aren't played for titillation so much as familial goofiness,
and the next two episodes are ``clean.'' ``Malcolm in the Middle''
may not be polite _ what family sitcom worth its salt could be in
this day and age? But it doesn't have a mean bone in its cheerfully
black-and-blue body.

DISGUISE THE OPEN WALLPAPER SEAMS BY PAINTING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 09, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The wallpaper in one room of my house was installed three
years ago, with the seams butted rather than overlapped. Now I
notice the seams have opened up, not much, but enough to create a
white line where each strip of paper butts against the other. What
happened? And what can I do about it? The paper is predominately
beige in color.
</P>
<P>
   F. B., Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. What happened is a good question that the manufacturer of the
paper and the installer would like to have an answer to. So would
the handyman, who can at least give an educated guess. For
starters, modern paper is butted at the seams; in fact, it would
not work to overlap the seams because overlapped seams would
prevent a proper pattern match.
</P>
<P>
   OK, for more answers, the paper might have shrunk after
installation because it was defective. This could happen with
prepasted paper or with paper that is pasted. You may have a case
with the manufacturer; contact him and see what he says.
</P>
<P>
   The prepaste or added paste might have shrunk, pulling the
strips of paper away from each other. If the paper was prepasted,
again, you may have a case with the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure except to replace the paper, but you may not
have to if you disguise the seams by painting the gaps with a flat
latex paint the color of the paper. The handyman did this after he
botched a papering project many years ago, and you know, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think of this idea: Wax the ceramic tile in my
shower and bath to protect it, or at least to protect the grout
against dirt?
</P>
<P>
   BOB McAULIFFE, Mansfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Frankly, not a lot. Your idea is good, especially to protect
the grout, but the material is not. First, glazed tile does not
need protection; the glazing on most tiles is glass, quite
resistant to dirt and easily cleaned. With wax, you would have to
cover everything, and buff with a power buffer as well. Too much of
a hassle for little effect. Wax tends to attract dirt, and dirty
wax is not cleanable except by removal, which would have to be done
once a year or so and more applied. Whoo, I don't want to think
about it!
</P>
<P>
   However, here is what you can use instead of wax: Tile sealer or
masonry sealer. Apply one coat once a year to the entire surface
(it's easier that way than dabbing sealer on the grout lines).
Polish with a dry cloth. The tiles will be unaffected, but the
grout will be as dirt-resistant as it will ever be.
</P>
<P>
   As for cleaner or sealer, try Tile Guard products: grout
cleaner, grout coating, and silicone grout sealer; call
800-445-0619. For a cleaner, try KRC-7, sold in plumbing supply
shops. For a tile colorer and sealer, try Grout Colorant, sold in
tile stores. For new grout, try Colorlastic by Tec, Gainsville,
Fla., 904-372-3931. The company claims it is stain resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping grout clean is not easy, and that is why the handyman
recommends black grout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is good storage space behind the eaves on the second
floor of my house, but is it ever cold in there. I was thinking of
insulating that space with polyisocyanurate, the one-inch-thick
foam insulation with foil on both sides. Some say I can do that,
others say not to. They don't say why I should not; is there a
reason not to use such insulation?
</P>
<P>
   MARK CHAPMAN, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no reason that I know of against using this type of
insulation in almost any application, except that it is quite
expensive. But because it is flammable, it must be covered with
plasterboard or other fire-resistant material, wherever it is
exposed, whether it is exposed in living space or in that storage
space.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to install, and if you obey the rules, you can
put it in to keep that space a little warmer; not a lot, if the
space is not heated, but a little. To keep it warmer, you'd have to
add heat, or better yet, open the doors to the space so a little
house heat can get in there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My no-wax kitchen floor is 18 years old, and I am having a
tough time with wax buildup. I used no-buildup wax, or thought I
did, and tried a lot of other things over the years, including wax
strippers and waxes. Still there is buildup, and the vinyl looks
terrible. What can I do to remove remaining wax and possibly rewax?
</P>
<P>
   ROGER ROWELL, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the vinyl is beyond redemption because it is 18 years
old, a long time for sheet vinyl to last. It is so old that waxing
will not restore the shine. The older the vinyl, the more it will
absorb the wax, and the shine is gone. You could try stripping the
wax by applying llberal amounts of paint thinner or a strong
ammonia solution. Then rewax, but I doubt that will work. The wax
has penetrated the finish, making it that much harder to remove.
And, the new wax on an absorbent surface will not restore the
shine. Consider new floor covering.

<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. - Doug Flutie can't remember what he said
Monday when Wade Phillips, his coach, told him he was being sent to
the bench. It was too shocking. But Flutie clearly remembers what
he was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what happened (11 years ago) with the
Patriots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The words came. Flutie is not over the hurt, and he'll stop
midway through a sentence and ask, ``Do you think this would have
happened if I was 6-1?'' and then go on to say his first words to
his replacement, Rob Johnson, were, ``Just win a damn (Super Bowl)
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he'll go back 11 years when former Patriots coach
Raymond Berry shocked him and the team's fans by naming Tony Eason,
still hurt and still unable to throw well, as the starter in New
England's last game of the 1988 season, against a poor Denver team,
a game New England had to win to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me about this is that I felt the decision back
then was made because Tony was a first-rounder, Tony was making a
million-two and I was making a hundred grand, and if I went into
that offseason as a free agent and a starter, they were going to
have to pay me what Tony made,'' said Flutie. ``So they had to make
a decision then . . . and do it. And I feel like I got caught in
the middle of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And here in Buffalo, Johnson makes $5 million a year and Flutie
about $4.4 millon, an expensive scenario that clearly can't last
long. Flutie's mind searches for reasons why and he sees so many
similarities between New England and Buffalo, beyond both Berry and
Phillips telling him he doesn't throw the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, here's a situation where they've given up a
first-rounder plus for Rob, he signed for a lot of money, and he
hasn't done anything yet . . . it all had that same feeling,'' said
Flutie. ``Now . . . Rob is a much more talented quarterback than
(Eason) . . . Tony was still injured at that point . . . at least
here I can accept it because I know how talented a quarterback Rob
is. So I accept it a little easier . . . but it still doesn't
replace that hurt feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurt feeling ``knowing that I busted my ass for 15 weeks,
locked up a playoff spot, ready to take the team into the playoffs
. . . really, the whole reason I came down here from Canada was to
win a Super Bowl. We have a great defense, the best in the league,
and we have a real shot at the Super Bowl . . . and I helped put us
in position, and then you have to turn it over to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   A Toronto newspaper reported Thursday that Flutie may want to
return to the Canadian Football League. Wide receiver Andre Reed
disclosed on his Web site this week that he and Flutie don't speak
to each other; sources say Reed despises Flutie. And Scott
Berchtold, the Bills' vice president/communications, captured this
week of conspiracy theories by saying, ``It's like how they used to
play Beatles' records backward to find some hidden meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as . . . did owner Ralph Wilson make a call?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grass is still green in Buffalo and not a snowflake _ let
alone a snowbank _ is in sight. Eerie times for early January, for
the warmth just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   And the heat is coming not only from the weather gods, but also
from the Bills, because Phillips has made a decision that is
red-hot in its riskiness and white-hot for its daring. Depending on
what happens Saturday in Nashville, there may never be another
icicle in Buffalo because the hot anger from perhaps the NFL's most
passionate fans may last for eons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the difference (between Flutie and Johnson),''
said Phillips in words that may be his epitaph if Buffalo can't
more the ball in the AFC wild-card game against the Titans. ``Even
in practice last week, I thought we practiced as good as we
practiced all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as likely, if Buffalo wins and goes deep into the playoffs
under Johnson, the warmth of the praise for the Buffalo brain trust
might delay the onset of winter for another Ice Age or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision certainly,'' said Phillips. ``I studied
the film. It wasn't a haphazard thing. I talked to our coaches and
I think it gives us the best opportunity to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who helped lead the Bills to the playoffs, has been
benched and Johnson, who has started all of eight NFL games in his
career, is in. The Bills already have a defense good enough to win
the Super Bowl but scoring has been the bane of the Bills for much
of the second half of the season. If the Bills can score, Phillips
believes, Buffalo is good enough to win the Super Bowl. And
Phillips is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Still in all, benching quarterbacks on the eve of the playoffs
just isn't done in the NFL. Not since Jets coach Joe Walton benched
Ken O'Brien for Pat Ryan heading into the 1986 playoffs and a game
against the Chiefs (which the Jets won), has a coach been this
daring.
</P>
<P>
   But those Jets had lost five in a row under the mediocrity of
all mediocrities, O'Brien; Flutie, for his part, had completed his
last 12 passes in a row in his last action against the Patriots two
weeks ago in Foxborough, a game the Bill won in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   As Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher put it, ``I never second-guess a
coach's decision, but from a standpoint of being surprised, yes,
I'm very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   An understatement. ``Shocking'' is the only apt word as Flutie
is still shocked and his days in Buffalo possibly may be done.
Depending on what happens in Nashville, of course.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I do it,'' said Flutie, when asked to reply to the
criticism that he can't throw the long ball. ``Everybody has
different ways of getting it done. Rob may go downtown more often
and hit some big plays. It doesn't faze me that I hit somebody on a
slant and he goes 80 yards for a touchdown or I throw the long ball
and he outruns a guy for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, said Flutie, he throws the ball as far as Johnson.
And the quarterback efficiency ratings (Flutie's is 75.1; Johnson's
is 119.5 after an exceptional game last Sunday against the Colts)
``are a joke,'' said Flutie. ``I've thrown three interceptions on
the last play of the game trying just to throw one up. I run for
first downs and that has nothing to do with quarterback efficiency
ratings. I avoid sacks and throw the ball away and all that does is
hurt my percentage. But they're the little things that help win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   As always with Flutie. He may not look the best but he usually
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade came to me and said it was his decision and I have to
believe that,'' said Flutie, as another Beatles' record was played
backwards. ``Whether I do or not, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has fears and I'm sure I'll be nervous,'' said
Johnson, who was 24 of 32 for 287 yards and 2 TDs against the
Colts. ``but you just have to deal with it. You just have to
overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Phillips told him Monday ``that he thought with me
that we had the best chance of winning, the team . . . better . . .
That was good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' thinking is that NFL defensive coordinators have
caught up to Flutie. Defenses often bring eight men up close to the
line and dare Flutie to beat them with his passing. Teams now rush
Flutie from the outside, keeping him from performing his virtuoso
act of scrambling to the outside, while interior linemen rush with
their arms up, leading to deflections of Flutie's passes.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Flutie are in a deep freeze, because Reed believes
Flutie does not throw him the ball enough and because Reed believed
that Flutie went to the coaches two weeks ago and had Reed removed
from the Patriots game. More than a few times, Reed has given up on
his routes while Flutie has scrambled, an unhappy symptom, some
believe, of what ailed the Bills offense; a key part of any
offense, the deep ball, was missing.
</P>
<P>
   And the domino effect builds, affecting the Bills' running as
well, because teams do not have to worry about the long pass.
</P>
<P>
   Still in all, Reed has sulked many times before in his career
and Flutie's third-down success has been outstanding, often making
plays few other quarterbacks can make. The Bills have converted
40.8 percent of their third downs this season, third in the league.
Most important, the Bills (11-5) have won under Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   No Ken O'Brien, Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flutie said he does not intend to return to play in Canada,
except one day ``When this is all over, it would be nice to play
with my brother (Darren who was on the Grey Cup-winning Hamilton
Tiger Cats last season),'' he said. As for Reed, Flutie insisted he
had nothing to do with Reed being removed from the Patriots game,
saying that it was his belief Reed had sore ribs going into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was told by Phillips before the Colts game that he would
be rested to ensure that he would be at full speed for the
playoffs. Part of Flutie agreed, but in the back of his mind, there
was doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hurt, I don't want to rest, I want to play,'' Flutie
recalled saying to a friend when Phillips told him he'd be sitting
the last regular-season game. `` `No matter what Rob does, you're
the guy.' Wade said that. But I've been there before. I've seen how
it works. I didn't really anticipate it happening, and I thought it
was my own paranoia. But obviously . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And now, one of the gutsiest decisions ever made by an NFL coach
has been made, and in Nashville, Wade Phillips, Rob Johnson and
Doug Flutie will learn its consequences. For sure, football life
never will be the same for the three of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accepted the decision now,'' said Flutie. ``My way of
dealing with it is to know I'm going to get back out on the field
again. I believe in Rob and I believe in the team, and we're going
to win games. At some point, I'm still going to be a big part of
this, whether it's coming in with four minutes to go, down by 5,
whether it'll be one game to the next or whatever it may be. I
still deep down believe that I'm going to be a big part of this.''

BELICHICK GRIEVANCE GETS THE BALL SPINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The clock on when and if Bill Belichick will become the
new Patriots coach and general manager began ticking when his
agent, Neil Cornrich, filed an eight-page grievance with the NFL
over the validity of his current Jets contract, which Belichick
wants voided so he can pursue another job.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome affects the future leadership of the Patriots, who
Monday sought permission to speak to Belichick about coming to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a series of wild events that have once again
stirred New York-New England tensions and virtually reenacted the
1997 scenario between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, despite stating that his decision Tuesday to resign
after one day as Jets coach was influenced by an uncertain
ownership situation in New York and not because of his desire to
take the job in New England, would like to be coach and GM of the
Patriots, according to a source close to him.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the Jets have until the close of
business Monday to file a response on the grievance. At that point,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue will likely request a hearing, then
review the case before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   There are differing opinions on the likely outcome. One NFL
official said the league would be tough with Belichick and not
allow him out of the contract, forcing him to sit out or take a
college job, while a friend of Belichick said there was renewed
confidence that the league would allow Belichick to move to the
Patriots after the commissioner decided the proper compensation.
The Patriots continued to go forward with their contingency plans,
interviewing Chicago offensive coordinator Gary Crowton at Robert
Kraft's headquarters in Boston, and again at team headquarters in
Foxborough, where vice president and CEO Andy Wasynczuk and vice
president of player personnel Bobby Grier met with the 42-year-old
Crowton, considered one of the top offensive minds in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also interviewing Baltimore defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis. The team said there were no interviews
scheduled over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell will interview in
Foxborough, after the Patriots granted the Green Bay Packers
permission to interview him for their head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have contacted the Rams concerning offensive
coordinator Mike Martz, and a report that New England also was
interested in talking to the Rams' personnel man _ and former
Patriots college scouting director _ Charley Armey was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Given the turnaround in St. Louis this season, the Martz-Armey
combination would be intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Crowton, the first offensive coordinator interviewed by the
team, is an interesting candidate. Crowton is the former head coach
at Louisiana Tech University, where he directed a high-powered
offense. This was his first season in Chicago, and he brought
excitement to an offense that is quarterback-friendly _ designed so
the quarterback can audible and the receivers can make site reads.
Crowton also emphasizes downfield blocking by the receivers and
tries to set up mismatches against the defense that can exploit
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Crowton likes to run screens, which make linebackers have to
move laterally and which tends to wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   Crowton is the former quarterback coach at Boston College
(1991-93), where he coached former Jets and current Seahawks backup
Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Crowton used three quarterbacks _ rookie Cade
McNown, Shane Matthews, and Jim Miller. They were the first three
quarterbacks on the same team to each throw for more than 1,000
yards. Crowton has also worked at the University of New Hampshire,
and was a graduate assistant to Mike Holmgren at Brigham Young
University.
</P>
<P>
   Crowton is also credited with turning NFL Europe receiver Marcus
Robinson into a star. He's considered quite popular among his
players and with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell will be on a few lists around the league as coaching
vacancies occur. But it seemed the Patriots only decided to talk to
him because the Packers felt he was worthy of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may feel they know Sidwell, but until he explains
his philosophies of how to run the show, how to deal with players
and their problems, and how he would get the offense jump-started,
they will never know completely what Sidwell can do. Because his
focus has been on defense, the Patriots have rarely asked him
questions about offense.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the filing of the grievance in New York, Bill Parcells
addressed the media in a telephone conference call and said he
would wait to see who emerges as the owner of the team before
making any commitments, but he did hint he could be talked back
into coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my watch,'' he said. ``I have a responsibility to the
organization and I'm in charge of finding a new coach now. I will
not abandon the franchise. What I said Monday is what is my
intention to follow through with. I am not trying to open any doors
or windows, but I won't let this franchise go down the tubes. I am
going to say this is on my watch and I am going to ensure something
good will happen from this.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been much speculation about Parcells since Belichick
suddenly resigned. There's little question New York fans would like
him to return as coach, and the new Jets owners may feel the same
way, especially after paying $600 million for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said on Monday is the truth,'' said Parcells. ``When I
made that statement on Monday, that was completely my intention. I
am not leaving a ray of light to deviate from that, but I do not
know what is in the future. I do want to discuss with the new owner
what he wants done here. But my intention is to not coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is so popular and can sell his goods so well in New
York that he may be able to name either defensive coordinator Al
Groh or offensive coordinator Charlie Weis coach and sell Jets fans
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Groh would likely be Parcells's top choice, but Weis is very
interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland-based Cornrich said in a statement late Wednesday,
``It is unfortunate that the commissioner's office issued a
directive that precludes Bill Belichick from speaking to other
clubs about future NFL employment, thereby denying him the ability
to earn a livelihood for himself and his family. Likewise, it is
disappointing that this sanction was imposed without even having
heard Bill's position on the various reasons he is entitled to seek
other employment. We will be addressing the issue with the NFL
shortly and are hopeful that there will be a prompt resolution to
allow Bill to move forward with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said in his teleconference that he had not spoken to
Belichick since learning of his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to talk, I am here to talk to him,'' Parcells
said. ``But I take everything he said at face value. He made his
decision and I respect that. We have had a good professional
relationship for a long time, and I appreciate what he did for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has refused to talk about anything concerning the
Patriots. There has also been speculation on which Jets coaches
would come with him to New England, but all of the coaches except
Dan Henning have at least another year on their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick would need to bring a personnel person with him, and
speculation is that Phil Savage, the 34-year-old director of
college scouting for the Baltimore Ravens, would be his top choice.
Belichick's also very close to Scott Pioli, the Jets' director of
pro personnel. One problem: Pioli is married to Parcells's
daughter, Dallas.

ANALYSTS CONFUSED BY MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several of TV's prominent NFL analysts remain baffled by Bill
Belichick's resignation Tuesday after one day as New York Jets head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, for one, was shocked. ``I still don't understand
it,'' the Fox color man told reporters Wednesday. ``Belichick was
all set. Everything was in order and in place. It still shocks me.
I don't know how you walk away from that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden did not understand what Belichick was trying to say at
his news conference. ``Belichick was saying how the death of (Jets
owner) Leon Hess changed things for him,'' he said. ``He talked
about that as if it happened this weekend. The last I checked, Hess
died months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cris Collinsworth, who works for both HBO and Fox, found his
attention shifting to Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who has had his
issues with Bill Parcells and the Jets in the recent past. ``I
can't help but think that Bob Kraft is smoking some 8-foot cigar
somewhere, blowing smoke rings and doodling the names of Parcells
and Belichick,'' Collinsworth said. ``I know he's got to be having
the time of his life, laughing hysterically.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowingly or unknowingly, Collinsworth said, Kraft helped cause
a disaster within a rival organization. ``As soon as he sent the
fax down asking for permission to talk with Bellichick, things went
haywire,'' Collinsworth said. ``Thanks to Kraft's shenanigans, he
got rid of both Parcells and Belichick.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Armen Keteyian also had an interesting spin on the week's
events, also involving Kraft. ``You can say a lot of things about
Kraft, but he is a very smart businessman,'' Keteyian said. ``The
Belichick thing boils down to two things: money and power. In this
case, how much power Belichick would have and how much money he
would need.''
</P>
<P>
   Keteyian recalls the Jets starting to position Belichick as head
coach during the middle of the season, making him available to
select media in an attempt to change his drab image. All of that
planning fell apart Tuesday when Belichick stood in front of a room
of reporters and rambled on in some weird stream of consciousness,
revealing how his wife clips coupons and has been pretty frugal
over the years, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's news conference generated a lot of speculation. One
theory is that Little Bill quit because he felt he'd never be able
to break away from the perception that the Jets are still
Parcells's team.
</P>
<P>
   But Keteyian believes that another factor may have been the
changing landscape among NFL coaches. In addition to the
resignation of Parcells, Ray Rhodes was fired by Green Bay on
Sunday, Pete Carroll got the ax on Monday, and Mike Ditka was let
go by New Orleans on Wednesday. Belichick supposedly is paid about
$750,000 a year, but with several jobs available and his name
appearing on everyone's short list, he could command at least
double and perhaps triple that amount.
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing to Keteyian is the debt that Kraft owes NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue. The NFL intervened in the Parcells
mess three years ago, then bailed out the Foxborough stadium plans.
Now the Belichick disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft is a powerful owner to have in your debt,'' Keteyian
said. ``The NFL is not uncomfortable keeping track of who owes what
and it will appear in things like NFL committee votes _ taking the
league position that he may not ordinarily agree with or keeping
silent when he should be shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   As for CBS's Greg Gumbel, he sees the firings as simply the
latest example of one of the weirder years in NFL history.
``Players and coaches don't have the luxury of sitting around and
waiting to build a franchise,'' Gumbel said. ``They have to produce
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sweet number
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Bowl earned a 17.5 national rating, a 2 percent
increase over last year's BCS finale. In Boston, the numbers were _
as usual _ well below average . . . ESPN.com has hired Andy Katz as
a senior writer. Katz was the NBA writer for the Fresno Bee . . .

BIG LOSER IN FOOTBALL BOWLS: CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP OF EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the garrish shows of corporate carpetbagging in the
college football bowls, this one stung like chlorine in the cornea.
The burning started Saturday while watching the Rose Bowl. The
burning started again on Tuesday night when I turned on the game
between top-ranked Florida State and No. 2 Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Everytime a player was shown drinking fluids, the camera also
caught the massive blue letters on the white cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   Everytime the coach was seen drinking, it was the same cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if you needed an eye chart, the camera would come
to a rack of cups during breaks in the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab. Charles Schwab. Charles Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I am not naive. We all know that corporate sponsorships have
eviscerated whatever dignity there was out of the college bowls.
Some bowls are sponsored by ghastly icons of gastronomy seemingly
prepared in the bottom of a food disposal ( corn chips, fried
chicken and steaks).
</P>
<P>
   Other sponsors claim to be communications giants, but are
actually gnats driving people nuts with dumb directory assistance
or transforming attentive drivers into glazed zombies (telephone
companies, cell phones). Others sound as personal as Hal the
computer in ``2000, A Space Odyssey'' (anybowl.com).
</P>
<P>
   Now we as a society have not gotten very disturbed about this,
watching the bowls grow from basically four or so 30 years ago to
23 today. We have not questioned deeply the rise in corporate
sponsorships of even high school scoreboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab'' hits me differently. While most corporate
logos are bad enough, being seen all over TV along the walls, on
the 50-yard-line or on the shoulders of player jerseys like the
overblown medals of tinhorn dictators, ``Charles Schwab'' is so
huge as to become the foreground. It blatantly turns college
athletes into billboards when, if they were to try and go out and
get paid to advertise the same product, they would lose their
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   I figure if corporations are getting to this level, doing
everything but plugging these teenagers and young men into a socket
so their helmets glow ``Eat at Joe's,'' then it makes you wonder
what is their commitment to actual education.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago-based
newsletter that tracks sponsorships, corporations spent an
estimated $5.1 billion on all sports sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than the $3.25 billion corporations gave to higher
education in 1998, according to the New York-based Council for Aid
to Education. In another light, the $5.1 billion spent on sports
dwarfs the $1.3 billion proposed this week by President Clinton to
rebuild the nation's dilapidated public schools. The $1.3 billion
merely matches the level of corporate sponsorships of auto racing
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nation, according to the General Accounting
Office, would need to spend $112 billion to fix the schools. One
reason Clinton's proposal is so lame is because the Republicans
last year shot down a $3.7 billion proposal. This is despite the
plea about the schools from Dan Wilson, the American Institute of
Architects's senior director of federal affairs. Wilson said, ``If
we don't do something, it's a national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also becoming a disgrace to see corporations and compliant
colleges and universities exploit their athletes as cash cows,
raking in dollars with mediocre graduation rates. Up until now,
society has allowed that a college scholarship was lavish
compensation for an athletes. If they all they were doing was
playing a game, that would still be true.
</P>
<P>
   But that ``Charles Schwab'' cup smells of a new level of
exploitation. When the big bowls bring in $13 million a team, when
corporations are advertising so close to the lips of athletes that
it is as if the athlete is indeed mouthing ``Charles Schwab'' on
every sip, athletes should get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have long said pay the athletes and reorganize them
into minor leagues like baseball. Or perhaps there can be some
detached club affiliation with a college, where the students who
want to go to down the street to school can and the ones who think
they can go pro can concentrate on bulking up.
</P>
<P>
   With neither of these in the immediate offing, I have another
thought. If these corporations think it is fine to exploit young
people for profit, then they should have no problem sharing those
profits, in a bowl-sponsors scholarship fund that benefits all
students.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, every one of those .com, corn chip and Charles
Schwab-type companies will tell you how much they already give to
education. Sorry. Charles Schwab alone has over $460 billion in
assets, enough to fix the nation's schools, provide college
scholarships for all who need them and even start their own minor
league in football. Think about that and then your eyes really
start to burn.

A SURVIVOR LUMBERS ON THE ROAD TO REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW 
By Zoe Heller 
Knopf, 205 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chewed-over subjects like bad marriage and the immorality of
Hollywood are risky business for a first novel. Add manslaughter,
suicide and hack celebrity and you've got the makings of real
bathos. Unless, as is the case with Zoe Heller, you've got the wit
and craft to carry it off.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Heller, a British journalist who has written for
Granta, Vanity Fair and the London Review of Books, is nothing like
her protagonist, the world-weary Willy Muller. But she slips into
his skin and gives us an absorbingly arch _ and male _ narration
full of sly pride and paralyzing doubt. Muller, recovering from a
heart attack, blocked in his attempts to turn his memoir into a
screenplay, has plenty of self-disgust to dispense with. But he's
so right-on when he skewers the silliness around him _ and so
clearly capable of discerning truths amid the wreckage of his life
_ that he draws us in as he lumbers toward some measure of
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As the book opens, Willy is just out of the hospital, taking a
dissolute sort of inventory of his life. ``Women still want to have
sex with me, I thought this morning as I lay in bed. I have quite a
lot of hair left. I was born in the First World. I am still not
smoking. I have been making this rapid survey of Things To Be
Grateful For every morning since my heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He has survived plenty, he reassures himself: imprisonment for
manslaughter after the death of his wife, years of hate mail from
readers of his dissembling memoir, ``To Have and To Hold.'' But the
afternoon mail brings a startling package _ the diary of his
daughter Sadie, who committed suicide months before. Balancing
guilt with curiosity, Willy turns to the first page. It is dated
Dec. 31, 1970, shortly after Willy's wife, Oona, died in a
mysterious fall in the kitchen. ``Mum who is called Oona died in
september and there is quite a controversy about that. Now we live
just with dad who is called William Muller. He used to be on
television. He reported current affairs for a program called 24/7
but he is not working at the moment because he has a lot on his
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   He still does, of course, and once he begins reading the diary,
he can't stop. Heller, who was born and educated in Britain, is
able to imbue her narrator with a kind of cultural
cold-bloodedness. She draws a bead on the details that make LA so
alluring and so unredeemably pastel. ``Nine years ago, when I first
came to Los Angeles, I really believed I had found my perfect city.
. . . (It) seemed to me a place of limitless erotic promise _
gleaming, hygienic days; mysterious, noirish nights. Everything
about it spoke of sex: the galloping freeways; the roaring Niagara
of my hotel shower; the odd, swimming-pool fragrance of the tap
water, the ticklish shiver and momentary blindness that occurred
whenever I passed from a sunny street into the dark cool of an
air-conditioned lobby. I'm not sure exactly when all these things
ceased, or when they ceased to excite me. I guess it's been a slow
ebb.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy's agent suggests he keep quiet about the heart attack and
repair to a villa in Puerto Vallerta, Mexico, to crank out the
screenplay. Brushing off a passing parade of girlfriends, drunken
pals and film industry types, Willy sinks more deeply into Sadie's
diary. While he skated free and clear on the revenue of his memoir,
she sank. There is the freezing apartment, the married lover, the
newborn named Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's death propels him back to England, and tempers his
cynicism. But the final reckoning comes from his accountant, a
70-year-old Yoda in Calabasas living in a house with an Astro-Turf
lawn. An LA numbers guy with old-world smarts, Meir Rosenblatt sits
under a lemon tree and talks about back taxes and cutbacks, courage
and cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coward isn't a bad man, necessarily,'' the accountant says.
``You can't know if you're a bad man until you die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to wait until you hear God's decision?'' Willy
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes, that's true. But I meant something else. Only when
you die do you run out of chances to be good. Until then, there is
always the possibility of turning yourself around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end (without revealing too many plot twists), Willy is
able to muster some courage to go spelunking in the past. And to
emerge with, as he puts it, at least a ``plurality'' of truth.

`MAGNOLIA' SPUTTERS AND SIZZLES, WITH LIKABLE FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MAGNOLIA 
Directed and written by: Paul Thomas Anderson 
Starring: Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, April Grace,
Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ricky Jay,
Orlando Jones, William H. Macy, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore,
Michael Murphy, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards, Melora Walters 
Running time: 179 
Rated: R (strong language, drug use, sexuality and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of sprawl and sputter in ``Magnolia.'' But there's
also a lot of sizzle in its charting of parents and children facing
off across emotional chasms that would dwarf the San Andreas Fault.
The faults of Paul Thomas Anderson's often ungainly but ultimately
winning and often powerful follow-up to ``Boogie Nights'' are ones
of ambition. In a culture and an art form where shortcomings
usually involve caving in to one form or other of political or
economic pressure, it's easy to like even this movie's faults,
which essentially can be thought of as overreach and underbite. As
for the parts that go right, they're like very little else that's
out there today.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Anderson's crisscrossing stories of Los Angelenos in
crisis seem as random as a drive-by shooting. If Anderson intends
to pull their strands together, you can't imagine how. Nor, I'm
willing to bet, will you even come close to guessing the climactic
stroke that comes out of the blue. What I think will happen, or at
least what happened to me, is that you're going to get increasingly
caught up in this or that playing out of this or that character's
story. Certainly there are enough of them, and they infectiously
proceed from what has to be Anderson's joy in writing meaty scenes
for actors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise has his best role since ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' as a motivational motormouth of machismo manure. Cruise, at
his best playing tightly wound types, shows up here in the attack
mode wearing long hair, cowboy vest, and black leather pants. As he
restlessly paces the stage at a hotel meeting room and starts
unreeling his women-are-the-enemy rant, you don't know whether to
laugh, hose him down, phone for the bomb squad, or all of the
above. You can't imagine where Cruise can possibly go with this
character, given his initial high attack, but Anderson finds a few
places to lead him, including an interview with April Grace's
perceptive TV reporter who steers him into emotional territory he
didn't anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   The rich lineup includes Anderson regulars Julianne Moore and
Philip Seymour Hoffman, each in a way connected to a dying TV
executive played by Jason Robards. Not until she realizes that her
bedridden husband is dying does Moore's brittle beauty realize that
she married him for more than the money and comfort he brought her.
One scene, a drugstore encounter involving painkillers, is almost
worth the ticket price. Hoffman plays the ailing exec's in-home
nurse, bringing fresh spin and imaginative choices to what could in
other hands have collapsed into mundane bathos.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bill Macy's washed-up ex-quiz kid, strapped for
cash, starved for love, about to make a big mistake. Philip Baker
Hall, another Anderson stalwart, turns up as a TV game-show host
and turns in a startlingly poignant performance as a man altogether
unlikable yet pitiable. John C. Reilly is perhaps the most
sympathetic as a lonely cop just bright enough to realize he isn't
bright enough, but trying to hang in there all the same, on all
fronts. He hopes he might get something going with Melora Walters's
damaged sparrow, who lives cooped up in her flat with the shades
drawn, trying to numb her rage and pain with cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of lovely stuff going on between the actors,
especially in one-on-one confrontations. Time after time, you can
feel the tension, you can feel the give-and-take, you can feel the
moment breathe. The larger picture doesn't always take on the
urgency of those peak moments when Anderson and his camera move in
close on these aching people. They're flailing about, trying to
figure out what they've got to do to make their lives whole while
the song ``It's Not Going to Stop (Until You Wise Up)'' throbs in
the background. ``Magnolia'' turns the generation gap into a San
Fernando Valley minefield, but it's made with just enough affection
for the characters to tantalize us with the possibility that at
least a few disasters can be averted. ``Magnolia'' is ``Short
Cuts'' with hope. It's my kind of mess.

ON GOLAN, SOME DRUZE LONG FOR SYRIAN RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights _ In this Druze village on the
shoulders of Mount Hermon, at the northern end of the Israeli-held
Golan Heights, some 300 demonstrators gathered defiantly, singing
along as the Syrian national anthem blared over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   A man climbed a 20-foot bronze statue of Sultan Pasha Al Atrash,
a Syrian nationalist who led the 1920s revolution against the
French, and tied the red-white-and-black Syrian flag to the
sultan's raised sword as it unfurled over the village square.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli military vehicles idled in the distance, out of view
of the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   But the gathering Monday offered a glimpse of the mounting
expectations and deep longings among some members of the Golan
Druze community, who sense their homes will soon return to Syria
after being under Israeli control since the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   The US-mediated Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which got underway
this week in Shepherdstown, W. Va., are proceeding slowly and
deliberately. The final details of a deal, which analysts expect to
include the return of the Golan Heights to Syria in return for
Israeli security guarantees, are far from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   And the relationship between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and his negotiating partner, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa,
seems less than warm.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, is stopping the 18,000 residents of the
Golan's community of Druze, a secretive sect of Shiite Islam formed
in the 11th Century, from celebrating what they believe is the
inevitable return of their community to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it stopped the 18,000 Israeli settlers who live amid the
cattle ranches and wine vineyards of the Golan from stepping up
their own publicity campaign alerting Israelis to the military
risks and threat to vital water resources that would accompany
returning the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis have finally admitted that this is Syrian land,''
said Iman Abu Jabal, 33, the man who raised the flag over the town
square.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Jabal, a carpenter, was a leader of the demonstration, which
included a half-dozen people holding framed photographs of sons and
brothers held in Israeli prisons and chanting calls for their
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel was forced to admit the Golan is Syrian by those of us
who fought occupation,'' said Abu Jabal, who said he was released
from an Israeli prison two years ago after serving a 12-year
sentence for exploding an Israeli weapons depot on the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young Druze, Abu Jabal, who was born just before Syria
lost the Golan to Israel in the June 1967 war, has heard his father
and the elders of other family clans tell stories of a happier
time, as they recall it, when this farming community was under
Syrian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the land around the town is still blanketed with
bountiful apple and pear orchards, and the warm smell of
woodburning stoves wafts from the houses that cling to the steep
hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Majdal Shams and other Druze communities have
relatives in Syria whom they have not seen for more than 30 years.
Their emotional attachment to their Syrian nationality is a
powerful one.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, the demonstration disbanded. The Israeli military
vehicles approached the center of town. And just then, Abu Jabal
climbed the statue and quickly took down the Syrian flag, stuffing
it in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Such a defiant display of Syrian nationalism as raising a flag
could land a Majdal Shams resident in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
   But in some homes in the notoriously insular community of the
Druze, people are less stridently pro-Syrian and more worried about
their future. Some privately express reservations about a peace
process that would place them once again under the authoritarian
rule of Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sentiment not often expressed since many fear that
they could be labeled Israeli collaborators when and if the Syrian
government regains sovereignty in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment was expressed, however, in a letter sent to Barak
by Druze Sheikh Muafiq Tarif, an Israeli citizen who lives in the
Galilee. The Israeli Druze leader asked for a committee to be
established ``to discuss the issue of finding a solution to the
problem of those in the Golan who are loyal to Israel and hold
Israeli citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, which was cited in an article in the Dec. 14
issue of the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, Tarif said as many as
2,000 of the 18,000 Golan Druze wish to stay under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But Salman Fakhr El-Din, a leader of the Druze community and
director of the Golan Research Unit, which monitors Israeli
broadcasts and newspapers on the occupation of the Golan, says,
``If this feeling exists, I have not heard it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe for one minute we have more democracy in
Israel than in Syria,'' said Fakhr El-Din. ``It's true in Israel
you can shout against the government. But if you are Arab you can't
build a home where you want to, and you are not given the same
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that in Syria opposition to the government is
limited,'' said Fakhr El-Din. ``But at least you can build your
home where you wish and you are sure that when you do so you are
building in a nation that sees you as an equal citizen.''

PETULA CLARK: FROM `DOWNTOWN' TO NORMA DESMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Petula Clark didn't take to Norma Desmond right away.
In fact, she recoiled from her the first time she saw her, when
Clark was a teenager back in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Desmond, a fading, deluded silent-movie star, was
being personified by Gloria Swanson in Billy Wilder's 1950 film
``Sunset Blvd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young when I first saw it. I thought it was spooky
and weird,'' Clark said on the phone from Green Bay, Wis., where
she's playing Desmond in a touring production of Andrew Lloyd
Webber's musical adaptation from the film. It's opening Tuesday and
playing through Jan. 16 at the Wang Theatre in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is known primarily as the English pop singer who won two
Grammy Awards in 1965 for ``Downtown'' and ``I Know a Place,'' and
another Grammy for ``Don't Sleep in the Subway'' in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   She's perhaps lesser known as a film and stage actress who has
appeared in such movies as Francis Coppola's musical ``Finian's
Rainbow'' (co-starring Fred Astaire) and on stage in Willy
Russell's ``Blood Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   A 60ish mother of three and grandmother of one, Clark, a child
star called ``the Shirley Temple of Britain,'' was in a Broadway
audience when she next beheld Desmond being portrayed by Glenn
Close. ``I was not moved,'' Clark says. ``The production was
totally overshadowed by the set.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later she got a call from Trevor Nunn, Webber's
director, who ``wanted to talk.'' Talk they did. ``I spent what I
can only describe as three grueling hours with him.'' He'd ``made
up his mind'' that she was going to play Desmond in a touring
production. ``I didn't think I was right for it. I was a little
scared of it. I'd seen Close. `I wouldn't be like that,' I told
him. `Don't worry,' he said. `You'll bring your own qualities of
humor and vulnerability to it.' I hadn't thought of Norma Desmond
in that way. `Every actress who's played her has brought her own
qualities to her and that's what you'll do,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark says that ``you don't say no to Trevor Nunn,'' which is
how she came to sign on. He told her not to look at the movie, an
injunction she managed to obey until one night her son ``tricked''
her into looking at some of it on television. (On the other hand,
Clark says, Nunn told Elaine Paige, another Desmond, to study the
film closely. Paige wound up seeing it some 40 times.) When Clark
looked at it with her son, she was so far into her character that
she cried out against some of Swanson/Desmond's lines in the movie:
``No, no, that's not what she's thinking!''
</P>
<P>
   Clark debuted as Desmond in a London production in 1997, four
years after it opened there. She has been touring the United States
in this production since November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She's seen everybody who's played Desmond with the exceptions of
Patti Lupone, Webber's original Norma, and Rita Moreno, who filled
in when Clark took a break. Clark has now played the lead longer
than any other actress, a field that also includes Betty Buckley
and Diahann Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Clark says she's become so familiar with Desmond _ starting with
getting her American accent down _ that ``I don't feel I'm playing
her any more.'' She describes the character as ``one of the great
roles for women.''
</P>
<P>
   She says her real-life reference for someone like Desmond is an
acquaintance ``who lives totally in the past, back in the '40s, in
a time warp.'' Clark says Desmond is a ``Hollywood creation, made
and destroyed by it. If you totally dislike her, it's tough for
you, because she's the centerpiece. She's a monster. She's not
nice. She's deluded. She's rude. She doesn't see straight. But she
can be funny, even dotty at times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided the way to play her was like playing Hamlet.
Everyone who plays him brings his own qualities to him. That's what
makes `Hamlet' always different and interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark concludes with the tour in May. She's working on an
autobiographical one-woman show that she may try out in Ottawa or
Montreal. It will have special effects and four singer-dancers
accompanying her. ``Not too many special effects,'' she adds. ``I'm
not big on special effects on the stage.''

INFLATION WILL EAT UP RETIREMENT FUND FOR DAUGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 9, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My small business is doing well enough to allow me the
opportunity to plan for my two daughters, aged 11 and 6. Their
college costs are covered, due to the goodwill of their
grandparents. So I am attempting to plan not just for my
retirement, but for my daughters as well. My 11-year-old has been
on the business payroll for three years, earning approximately
$2,000 per year. This has been invested in a Roth IRA in Vanguard's
Index 500 fund, with a current value of $7,142. What do you think
of this strategy? What type of lifestyle would this allow when she
is 60 years old if I continue this for 20 or 30 years? I hope to do
the same with my younger child when she is eight years old. Should
her plan be similar?
</P>
<P>
   M.D., Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I based my calculation on a projection of 10 percent average
annual growth for 25 additional years, which took the account to
$283,122 by the time your older daughter is 36 years old. If the
funds were then left to grow without additional contributions for a
further 24 years, the pool would grow to $2,788,676. Alas, if you
adjust that figure for a presumed 3.5 percent inflation rate over
the course of 49 years, that money would have the buying power of
only a little more than $516,000 in today's money. Put another way,
she might then invest it in a fixed-income portfolio, which would
bring her an annual income stream with the buying power of $33,540
in today's dollars. For many people, that wouldnt represent a
handsome and comfortable retirement, but for almost anybody it
would represent a wonderful start.
</P>
<P>
   One warning: in order to face the taxman with a clean
conscience, I suggest you bend over backward to assure that the
amount of work which your daughters perform to earn that $2,000 a
year is truly worth $2,000, maintaining very careful records to
demonstrate that the work was done and that their remuneration is
in line with (or less than) that of other employees who do similar
work.
</P>
<P>
   I have no quarrel with your choice of investment, and strongly
recommend that you follow precisely the same approach with your
younger daughter. Since her investment time period will be
different, the chances are that the amount of the eventual
accumulation in the two accounts will me somewhat different. But if
you chose a different investment vehicle for each child, there's a
significant chance that it might end up being very different, which
could cause dissension and unhappiness in the ranks. When I was a
boy, my father converted some warrants that came to two of my
sisters and myself into cash, and then reinvested the proceeds. For
one sister and myself, he chose a couple of good old workhorse
industrials, which plodded along predictably and unspectacularly.
But for the other sister, he took a chance on an early mutual fund
that invested in that new fad called television. In a very few
years, one sister was seeing dividends that were twentyfold those
of her siblings. She reminded us about the discrepancy, often. So
for harmonys sake, I suggest absolutely identical investment
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 50-year-old self-employed person with an income of
$40,000 to $45,000, and the only debt I have is a $438-a-month auto
loan. I think I am a fairly typical reader who is starting late
with my retirement portfolio. Starting my IRA about three years ago
I have about $3,500 each in Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury, and Janus
Equity Income funds, contributing $2,000 a year. If I want to
retire between 65 and 70, what advice can you give me to maximize
my retirement savings? Please give me some hope.
</P>
<P>
   P.F., Sandwich, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Using a $42,500 midpoint for your estimated earnings, I
calculate that you are spending 4.7 percent of your earnings on
your retirement portfolio, and 12.4 percent on your wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Do you see something out of whack?
</P>
<P>
   At the rate you are going now, you would have $110,329 in the
IRA accounts by age 65, or $190,453 at age 70, based on a
presumption of average investment returns of 10 percent a year and
continued maximum contributions.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the only hope of a substantial retirement portfolio
which I can hold out is if you fairly dramatically increase your
savings rate -- even to the point of a crash savings program. For
example, if you were to save as much for retirement as you are
spending on your auto, you could accumulate $218,544 after 15
years, or $385,525 after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Probably that's an unrealistic suggestion, but once you complete
the auto loan contract, perhaps you could resolve to try to make
that car go 200,000 miles, and to put the extra $438 a month into
retirement accounts. In the meantime, you could adopt other savings
disciplines. For one, you might set $42,500 as a base earnings
level and resolve to add any amount that you earn above that figure
to the retirement pool. Another slow-but-steady approach would be
to empty your pocket change into a jug every night, and monthly
empty the jug, roll the coins, and add the money to a retirement
account.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to save money, but all of them require the
will to save and the discipline to stick to whatever program you
establish.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with your choice of funds. The route to
success will be not to gamble on more aggressive investments, to
establish more aggressive savings patterns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I inherited $292,000 last year. My aim is to create a
portfolio that I'll tap for my retirement and the occasional (every
five to ten years) big-ticket item.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these items will probably be the down payment for a
home, which will happen within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   I am 35, single, childless (and don't plan on having children).
I havent set my heart -- or my investment objectives -- on early
retirement. I have two questions.
</P>
<P>
   The first concerns allocating money among several Vanguard
funds. I'm looking to create a portfolio that is about 80 percent
equity and 20 percent bonds. I'm willing to ride out the
vicissitudes of the market and don't plan to tap the interest this
money generates until I retire. I'm pretty thrifty and not very
materialistic, and I think I could live quite comfortably in
retirement on the equivalent of $35,000 a year in today's dollars.
I figure that would be $69,643 to $98,238, depending on whether I
retire at age 55 or 65.
</P>
<P>
   Provided I dont deplete my principal, a relatively conservative
8 percent annual return should supply this, no? To generate this I
plan to put 20 percent in Vanguard's GNMA fund, 50 percent in
Vanguard Index 500, and 10 percent each in its Mid-Cap, Small-Cap
and Total International Index funds.
</P>
<P>
   The second question involves the home down payment. Am I better
off putting, say, $40,000 in a money market fund so that I have
liquidity, or should I just pull the money out of one or more of
the stock funds when I need it? I'm leaning toward the second
option; even after paying the capital gains tax, I think I'd
probably earn more in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   P.T., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the second question, which is easier. I
strongly disagree with the idea of putting this money into stock
funds. If indeed there were a long run you might be better off
sticking with stock investments, but when it comes to investing,
two years is a short run, and your problem might just as well turn
out to be how to best take advantage of a trading loss than how to
pay the capital gains you so blithely presume would be in the
cards. If you're sure you'll be buying the home in two years
(rather than sooner), I suggest you put $36,280 in Vanguard's Prime
Money Market fund, counting on average 5 percent interest to get
you to $40,000 after 24 months. Whats the worst that can happen?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you earned 4 percent instead of 5 percent, you'd have
to dig up about $750 to get to that $40,000 down payment, which
will probably be a can-do situation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I like your idea for investing the major part
of the bequest, especially since you dont seem to be too devoted to
the idea of retiring at age 55. If you were to adopt that target,
and did achieve your target 8 percent average total returns, you
would have $1,191,899. If a fixed-income portfolio yielded 6.5
percent at that time, you would need a little less than $1,075,000
to supply your desired $69,643 annual income stream, leaving you
with but $116,899 left as a capital pool to protect you against
inflation. Your calculations were based on a presumption of 3.5
percent average inflation, and that sum would not be enough to
provide sufficient protection. Remember, the earlier you retire,
the more you need to have on hand to deal with post-retirement
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   True, you would perhaps have the prospect of Social Security in
a decade or so to bail you out, but it doesnt strike me as a
comfortable situation.
</P>
<P>
   If you retired at age 65, on the other hand, the situation would
be quite rosy, with the pool growing to $2,573,266, and only about
$1.5 million of it needed to provide your $98,238 income stream.
The balance would represent plenty of protection, and even more if
you qualified for a Social Security check.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that could upset this rather tidy applecart is
that reference early in your letter to drawing upon the nestegg for
that occasional big ticket item. My suggestion would be that since
your fortunate bequest should allow you not only to buy your first
home, but als to provide a satisfactory retirement, you establish a
modest savings program based on your current earnings, with this
designed to meet the cost of those big ticket items.

`SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS' IS JUST BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS 
Directed by: Scott Hicks 
Screenplay by: Ron Bass and Hicks, based on David Guterson's novel 
Starring: Ethan Hawke, Youki Kudoh, Rick Yune, Max Von Sydow, James
Cromwell, Richard Jenkins, James Rebhorn, Celia Weston, Sam
Shepard 
Running time: 127 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (disturbing war images, sensuality and brief strong
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somber, velvety, haunting, ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is a film
with the same gravitational pull as the novel on which it's based _
and the same moral weight, arising from its facing up to the US
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. It's a series
of interlocking mysteries that begins in fog with the death of a
fisherman in the Pacific Northwest in 1950. It ends with the
clearing away of actual and metaphorical fog and the unlocking of a
single chamber in a single human heart. In between, it transports
us to a magical world arising from novelist David Guterson's
longtime residence on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound. The
fictionalized island and its environs, where life gets pretty
primal among the fishing and berry-picking locals, is a vivid
character, too, in a film populated by characters who all leave an
imprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is the kind of richly layered film
that Hollywood seldom attempts, much less brings off. But it's more
than brought off here in grand, solid style and beautifully crafted
detail. Perhaps the most remarkable achievement of director Scott
Hicks (in his first film since ``Shine'') is his ability to make us
feel the things haunting the island and its Anglo and
Japanese-American populations. The man put on trial for the
fisherman's murder is an angry Japanese-American war veteran whose
return needles the consciences of the locals, who stood by and in
some cases even profited when the Japanese-Americans were rounded
up and shipped off to the internment camps. Although it's never
stated, we feel he's as much on trial for his race, and for the
guilt he triggers, as for the killing of which he's accused.
</P>
<P>
   Several kinds of guilt are held under the microscope here,
including the feelings arising from the thwarted love between the
Anglo son of the island's idealistic newspaper editor and a
Japanese girl who subsequently married the man now on trial. Will
Ethan Hawke's young reporter, coiled inside his own damaged soul,
pursue leads with full diligence, knowing they'll benefit a man he
views as a rival? The ideals of his late father (played warmly,
trenchantly, and with economy by Sam Shepard) are at war with his
unwillingness to let go of his memories and hopes attached to the
woman he loved (Youki Kudoh's Hatsue), but lost because post-Pearl
Harbor racism overwhelmed them. The courtroom issues, personal
issues, and larger social issues swirl transfixingly across the
screen, arising from internal and external sources, flitting
through several time periods.
</P>
<P>
   This resonant film, with its stygian blackness and grave
clarity, and its blanketing snow symbolizing the death of communal
reason and of a couple's love, will impel audiences to reflect as
well on our wartime racism. Even the film's most conventional
aspect, the courtroom drama, is both rock-solid and filled with
immediacy in its ambered way. Max Von Sydow, who plays the shrewd
and humane defense lawyer, and whose weathered face is a map of
human experience, seems the likeliest Oscar candidate in an
excellent cast that ranges from the tormented Hawke to Celia
Weston's aggrieved mother, an embodiment of racism at its most
homespun. There should be more than one nomination for ``Snow
Falling on Cedars.'' Even in this season, more bountiful than most
in films drawn from formidable literary sources, it's second to
none in its ability to specify a world and immerse us in it.

AFRICA SEEKS ITS OWN AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ African governments, skeptical of fighting AIDS
with high-cost Western drugs like AZT, have embraced another
scientific strategy in the battle against the epidemic _ the
pursuit of a workable vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries in southern and central Africa are eagerly
collaborating with foreign researchers to create or test
experimental vaccines. Some are even putting up modest amounts of
their own funding for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The push for a vaccine appeals to government officials who are
bitter about the high cost of foreign drugs and the global
imbalances in AIDS-related research. Most vaccine work is focused
on subtypes of the human immunodeficiency virus that are prevalent
in the Northern Hemisphere, while more than 90 percent of HIV
infections occur in Africa, where different strains flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only practical, affordable means to control our AIDS
epidemic over the long term is by mass vaccination,'' said Walter
Prozesky, head of the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative,
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the search for a vaccine poses problems, AIDS experts
caution, both by raising false expectations that a cure will be
available soon and by providing African governments with an excuse
for not implementing proven measures to reduce HIV infections or
break down the stigmas and taboos surrounding AIDS and sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency toward magic bullet solutions, and
vaccines are part of that,'' said Mark Lurie, a field scientist at
the African Center for Population Studies and Reproductive Heath in
Mtubatuba, South Africa. ``Vaccine research is a critical part of a
multiprong strategy against AIDS. But we haven't managed to
implement what we know works, so we rely on dreams about what might
be done in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers behind Africa's AIDS epidemic underscore the urgency
of finding more effective interventions. In Botswana, Zimbabwe,
Swaziland and Namibia, one in four adults carries the AIDS virus.
South Africa counts 1,700 new infections each day.
</P>
<P>
   Health ministers of the 14-member Southern African Development
Community, as well as Rwanda and Uganda in Central Africa, pledged
last November to make vaccine research their top scientific
priority in response to the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Most research undertaken by African countries is foreign-funded
and involves partnerships with international scientists. Uganda has
begun the first African trials of a French vaccine tested last year
in the United States. Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania have joined
hands with the National Institutes of Health in the United States.
South African researchers have teamed up with scientists in North
Carolina and hope to begin human tests next year.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts with the hostility voiced by some African leaders
to other approaches already available. Most of the governments in
the region refuse to make AZT available, even to prevent
transmission of HIV from a pregnant woman to her fetus, much less
fund their own research to satisfy their doubts about such drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the foreign-made medications is a primary concern,
health officials say. Providing a month-long course of AZT to all
pregnant women _ even at reduced prices offered by the
manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome _ would deplete government coffers at
a time when health budgets strain to cope with ailments like
tuberculosis, malaria, and malnutrition. Uganda has conducted tests
on an alternative drug called nevaripine, which costs about $4 for
a single-dose treatment for pregnant women, but regional health
ministers say even that is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, director of UNICEF, disagrees. ``It is true that
even a $4 drug treatment will challenge the health budgets of many
African countries _ but the cost of failing to introduce this
preventative regimen will be incalculably higher,'' she said
recently. ``If immediate steps are not taken to reduce the risk of
mother-to-child-transmission, already overburdened health systems
will simply be unable to cope with the needs of the huge numbers of
sick and dying young children.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, the African country most able to afford and
conduct vaccine research, has vowed to have a locally produced
vaccine available by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much time, even if everything goes well. It took 40
years to develop the polio serum, noted Saladin Osmanov, a vaccine
specialist with the UN AIDS program. Less than a year old, the
South African effort has an annual budget of about $3.5 million _
tiny by international standards.
</P>
<P>
   South Africans are closely watching as a US-made vaccine,
VaxGen's ``Aidsvax,'' undergoes final human trials. But even if it
works, it is designed for HIV subtypes prevalent in the Northern
Hemisphere and would serve only as model for vaccines against
African strains.
</P>
<P>
   Just preparing a community for human testing of a vaccine is no
simple task. Field workers have spent more than a year working in
the South African village of Hlabisa, in the province of
Kwa-Zulu/Natal. The villagers elected a community advisory board to
steer the preparatory work. Local church leaders were brought on
board. Education programs were designed for the schools. The
village had to be mapped, which meant numbering each dwelling. New
health services were introduced, including HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
   All that, without any vaccine worth testing on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vaccine initiative is about more than the vaccine,'' said
Janet Frohlich, the community liaison officer. ``Part of the
process involves educating people about expectations. They have to
understand that they may be looking at a 10-year program.''

WASHINGTON'S INTENSITY POWERS `HURRICANE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HURRICANE 
Directed by: Norman Jewison 
Screenplay by: Armyan Bernstein &AMP; Dan Gordon, based on Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter's book, ``The Sixteenth Round'' and Sam
Chatton's and Terry Swinton's book, ``Lazarus and the Hurricane'' 
Starring: Denzel Washington, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev
Schreiber, Vicellous Reon Shannon, David Paymer, Dan Hedaya, Harris
Yulin, Rod Steiger 
Running time: 146 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former New Jersey boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, now 62,
lives in Canada, a free man. How he got there, after being
imprisoned more than 19 years for a triple murder he didn't commit,
is the subject of ``The Hurricane.'' It's a big, old-fashioned
movie that could easily have collapsed under the foursquare weight
of its good intentions. That it doesn't is due largely to the
amazing concentration that Denzel Washington brings to the central
role of Carter. It's an astonishing performance, partly because
it's so devoid of histrionics, and it has Oscar nomination written
all over it.
</P>
<P>
   After a predictably kinetic beginning, in which we see ample
evidence of the knockout punch that made Carter such a formidable
middleweight, Carter himself is dealt a blow that few would have
bet he could survive. He and a fan, John Artis, are convicted of
murder in the 1966 shooting deaths of three people in a bar in
Paterson, N.J., after having first been cleared. Efficiently, the
script shows us what Carter goes in with _ toughness, and the
ability to temper his explosive urges with discipline, acquired in
the Army, where the former gang member learned to channel his fists
into boxing. It would be going too far to say that the real fight
takes place inside Carter, and that it's between rage and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   What we see instead is something more subtle and more
interesting, thanks to Washington's intensity. Most of the film is
the opposite of an action picture. It's a portrait of stoicism and
self-renewal as Washington's Carter in effect migrates to his own
interior. Drawing upon inner resources isn't a subject to which a
movie camera naturally gravitates, but in Washington's case it
does. The most powerful scene comes when Carter refuses to wear a
prison uniform and insists on retaining his own clothes, even if it
means a stretch in solitary, because in doing so he retains some of
the dignity that has been so rudely stripped from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' needs the powerful performance it gets from
Washington because, while the other actors throw themselves into
their work with the invigorating knowledge that they are fighting
the good fight, their material is limited and on the simplistic
side. That is even the case with Vicellous Reon Shannon, who plays
the young lawyer-to-be, Lesra Martin, who became not only an
impassioned advocate but a surrogate son. It's Martin, as the
semi-literate protege of a trio of social workers, who gets the
ball rolling when he buys a copy of Carter's book, ``The Sixteenth
Round,'' at a rummage sale, is moved by Carter's story of his
railroading, contacts him, and causes the case to be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' is the kind of movie that works in bold
strokes and primary colors and leaves little room for shadings. As
the trio of white Canadian activists who throw themselves into
working for Carter's release, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger,
and John Hannah are pretty much angels of mercy and nothing but.
The dynamic of their ad hoc family is left unexplored, as is the
fact of Carter's subsequent marriage to Unger's character, Lisa
Peters. Dan Hedaya, a caricature of racism as the cop who makes the
persecution of Carter his life work, does his usual job of making
five o'clock shadow stand for vindictive meanness. Apart from
Washington, only Shannon has any real chance of seeming emotionally
dimensionalized, and he makes the most of it in this film that
clearly sorts out the good guys from the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably the fact that Canada plays such a positive role in
the story of Rubin Carter (he has lived there since his release)
provided added motivation for filmmaker Norman Jewison, who was
born there, and who previously explored race-centric themes in ``In
the Heat of the Night'' and ``A Soldier's Story.'' Not that Jewison
is so xenophobic as to refrain from spotlighting Bob Dylan's song,
``Hurricane,'' on the soundtrack. There's a certain
over-earnestness in this film, and more than a few compromises and
generous helpings of dramatic license. But its celebration of a
spirit that refused to go down for the count is the important thing
here, and Washington gets it shiningly right.

A PLAY LOOKS INTO AMERICA'S INFAMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In America's internal politics, Feb. 19, 1942, is a day
that will live in infamy. It was on that day, 2 1/2 months after
Pearl Harbor, that President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive
Order 9066, paving the way for authorities to ``detain'' 120,000
Japanese-Americans in concentration camps in the western United
States, lest they betray the country.
</P>
<P>
   Next to slavery and taking land from the Native Americans, this
was the most racist act sanctioned by the federal government. No
such action was taken against German-American or Italian-American
citizens, and even liberals like Earl Warren, as attorney general
and governor of California, went along with it. Playwright Philip
Kan Gotanda, whose parents were interned, is one of a generation of
Japanese-American artists who have attempted to bring the camps out
of the shadows of American history and shed some light on what that
experience has meant to Japanese-American identity.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Gotanda dramatizes not the horrific experiences of
the camps but the immediate aftermath, when the detainees were
released after World War II, in ``Sisters Matsumoto,'' which is
receiving its East Coast premiere in a fine staging at the
Huntington Theatre Company.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself is more problematic. Gotanda dexterously guides
us into the specifics of time and place and sets up the terms of
the debate in such a way that we identify with each of the
well-drawn characters and wonder which part of the spectrum we
would have been. Gone is the patriarch, the father of the three
sisters, who, in his misguided faith in America, counseled
compliance with the camps and was left a broken man who died after
being beaten up in one of them. When the sisters return to the
family farm, the oldest, Grace, is determined to put the past
behind and get on with life while paying attention to ethnic
traditions. Chiz, the middle sister, is an out-and-out
assimilationist, while the youngest is in a state of depression,
having lost her fiance in one of the Japanese-American platoons
assigned to the front as cannon fodder. Of the two husbands, one is
a Japanese nationalist; the other is a jokester who, ironically,
voices most of the play's anger at what the government did to them.
</P>
<P>
   As the play progresses through the first act, ``Sisters
Matsumoto'' loses much of the schematic characterization, thanks in
part to the talents of director Sharon Ott and the acting ensemble,
particularly Kim Miyori and Christine Toy Johnson as the two older
sisters. Kate Edmunds's interior of the farmhouse captures the
compassion in Gotanda's writing, and Nancy Schertler's lighting
evokes changes in mood along with time of day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gotanda makes us feel the warmth within the family, he
doesn't find the heat that would spark the play into much more than
a recapitulation of the terms of debate. Gotanda seems to be using
the play to work through his own ambivalence at a country that
treated his innocent parents like pariahs and then rolled out the
affirmative-action red carpet to him and other professionals in his
generation. In either case, the color of his skin was paramount and
the issues of identity are anything but clearcut.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Gotanda doesn't seek any simplistic answers to
define the ``right'' attitude to America or Japanese-American
identity, then or now. On the other hand, ``Sisters Matsumoto''
cries for a stronger authorial voice to take control of the
situation rather than dish out indomitable-spirit cliches like
stick together, find common ground, and work hard.
</P>
<P>
   The outright naturalism of the play seems to be new territory
for Gotanda, who in past plays and interviews, eschews such plays
in favor of more poetic and less realistic storytelling. Clearly he
hasn't mastered the form as ``Sisters Matsumoto'' unfolds like
``Three Sisters'' without the poetry or ``Awake and Sing'' without
the singing (though the period Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller music
cast a wry commentary). Nor, really, is there much drama. The
reconciliations are utterly predictable, as is the one white
character's betrayal. Gotanda has put down writing for television
and movies, but ``Sisters Matsumoto'' is awfully Hallmark Hall of
Fame-ish.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, ``Sisters Matsumoto'' does have a strong heart
and doesn't wear it on its sleeve. Together with that, the acting
and the production values make this a rewarding trip in American
history (the program notes are superb) even if it may not prove to
be a deeply memorable one.

SEASON OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is no time to miss your number.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings season is upon us again and these quarterly
numbers will face particularly close scrutiny. Disappointments,
like a few announced in advance this week, may be dealt with
harshly.
</P>
<P>
   The action begins in earnest next week and will stretch into
early February. For a warm-up, watch how the market treats Lucent
Technologies Inc., following a late warning Thursday that quarterly
results would fail to meet forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The market's new worries over rising interest rates and the
ballooning valuation of some stocks, particularly technology
issues, during the final quarter of 1999 demand strong bottom-line
performance to continue to support share prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's really important to hit the numbers,'' said Stephen
Demirjian, who invests in small stocks at Westfield Capital
Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Fourth-quarter earnings forecasts by brokerage
analysts for companies locally and across the nation are generally
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind is at our backs right now,'' said Ned Riley, chief
investment officer of State Street Global Advisors. ``The
environment couldn't be any better for most industries.''
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Capital survey of forecasts for earnings among the 100
largest Massachusetts companies each tracked by at least one
analyst, conducted for us by First Call Corp. of Boston, is mostly
rosy. It forecasts profits exceeding those for the same period of
1998 or improvements over year-ago losses in three out of every
four cases.
</P>
<P>
   Among all stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, earnings
will jump by about 17.5 percent for the year, according to Chuck
Hill, director of research at First Call. That's ahead of the 3.7
percent increase in 1998 and the S&AMP;P's historical annual
improvement of about 7 percent. The early forecast for 2000:
profits will rise about 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half the earnings are really pretty much in the
bag,'' said Hill. ``The expectations for the second half are good,
but that's certainly dependent on what the Fed does in the
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks will remain in the spotlight not only because
of their high prices but also because of their track record
delivering on high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will generate annual profit
increases of at least 30 percent for 1999 and earnings will
probably rise about 24 percent in the year ahead, according to
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: There is so little room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations have been elevated to almost a perfection-type
environment,'' said Riley. ``When there's something less than
perfection, the market is not very forgiving and takes its wrath
out on individual stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   So now those individual companies have to perform again. But
reading the significance of corporate earnings reports for any
single quarter or year-to-year changes can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. of Andover, which owns interests in dozens of Internet
companies, reports wildly varying quarterly profits and losses
based on stock transactions, big investments, and other special
circumstances. Over the last quarter, CMGI spent huge sums on its
AltaVista unit, which it plans to take public this year.
</P>
<P>
   Very young companies, particularly the crop of Massachusetts
firms that launched initial public stock offerings in 1999, often
are expected to post quarterly losses as they build business. In
many cases, the amount of revenues they produce is at least as
important as the bottom line in evaluating progress.
</P>
<P>
   But for most companies, profit numbers speak for themselves and
investors know what they want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology Corp. of Waltham waited until the market
closed on Monday to announce that revenues from an older line of
its engineering software would fall short of expectations and drag
earnings down below forecasts. The immediate reaction: Parametric
shares plunged 20 percent the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, earnings surprises can work both ways. PeopleSoft
Inc. told investors Thursday that its business-management software
products may have generated fourth-quarter results that beat Wall
Street expectations for sales and profits. The stock jumped
immediately and finished Thursday up 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors such as Demirjian who like smaller
companies said the weeks ahead may be unusually pleasant for some
stocks that exceed earnings forecasts. He said small high-tech
stocks have been clubbed almost across the board this week and
those companies that produce strong profits may look like better
buys.

 &HT;    BRITISH TV PERSONALITY'S MYSTERIOUS MURDER STILL STUMPS
INVESTIGATORS
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Eight months after the mysterious murder of one of
Britain's most beloved television personalities, Scotland Yard
remains short of clear suspects mired in inconclusive leads.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Dando, 37, died instantly April 26 when she was shot once
in the head with a 9mm pistol at the front door of her house in
London's trendy Fulham district. In addition to anchoring the BBC's
Six O'Clock news, Dando also hosted two popular weekly shows _ the
detective series, Crimewatch, and the travel show, Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The murder and its implications about the cost of fame still
trouble TV personalities here. ``When you are in people's living
rooms, there is always the risk of attracting unwanted attention,''
said Sue Barker, a BBC sportscaster and Dando's friend. ``If you do
a job like mine _ and I love what I do _ you can't live your life
constantly looking over your shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the shooting took place in broad daylight, there
were no witnesses. Neighbors reported seeing more than 20 men who
seemed even a little suspicious _ leads still being followed by
police.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Scotland Yard said it will send investigators to the
United States to consult with FBI ballistic and forensic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul Conlan, the longtime Scotland Yard chief, lists the
unsolved case among the major frustrations that will haunt him
after he retires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the privilege and joy of knowing Jill,'' Conlan told The
Evening Standard. ``If you know the victim the challenge seems that
much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Conlan is convinced that the killer will not go unpunished.
``This case is solvable _ and it will be solved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Scotland
Yard has spent more than $60,000 a week investigating what a police
agency spokesman describes as ``thousands of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to establish a clear motive for the killing.
Dando wasn't robbed, and there was no apparent burglary of the
home. Some investigators have speculated that she may have been the
victim of a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of progress, detectives met secretly in
mid-December at a London hotel to assess where the investigation
was heading, according to local press reports. The meeting also was
meant to bring in the probe's new chief, Brian Moore, a former
undercover investigator assigned to target police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These days investigators are focused on records of mobile phone
calls made in the area the day Dando was killed. An estimated
10,000 calls were made in the heavily populated neighborhood that
day, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the killer made at least one call soon after
the shooting. Witnesses reported seeing a man talking on a mobile
phone between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. outside Dando's home. A
sweating man later was seen talking into a phone as he ran up a
street away from the scene of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Police found six distinctive marks on the cartridge case of the
fatal bullet. Experts believe the round may have been tampered
with, possibly to reduce the amount of powder to deaden the sound
of the blast. Neighbors told police they heard no shot, only a
scream.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard detectives will consult with U.S. ballistic
experts about the type of gun used in the attack and the apparent
modification of the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Conlan denied that the force's decision to seek help in
the United States represents an act of desperation. ``There's a
premier league of police forces around the world,'' he said. ``The
FBI and the (Metropolitan Police) are world players. We work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 20 years to catch the Uni-bomber in the United States.
We will keep looking for Jill's killer until he is found.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four months before the shooting, Dando became engaged to
gynecologist Alan
</P>
<P>
   Farthing. They were to be married in September. On the day of
her shooting, she reportedly told Farthing's mother that she
planned to spend the day planning for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually got today free, and I'm going to look through
some honeymoon details,'' she is reported to have told Farthing.
</P>
<P>
   But as she returned home in the late morning, she was shot at
close range on her doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden, violent death left all of Britain stunned. Queen
Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair immediately issued
statements of shock and horror. Within hours, mourners began
visiting the tree-lined avenue where she lived to lay flowers and
notes. It reminded many of the country's response to the death of
Princess Diana, who was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jill was a princess among ordinary people,'' Bob Wheaton, her
former BBC producer and onetime boyfriend, said at the time.
``Wherever she went, she left the same impression _ a warm, kind
and gentle person who cared.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S WAR BOGS DOWN IN CHECHNYA
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ While Russian leaders make bold predictions of imminent
victory in Chechnya, in reality the fight for control over the
rebellious republic is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military commanders temporary halted the intensive air
and artillery bombardment of the breakaway republic on Friday, but
kept up the ground offensive in the capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   An alleged use of chemical weapons by Islamic separatists, which
could harm civilians in the shattered city, led to the decision,
Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, deputy commander of Russian forces in the
region, said according to the news agency ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   But the same allegations have been leveled against the Russian
military by the rebel. Claims on neither side have been verified.
</P>
<P>
   In its three-month-old campaign to subdue rebel troops, the
Russian air force has bombed unrelentingly Chechnya's northern
lowlands, causing mass civilian evacuations, while the
50,000-strong army has romped across the territory of 5,000 square
miles (about half the size of Maryland).
</P>
<P>
   By Christmas, Russian commanders claimed they controlled
two-thirds of Chechnya, including its second-largest city,
Gudermes, and were closing in on Grozny. Generals said they had the
core of the rebel forces, estimated at between 10,000 to 15,000
men, running for mountain hideouts along Chechnya's southern
border, located between the Caspian and Black seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Grozny's liberation should take a matter of
days. The question of the liberation of the rest of the Chechen
territory is a matter of weeks,'' said Gen. Valery Manilov, the
first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff.
</P>
<P>
   But what was first painted to be a rout now resembles the same
disastrous war of attrition that killed at least 30,000 soldiers
and civilians during Russia's first Chechen conflict from 1994 to
1996. That ill-fated war which pitted mostly poorly trained and fed
Russian army recruits against hard-nosed Chechen guerrillas who
were fighting from independence from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, the army has run into fierce resistance from
the rebel forces, which appear to have halted the Russian advance
on the rebels' two largest strongholds, Grozny and the mountain
ranges. On Wednesday, the rebels beat the Russian army out of
Alkhan-Kala and another smaller village, which had been under
Russian control for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rebels say a ``turning point'' has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period of the Russian army's triumphant march through
Chechnya is over,'' said Chechen presidential administration chief
Apti Batalov on Wednesday. ``A turning point in the second war in
Chechnya is about to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   This could mean bad news for Russia's acting president, Vladimir
Putin. The Chechen campaign has brought him power and a wave of
popularity that right now looks strong enough to sweep the
country's presidential election scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Putin obviously would like to declare victory in Chechnya before
the elections _ just as the outnumbered rebels would like to turn
the tide of the fighting in hopes ending the conflict before that
time, said Moscow military analyst Pavel Flegenhauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dejected and impoverished population wants something to
cheer about. They don't want to look at body bags,'' Flegenhauer
said. ``The longer this goes on, the bloodier it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Russian commanders have blamed their setbacks this week
on severe weather and heavy fog, which have grounded their planes,
the most efficient line of attack against Chechen targets. First
Deputy Interior Minister Valery Fyodorov, whose troops are
spearheading Russian attacks
</P>
<P>
   in Grozny and are bearing the brunt of losses in recent fighting
in the city, announced on Thursday that ``The anti-terrorist
operation is going according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though former Russian president Boris Yeltsin
declared on the same day during a trip to Jerusalem that the
campaign would be over in one month, Fyodorov pointedly would not
give an estimate on the end of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officials, meanwhile, shed the bravado and grimly
agree with the rebels' assessment of a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders at the military headquarters in Mozdok,
Russia, some 100 miles north of Grozny, have admitted that rebels
sneaked behind Russian lines and set fire Tuesday to a Russian
field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also been mining roads behind Russian lines, and
Russian platoons say ambushes are a ``direct threat.'' Russian
commanders have warned their troops that the rebels may try to send
small groups of saboteurs disguised as civilians into
Russian-controlled settlements, like Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, the Associated Press quoted one Russian
paratrooper fighting rebels in the hills saying he expected ``tough
fighting ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to defeat the rebels with aircraft and armor.
We will have to go there (into the mountains) on foot. And it will
take a long time,'' said Lt. Col. Mikhail Sukhovskoy, commander of
a paratroop battalion.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' tactics are the same that they used to bring about
an end to the first Chechen War: inflict high casualties on Russian
troops and hope that doing so will bring about a stalemate on the
battlefield and a change of Russian public opinion against the war.
</P>
<P>
   The first war began when Moscow attempted to crush the Chechen
struggle for national independence. When the death toll for the
army reached unacceptable levels, the Kremlin decided to sign a
hastily constructed peace accord just before presidential elections
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim period, Russia did little to rebuild
infrastructure like factories, schools and hospitals destroyed in
Chechnya during the fighting. Unemployment has run high, as has
lawlessness, with a handful of rebel commanders setting up fiefdoms
within the state and ruling with the power of their weapons kept
from the first conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen forces now fighting the Russians are a minority of
the population, a group headed by two leaders, a Chechen named
Shamil Basayev and an Arabian called Khattab, who is a follower of
the Islamic sect called Wahabbism.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, the Russian side has refused to begin
peace talks with any Chechen commander or official, including the
elected president Aslan Maskhadov. How much control he wields with
the rebel forces and armed clans is unknown. Putin said this week
that he doesn't
</P>
<P>
   rule out talks, but refused to say whom he would deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Independent observers say the Russian side has no other viable
exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started a military campaign, but we haven't defined what
it means to win. Putting a flag in the ground in Grozny won't end
this,'' said Yuri Levada, the head of Moscow's Public Opinion
Institute. ``Putin can't count on this event to end the war. He
must start thinking about talks.''

 &HT;    BRITISH TV PERSONALITY'S MYSTERIOUS MURDER STILL STUMPS
INVESTIGATORS
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   LONDON _ Eight months after the mysterious murder of one of
Britain's most beloved television personalities, Scotland Yard
remains short of clear suspects mired in inconclusive leads.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Dando, 37, died instantly April 26 when she was shot once
in the head with a 9mm pistol at the front door of her house in
London's trendy Fulham district. In addition to anchoring the BBC's
Six O'Clock news, Dando also hosted two popular weekly shows _ the
detective series, Crimewatch, and the travel show, Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The murder and its implications about the cost of fame still
trouble TV personalities here. ``When you are in people's living
rooms, there is always the risk of attracting unwanted attention,''
said Sue Barker, a BBC sportscaster and Dando's friend. ``If you do
a job like mine _ and I love what I do _ you can't live your life
constantly looking over your shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the shooting took place in broad daylight, there
were no witnesses. Neighbors reported seeing more than 20 men who
seemed even a little suspicious _ leads still being followed by
police.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Scotland Yard said it will send investigators to the
United States to consult with FBI ballistic and forensic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul Conlan, the longtime Scotland Yard chief, lists the
unsolved case among the major frustrations that will haunt him
after he retires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the privilege and joy of knowing Jill,'' Conlan told The
Evening Standard. ``If you know the victim the challenge seems that
much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Conlan is convinced that the killer will not go unpunished.
``This case is solvable _ and it will be solved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Scotland
Yard has spent more than $60,000 a week investigating what a police
agency spokesman describes as ``thousands of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to establish a clear motive for the killing.
Dando wasn't robbed, and there was no apparent burglary of the
home. Some investigators have speculated that she may have been the
victim of a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of progress, detectives met secretly in
mid-December at a London hotel to assess where the investigation
was heading, according to local press reports. The meeting also was
meant to bring in the probe's new chief, Brian Moore, a former
undercover investigator assigned to target police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These days investigators are focused on records of mobile phone
calls made in the area the day Dando was killed. An estimated
10,000 calls were made in the heavily populated neighborhood that
day, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the killer made at least one call soon after
the shooting. Witnesses reported seeing a man talking on a mobile
phone between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. outside Dando's home. A
sweating man later was seen talking into a phone as he ran up a
street away from the scene of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Police found six distinctive marks on the cartridge case of the
fatal bullet. Experts believe the round may have been tampered
with, possibly to reduce the amount of powder to deaden the sound
of the blast. Neighbors told police they heard no shot, only a
scream.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard detectives will consult with U.S. ballistic
experts about the type of gun used in the attack and the apparent
modification of the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Conlan denied that the force's decision to seek help in
the United States represents an act of desperation. ``There's a
premier league of police forces around the world,'' he said. ``The
FBI and the (Metropolitan Police) are world players. We work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 20 years to catch the Uni-bomber in the United States.
We will keep looking for Jill's killer until he is found.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four months before the shooting, Dando became engaged to
gynecologist Alan
</P>
<P>
   Farthing. They were to be married in September. On the day of
her shooting, she reportedly told Farthing's mother that she
planned to spend the day planning for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually got today free, and I'm going to look through
some honeymoon details,'' she is reported to have told Farthing.
</P>
<P>
   But as she returned home in the late morning, she was shot at
close range on her doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden, violent death left all of Britain stunned. Queen
Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair immediately issued
statements of shock and horror. Within hours, mourners began
visiting the tree-lined avenue where she lived to lay flowers and
notes. It reminded many of the country's response to the death of
Princess Diana, who was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jill was a princess among ordinary people,'' Bob Wheaton, her
former BBC producer and onetime boyfriend, said at the time.
``Wherever she went, she left the same impression _ a warm, kind
and gentle person who cared.''

&HT;     BOGUS TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki's political hero, Teddy
Roosevelt, was nothing if not a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful politician,'' TR once said, ``is he who
says what everybody is thinking most often and in the loudest
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark crossed my mind the other day in New York's Assembly
chamber as I heard Pataki, in his latest State of the State
address, pledge once more to cut taxes _ especially on business and
especially upstate, where job creation lags behind both the rest of
the Empire State and the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It was toasty inside the state Capitol's newly restored Assembly
chamber but bitterly cold outside. It'll be a far colder day,
though, before this governor misses a chance to extol the virtues
of tax cuts. And it's not as though New Yorkers can't use them. The
state ranks first in the country in combined per capita state and
local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that New York is well back in the national pack
on state taxes and at the top of the heap in local taxes. New
Yorkers pay two-thirds more than the national average in property
taxes, and cutting state business taxes probably has less to do
with stimulating job creation than a hefty cut in the top bracket
of the state income tax. After all, the people with the power to
make decisions on job creation and business location tend to be
people with high incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But pushing for a cut in income tax rates for the prosperous is
political suicide in a 5-3 Democratic state like New York. You want
tax cuts for the rich, Governor? Hey, here's the door; don't let it
smack you in the butt on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is right when he calls for an end to regressive taxes
like the gross receipts tax on energy use, which afflicts human
beings as well as businesses. This tax murders manufacturing. If
you operate a business in New York where you have to turn on big
machines every day, you know how outrageous electricity costs are.
Part of that is the result of decades of rotten regulation of the
electrical generation industry, but killing this tax won't hurt a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governor also wants to cut taxes for small
businesses, for farms and for railroads. To the extent that this
stimulates job growth, fine. But tax cuts like this need to be
assessed in context. And the relevant context is that business pays
a far smaller share of the total New York state tax dollar today
than it did a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the state budget of 1959-60, businesses directly supplied 25
cents of every state tax dollar while individuals directly paid 36
cents. The rest came from various taxes that affect businesses and
consumers in varying measure. Businesses, for example, pay about 25
percent of New York state's sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rockefeller thought businesses were paying too much, so
he took action to reduce their share. That trend continued after he
left office, and _ for a variety of complex reasons _ has been
mirrored across the nation. By the New York state budget of
1991-92, the share paid by individuals had gone up 47 percent and
the share paid by businesses had dipped 17 percent. That ratio has
stayed pretty much the same since Pataki was elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point? Simply that cutting taxes to stimulate
economic growth is complicated and that New York's real tax crisis
resides at the local level, in a stunning overabundance of town
halls and school district offices. For historical reasons _ because
of political boundaries created centuries ago to conform to
economic boundaries that no longer exist _ New Yorkers suffer from
having way too much local government killing private sector
employment. In metro Albany alone, a region of not quite 1 million
people, the taxpayers support 770 separate local taxing units.
</P>
<P>
   What's really interesting is that the vast majority of the local
officials in these little, conspicuously redundant governments are
Republicans, members of the political party supposedly most
fervently devoted to tax-cutting. Not if cutting taxes means losing
their lip lock on the public teat, though.
</P>
<P>
   Mention consolidation of local governments or school districts,
and these local Republican politicians howl about the evils of
centralized government in Eastern Europe before communism failed.
They explode with dire warnings that the same horrible thing could
happen in New York if the vestigial local government that pays
their salaries should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact is that politicians never really cut taxes. They
just rearrange them.

far has quietly doled out nearly $500,000 to her party's
candidates, mostly women, minorities and those in tight House
races. If Democrats grab control of the House, Pelosi hopes to call

&HT;     FILTERS MAY CUT COST OF DRINKING WATER WHILE IMPROVING TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you have been investing in bottled water, you
may be able to reduce expenses by using a water filter to make your
water taste mountain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The average person needs two quarts of water per day, but many
of us fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Water filters can be costly to install in your home and not an
option if you rent an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Water filtration pitchers, such as those by Brita or Pur,
improve the taste and quality of household tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Brita says its water filtration pitcher reduces 99 percent of
chlorine (which can impair taste and odor), lead, bad tastes, odor,
copper and water hardness (as well as the chalky, scale buildup in
appliances) at a fraction of the cost of bottled water. A
replacement filter costs less than 20 cents per gallon of water
purified.
</P>
<P>
   It will not remove microbes or disinfect water that hasn't been
sufficiently treated. Those who require water of special purity
should follow the advice of a doctor or local health official.
</P>
<P>
   Filtered water is not recommended for fish, as some fish are
very sensitive to silver and/or changes in pH, but it can be used
on plants and flowers. The water pitcher filtration system also
softens tap water without adding sodium.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: The upper tier of the pitcher holds tap
water until it flows through a carbon and resin filter, which it
houses in a reservoir between the top and filtered water in the
base.
</P>
<P>
   Filtering one quart of water takes approximately three to five
minutes. If your water is hard, or contains sediment and particles,
the filter should be changed more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Brita water pitchers, which cost $26, and replacement filters
($7.99 for a single filter or $19.99 for a three pack), can be
found in grocery, drug, discount, health food, department, hardware
and warehouse club stores.
</P>
<P>
   Pur's product costs are similar.

   MIDEAST-TALKS _ SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton brought
Israeli and Syrian negotiators together for face-to-face talks
Friday, and presented them with a detailed document as a starting
point for areas of agreement and disagreement between the two
Mideast foes. A week of sensitive talks were expected to pause for
religious observances by both groups on Saturday and resume

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA _ MOSCOW _ Two weeks ago, the Russian military
began an all-out aasault on the Chechen capital Grozny stating that
they would take control of the city in two to three weeks. That
didn't happen, and military leaders are coming dangerously close to
having egg on their faces. Worse, the longer the war goes on, the
more it resembles the 1994-96 fiasco. Developing. (Coker, Cox News

   BRITAIN-DANDO _ LONDON _ Last April, an unidentified killer shot
popular television personality Jill Dando in the face at nearly
point blank range. The shooting took place at the front door of her
apartment in a trendy London neighborhood. Some investigators
believe the 37-year-old star was killed by a stalker, while others
believe she was the victim of a professional hit. While they have
plenty of theories, police have few hard pieces of evidence.
Scotland Yard is sending a team of detectives to the United States
to seek the help of American ballistic and forensic experts.

   TEXAS-EXAMS _ A federal judge in San Antonio is expected to rule
today on a two-year-old suit that alleges Texas' requirement to
pass TAAS to graduate discriminates against minority students. The
ruling could have broad implications, from the root of Texas'
accountability system to the presidential campaign trail. The exam
is a centerpiece of Gov. George W. Bush's education program.

   FLA-DEATH _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Republican lawmakers scrambled
Friday to round up the votes to pass a law that would allow the
state to kill its Death Row inmates quicker, even if it meant
taking a lawmaker away from his sister's funeral. Chartered planes
_ paid for by the state Republican Party _ were dispatched across
the state to bring GOP lawmakers to Tallahassee to vote. One was at
his sister's funeral. Another at the birth of his first child. Two
were ill. Supporters _ who need 2/3 majorities in both chambers to
approve laws that would change court appellate procedures _ say the
average of 14 years of appeals of Death Row inmates is an insult to
their victims and should be shortened to 5. On Thursday, lawmakers
in both chambers overwhelmingly approved

   FLAGFIGHT _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The South Carolina Heritage
Coalition is planning a big march in support of the Confederate

only to make both sides in the debate dig in their heels. (Burritt,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FLU-GEORGIA _ Flu, the last, uninvited guest of the holidays, is
moving into Georgia. In the past two weeks, Georgia was upgraded to
having a ``regional'' problem with the illness - causing almost 8
percent of hospital cases. (Lore, Atlanta journal-Constitution).

   GA-TEENDRIVING _ Gov. Roy Barnes elevated the debate over
raising the teen driving age this week by asserting that he
supports the idea of making Georgia teenagers wait until they're 17
to get a driver's license. He says too many teenagers have been
involved in serious accidents at younger ages, and have proven that
there are problems with maturity and experience. Lt. Gov. Mark
Taylor also is receptive to the idea of increasing the driving age,
and a Cobb Republican has introduced a bill to do just that. If
Barnes weighs in to try to push the legislation through, it could
put him on a collision course with House Democratic leaders, who
don't want the change. (Pruitt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ U.S. job growth accelerated at the
fastest pace in five months in December as wages also registered
strong gains, bolstering expectations the Fed will raise interest
rates next month. Nonfarm payrolls grew a surprising 315,000 after
a revised 222,000 increase in November. The unemployment rate was
unchanged at 4.1 percent but only because of a change in the
government's method of making seasonal adjustments; without the
changes the rate would have dropped to 4 percent. Average hourly
wages, meanwhile, climbed 6 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $13.46,
slightly higher than expected. Investors, who apparently factored
in a rate increase, sent stocks higher. Bond prices slipped. By

 &HT;    FOR U.S. TAXPAYER, PRICE OF PEACE IN MIDEAST AT $20 BILLION -
AND CLIMBING
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 9 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton spent last week
shuttling from Washington to this rustic hamlet on the Potomac,
trying to help broker an end to half a century of Israeli-Syrian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he focused on the diplomacy of ending war, though,
Clinton began the political work of preparing the American people
for the cost of peace.
</P>
<P>
   For if Clinton succeeds in his highest foreign policy ambition _
the cementing of an overall peace accord between Israel and its
Arab foes _ U.S. taxpayers will get hit with a sizeable bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tab could well top $20 billion, analysts say, to help
strengthen Israeli security and resettle Jewish residents from
lands Israel would relinquish under the group of peace accords
Clinton backs.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military personnel, possibly even troops, could be deployed
to help police the peace, putting Americans at risk in a region
where suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism have become a
tragic part of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Clinton's challenge, even as he works to bring the
conflicted parties together around the contentious issues dividing
them, is to convince Americans that the price of Mideast peace is a
cost worth bearing.
</P>
<P>
   That became part of the message last week emanating from every
corner of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, the point was made by National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Pentagon spokesman Craig Quigley and even Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some costs,'' Clinton told reporters in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start working on that and figuring out what the
specific jobs are that we would be asked to help finance, whether
we could get any others to help, and over how many years it would
have to be done,'' Clinton said. ``Then I'll have to go talk to the
Congress. And I'm just not in a position to say what dollar amount
I would ask our Congress for.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs of peace, in fact, are a central point of negotiation
in any set of peace talks among the United States, Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Israel received $1.2 billion in U.S. military aid as part of the
interim peace agreements Clinton brokered at the Wye River
Plantation in October 1998 between Israel and the Palestinians. The
Palestinians were promised $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   After President Jimmy Carter brokered peace between Israel and
Egypt in the 1978 Camp David accords, the United States paid
hundreds of millions of dollars to, in effect, compensate Israel
for returning to Cairo's control territory on the Sinai Peninsula
that Israeli troops had occupied for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is in addition to the roughly $3 billion in U.S.
military and economic aid Israel receives each year.
</P>
<P>
   As the ante for the current round of Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
Barak has asked Clinton for $17 billion worth of military and
resettlement aid in connection with the Syrian portion of the talks
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Peace will require Barak to give back to Syria strategic
territory that Israeli troops seized when the two countries fought
a war in 1967. That territory, the Golan Heights, is now inhabited
by an estimated 16,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll want compensation for every one of those people, and
they'll be asking for compensation in the neighborhood of $1
million apiece,'' said Middle East expert Richard Curtiss, a former
U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will also seek compensation, Curtiss said, for the far
greater number _ perhaps 160,000 _ of Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank territories Israel is handing over to
Palestinian control as part of its peace agreement with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also claiming that giving up the Golan Heights and
large parts of the West Bank have the potential of making the
country vulnerable to Arab attack. In return, Israel is seeking
additional U.S. military aid and security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will want some sort of guarantee that they will remain
superior to any combination of Arab forces after this is over,''
said Curtiss, editor of the Washington Report on Middle East
Affairs. ``We'd be talking about more tanks, improved radar of all
kinds, they might even want to have their own surveillance
satellite over the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is also seeking U.S. troops to help police the Golan and
take over the operation of spy stations there that now allow Israel
to eavesdrop on Syrian military movements and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that isn't on the table,'' Quigley told
reporters at the Pentagon last week.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Quigley insisted that the whole subject of increased
U.S. military aid to Israel is ``a work in progress,'' he made
clear that the role would expand as part of any comprehensive peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in our nation's interest, it's in the region's
interest, it's in the world's interest to have that part of the
world, the Middle East, be a peaceful place,'' said Quigley. ``And
we, the United States, have made a commitment to do that, to be a
very substantive part of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his case to Congress, Clinton will be aided by the
influential pro-Israel lobby, particularly in a year when all
members of the House and one-third of the Senate face elections.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of bloodshed and enmity in the oil-rich Middle
East, the argument in favor of investing in peace seems clear
enough to the people who have looked closely at the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing down tensions in a region of the world that has
something like two-thirds of the world's oil reserves is a good
idea,'' said University of California at Santa Cruz professor Alan
Richards, an expert in Middle East economics.
</P>
<P>
   In a region that's holy to three of the world's great religions,
however, there's an argument that transcends dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the oldest, nastiest conflicts in the world,''
said Richards. ``It's naive to think that it's going to end, but it
certainly would be criminally negligent not to seize any
opportunity to lessen tensions.''

&HT;     VERSATILITY IS GOOD RECIPE IN KITCHEN DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Today's kitchen reflects growth, sociability,
individuality and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Larger kitchens feature multiple sinks, desks, televisions,
computers and entertainment centers, according to the National
Association of the Remodeling Industry.
</P>
<P>
   So many new features and functions call for various counter
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Multilevel, solid-surface counter tops and islands provide the
necessary heights to accommodate various functions and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The staggered wall cabinets create visual interest and let cooks
of different sizes and ages find their own comfort zones, according
to the Maytag Kitchen Design Center. A 30-inch-high cutting board
at the end of a work island is practical for children and is
wheelchair-accessible.
</P>
<P>
   A multilevel island or peninsula accommodates all family members
and the stepped-back partition keeps mealtime clutter out of view.
</P>
<P>
   In appliances, cooktops are lower for better visibility and to
help cooks reach back burners. Dishwashers are higher, creating
better access to controls, less strain on the back and easier
loading and unloading. The 42-inch counter above the raised
dishwasher is at an ideal height for the microwave oven. The area
below the dishwasher can store flat items.
</P>
<P>
   Sinks also are installed at different heights for better access.
As a bonus, the lower sink allows for a longer window so the entire
family can enjoy the view.
</P>
<P>
   Multitiered islands, comfortable for various heights, often
feature a small prep sink with a lever mounted on the side of the
faucet for easier reach.
</P>
<P>
   The key to planning a new kitchen or remodeling an existing one
is to think about family members and how they will be using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any eating space should be 12 inches higher than the seat of
the chair,'' said David DeNofio, division manager of Terminal
Millwork Inc. in Albany. The universal seat height of a chair is 18
inches, a counter stool is usually 24 inches high and a bar stool
is 30 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The standard kitchen counter top is 36 inches high, according to
interior designer Denise Maurer of Troy, and would call for a
24-inch stool. A 30-inch bar stool would require a 42-inch bar top.
</P>
<P>
   To create a multilevel look in a kitchen with little space or
counter top, laminate a flea market table top to match your counter
top.
</P>
<P>
   Counter tops are one of the easiest and most dramatic ways to
give a fresh new look to your kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Decide which surface materials work best for you.
</P>
<P>
   Granite is the most expensive, at approximately $75 to $200 per
square foot, but shopping around and exploring all granite
materials may get you an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike acrylic resins, which are sold by the linear foot,
granite is sold by either the square foot or the job, and all
edgework is sold by the linear foot, said James Nass, manager of
Capital Stone in the Albany suburb of Colonie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is also affected by the amount of custom work, such
as shapes, radius cuts and corners,'' Nass said. ``It's heavy to
work with, and all of the cuts are made with diamonds, making the
tooling work expensive. The typical templated granite counter top
leaving here costs between $100 and $110 per square foot
installed.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to granite is that scratches are hard to repair and
it doesn't seam perfectly, like solid-surface materials. Chips are
fairly easy to repair, Nass said.
</P>
<P>
   To save on the cost of granite, do just one section in the stone
and the rest in another material, such as 4-inch backsplashes in
tile, Nass suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Although the color and pattern run through the entire thickness
of granite, it may be inconsistent. Granite mainly comes in dark
colors with no solids or whites.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is stone and stone is porous, granite may stain.
According to DeNofio, something as simple as a potato chip will
stain a granite counter.
</P>
<P>
   Granite, which is made of igneous rocks (quartz, feldspar and
mica) should be coated with a Silicone sealer every three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic resin counter tops, which come in more than 65 colors
and finishes, from faux marble to granite, can be easily repaired
by either buffing out a small nick or gluing in a new pie-shaped
piece and buffing the seam out till it is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic resin is seamless, nonporous and easy to clean with
ordinary abrasive cleaner or sandpaper, as the color and pattern
run all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic resins can also be seamed into the sink, eliminating
metal edges or water seepage. It is chip- and crack-resistant.
Accidental cuts, burns and scratches are easily sanded away with
fine sandpaper. Drainboard grooves can also be routed into the
acrylic resin or thermoformed to create designs.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular brand, DuPont's Corian, costs between $110 and
$175 per linear foot. The price depends on the color, whether it
has to be fitted to a sink and general configuration of the counter
top. Granite costs approximately 15 to 20 percent more than Corian.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it is for a small area, such as a vanity or desk, solid
surface counter-top prices include installation. However, the price
might not include removing the old counter out. Make sure that the
contractor doing the installation is certified or accredited by the
solid surfacing manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   A new pure acrylic material that costs about 20 percent less
than Corian is Wilsonart's SSV, a one-eighth-inch solid surface
veneer (Corian is 1 1/2-inches thick) that is applied to particle
board. This comes in the same patterns as acrylic resins and
granite.
</P>
<P>
   There are several Corian look-alike products on the market,
including the Wilsonart product and Nevamar's Fountainhead.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive counter material is plastic laminate, such
as Formica.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Francesconi, a customer service representative with Arcy
Plastic Laminates Inc. near Albany, said one factor in the cost is
the type of edging. Post form edging is approximately $8.50 a
linear foot, square edge is $14.50 and a bevel edge is $21 a linear
foot. But the price goes up to approximately $30 or more per linear
foot as the width increases.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic laminate countertops may be the most affordable, but
they have several disadvantages. They can chip or wear away, and
stains easily seep into pores, seams and voids. Areas with
scorches, chips and cuts can't be repaired, but must be replaced.
These are best used around the bathroom vanity or wet bar area.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting a counter top, kitchen designer experts say,
remember that solid and dark colors show everything, while a little
pattern can help to mask water spots and a few crumbs here and
there. Stay away from trendy colors that become easily dated.

 &HT;    FOR U.S. TAXPAYER, PRICE OF PEACE IN MIDEAST AT $20 BILLION -
AND CLIMBING
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 9 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton spent last week
shuttling from Washington to this rustic hamlet on the Potomac,
trying to help broker an end to half a century of Israeli-Syrian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he focused on the diplomacy of ending war, though,
Clinton began the political work of preparing the American people
for the cost of peace.
</P>
<P>
   For if Clinton succeeds in his highest foreign policy ambition _
the cementing of an overall peace accord between Israel and its
Arab foes _ U.S. taxpayers will get hit with a sizeable bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tab could well top $20 billion, analysts say, to help
strengthen Israeli security and resettle Jewish residents from
lands Israel would relinquish under the group of peace accords
Clinton backs.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military personnel, possibly even troops, could be deployed
to help police the peace, putting Americans at risk in a region
where suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism have become a
tragic part of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Clinton's challenge, even as he works to bring the
conflicted parties together around the contentious issues dividing
them, is to convince Americans that the price of Mideast peace is a
cost worth bearing.
</P>
<P>
   That became part of the message last week emanating from every
corner of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, the point was made by National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Pentagon spokesman Craig Quigley and even Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some costs,'' Clinton told reporters in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start working on that and figuring out what the
specific jobs are that we would be asked to help finance, whether
we could get any others to help, and over how many years it would
have to be done,'' Clinton said. ``Then I'll have to go talk to the
Congress. And I'm just not in a position to say what dollar amount
I would ask our Congress for.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs of peace, in fact, are a central point of negotiation
in any set of peace talks among the United States, Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Israel received $1.2 billion in U.S. military aid as part of the
interim peace agreements Clinton brokered at the Wye River
Plantation in October 1998 between Israel and the Palestinians. The
Palestinians were promised $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   After President Jimmy Carter brokered peace between Israel and
Egypt in the 1978 Camp David accords, the United States paid
hundreds of millions of dollars to, in effect, compensate Israel
for returning to Cairo's control territory on the Sinai Peninsula
that Israeli troops had occupied for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is in addition to the roughly $3 billion in U.S.
military and economic aid Israel receives each year.
</P>
<P>
   As the ante for the current round of Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
Barak has asked Clinton for $17 billion worth of military and
resettlement aid in connection with the Syrian portion of the talks
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Peace will require Barak to give back to Syria strategic
territory that Israeli troops seized when the two countries fought
a war in 1967. That territory, the Golan Heights, is now inhabited
by an estimated 16,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll want compensation for every one of those people, and
they'll be asking for compensation in the neighborhood of $1
million apiece,'' said Middle East expert Richard Curtiss, a former
U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will also seek compensation, Curtiss said, for the far
greater number _ perhaps 160,000 _ of Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank territories Israel is handing over to
Palestinian control as part of its peace agreement with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also claiming that giving up the Golan Heights and
large parts of the West Bank have the potential of making the
country vulnerable to Arab attack. In return, Israel is seeking
additional U.S. military aid and security guarantees.

Affairs. ``We'd be talking about more tanks, improved radar of all
kinds, they might even want to have their own surveillance
satellite over the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is also seeking U.S. troops to help police the Golan and
take over the operation of spy stations there that now allow Israel
to eavesdrop on Syrian military movements and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that isn't on the table,'' Quigley told
reporters at the Pentagon last week.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Quigley insisted that the whole subject of increased
U.S. military aid to Israel is ``a work in progress,'' he made

<TEXT>

   EDITORS:  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his hard-hitting dispatches from the front lines of Kosovo,
the Independent's veteran correspondent Robert Fisk was NATO's
sternest critic during the war in Kosovo _ the top international
news story of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut-based Fisk recently returned to Kosovo _ ``as I always do
after such conflicts'' _ to search for the war's first casualty:
truth. And to assess the war's real _ and continuing _ human toll.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Syndicate is pleased to share his
extraordinary eight-part special report, ``My Return to Kosovo's
Killing Fields,'' with you and your readers.
</P>
<P>
   Each compelling article offers editor-friendly optional trims to
fit your needs. All have moved to the ``a'' general, ``i''
international and ``k'' commentary news files. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON MOVES TO DEFEND U.S. CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    360&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to defend America's cyberspace, President
Clinton on Friday sought $2 billion from Congress in his new budget
to safeguard the nation's key computers against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to protecting critical federal systems, the new
spending would be used to shield privately owned electrical grids,
telecommunications and transportation networks, banking and
financial institutions, water supplies and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today our critical systems, from power structures to air
traffic control, are connected and run by computers. We must make
those systems more secure so that America can be more secure,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age when one person sitting at one computer can
come up with an idea, travel through cyberspace, and take humanity
to new heights,'' Clinton said outside the White House. ``Yet
someone can sit at the same computer, hack into a computer system,
and potentially paralyze a company, a city or a government.''
</P>
<P>
   The request to combat both domestic and foreign cyberterrorism
came with the release, eight months behind schedule, of a
comprehensive ``National Plan for Information Systems Protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging that such protection is now lacking, the report
sets out a step-by-step 10-point program to fortify vital
infrastructures against deliberate attack by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Key points of the White House program call for enhancing
research and development to detect and deter attacks, training and
hiring a corps of information security specialists, and launching
further outreach efforts ``to make Americans aware of the need for
improved cyber-security.''
</P>
<P>
   Following up on Clinton's remarks, Commerce Secretary William
Daley noted that ``this is the first time in American history that
we in the federal government alone cannot protect our
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only the government is at risk, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't hire an army or a police force that's large enough to
protect all of America's cell phones or pagers or computer
networks, not when 95 percent of these infrastructures are owned
and operated by the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The bid for more spending comes after public and private outlays
of an estimated $100 billion since 1997 to correct the so-called
Y2K bug. Since widespread prediction of massive Y2K disruptions
proved unwarranted, White House officials remain eager to emphasize
that major cyberterrorism issues remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   For the current fiscal year, which ends next October, Congress
appropriated $1.75 billion for these initiatives, just $2 million
shy of the administration's initial request. In addition, the
lawmakers approved billions of dollars _ the actual figures remain
classified _ to enable the Pentagon to deploy offensive tools to
wage cyberwars.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richard Clarke, who heads counter-terrorism efforts
at the National Security Council, the defensive elements of the
cyber equation cover a wide range of threats ``from the teenage
hacker who sort of joy-rides in cyberspace, up through industrial
espionage, up through fraud and theft, and up at the far end of the
spectrum to another country using information warfare against our
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware now, over the course of the last two years, that
several other nations have developed offensive information warfare
units, organizations, tactics, doctrine and capability,'' Clarke
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean they're going to use them, but it means that
they're developing them, they're getting better all the time,'' he
said. He declined to name any of the countries.
</P>
<P>
   A 33-page summary of the cyberspace protection report can be
downloaded from the White House Internet site (www.whitehouse.gov).

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: When age and driving speed merge
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I'll be 59 this month, and I'm slowing down. In
the process, I'm running the risk of getting run-down.
</P>
<P>
   But that's my New Year's resolution, to drive no faster than 62
mph on the highway, so as not to outpace my aging reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm finding out, it isn't always easy to stay under the
speed limit. There are limits to what other drivers will stand for.
</P>
<P>
   Easing along at 62 mph on a Texas two-lane blacktop where the
law allows 70 mph, and you'd think I was leading a parade _ all
those cars and trucks backed up behind me.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't waving and smiling like people in a parade. If
anything, they're shaking their fists.
</P>
<P>
   A speed limit of 70 mph means you can probably push it as high
as 75 mph without getting the attention of the highway patrol. Fact
of the matter, 62 mph was my personal speed limit when the signs
said 55.
</P>
<P>
   All my years, I've driven too fast. Blame it on my upbringing.
In the '50s, when I was a teenager, 80 or 90 mph was considered
cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   I never will forget one time when I was picking up a date, being
quizzed by her father about my driving habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you're careful on the road,'' he said, sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, don't worry, sir,'' I said, honest and forthright young
lad that I was. ``When I have a girl in the car, I never drive over
80.''
</P>
<P>
   The man started sputtering, his face flushed and his neck veins
bulging, and was in the process of getting out of his chair with
what appeared to be the most violent of intentions when his wife
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, now,'' she said, shushing her husband and shooing us
toward the door. ``I'm sure you're a very responsible young man.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember thinking at the time, ``What's wrong with him?'' But
that's what you get for being honest and forthright, and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken me a long time time to wise up.
</P>
<P>
   I was at my worst at middle-age and driving a Corvette. That car
was like a wild woman _ she'd do anything you had the nerve to ask
of her.
</P>
<P>
   There was one particular piece of highway, downhill onto a long,
flat stretch where you could see for a mile or more. The Corvette
made it feel like you were coming off a ski jump.
</P>
<P>
   One time I topped 130 mph before chickening out and easing off.
I never did find out exactly how fast that car would go. Whatever
it was, it was too fast for me.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, speed is relative. You go 500 mph in a jetliner and
it's no different from sitting at home in front of the TV. And I
have a friend my age who races motorcycles at 150-plus mph, which
must seem like something akin to warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's now behind me, along with the line of cars
wanting to pass. No matter. I'll smile and wave even if they won't.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bumper sticker says, honk if you love Jesus.

&HT;     AIRPORT SEES SOUTHWEST ARRIVAL AS HARBINGER OF LOWER FARES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KERI P. MATTOX  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Three months after Southwest Airlines began
serving Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Conn., passenger
traffic has soared 30 percent and fares on other airlines have
dropped by as much as 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The impact was so immediate, Hartford officials dubbed the
results the ``Southwest Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Now officials at Albany International Airport hope to duplicate
that success when the no-frills, discount carrier begins service in
early May.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of intense negotiations, Southwest added
Albany to its 55-city roster Thursday. An announcement on the
number of daily flights and four destination cities is expected
next week. Based on Albany International's most popular routes, the
cities could include Orlando, Chicago and Baltimore/Washington
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airport and local officials, who toured the still-unopened $6.2
million terminal expansion into which Southwest will move this
spring, expect that the airline's arrival will mean lower fares,
more jobs and new businesses for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic impact of this decision is immense,'' said State
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, one of several key political
leaders who lobbied to land the Dallas-based airline. ``It can
literally change the complexion of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest began service to Bradley International in Hartford on
Oct. 31. Within a month, the airport topped the 600,000-traveler
mark for the first time. While Southwest flew nearly 60,000
passengers during its first month, other major carriers also saw a
healthy boost in their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines like American, Continental, TWA and United had
passenger numbers almost 50 percent higher than in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although numbers for December are not yet available, Bradley is
on pace to top 6 million passengers in 1999 _ another record.
</P>
<P>
   Fares on all airlines at Bradley have plummeted as carriers try
to compete with Southwest's budget prices. Southwest introduced
with a $65 one-way fare from Hartford to Baltimore/Washington _ 76
percent lower than competitors' fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once it hits and they realize what this means for
fares, we'll be really busy,'' said Theresa Beverly, owner of
Empress Travel in Latham, N.Y. With fares out of Hartford so low,
Beverly always prices flights for her customers out of both Albany
International and Bradley International. About half of those buying
tickets opt to drive the 108 miles to Hartford, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that will change once service begins in May, Beverly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have those kind of air fares, people will definitely fly
out of Albany. There will be no reason not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials hope that Southwest, the nation's largest
discount carrier, can bring lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another discount carrier, Shuttle America, which began service
at Albany International in April, was able to bring down fares when
it moved in, but has since raised its prices and lightened its
flight schedule because of low demand.
</P>
<P>
   Flights to Buffalo started at $49 each way, but are now up to
$79 for the 14-day advance ticket. Ticket prices on other airlines,
however, have fallen to meet the prices offered by the smaller
Shuttle America.
</P>
<P>
   The airport also is expecting the number of travelers to take
off with the anticipated crush of Southwest passengers. Albany
International, like Bradley, was on track to reach record numbers
in 1999 _ almost 1.2 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot wait. All the airlines have dropped their air fares
out of Hartford,'' Beverly said. ``That's the great thing, it's not
just Southwest.''

&HT;     LAKERS COACH STILL CONNECTS TO HIS DAYS IN THE TRENCHES OF
CONTINENTAL LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK SINGELAIS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Phil Jackson ever worked in the
state-of-the art Staples Center in Los Angeles, he froze in the
drafty Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And before he became the intellectual leader of the six-time NBA
champion Chicago Bulls, Jackson tasted a title with the 1984 Albany
Patroons, who reigned atop the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he still harbors a special place in his heart for
that CBA title, which helped convince him that he made the right
career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us, it was important for me,'' Jackson
said recently. ``I was just in the process where I was concerned
whether coaching was going to be something I was going to do or not
do. Or if I was going to be any good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts have long since melted away. When the curtain fell
on the Michael Jordan era in Chicago, Jackson had in his nine
seasons with the Bulls compiled the best regular-season (.731) and
playoff (.730) winning percentages of any coach in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that Jackson was simply along for the ride as
Jordan and Scottie Pippen carried the Bulls, so far the 54-year-old
coach has duplicated his success with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have the league's best record at 26-5 (.839) in
Jackson's first year and he was named IBM Coach of the Month for
December. It appears his cerebral approach to the game has unified
a team that was known for clashing personalities (Shaquille O'Neal,
Kobe Bryant) and tuning out coaches (Del Harris, Kurt Rambis).
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had to prove himself to us because he already proved
himself,'' Lakers forward Robert Horry said. ``You had only two
guys on (the Bulls), or three when (Dennis) Rodman was there, that
guys really respected. The rest of those guys, nobody really
respected. But he got all of them to play above and beyond their
potential. Guys always had respect for him. When he first came
here, guys didn't say much to him, but he's a likeable guy. He's
cool, so guys started to warm up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool'' was the same adjective used by Derrick Rowland, who
played for the Patroons during all five of Jackson's seasons there
from 1982-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was just a great guy to play for,'' said Rowland, the
franchise's all-time leading scorer. ``He understands a lot of the
dynamics of the game, the dynamics of people and brings them
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the hardships made it difficult to build a winning
team in Albany. First, there was the frigid atmosphere of the
Armory. While Jackson maintains it was the perfect facility for a
CBA team, it got so cold during practices that players often wore
their sweats and mittens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to talk our commander of the Armory into keeping the
balls in a warm spot in the ticket office so that the guys wouldn't
have to use balls that were 50 degrees, because that was the
temperature in the building,'' Jackson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we had to always go out and sweep the floor and mop the
court because they used it for everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also the road trips. Jackson drove the team van to
places like Toronto or Bangor, Maine. And the Patroons only took
nine players on road trips because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult,'' he said. ``We'd play four games in four
nights on some road trip out West. We fly out to some place, grab a
van and then drive to wherever. You'd get four or five hours of
sleep at night. It was almost impossible to win on the road. But
the players all performed very well. I was impressed by their
cohesiveness, their desire to win. They were motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jackson felt the egalitarian salary structure of the
Patroons led to success. Married players were paid just $25 more
per week than single players. Nobody was treated above the rest of
the team and players usually didn't grumble about playing time,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really kind of a taught thing,'' he said. ``We talked
these guys into that. We talked them into sharing time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was former Patroons owner Jim Coyne who gave Jackson his
first head coaching job. It almost never happened. When the
Patroons got off to an 8-15 start in the 1982-83 season, coach Dean
Meminger was fired. Coyne first looked at former UCLA star Henry
Bibby (now the USC coach), but Bibby wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   Then Coyne called Jackson, who was out of basketball after a
playing career with the New York Knicks and a stint as an assistant
with the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Phil how things were going, and I told him I just
wanted him to finish out the year and see if he liked it or not,''
Coyne recalled. ``He told me to call back in an hour, and when I
called back, he said, `I'll be there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Fate is a funny thing,'' Coyne said. ``It's just being in the
right place at the right time. If I didn't make the phone call,
maybe fate would have turned out a different way for Phil and he
might not have gotten back in basketball the way he did.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Known as something of a middle-aged hippie, Jackson lived in
Woodstock during his Patroon tenure. He still remembers the one-way
length of his commute _ 47 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a much longer journey to the riches of the NBA. He
recalled making $17,500 in the CBA. The Bulls hired him as an
assistant under Doug Collins in 1987. When Collins was fired two
years later, Jackson ascended to the head position.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson earns $6 million per year with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said motivating players hasn't changed that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still playing for the group, I think,'' he said. ``It's
still playing for your team. It's still a desire to win and play
hard every time you're on the floor. I think it's easier at this
level because of the audience and television that comes with this
game to motivate players, and the fact that their life is so much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ron Harper has enjoyed playing for Jackson so much, he
followed him from the Bulls to the Lakers. He's become accustomed
to Jackson traditions such as handing out books to players on road
trips to take their minds off basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who knows the game, who has played in this
league,'' Harper said. ``He's a guy we have fun with. I think he
knows me and I know him. We (the Lakers) have a long way to learn,
that's for sure. Our team is off to a fast start, but we have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And surely, Jackson has come a long way. It's been 13 years
since his last CBA game, and the Patroons are only a memory, moving
to Hartford, Conn., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of driving vans, sweeping floors and negotiating
player contracts haven't left Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely who I am,'' he said.

REGAINING DRIVE AFTER THE HOLIDAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With all the holiday hoopla over, it's a little
depressing to be back at work.
</P>
<P>
   That's not at all unusual this time of year, but the malaise
seems to be especially strong this year. All of a sudden, the
parties, the fun and the food celebrating the new century have come
to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot of other excitement looming either. The
University of Wisconsin has won the Rose Bowl, Y2K worries turned
out to be one big bore and warm weather is a long way off. How
excited, after all, can you get about Valentine's Day?
</P>
<P>
   And the new millennium didn't exactly make folks feel like
Masters of their Universe. All the talk about the best of this and
the best of that during the 20th century seemed to remind many of
us that we're just a cog in the wheels of history.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't help that half the country seems to be suffering
from a lingering bronchitis _ in my case, I have developed an
addiction to NyQuil _ or a nasty case of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays we tend to refocus on what's important in
our lives, like family and children, said Greg Nakanishi, president
of GN Resources, a human resources consulting firm in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For Nakanishi, who spends a lot of his life working with
charities, the holidays are a time to help others. He recalled the
good feeling he had as he spent Christmas Eve with his family
serving free food to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we come back in January, the old reality hits us,''
he said. ``Then you get back and you have to go to this meeting and
that meeting and you wonder _ does it make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   So many people were pushing to overcome Y2K problems and
complete their year-end goals that folks feel kind of spent, said
Charlie Rhoads, managing partner of Vandaveer-Rhoads, a consulting
firm in Houston that specializes in helping companies change their
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   He likened the sensation to playing in top form against a superb
basketball team, then playing badly against _ and losing to _ a
weak competitor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ESTABLISHING A GOAL HELPS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how can you get that jump-start to get going again?
</P>
<P>
   Give yourself a goal to meet, said Rhoads. The day-to-day stuff
is hard to do after doing a big deal like making it through Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's human nature to rest on your laurels and slide a little, he
said. It's the time after a big victory _ like a great board
presentation or implementing a new computer system that worked _
that makes someone the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers get jealous, and that's when they stab the new
golden-haired man or woman in the back or knock the legs out from
under him or her by working hard themselves.
</P>
<P>
   People need to get their momentum going before they're
threatened by someone else, he said. If you have a good victory on
Wednesday, present yourself a big challenge _ with specific
deadlines _ on Friday. That will get your adrenaline going.
</P>
<P>
   A good leader will recognize the human instinct to float and
make sure to set challenges and deadlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads said it would be easy to deliver a big project on a
Tuesday, then drift the rest of the week by going to long lunches
and shopping excursions. But if he has another deadline on Friday,
Rhoads said, he knows he'll push to finish the next project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work at a pace at which we think we can get away with,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A CALENDAR IS A GOOD TOOL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting goals is important to getting a jump-start, said
Nakanishi. Focus on just a few things and make an action plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's also helpful to buy a calendar to better plan your time, he
said. And use the slowness of the New Year to reconnect with people
you haven't talked to in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some folks say they're not depressed. In fact, they
report that they are actually thrilled to be back at work.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Jeanneret, an industrial and organizational psychologist
with Jeanneret &AMP; Associates, returned to Houston this week after
spending New Year's Eve on a Caribbean cruise. Jeanneret said he
thought on the ship about how much he was looking forward to coming
back to work. It might be guilt, he said, but he reports not one
speck of sadness, much less malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanneret said he has consulting proposals floating about, and
companies have money to spend on consultants.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great time, he insisted. That may be true, but it will
take many of the rest of us a few more days to feel as chipper.

THE GOOD OL' DAYS REALLY NOT SO GOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloom and doom. Gloom and doom. People gripe at the news media
for concentrating on them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason. Things are supposed to go well. We focus on
the unusual _ when they don't. People also like to read, listen and
watch gloom and doom. For proof of that statement, keep an eye on
the bestseller book lists. There's generally at least one book full
of that emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of that focus we often lose sight of the real
advancements being made. The Cato Institute, a free-market think
tank in Washington, D.C., recently collected an astounding set of
figures about progress. They compared where we are now, with
(mostly) the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the changes in the past 100 years in the
United States in health and safety trends.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average lifespan increased by 30 years, from 47 to age 77.
</P>
<P>
   _ Infant mortality per 1,000 live births decreased by 93
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heart disease deaths were cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1977, when we first started keeping reliable records,
five major air pollutants have decreased significantly: sulfur
dioxide, 58 percent; nitrogen oxides, 27 percent; ozone, 30
percent; carbon monoxide, 61 percent; lead, 97 percent. Most
problems meeting air pollution standards today don't come from
increasing pollution, but from a tightening of those standards over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accidental deaths decreased by 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IMPROVED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about how we were financially better off in the good old
days? Not true.
</P>
<P>
   _ The per-person Gross Domestic Product, a measure of the wealth
created, is almost seven times higher today than in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manufacturing wages, in today's dollars, went from $3.43 per
hour in 1900 to $12.47 now. And that doesn't include the growth in
fringe benefits such as vacation, medical insurance, retirement and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   _ Household assets, everything from the value of our homes to
our personal possessions, are seven times greater.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the beginning of the century, 40 percent to 50 percent of
all Americans had income levels that classified them as poor _
depending upon the measurement used. Today, that's down to between
10 percent and 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home ownership increased by 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1980, personal computer ownership went up 44 times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Household incomes of blacks increased 10-fold. Although blacks
still earn less than whites, the gap has decreased. In 1900, blacks
earned about 40 percent of whites. It is now 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The price of wheat, measured by the amount of farmer hours it
takes to produce it, decreased 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer speed has jumped 3 million percent since computers
were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of patents granted each year increased by a factor
of six.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO BETTER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How about the quality of life in the past 100 years? Here are
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average length of the workweek decreased by 30 percent,
falling from 66 hours to 35 hours. And because of more holidays and
a shorter work week, the average number of hours worked in a year
is half of what it was in the latter part of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   _ The percent of workers on the farm fell by 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Television ownership went from nothing, of course, to almost
universal. Although I must admit I'm not sure if that's a plus.
</P>
<P>
   _ The percentage of households with electricity went from 10
percent to near-universal. At the same time, the average American
in 1900 had to work six times as many hours to pay his electricity
bill than does a worker today.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of telephone calls per capita per year increased
5,600 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of households with cars increased 90-fold.
</P>
<P>
   _ The percentage of people completing college is four times
higher. Today more people (28 percent) have bachelor's degrees than
the number of Americans who held high school degrees in 1900 (22
percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of women with bachelor's degrees increased by half
with women now earning almost 60 percent of such degrees. Women
with comparable work and work histories comparable to men's earn 98
cents for every dollar men do.
</P>
<P>
   All this doesn't mean we've reached perfection. But the
measurable aspects of life shows lots of improvement, with more
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'm an optimist.

HIDDEN PROGRAMS THAT CAN THROW YOU 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you're one of the many who found a new computer
under the Christmas tree, and that shiny new PC was bought from a
retailer, chances are you got a lot more than you bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a name-brand personal computer that uses Windows 98,
watch during the boot-up process at the number of icons that appear
in what's called the system tray, the area to the right in the
taskbar at the bottom of the screen that shows the time.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably find at least half a dozen icons there in the
typical consumer computer bought at retail _ maybe more. Each one
represents a program running in the background. And that's only the
tip of the iceberg. There are usually even more active background
programs that don't place icons in the tray. You don't know they're
there unless you know how and where to look.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of these computers will tell you that these programs
add features that you'll like. But what they won't tell you is that
they can slow down a PC's performance, conflict with other programs
and possibly make your computing life a living hell.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, PC makers aren't solely to blame. The
services these background programs offer usually are useful and
well-intentioned. Manufacturers add these programs to make PCs
easier to use as well as to differentiate themselves from
competitors. You can also blame Microsoft's Windows 95/98 and the
way it manages what are called resources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLOGGING POCKETS OF MEMORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windows resources have little or nothing to do with the amount
of memory or hard-drive space on your computer. You can have
hundreds of megabytes of RAM and dozens of gigabytes of hard-drive
space and still run out of resources in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Resources are pockets of memory that Windows sets aside to
manage the operating system's status. They track such things as the
positions of open windows and applications, how memory is allocated
and what drivers are active.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of the legacy of Windows 3.1, the Microsoft shell
that protected early PC users from the horrors of the MS-DOS
command line. With the introduction of Windows 95, the amount of
resources increased dramatically. But modern programs take up more
resources than old Windows 3.1 software, so what was once a bounty
is again a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   This problem recently came to light with owners of new Compaq
Computer Corp. Presario machines. Owners of some models began
experiencing what appeared to be random lockups. But they weren't
random, and they weren't lockups.
</P>
<P>
   What was happening, according to a company spokeswoman, was that
Windows ran low on resources when a Compaq-specific application
kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   The program goes to a Compaq site on the Internet and checks for
updates to key software on the computer. The idea is to make it
easy to keep a system up to date. This is something many users
aren't aware should be done, or they don't know how, or they simply
don't want to be bothered. Automating the process, in theory, is a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SLOWDOWN LOOKED LIKE LOCKUP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Presario owners, however, was that the program
would _ when combined with all the other programs that were running
_ drain Windows' resources. The systems would slow to a crawl,
which appeared to many users to be a lockup. In reality, the
computer had slowed down, and after a period of about a minute or
so, the spokeswoman said, activity would return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   But most users interpreted this slowdown as a lockup, and began
hitting buttons and clicking the mouse. This further overloaded
Windows' resources, and caused a real lockup, or a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has fixed this with a patch that changes how its own
software works. But it still doesn't address the root problem _
that many PCs are overloaded with background programs and Windows
can't handle that gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is not alone in loading up its consumer PCs with
background programs, though the Houston-based company is certainly
zealous about it. Buy a system from Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Gateway
or a manufacturer that sells to consumers and you'll find virus
checkers, keyboard-button managers, video- and sound-settings
control panels, crash protectors and programs that check the Net
for updates. On computers that have rewriteable CD-ROM drives,
you'll find one or two more background programs running. And
notebook computers are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is aggravated by programs that users install later
that run even more background components. For example, install any
of the popular utilities suites, such as McAfee Office or Norton
SystemWorks, and watch your system tray get even more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you can turn off a lot of these programs, disabling
them so they don't launch when your computer starts. On a Presario
5900 I recently tested, only 74 percent of system resources were
available on bootup. By turning off what I considered to be
non-essential, I got that number up to 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (You can find out how many system resources are available by
running the Resource Meter. Go to Start, Programs, Accessories,
System Tools, then click on Resource Meter. It appears as an icon
on the task bar and, yes, it also takes up resources. To learn how
to find and disable background programs, see the column I wrote
last February at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/19/compute.html.)
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company is working on ways of
increasing system resources in the next version of its consumer
operating system, which has the working name of Millennium and is
due out sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   But until Microsoft fixes the problem _ which, by the way, is
not a factor in Windows NT or the upcoming Windows 2000, both aimed
at corporate users _ PC makers should be more judicious in their
use of background programs. And they should work harder to make
sure their background programs use as few resources as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Users should be given a choice, either when they first turn on a
new computer or through a one-stop control panel, of what is
allowed to run in the background. Although you can do this now
through the System Information utility in Windows 98, it's not a
particularly friendly program. A graphical version, which clearly
explains what each program does and how many resources are
consumed, would be more useful.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can always vote with your pocketbook and buy
systems that are lean and mean. You'll send a message to PC makers,
and get a more stable computer in the process.

MOST PCS HAVE MAINTENANCE SO BUT USERS MAY WANT TO MAKE
ADDITIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Santa was good to me. Got a new computer for
Christmas. Sure beats the old 486 I was using. I read your section
every week, but I want to know just what kind of software I need to
keep it running. Does it come with everything I need to maintain
it, or is there something I should buy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most modern PCs have a slew of features that help keep them
running well, but you have to know where they are and how to use
them. Most computer makers don't point you to them for a variety of
reasons, including worries that novices might do more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Windows 98 comes with a feature called the
Maintenance Wizard that automates the process of defragmenting your
hard drive, removing temporary files and scanning the hard drive
for errors. It can also be used to turn off programs that launch
automatically via the Startup folder. You can find this wizard in
the Accessories/System Tools folder.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful Windows feature overlooked by many users is the
System Information Utility, also found in Accessories/System Tools.
On the surface, it looks as though all it does is give you detailed
information about your system. But there's a Tools menu item that
is full of goodies, including programs that can restore missing or
corrupt files and another that can turn off even more items that
launch automatically through the Registry.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things you need for maintaining your PC that
don't come with it, or or if they do, they are anemic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some PCs come with a virus scanner. But often it
includes only one or two free upgrades to a database of known
viruses. Since new viruses are found all the time, it's important
to keep your virus signatures up to date. You should either buy a
full-powered antivirus program or upgrade the one that came with
your computer. This is going to cost you some money, but you'll be
glad you did it. The two most popular are McAfee's VirusScan
(www.mcafee.com) and Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com).
</P>
<P>
   Also, all Windows users should have an un-install program on
their systems. Even though Windows comes with its own Add/Remove
Programs module in the Control Panel, you may find programs you
want to remove that don't have a listing there. This category of
software usually has other useful features, such as deleting
temporary files or transferring programs between drives or even
between computers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most popular are Norton's CleanSweep and McAfee's
UnInstaller.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you're willing to tackle problems yourself, you may
want to get a utility suite, such as McAfee Office 2000, Ontrack's
SystemSuite 2000 or Norton SystemWorks 2000. These are collections
of software designed to track down and fix problems. If you are a
serious novice but nervous about getting under the hood of your PC,
these programs can help.
</P>
<P>
   These suites also contain both antivirus and un-install
programs, and you save money by buying them as a package.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My new hobby is converting my old photos into digital
pictures on my computer. I've been using the JPG format, and have
been putting the pictures into ZIP files to save space. But I
notice that when I check the properties of the ZIPs, they don't
appear to have been compressed much. Is there any way to shrink
them further?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're trying to compress a file format that's already
compressed. The JPG format is ``tight'' already, and you're getting
only a couple of percentage points of extra compression by using
ZIP files. Unless you're working with larger file formats, such as
BMP, there's not much sense in using ZIP compression to store them.

THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF COOKING IN THIS CD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: (at) indicates that the at sign should be used.) (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Y2K has passed and home computers are still running,
let's assume the gas, electric and water services are still
working. That way, The Complete MasterCook Suite Featuring Betty
Crocker can be put to work in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The program (Windows; about $45-$50) is not simply another
cooking program, notes publisher SierraHome. It is five complete
recipe collections, making it the largest collection of Betty
Crocker recipes on CD-ROM. There are about 1,000 recipes from Betty
Crocker and another 5,000 from MasterCook Deluxe.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows users to search through recipes by
ingredient, watch video clips for instructions and develop
plan-ahead menus. Recipes can be imported from the Internet, and
the program can provide an instant analysis of any recipes. The
recipes can also be sent through e-mail to friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive new features is an ``import
assistant'' which lets users take recipes from the Web and drop
them directly into the program. In addition, a rating system allows
cooks to customize a recipe's attributes based on personal judgment
to rank the recipe's spiciness, preparation time and other
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The suite includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Cooking Basics, with more than 100 simple
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Best of Baking, featuring 350 baked recipes
ranging from break to desserts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Best of Healthy and Hearty Cooking has more
than 400 recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Cookie Book offers 225 cookie recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCook Deluxe 5.0 is a collection of more than 5,000 recipes
from food associations, well-known chefs and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The suite also has a pantry management system and more advanced
search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   MINDGYM: Here's a fun program that works the brain harder than
the mouse: Mind-Gym from Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive. This series
of mental exercises with an attitude won the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts' Best Comedy CD award.
</P>
<P>

   SATELLITE PHONES FINALLY HERE FOR ALL
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Lipman
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 - Satellite phones, a technology long
heralded as the future in mobile communications but slow to pan
out, are finally available to the public on a limited basis at an
affordable level. Globalstar USA announced commercial service and a
pricing plan Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar, which has won investor confidence with its cautious
introduction plan, is still not ready for full commercial service.
Friday's announcement for limited service was not accompanied by
any sort of ad blitz or sales push. Instead, the company is hoping
for already targeted customers to sign up, at discounted rates,
which will give the company five to 10 weeks to fine tune the
system. However, anyone who wants the phone now can sign up at
regional distributors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company is confident with the network, the advertising
will begin. ``We'll be everywhere,'' said company spokeswoman Toni
Carinci.
</P>
<P>
   Previous satellite phone systems have been targeted at the
economic elite, costing up to $10,000 for the phone, up to $10 a
minute for service, and often accompanied by a briefcase-sized
transmitter. Globalstar USA was one of three companies, along with
Iridium LLC and ICO Global Communications, that promised to bring
the technology to a broad market. The other two companies have
undergone bankruptcy or severe reorganization, leaving Globalstar
as the last hope for cheap satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap is relative. Globalstar phones, similar in size and
weight to some of the early hand-held cell phones, still cost about
$1,500. The company is not targeting mothers commuting home from
work, but industry specialists in agriculture, forestry, mining, or
maritime activities - people who are out of range of conventional
cell phone transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar executives speaking last year at the International
Space Business Assembly also spoke of a large, untapped market in
foreign nations, where many people desire mobile phone service, but
where there is no cell phone infrastructure similar to the many
towers and transmitters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Customers must buy a Globalstar phone, which can operate in
three modes: standard cell phone, digital mobile phone, and
satellite phone. Customers will be able to connect with any
standard cell phone service, such as Bell Mobile, or AT&AMP;T, whenever
they are in range of a cellular or digital transmitter, presumably
at a cheaper rate.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever customers cannot get traditional service, they can
extend the special antenna by hand, larger than a traditional cell
phone's almost vestigial antenna, and connect to one of
Globalstar's 44 low-Earth-orbit satellites. Once connected,
customers are charged for satellite time based on one of three
plans:
</P>
<P>
   Basic plan:
</P>
<P>
   Monthly cost: $29.99. Minutes you get for free: 0. Cost for each
additional minute:$1.69.
</P>
<P>
   Using the phone for 10 minutes a month would cost you $46.89.
</P>
<P>
   Using the phone for two hours a month would cost you $232.79.
</P>
<P>
   Using the phone for five hours a month would cost you $536.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond 100'' plan:
</P>
<P>
   Monthly cost: $169.99. Minutes you get for free: 100. Cost for
each additional minute:$1.49.
</P>
<P>
   Using the phone for 10 minutes a month would cost you $169.99.
</P>
<P>
   Using the phone for two hours a month would cost you $199.79.

<P>
   Using the phone for five hours a month would cost you $467.99.

<P>
   ``Beyond 250'' plan:
</P>
<P>
   Monthly cost: $369.99. Minutes you get for free: 250. Cost for
each additional minute:$1.39.
</P>
<P>

A MUTTER SERIES COVERS THE CENTURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The violin, surrogate of choice for the singing human
voice during the first 200 years of its existence, entered the 20th
century both as friend and enemy. Keepers of the Romantic flame
were grateful for its lyrical qualities. Makers of a new order were
mistrustful. The instrument has endured, indeed prospered, because
the music that Mendelssohn, Mozart, Bach and Tchaikovsky wrote for
it has endured as well. Newer composers deeply suspicious of older
forms of sentiment have explored its rhythmic and percussive
qualities with wary enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Sophie Mutter is bringing us a brave series that will show
how the violin has fared during the last 100 years: recitals at
Carnegie Hall and three orchestra concerts with the New York
Philharmonic under Kurt Masur, the first of which was played at
Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night. Offered was a heavy
concentration of Lutoslawski, some Leonard Bernstein and an
orchestral medley of Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess'' as a tasty
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The other events next week bring music by Sibelius, Berg and
Wolfgang Rihm. The Lutoslawski pieces _ in fact, a single concerto
made from three separate items _ represent the old ways carried
forward: The Partita in five movements and ``Chain 2,'' the two
bound together by the quiet ``Interlude,'' are expansive personal
statements exploited by a solo instrument engineered for
soul-searching. Depending on your musical politics, the composer
has carried history forward in orderly fashion, or else he has been
a nurse tending an elderly patient on life support.
</P>
<P>
   What this music brings us, and what a lot of 20th-century music
does not, is an intimate passion, an enthusiasm for mystery and an
unashamed intoxication. In matters of harmony and format,
Lutoslawski has moved on. Tonality is often abandoned, though not
rigorously in the manner of Schoenberg. The composer does not
reject the Romantic vocabulary as so many did; he simply adds to
it. Two movements of the Partita expand freedom to the point of
indeterminacy. Elements are allowed to float freely from one
another and to enjoy the chance collision. Radically new in its
20th-century zeal for experimentation this music may well be; but
when one thinks about it, it is also the Romantic impulse carried
to its natural conclusion. For here is freedom supervised; the
voice is allowed its uniqueness, and yet the composer is there in
the background to shelter it from chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Movements of ``Chain 2'' treat the violin with more abruptness,
even brutality. These are traits found also in Bernstein's
``Serenade for Violin, Strings, Harp and Percussion.'' The concept,
a musical version of Plato's ``Symposium,'' is a little stagy, but
the music is fresh, as only his early music was. There is in
Bernstein Lutoslawski's fascination with the violin's gifts of
song, here with a scrubbed-clean quality, but also a willingness to
subject an old instrument to the violences of modern American
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mutter was a wonder of adaptability. The ability to play
right notes and exact rhythms with correct intonation was taken for
granted. Lutoslawski and Bernstein could not be two more different
spirits, and yet Ms. Mutter took the pulse of each with equal
precision. It is meant as a compliment to say that over a two-hour
stretch one often forgot about the violinist altogether in favor of
what she was playing. Her series is just one more example of
music's sudden rush to celebrate its own time.
</P>
<P>
   Program illustrations for these Fisher Hall concerts are not shy
about exploiting Ms. Mutter's glamour, but if such as this draws
the wary into the concert hall let her be as glamorous as she
chooses. Masur's orchestra, with its equally easy mastery of
several styles, turned at the end to Robert Russell Bennett's
``Symphonic Picture'' of the ``Porgy and Bess'' music. A very
central European conductor wisely conducted as little as possible,
turning the music over to players who have its qualities in their
genes.

 ANGOLA'S DEADLY CIVIL WAR SPILLS INTO NAMIBIA  (ART ADV: A map is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The death toll in Namibia is
mounting as Angola's protracted civil war spills across its
southern border, resulting in killings, kidnappings and other
violence on Namibian soil.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 10 people were shot to death in the northeastern
corner of Namibia, near the Angolan border, including three French
tourists and seven Angolan rebels. On Saturday, Jan. 1, 20 Namibian
villagers in the region were reportedly abducted from their homes.
And last month, Angolan rebels attacked a Namibian police camp with
mortars and grenades, killing one officer and wounding three
others.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes, which the Namibian government has blamed on Angolan
rebels, follows the government's decision last month to allow
Angola to use Namibia as a staging ground for troops in their
26-year battle against the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or Unita.
</P>
<P>
   Unita officials promptly vowed to retaliate against Namibia. The
resulting clashes between the rebels and soldiers from Angola and
Namibia have so destabilized the territory between the countries
that the U.S. Embassy in Namibia has warned tourists against travel
in that region.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Angolan conflict beyond its borders is yet
another worrisome example of how the bitter conflicts of central
Africa continue to ensnare many peripheral countries.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe are already deeply involved in the
fighting in Congo, where they have provided armed support to
President Laurent Kabila in his struggle against rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   And diplomats and government officials here in South Africa, who
have unsuccessfully lobbied for peace in Congo, are watching the
widening conflict in Angola with growing uneasiness. They are
urging the Angolans to negotiate a settlement that might bring
stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to sit around a table and come to terms with their
situation for the sake of peace, not only in Angola, but also in
the region,'' said Daniel Ngwepe, a spokesman for South Africa's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But both Angolan and Namibian officials have dismissed the idea
of withdrawing from the conflict. The Angolan army has made
significant gains against Unita in recent months and seems
determined to crush the rebels once and for all. And Namibian
military officials have argued that Unita no longer poses a serious
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care about Unita; we're not scared about Unita,''
said Maj. Gen. Martin Shalli, the chief-of-staff of the Namibian
Defense Force, in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to give Angola whatever assistance they want,''
Shalli said.``Angola's our ally, our friend. And we as a country
have our own national interest and security interest. We cannot
have this problem on our doorstep, in our backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's shootings of the French tourists seemed to stiffen
the Namibian government's resolve. The family of five was ambushed
on Monday by about 10 gunmen in green uniforms on the Trans-Caprivi
highway about 125 miles east of the Angolan border. The Namibian
government promptly blamed the attack on the Angolan rebels from
Unita, who have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Claude and Brigitte Bidoin, were wounded in the
ambush. Their three children _ Cecile, 10, Aurelie, 15, and
Michael, 18 _ were killed.
</P>
<P>
   And as the killings made banner headlines on the front pages of
newspapers in Britain and France, raising fears that Namibia's
tourism industry might be damaged, the Namibian army stepped up its
attacks. On Wednesday, Namibia reported that it had killed seven
Unita fighters and captured four more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to fight until all Unita members are out of
Namibia,'' Shalli told local reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts warn that that will not be easy. Despite the
Angolan government's gains, Unita remains a force to be reckoned
with, and many believe the violence is unlikely to stop soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's likely to continue,'' said Richard Cornwell, a
South African analyst at the Institute for Security Studies in
Pretoria, which closely monitors the Angolan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Namibia has been persuaded that Unita is on its last legs, but
we think Unita still has sizeable forces in the field,'' Cornwell
said. ``They've gone back to their guerrilla mode and they're the
finest guerrilla army in Africa.''

ALL VANITY, NOT MUCH QUALITY IN `DAVID CASSIDY STORY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE DAVID CASSIDY STORY 
Starring: Andrew Kavovit, Malcolm McDowell, Dey Young 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: none listed 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As David Cassidy, actor Andrew Kavovit looks more like Shaun
Cassidy, David Cassidy's half brother, wearing a David Cassidy shag
wig. But that's OK, because the David Cassidy in ``The David
Cassidy Story'' doesn't much want to be David Cassidy anyway,
insofar as everyone thinks he's Keith Partridge, the Prince Valiant
of the teenybopper universe. The David Cassidy in ``The David
Cassidy Story,'' which airs Sunday night at 9, would rather play
Bob Dylan songs and not wear a rhinestone-studded jumpsuit when
singing in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Dey Young, meanwhile, goes for something a little more
postmodern in ``The David Cassidy Story.'' Rather than simply
playing Shirley Jones, she plays Shelley Long playing Shirley
Jones. It's quite a feat! Shelley Long, you may recall, played
Florence Henderson's Carol Brady in ``The Brady Bunch'' movies.
Shirley Jones, on the other hand, played Keith Partridge's mother,
Shirley Partridge, on ``The Partridge Family,'' at the same time
that she was David Cassidy's stepmother in real life. Got it all
straight?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it's not fair of me to make fun of this lame NBC
presentation, which follows ABC's crummy ``Come On Get Happy: The
Partridge Family Story'' by only two months. Maybe the people who
slapped the TV movie together, including executive producer David
Cassidy, were aiming higher than they managed to hit. But I
sincerely doubt it. ``The David Cassidy Story'' is little more than
a self-serving piece of fluff, one that sacrifices reality and
quality for vanity and superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes something like this. Little David is the neglected
son of a nasty, bitter actor named Jack Cassidy who once made the
mistake of turning down the role of Ted Baxter in ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show.'' Teenager David, devoted to his mother, auditions for
an acting gig on ``The Partridge Family,'' where he accidentally
learns that his stepmother happens to be the show's star (yeah
right). Teen Idol David is swarmed by screaming girls, which loses
its charm quickly, and he begins to despise playing in a faux band
called the Partridge Family, where the wide-eyed Susan Dey has a
total crush on him. And, finally, Young Adult David feels lost,
drops out of fame and fortune, abuses booze and Valium, gets
married and divorced, and finds love and happiness and fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   It's an over-familiar story arc, presented without a hint of
originality or sophistication. The dialogue is ridden with cliches,
like this comment from David's concerned best friend: ``Listen,
man. I love you, but you're turning into someone I don't even know
anymore.'' And the tone is relentlessly self-pitying. In just about
every scene, the movie angles to position Cassidy as some kind of
weary but well-meaning victim. His father, played with edge by
Malcolm McDowell, can't stop demoralizing him with catty comments
like ``You're just a flavor of the week.'' He desperately wants to
be creative musically, but the makers of ``The Partridge Family''
won't let him reach beyond bubblegum for fear of alienating
audiences. Groupies hide in his closets, he's not making his fair
share of money on the show, and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd and unexplained epilogue to ``The David Cassidy
Story,'' the real Cassidy makes an appearance onstage performing
with Andrew Kavovit. Hey, I'm glad that David Cassidy has overcome
his hangups about having been a teen idol and moved forward in his
career enough to make this movie and appear in it. But give me the
``E! True Hollywood Story'' or the ``Behind the Music'' version of
his life over this hollow business any day.

THE KNOWLEDGE GRAB VS. COPYRIGHT PROTECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shakespeare was great at writing plays but lousy at inventing
plots. So he borrowed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo and Juliet,'' for instance, was lifted from ``The
Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet,'' a 1562 translation of a
tale by Matteo Bandello, an Italian writer, soldier and monk.
``Julius Caesar'' came out of Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation
of Plutarch's ``Lives of Nobel Grecians and Romans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sued for breach of copyright because there wasn't any. By
and large, the work of artists, inventors and scientists was
available for others to copy, improve or improvise on at will.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that hasn't been true the last couple of hundred
years. The idea of a copyright _ to establish personal ownership of
artworks, ideas, techniques and other intellectual property _ was
included in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. In 1989, Americans
took out 95,537 patents; in 1998 the number reached 147,521 and
72,395 more were issued to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Congress extended existing copyright protection for an
additional 20 years. Major beneficiaries were corporations like
Disney, whose copyright on Mickey Mouse, for example, was to expire
in 2004, but has now been extended.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, criticism has been building in the academic world,
with many arguing that the growing privatization of knowledge will
threaten traditional intellectual and artistic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industries and governments always favor strong intellectual
property protection; academics tend to favor weaker protection,''
said Robert P. Merges, an expert on intellectual property law at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``If you took a poll of
American academics, you'd find most believe the knowledge grab has
gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a group of Harvard University law professors asked
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to declare the
Copyright Extension Act of 1998 unconstitutional. They argued that
it violated guarantees of free speech by reprivatizing works that
would otherwise have become public property. They also said it
breached a constitutional requirement that copyright laws ``promote
the progress of science and useful arts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Extending a dead author's copyright won't encourage him to
write another book,'' said Lawrence Lessig, one of the Harvard
professors bringing the case. ``Would Shakespeare have written
`Romeo and Juliet' if he had to get permission from Bandello and
pay royalties?''
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the argument, and the professors have
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Patents and copyrights are essentially a monopoly that the
government grants for a limited time to encourage art and invention
by publicizing new discoveries while ensuring the authors a fair
return.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Knowledge Diplomacy,'' a study of the
international diplomacy of intellectual property rights, Michael P.
Ryan, of Georgetown University, explains: ``From its beginning, the
basic contract between the innovator and society has been that,
rather than safeguarding the know-how of an innovation through the
darkness of trade secrets, the innovator discloses the know-how in
exchange for a limited period of exclusivity to produce and
authorize to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he writes, ``industrial diplomacy'' created
global markets for manufactured goods. Today, that has been
replaced by ``knowledge diplomacy,'' which is ``institutionalizing
trade in products of invention and expression, offering innovators
the incentive to make their products for the global market.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the fastest growth in copyrights has been in the
field of computer software (where the number of patents granted is
expected to increase to 22,500 for 1999 from 1,300 in 1990),
companies are increasingly patenting such innovations as methods of
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online bookseller, for example, has patented its
``one click'' sales system, allowing customers to place new orders
with a single press on the computer mouse. Priceline.com has done
the same for ``reverse auctions,'' which enable buyers to name a
price and find a seller. Applications for such ``business method''
patents have risen 70 percent this year, according to the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the current laws on intellectual property may
shrink the pool of freely available artworks and ideas from which
artists and inventors often draw their inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and the Construction of
the Information Society'' (Harvard University Press), James Boyle
of American University argues that the present system
overemphasizes the rights of the romanticized author at the expense
of ``the public domain necessary to give the magpie genius the raw
material she needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Already many universities and colleges have stopped providing
students with photocopied anthologies of learned articles as an
introduction to their courses. Those that still do may charge an
additional fee to cover royalties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ronald V. Bettif, a communications professor at Pennsylvania
State University, writes in his book ``Copyrighting Culture: the
Political Economy of Intellectual Property''(Westview Press): ``The
consequences of expanded intellectual property rights are always
the same: the continuing enclosure of the intellectual and artistic
commons.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more knowledge and culture are being privately
appropriated and submitted to the logic of the marketplace,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   What is patented is supposed to be novel, useful and not
obvious. Today, many critics feel the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office is granting patents too readily with insufficient research
to establish that what it protects really is new and useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PTO refuses to give examiners enough time, money and
resources to search for relevant `prior art' to establish
novelty,'' said Gregory Aharonian, who runs the specialist Internet
Patent Newservice in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of what he calls ``ridiculous patents'' he cites one
for a disposable razor with a small mirror attached so the shaver
can watch himself shave and another for a dog collar that
discourages dogs from barking by buzzing them when they do.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig agrees. ``It takes $1.2 million on average to challenge
the validity of a patent, which means it is often cheaper simply to
pay the royalties than establish that a patent isn't deserved,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many academic experts say copyrights can have
suffocating side effects, few argue for their abandonment. Boyle,
for instance, favors establishing a new property right that would
encourage native peoples to preserve forests and their tribal lore
by receiving royalty payments from pharmaceutical companies that
use the plants they live among and the natives' knowledge of them
to make profitable drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of a drug derived from the rosy periwinkle found in
Madagascar is used to treat Hodgkin's disease and are worth about
$100 million a year, he points out. But Madagascar gets nothing and
its people chop down their forests to live.
</P>

   ``Who knows what other unique and potentially valuable plants
disappear with the forest, what generations of pharmacological
experience disappear as the indigenous culture is destroyed?'' he
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that not only researchers but also participants in
experimental research should benefit from resulting medical
advances. Boyle cites the case of John Moore vs. the Regents of the
University of California, in which American courts decided that a
patient had no rights deriving from medical information about
proteins that regulate the immune system discovered through
research on his spleen.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan writes that the United States, at the urging of business,
has been aggressively pushing other countries to accept its system
of intellectual property rights in international trade
negotiations. The results are mixed, however.
</P>
<P>
   Susan K. Sell, the author of ``Power and Ideas: North-South
Aspects of Intellectual Property and Antitrust,'' argues that
despite ``their glaring vulnerability to trade threats, developing
countries have not enforced intellectual property protection'' and
``do not believe in it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is nonetheless likely to press for enforcement. Ryan
puts the cost of foreign piracy to American industry at more than
$10 billion in 1996, including $1.8 billion in the film industry,
$1.2 billion in music, $3.8 billion in business application
software, and $690 million in book publishing.

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all its familiarity, Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly'' is a hard opera to cast. When we meet her in Act One,
Cio-Cio-San, the title character, is a worldly 15-year-old,
overcome with love for Lt. Pinkerton, the hearty American naval
officer who has swept into her life and hastily arranged a
marriage, rescuing her from a humiliating life as a geisha.
</P>
<P>
   To portray her, a soprano must have fragility and tender
lyricism in her singing and demeanor. Yet Cio-Cio-San has had a
hard youth, which is reflected in the music. Whole stretches of the
role require penetrating tone and the stamina to soar. The great
Mirella Freni refused repeated requests to undertake it until
Herbert von Karajan, who had Svengali-like power over sopranos,
persuaded her to at least record the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera revived Giancarlo del Monaco's
scrupulously realistic 1994 production on Thursday night, and
naturally the focus of attention was the French soprano Sylvie
Valayre, who made her Met debut as Cio-Cio-San. Local operagoers
may remember Ms. Valayre from her intrepid performance last year in
the taxing role of Helene in Verdi's ``Jerusalem'' with the Opera
Orchestra of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valayre has been all over the soprano terrain in her choice
of roles: Norma, Tosca, Salome, Abigaille in ``Nabucco.'' Her
performance on this occasion suggested that she is essentially a
lyric soprano who has by sheer determination boosted her sound to
sing these heavy roles.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically, she made a lovely, vulnerable and, as the tragedy
unfolds, impassioned Cio-Cio-San. Her singing was confident and
often striking. She does not have a lustrous sound. A certain
stridency of tone may be the result of her taxing repertory. When
she contained her voice and shaped delicate phrases in her middle
range, her singing had poignancy and beauty. Her high notes came
with effort, but she did not shrink from them. Overall, if this was
not an exceptional Cio-Cio-San, she made the role work on her own
terms. She certainly reached the audience, who rewarded her with a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian tenor Vladimir Galouzine, who sang Pinkerton, made
his Met debut in 1994 singing impressively as Sergei in
Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,'' and he will return in
that role this season. His Russian voice, with its husky cast and
slightly nasal tone, is not ideal for Puccini. He sings with power
but not much subtlety. On Thursday night, his top notes were
notably shaky. Still, he has the breath control to project long
lines, and there was no lack of energy or ardency in his portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The mezzo-soprano Jane Bunnell was a vocally strong and
sympathetic Suzuki. The tenor Bernard Fitch was a suitably slick
Goro, and the baritone William Shimell was an elegant Sharpless,
the well-meaning but weak-willed American consul.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-born conductor Marcello Viotti, recently appointed
principal conductor of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, made his Met
debut. After a nervous start in which the strings sounded a bit
scrambled, he conducted with a just balance of vigor and pliancy.
With a new cast and conductor, there was a gratifying sense that,
whatever the results, this repertory staple had been approached
afresh.

 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An intensifying debate going on in our household is whether or
not to get a dog. My 11-year-old son, Roy, has become increasingly
adamant, while my wife for some reason thinks she will be stuck
with all the work. Guy, our 9-year-old, wants a snake. My tentative
step in the direction of pet ownership _ as well as to create
educational adventures at home _ is to send away for sea monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Remember sea monkeys? They have been around as commercial
products for at least 40 years, first as food for tropical fish,
then as pets in their own right, and lately as learning tools. They
are actually brine shrimp, and enjoyed an instant of fame in the
1960s, when John Glenn took a jarful into space to amuse his
children back on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   What is new about the sea monkey enterprise is the way the tiny
crustaceans are packaged. Ours, from Educational Insights ($19.95),
came with food, a little tank, a plastic galleon that glows in the
dark and a tool that shoots air into the water.
</P>
<P>
   We also decided on wrist watches ($9.95 each). A globe on the
watch is filled with water and you can wear a sea monkey on your
wrist. The creatures are recommended for children 6 and up.
</P>
<P>
   On reading the sea monkey instruction book, we learned that we
would witness cryptobiosis, which means ``hidden life.'' Sea
monkeys are like the grains of wheat that sprouted in the sealed
tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   We began by putting the water purifier in the tank overnight.
Then came the almost invisible eggs. There was nothing to see, but
the instructions said we had just created ``instant life.'' On the
appointed days, we added a touch of food, then plasma a few days
later. The plasma did something to the water the sea monkeys
apparently liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to fight over the females,'' Roy reported from
the instruction book. He quoted: ``Do not interfere with the fight.
It can only get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   We wait.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   GADGETRY FOR READING
</P>
<P>
   I want my children to be creative, intuitive, deductive students
who genuinely enjoy learning. So, like any other guilt-ridden,
neurotic, anxious parent, I buy them cool educational gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Quicktionary, from Seiko Instruments, looks like a fat pen with
tiny wheels at one end but is in fact a hand-held electronic
scanner geared to adults who need reading help, though children may
benefit from it as well. You roll the device over printed words in
books or magazines, and they are pronounced via optical character
recognition. Definitions _ for 400,000 words, the entire American
Heritage Dictionary _ appear on a narrow screen at the center of
the ``pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both my boys had trouble at first rolling it absolutely straight
on a line of text, but Roy gradually improved. He now finds
Quicktionary helpful and uses it with his homework. My experience,
too, was smooth and utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   But Guy, who is not as handy, rejected it. ``The dictionary, I'm
a master at,'' he said, perhaps exaggerating. ``I can find any word
in the dictionary. The scanning thing is harder for me.'' Guy's
coordination might not be developed enough for Quicktionary, which
at $249.95 is no toy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   MORE SEA MONKEYS
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days after we brought the sea monkeys to life, several
grew to more than a quarter-inch long. I arrived home one evening
to find the boys huddled in front of the tank squealing with
delight. ``Hey, Dad, the sea monkeys are mating!'' Guy exclaimed.
``They're staying next to each other and flying around the whole
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have hundreds!'' Roy predicted. The next
morning, the two monkeys were still attached. They did not separate
until late evening. The next day, the one we figured as the female
had a large swelling at the base of her tail. Fertilized eggs?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GLOBE-TROTTING
</P>
<P>
   Part of a popular series of games focused on geography, the
Geosafari Talking Globe (Educational Insights, $49.95) asks and
answers more than 10,000 questions about countries, capitals,
cities, rivers, landmarks and even national songs, which it plays.
</P>
<P>
   As many as four people can play at once, and both the degree of
difficulty and answering time can be regulated. There are many
flashing lights. (A smaller, hand-held traveling version has 5,000
questions, for $49.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Guy liked the way the voice jingled like a cash register after a
successful answer. ``I just learned that the capital of Poland is
Warsaw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The game moved along nicely, teaching effortlessly. The medium
levels seemed beyond children of 8, the youngest age for which the
globe is recommended. The upper levels often eluded me. Some
questions were repeated too often, like whether or not the Marshall
Islands are in the Pacific Ocean. But after missing a few in a row,
the game automatically lowered the level of difficulty, at least
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Roy had an idea for a future edition. He suggested the country
in question light up, making it easier to examine.
</P>
<P>
   Geosafari Know It All, also $49.95 and for children 8 and up,
looks like a small laptop computer and asks about 2,000 far-ranging
questions, from geography to weather to sports to astronomy to
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Guy thought the state-capital questions were too easy but got
frustrated with the harder ones. I believe it will work out over
time. Roy liked it because, in his view, it finally proved he can
use a dictionary: just like the top of a real dictionary page, the
screen lists the first and last words, then asks players to name
three words whose spellings would fall in between the two words.
Roy scored 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mom doesn't think I know how to use a dictionary,'' he
said with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   THINKING-CAPS TIME
</P>
<P>
   The Thinkin' Things series of computer games really do make
children think rather than recite knowledge or, as is often the
case, just play.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent titles are Galactic Brain Benders and Sky Island
Mysteries ($29.95 each from Edmark, ages 8 to 12). Guy was
immediately fascinated with Rebus Isle in the Sky Island game. At
Rebus Isle, you can sharpen your phonics by sounding out clever
combinations of letters and pictures. Guy got his Teddy bear to
push the buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Roy favored Galactic, especially a game called Stocktopus. This
involved trading items, like basketballs, and often required
players to make temporary sacrifices to reach their goals. In
addition to honing mental skills, it suggests the unthinkable to
youngsters: You can't always have what you want when you want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be No. 1 trader,'' he said a few minutes after
beginning. ``I'm not going to stop until I'm No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   I could see him at a Wall Street trading desk until, 45 minutes
later, things turned against him. He glared at the screen and
growled, ``I'm in trouble now.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   STILL MORE SEA MONKEYS
</P>
<P>
   Roy tipped the tank over, and the sea monkeys fell on the floor.
He wailed like a banshee and ran to his room, screaming that he
wanted to die. I managed to save the big, possibly pregnant, one,
but she died by the next morning. A pall settled over our
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Then we threw another pack of eggs into the tank. Like spring
rain, ``instant life'' sprouted again. A couple of our little
friends were soon quite large. The boys chatted eagerly about
buying Cupid's Arrow Mating Powder, one of the many accessories
available to sea monkey owners.
</P>
<P>
   And I tried to remember what was wrong with a dog.

Army plans to overhaul its advertising and marketing campaign,
ending its contract with the ad agency Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. after
12 years. The most immediate and perceptible impact of the changes,
which the Army announced on Friday, may be the demise of ``Be all
that you can be,'' the Army's slogan for two decades but one that
officials said may no longer attract the prospective enlistees the
Army desperately needs. By Steven Lee Myers.

surprisingly robust rate in December, propelling the economy into
the new year with considerable momentum, the Labor Department
reported on Friday. Average hourly earnings for the month rose by
0.4 percent, slightly higher than expected. But because workers are
producing more for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far
shows few signs of setting off a surge in inflation. While good

likelihood that the Federal Reserve will act to keep the economy
from overheating by raising interest rates next month. By Richard

&HT;     POLICE SEARCH LANDFILL FOR CLUES TO MISSING GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RYAN KIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. _ Investigators from Northern California have
been combing a vast landfill along the border of Washington and
Oregon in search of the body of a missing 7-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Two Vallejo police detectives have been searching since Monday
and have not uncovered any evidence about the missing girl, said
Lt. JoAnn West of the Vallejo police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still there and we're looking,`` West said. ``That's
where all our garbage is dumped, so we're looking through it.``
</P>
<P>
   West said the search of the landfill was routine and not the
result of any tips or outside information.
</P>
<P>
   Xiana Fairchild was reported missing Dec. 9 after her mother's
former boyfriend, Robert Turnbough, told the police he dropped her
off at a bus stop before going to work. He later changed his story
and told the police he last saw her outside the Vallejo apartment
he shared with Xiana's mother, Antoinette Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt Regional Landfill is perched along the border of
Washington and Oregon about 2 1/2 hours east of Portland, Ore. The
landfill, which covers more than 2,000 acres, has a contract to
take trash from Vallejo and Napa, said landfill general manager
Peter Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said the landfill accepts 180,000 tons of waste from the
two California cities each year.
</P>
<P>
   West said the detectives have been sifting through garbage
delivered since Dec. 9. She said the investigators have narrowed
their focus to a one-third-acre area where the trash from Vallejo
is believed to have been deposited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be there until we have looked through all of
it. We don't know how long it's going to take,`` West said.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill search is the latest twist in an investigation that
has confounded the police. Investigators have been repeatedly
stymied in their attempts to collect accurate information,
especially from Turnbough and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to changing his story on the last sighting of Xiana,
Turnbough also said the girl was wearing gray sweat pants when he
last saw her. But Robinson said she discovered the sweat pants at
home last weekend. Turnbough has served time for child neglect.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Turnbough, Jim McEntee, said his client is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also has given conflicting information about when she
discovered Xiana's sweat pants.

STUDENTS BEHAVING BADLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Jan. 9)  
 (Richard Flacks, a professor of sociology at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, has been conducting studies on student
culture since the early '60s. His books include ``Beyond the
Barricades: The '60s Generation Grows Up.'')  
(DW) 
 By RICHARD FLACKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professors have been complaining about the lack of connection
between faculty and students at least since the 1980s, with growing
dismay at poor lecture attendance and attention, reading
assignments that students suddenly find too onerous and courses
that must be ``dumbed down.'' Such disengagement, along with the
binge-drinking party culture that predominates at many universities
today, seems to be part of a broader pattern -- a general decline
in academic, intellectual and community life on campus.
</P>
<P>
   I began to wonder several years ago about who these disconnected
students were. My political-sociology class at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, had turned in a particularly weak set of
essays, yet there were a few papers of polished writing and obvious
effort. Those papers had not come from the typical Santa Barbara
student, who attends good schools and has high test scores and
parents with advanced degrees. They had come from students with
demanding and difficult personal lives _ a single father of a young
child who worked full time and commuted 40 miles a day, a single
mother of two school-age children and an older student who had
grown up in the inner city and entered college after serving time
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The most active, responsive students in my classes fit this
profile. Many were not admitted on the basis of their test scores
but had managed to get here by shining in junior college or by dint
of affirmative-action admissions policies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, my colleague Scott Thomas and I began a study to
explore whether there was a relationship between student
disengagement and social background. We surveyed nearly 1,000 Santa
Barbara students, about half white, a quarter Asian and 25 percent
underrepresented minorities; 50 students provided diaries and were
interviewed in depth.
</P>
<P>
   At the extremes, 15 percent had family incomes below $25,000 and
15 percent above $125,000. The latter group's SAT scores averaged
almost 200 points higher than those of the disadvantaged students.
While their dismal scores would suggest the poor students were
unprepared for the demands of college, their grade point averages
were only slightly lower than those of the more privileged
students: 2.80 versus 2.95.
</P>
<P>
   The poor students reported studying 16 to 20 hours a week;
students with household incomes of more than $125,000 said they
studied fewer than 10 hours a week to maintain their higher grades.
They also inhabited UCSB's notorious social scene. For most of its
50-year history, the university has been labeled a party school. On
any given weekend, music blares and drunken teen-agers spill into
the streets of the densely populated student enclave, Isla Vista.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the high-income students reported binge
drinking (five drinks in one sitting) at least once a month, and 40
percent imbibed excessively three to five times a month. At the
same time, 70 percent of the poor students said they never binged.
We found similar patterns whether adversity was defined by race,
income or family educational levels.
</P>
<P>
   In their spare time, the privileged students seemed to keep
their distance from the intellectually challenging opportunities
the campus offers. Instead, they worked out in the beautiful
fitness facilities that were recently opened on campus or they
watched television. A typical diary entry recounts a group of
friends sitting on a couch watching sitcoms about a group of
friends sitting on a couch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the students taking leadership roles in student
government, tutoring in local high schools, attending the
performance of a visiting theater troupe or a conference on the
global economy were disproportionately from working-class or
minority backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   These highly motivated, striving students call to mind earlier
moments in American higher education, when conventional assumptions
about class, merit and intellectual passion were challenged.
</P>
<P>
   From the '20s through the '50s, New York's city colleges ranked
among the top in the nation as producers of future doctorates. City
College was reputed to have one of the most intellectually vibrant
student bodies in the country. Its students were overwhelmingly
from working-class backgrounds, the first in their families to go
to college and often first- and second-generation immigrants. In
the '20s and '30s, the college's only admission requirement was a
high school average of 60 percent (a C), and after World War II, 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   From 1945 through 1948, with the GI Bill of Rights luring
students who would never have contemplated college before, 2
million veterans thronged the city system. A study by the
Educational Testing Service in 1952 determined that veterans'
college grades tended to be higher than nonveterans' when SAT
scores were matched.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, according to Nicholas Lemann's book
``The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,''
pioneers of testing thought they were creating a fairer basis for
college admissions: if selection were based on test scores,
working-class students could compete with graduates of prep
schools, and colleges would have a solid way to measure the
aptitudes of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   But studies show that test scores are closely correlated to
family income, which determines the quality of a student's
schooling and a family's ability to pay for test preparation. There
is also growing evidence that scores are affected by biases built
into test content and by the emotional effect of the test-taking
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says that tests predict who will succeed in
higher education. Accordingly, the best colleges recruit the
highest scorers; to upgrade, they raise SAT requirements of the
freshman class. Another prevailing assumption is that efforts to
increase access and create a more diverse student body result in
admitting students who are unprepared for a college curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Such assumptions now pervade efforts for academic reform.
Standardized testing has become the primary way to measure the
achievement of individual students, schools and school systems.
Teachers and administrators are driven by both sticks and carrots
to set and fulfill test score targets. ``Teaching to the test'' is
the newest look in pedagogy.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for college certainly entails mastery of subject
matter and the discipline to study and learn; and standardized
testing may be a useful tool for assessing educational outcomes.
But to exploit the opportunities of higher education, students must
be motivated not only to get the right test scores but also to test
their values and assumptions, and to stretch their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The students of sacrifice, the less-prepared but hungry students
who have struggled to get and stay in college, see it as a precious
opportunity for self-realization. They are the ones, at least at
UCSB, who are making the best use of what higher education has to
offer, and at the same time invigorating the intellectual climate
of the campus.

   FLAT-PANTS (Undated) _ For many years, if you were a guy who
preferred flat-front to pleated pants, you were in trouble. You had
to track them down, like a big-game hunter on the trail of an
endangered species, or else have them made. I did both, until flat
started to come back in the mid-90s. By Rick Marin. WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   PLAYBOY-PARTIES (Undated) _ Is there no place left where
40-something men can pursue women young enough to be their
daughters, the age difference overcome by the size of their
portfolios? The answer is yes _ at a Ted Field party. Field is the
Hollywood financier who, twice a year, gives a big, splashy,
over-the-top party in St. Barts, Aspen, East Hampton or Paris
during fashion week _ wherever the action is. The guest lists are
drawn up by professional party planners well connected to modeling
agencies, and the ratio of women to men is usually about two to
one. The evenings draw hundreds, sometimes thousands, no matter
what island, yacht or ocean-front mansion is chosen as the setting.

   CELLPHONES-HEADSETS (New York) _ In New York City, the public
use of cell phone headsets are poised to become the big accessory

attractive. By Penelope Green.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-KATZ (New York) _ Youth and age seemed relative Thursday
night, as did notions of gay and straight, in an evening that
involved Grace Kelly, Eartha Kitt, Noah Wyle and the drag
entertainer Divine. It started at the Walter Reade Theater, where
the producer James C. Katz was introducing his latest work, a

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the withering heat and

white flowers and spectacular scarlet, wine-red and lemon-yellow
foliage in the fall. That's what happened, however. I found it
quite wondrous. By Patricia A. Taylor.

A MEMORABLE PORTRAIT OF A GREAT AMERICAN WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Jan. 10, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT 
Produced by: Kathryn Dietz and Sue Williams 
Directed and written by: Sue Williams 
Narrated by: Alfre Woodard 
On: PBS 
Date: Monday at 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's ever been a better television biography of a public
personality than ``Eleanor Roosevelt,'' a production for the PBS
``American Experience'' series airing Monday at 9 p.m., I haven't
seen it or heard about it. It achieves an almost-perfect balance
between the epic sweep of her high-profile public life and the
intimate and psychologically acute detailing of her private life.
But its greatest virtue is the depth of understanding it brings to
her inner struggles and how she dealt with and often mastered her
childhood suffering, blistering self-doubts, troubling bouts of
depression, and yearning for emotional intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine-grained and thoroughly human picture of one of
the most powerful American women in the 20th century. Not only was
Mrs. Roosevelt a key player in the long and illustrious political
career of her husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but she had a
long and illustrious career of her own predating his presidency and
extending well past his death in 1945. Among other things, she
became the United States' first delegate to the new United Nations.
At the UN, she met initially with condescension from her
colleagues, all male, and then, typically, not only won them over
with her grace, charm, and sharp intellect but also taught many of
them a political lesson or two as she skillfully led the commission
that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans over 40 have some sense of the outer Eleanor
Roosevelt _ the smiling, energetic, and dignified but physically
gawky idealist who became an international icon for human rights.
But to an extent remarkable for a 2 1/2-hour TV program, this
birth-to-death portrait offers a richly interior and sympathetic
study of a woman of anguishing contradiction. Her shining
humanitarianism and the courage behind it were totally authentic,
but just as real were the disappointments of her five children in
being denied their mother's unqualified love. Eleanor Roosevelt,
this film makes clear, was painfully aware of this and many other
shortcomings. Her own sense of the divide between her imperfect
private self and the rather saintly persona she often presented to
the world provides the tension that animates this moving
documenatry.
</P>
<P>
   Just how courageous was this wife of our only three-term
president, who often served as his fearless adviser on domestic
issues, and especially on race relations?
</P>
<P>
   She established herself as radical enough on the race issue to
inflame the FBI. The agency compiled a file on her that, according
to one of the many excellent commentators in the film, ``is one of
the wonders of the Western world.'' When Mrs. Roosevelt was invited
to speak in racially charged Tennessee in 1958, the Ku Klux Klan
put a bounty on her head. In her 70s, she nonetheless proceeded
with the trip, refusing official protection. She flew alone to
Nashville where she was met by a woman friend, and the two drove
through the night, a loaded pistol on the seat between them, to
Mrs. Roosevelt's destination. She believed that, as she publicly
announced much earlier in her life, ``We can't have two kinds of
citizens.'' She backed up her often controversial positions with a
moral conviction and physical fortitude that lent her a lasting
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   She was a child of distinction _ Theodore Roosevelt called her
his favorite niece _ and of frightful family dysfunction. Although
loving, her alcoholic father once left her outside his New York
club and forgot about her altogether. One of her father's unstable
brothers routinely fired his shotgun out the window at neighbors.
Her mother considered buck-toothed little Eleanor homely and
nicknamed her ``Granny.'' Not surprisingly, the self-conscious
Eleanor hated coming out _ she made her social debut in 1902 _ and
loathed alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   She would later dread becoming America's first lady, partly out
of discomfort with the endless social functions required by the
role but also because she treasured her hard-won independence.
``Eleanor Roosevelt'' explains how this remarkable woman prevailed
over so many of her demons to make a place for herself in American
history, blazing a trail for other strong women as she did so. It
also investigates, with consummate sensitivity, her emotional and,
to some extent, her sexual life. Her discovery of FDR's affair with
her own social secretary, Lucy Mercer, ended Eleanor's physical
relationship with her husband. But the betrayal did not preclude an
intense, often warm, but also pragmatic partnership between them
that served their shared values and political ambitions. Eleanor
went on to have a close relationship with the Associated Press
reporter assigned to cover her, Lorena Hickock. Judging by some
candid archival footage we see showing the two of them horsing
around on a plane flight, they were close and sometimes playful.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the relationship was sexual cannot be clearly
ascertained, according to the program. It really doesn't matter,
says one of the many Roosevelt descendants who appear in the film
along with family friends and biographers. The filmmakers seem to
agree that what was important was the relaxed and devoted
companionship Eleanor was finally able to achieve in this
relationship and a later one with her physician, David Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   From beginning to end, filmmakers Sue Williams and Kathryn Dietz
seem to know what's important and, above all, how to relate Eleanor
Roosevelt's inspirational public accomplishments to her private
agonies and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Is their documentary flawless? No. As much as they do manage to
say about the complex relationship of Eleanor and Franklin, too
much is still left shrouded in mystery. And on one occasion, crazy
camera movements and frenzied music overtheatricalize an emotional
meltdown Eleanor suffered early in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   But these are minor blemishes in the context of this memorably
impressive and finely nuanced portrait of a great American woman.

MASSACRE, ADULTERY, INCEST AND BETRAYAL IN AN ELECTION YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How are the mighty chosen?
</P>
<P>
   In an election season, the greatest concern might be banality
and boredom. But in the biblical account of the election of King
David, which has just been retold in two powerful new English
translations, here are the dangers: massacre, decapitation,
necromancy, fratricide, adultery, incest, betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a king!'' the Israelite people demand of their prophet
Samuel, and against his better judgment he does. Divine guidance
seems as fallible as human judgment. The first King, Saul, is a
``fine and goodly young fellow'' who is secretly anointed by Samuel
while aimlessly searching for his father's lost donkeys. Saul is
remarkably clueless, hesitant to act, easily swayed, but when his
power is threatened his manic paranoia is unleashed in ruthless
fury. In revenge for a priest's aiding an enemy, the priest's
entire town is struck down, ``man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and donkey and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 12th century B.C., succession to power is no less
gruesome than the preservation of power. David overturns Saul's
line after a savage civil war. Even David, whose lineage is
prophetically guaranteed, is challenged twice by his own sons in
rebellions that steep the kingdom in blood. David, old and feeble,
finally chooses his heir through what seems a ruse: he is convinced
by one of his wives, Bathsheba (whose first husband David had had
killed), that he once promised the kingdom to her youngest son,
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   The only suggestion of ordered succession in these tales is the
divine promise that it will take place. But in earthly realms such
promises are meaningless. They come to fruition only by keeping
one's eyes wary and one's back covered. The existence of kings is
hardly a solution. Before a king is named, authority is corrupt,
sons are dissolute, warfare is commonplace and civil strife severe.
After a king is named, authority is corrupt, sons are dissolute,
warfare is commonplace and civil strife severe.
</P>
<P>
   One is reminded not of the legendary David _ whose mastery of
the lyre put Orpheus to shame and whose psalms are the works of a
great visionary _ but of more modern tyrants whose central project
is the preservation of power. Saul, the bloodthirsty, depressive
hick, seems almost Stalinesque.
</P>
<P>
   Both new translations of Samuel I and II also reveal something
else latent in these texts. By forcing close attention to detail,
they show how the repeated power struggles are part of a larger
unfolding drama.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Give Us a King!'' (Schocken) Everett Fox, a professor of
Judaic and biblical studies at Clark University, continues the
project he began with his version of ``The Five Books of Moses.''
Fox does not strive for transparency in recounting these familiar
stories; he wants the text to draw attention to itself. So when the
Hebrew is unsettling and artificial, the English is as well. The
names retain their Hebrew sound. The Ark of the Tabernacle is
called a Coffer.
</P>
<P>
   When David cries out in grief at the death of his traitorous
son, Absalom, instead of declaring his wish to have died instead of
Absalom, his exclamation is stilted, ambiguous and halting: ``Who
would give/my dying, my (own) in your place!'' The unnatural idiom
forces the English reader to ask the same questions the Hebrew
reader would: why are these words used and not others? What are
they trying to tell us?
</P>
<P>
   This sort of inquiry is encouraged also by Robert Alter, a
professor of Hebrew and comparative literature at the University of
California at Berkeley, in ``The David Story'' (W.W. Norton). He
does it not through his translation, which is sober and clear and
fluid, judiciously alluding to King James language while
accumulating fresh nuances. Instead, he creates a provocative
counterpoint to the biblical text: nearly two-thirds of each page
contains masterful commentary. Alter argues that this text offers
``one of the most astounding pieces of narrative'' from ancient
times, deserving a literary place next to the works of Shakespeare
or Stendhal.
</P>
<P>
   Though parts of the text are clearly patched together from
varied sources, Alter suggests that the compiler had a grand,
unified vision: images are repeatedly invoked, phrases echo one
another, no detail is accidental. Alter points out, for example,
that turning points in King David's career are marked by his
responses to death.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, the charismatic warrior is given to eloquent
elegy; at the height of his power, the elegy is a strategically
worded public proclamation; at the beginning of his decline, the
death of his infant son inspires a humble acknowledgment of his own
mortality; and finally, in old age, David is reduced to a ``sheer
stammer of grief.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the David stories might seem on their surface to be
about divine retribution for the sins of power, they are actually
meticulous accounts of flawed people shaping their own fates. The
prophets who keep appearing are not like their later counterparts,
preaching justice, condemning idolatry and promising punishment;
their proclamations actually seem superfluous. Divine influence is
hardly needed to explain the downfall of Saul or the sorrows of
David. A man's character is his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as both translations also show, fate is not solely a
matter of character: the details reveal recurrent narrative
patterns and images, oblique allusions to earlier events and
ominous signs of things yet to come _ evidence of a designer at
work giving shape both to story and to history. But that design is
not apparent to the characters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The future may be ordained, but it is realized through human
action, which is unavoidably flawed, and through the application of
power, which is unavoidably corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the issue of succession is so central to these
tales. The future in such a world is always in doubt; history's
shape is always in the making, and the relationship between human
actor and divine creator always in flux. With David's death, the
story is just beginning.

MCCAIN BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT FOR A BAD SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 9, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain is taking a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is getting castigated as a hypocrite and
grafter merely for taking part in, and playing by the rules of, a
system so corrupt that noone can participate without getting
smudged. For writing a pair of routine
get-off-your-butts-and-make-up-your-mind letters to the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of a company whose executives
gave him some cut-rate plane rides and a relative pittance of
campaign donations, McCain is being drawn and quartered.
</P>
<P>
   The foghorns of the news media, and the jibes of his rival
presidential candidates, combine to tear down the reputation of the
man who has been the bravest, loudest, most effective reformer. The
toxicity of our money-drenched political system is now poisoning
the chances of even the champion of reform. All this helps prop up,
till the next inevitable scandal, the staggering status quo. You
are getting shafted again, ladies and gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   You know that a corrupt political system is caving in on itself
when the chief advocate of reform is sucked into the gaping maw.
The system at its simplest is a volcano of campaign cash lavished
upon politicians by donors seeking favors. The cash flows like
molten lava, the irresistible force burying all in its path. The
money eventually cools into a blackened crust upon which nothing
can grow for a long time, and that is the scorched earth detritus
of representative government which Sen. McCain denounced for years.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, at the most vulnerable point of his political life,
the outspoken Arizona Republican has been ambushed by news
accounts, and his rivals' piling on, which question his honor and
his conduct. Because he has received what amounts to nothing more
than routine consideration for a powerful committee chairman and a
potential president, he is being mocked as a charlatan and a
hypocrite. Neither charge is accurate nor fair. But it comes with
the territory. McCain, as he gamely adknowledged in Thursday
night's New Hampshire GOP debate, knows what comes with the
territory. If you fly over hostile terrain, you attract
anti-aircraft fire. He's not a whiner, not a belly-acher, not a
moaner-and-groaner.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Common Cause and the Committee for Economic
Development, two outfits which have bonded to try to undo the most
corrupt aspects of our present campaign contribution system, will
host a town meeting Wednesday night (Jan. 12) at 7 p.m. at New
Hampshire College in Manchester, featuring Bill Bradley, former
Harvard President Derek Bok, various authorities on campaign
finance, and Scott Harshbarger, the national president of Common
Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of further hand-wringing about the abuses, said
Harshbarger, ``on this night, we hope to focus on the solutions
rather than the problems.'' McCain has been invited, but organizers
are not sure he'll make it. If he does show up, he'll hear
Harshbarger describe McCain as a victim of the system, not an
exploiter.
</P>
<P>
   But the suffocating cynicism of the media coverage of the bare
outlines of the story will spawn in turn even more apathy in the
electorate. It is important for New Hampshire voters to hear how
even the best-intentioned politician can be tarnished. The system
is so corrupt that even the man trying hardest to cleanse it is
dirtied in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for his own peace of mind, McCain has the kind of
character and personality which will enable him to withstand this
buffeting. No one whose jet fighter was shot out from under him can
be knocked too far off stride by this kind of flak. And no one who
stood tall under five and a half years of torture, harassment and
systemic intimidation is going to crumble like a cookie when his
five rival GOP presidential candidates take turns zapping him in
televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   There is an aching irony to this development, caused by McCain's
eagerness to prod the FCC on behalf of Paxson Communications. The
firm's lobbyist and his associates bundled contributions amounting
to $20,000 for McCain's presidential campaign, all perfectly legal.
But in Thursday night's debate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush lectured
McCain on the ethics of campaign finance, and cautioned that
outlawing soft money, the unlimited six-digit cash transfers that
pay for party political activities, would harm ``the Republican
party and the conservative cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP tends to outspend Democrats substantially in federal
elections, particularly in presidential years. Bush has so far
raised $74 million in just 52 weeks, an unprecedented landslide of
lucre thyat made him the prohibitive favorite. McCain is the only
Republican with a chance of beating Bush in New Hampshire, actually
leading by a slim three points in the latest public poll. But now
McCain gets hammered for taking $20,000 from the Paxon lobbyists,
while Bush is not criticized for harvesting $1.4 million per week
from contributors hoping he wins the Oval Office. When people are
giving you $200,000 every day in the belief you'll be able to do
them a favor, who's peddling what to whom?
</P>
<P>
   What does Enron Corp. hope to get from President Bush Junior for
the $550,000 its executives have funneled to the Bush political
operation. Anyone listening? Hello? Hello?

 &HT;     McCAIN CAMP BLAMES GOVERNOR FOR FAILURE TO GET ON BALLOT IN ALL &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Republican presidential hopeful John McCain has
failed to qualify for the primary ballot in all of New York's
election districts and blamed the setback on his party leadership's
unilateral support for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miraculous write-in campaign, McCain has therefore
already lost a third of the GOP delegates New York will send to the
Republican National Convention in August, where the party will
christen its presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain delegates will be on the primary ballot in at least 22 of
New York's 31 congressional election districts, said his state
chairman, Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari. His camp
collected 30,000 petition signatures statewide.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Bush collected 90,000 signatures and will be on
the ballot on March 7 in all 31 election districts, the state
Republican Party said. The other high-profile GOP candidate,
magazine publisher Steve Forbes, collected ``more than 50,000''
signatures and also qualified for the ballot in all 31 districts,
said his campaign spokesman, Bill Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New York's top Republicans _ including Gov. George
Pataki, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno of Brunswick and Party
Chairman Bill Powers _ support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The state carries the second-largest number of nominating
delegates in the nation, making its primary a crucial election to
win. Only California has more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of others who wanted to join our ranks, and they
were told, `You'd better not if you want a political future. This
will come back to haunt you,''' Molinari said. ``That was
bothersome but not surprising. A lot of that has been traced back
to the governor's doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon dismissed Molinari's charges.
``If there was broad support, they would be on the ballot in every
district,'' McKeon said of Bush's challengers. ``But since they've
fallen short of that, they've resorted to whining. That's too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's primary balloting process is widely considered the
most archaic in the nation. To qualify for the ballot statewide,
candidates must collect the number of signatures in each
congressional district that equal half of 1 percent of enrolled
voters there, or 1,000 signatures, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, candidates must collect at least 5,000
signatures statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most onerous process in the country,'' said Dal Col,
who said Forbes' camp spent $750,000 just to get on the ballot.
Still, that's an improvement from Forbes' 1996 primary bid in New
York, during which he spent $1.8 million, Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona senator, is the only high-profile
presidential candidate _ among Republicans and Democrats alike _
who failed to qualify for a statewide run. On the Democratic side,
both Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
handily collected enough signatures to get on the ballot in all 31
districts, their camps said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Elections will not have official results for
several days as it wades through the reams and reams of petitions
submitted by the candidates, said agency spokesman Lee Daghlian.

</P>
<P>
   Gore's state campaign made a big show of wheeling its stacks of
petitions into the elections board office Thursday. The vice
president collected 100,000 signatures _ even more, state Chairman
Eric Eve said, than what Gore and President Clinton collected in
New York during their 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley collected about 46,000 signatures. Like McCain, the
former New York Knicks basketball star also did not have the
backing of most of his party's top officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the candidate of the Democratic establishment, so
to be the insurgent and to qualify in all 31 congressional
districts is a testament to our strength,'' said Bradley spokesman
Tony Wyche.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore supporters said they were unconcerned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it shows such great strength to lose 2-1 in the
petition count,'' said Rep. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y., who was on
hand to watch Gore's petitions filed. ``I think it's a tremendous
victory for the vice president. He's got twice as many signatures
as his only other opponent. It's not like the opposition is
split.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ The gentleman from Verona reared back guiltily
when asked why a horde of pigeons was pecking around his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it on purpose; the crumbs just accidentally fell
off,'' Paul Castio, a tourist from Verona, protested, holding up
the remains of a cream pastry. But he expressed dismay over a new
city ordinance that bans the feeding of pigeons in Assisi, the
medieval hill town where St. Francis lived and preached. ``I think
it is unfair,'' he said. ``Even pigeons have to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle between man and pigeon is waged daily in almost every
European city, but it has reached a whole new dimension in Assisi,
where the age-old debate over animal rights and the protection of
historic monuments _ and human health _ is colored by the moral
teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, the humble friar (born in 1182
and died in 1226) who loved animals and preached to the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Assisi, which is still recovering from the 1997 earthquake that
damaged its famous basilica and killed 11 people, is now
traumatized by the crackdown on pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Some, and especially the mayor, say it is a badly needed measure
to control a growing pigeon population. Others view it as a form of
anthrocentricity that clashes with the town's animal-loving ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the mayor's decision, but we do not agree with
it,'' said the Rev. Vincenzo Fortunato, the spokesman for the
Franciscan order of Assisi. ``We believe there are alternatives
that respect animals and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most custodians of churches and historic buildings in
Italy, however, the Franciscan friars have put up thin wiring that
emits an electrical impulse that repels birds along key spots of
their restored basilica to protect the 13th-century building from
pigeon excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists are even more upset. ``St. Francis
called everyone brother and sister, even animals,'' said Silvia
Rapicetta, a director of the Assisi Natural Council, an
environmental and animal rights association. ``This order doesn't
take into consideration the whole problem, it just gives out
prohibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   But even animal rights groups concede that there is no easy
solution to limiting the country's rapidly multiplying urban pigeon
population. Reducing the amount of food available and limiting
nesting sites is a partial solution.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Dinetti, a national coordinator of the Italian League for
the Protection of Birds, said that introducing natural predators
like the falcon or the tawny owl to cities would be ``ecologically
sound and not cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned, ``You have to do food reduction ethically _ you
cannot just take away food overnight and stop people from feeding
the pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Venice, a city where there are almost twice as many pigeons
as people, and where signs ordering tourists not to feed pigeons
are cheerfully ignored, has taken a harsher route. There, since the
end of 1998, about 20,000 pigeons have been captured and gassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find a falcon that could eat 50,000 pigeons
everyone would applaud, but it doesn't exist,'' said Mario
Scattolin, director of Venice's Environmental Office. ``Nature is
what it is, not what Walt Disney shows us.''
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Bartolini, the mayor of Assisi, said he would not dream
of introducing extermination measures to his town, and merely
wanted to reduce the pigeon population by cutting back feedings and
closing up windows and holes in abandoned buildings where pigeons
congregate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assisi cannot serve as a welcome center for pigeons,''
Bartolini, warned. ``I am not saying that we have an epidemic on
hand, but their growth rate is alarming, and they damage buildings
and pose a health risk to people.'' Experts disagree on the degree
of risk, but pigeons have been linked to the spread of salmonella,
ticks, and allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor conceded that his order, given just before Christmas
and on the eve of a Holy Year that is expected to bring millions of
additional pilgrims to Assisi, was not widely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis was a saint; I'm just a humble mayor,'' he said.
``I have no interest in becoming a saint. I am trying to apply
common sense and pragmatism.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Assisi, he has some supporters. ``When St. Francis spoke to
the birds, it was before they installed drains,'' grumbled Piero
Coenda, the manager of Cafe Minerva, a cafe across from Santa Maria
Sopra Minerva, a medieval church built over a Roman temple in
Assisi's main piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, locals used to feed pigeons corn on the
piazza when the church bells rang at noon. ``We were infested with
droppings,'' Coenda said. ``We had to change the outdoor
tablecloths every 10 minutes.'' The church now has anti-pigeon
wiring along its roof, and the ritual noon feedings have stopped.
</P>
<P>
   There are other pigeon experts who say people have taken St.
Francis' teachings too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis probably never met a pigeon in his entire life,''
said Bernardino Ragni, a zoologist at the University of Perugia who
conducted an experimental pigeon-reduction program in Perugia.
</P>
<P>
   Ragni said he believed that pigeons were introduced a century
after St. Francis' death, brought back from the Holy Land as
dinner. ``They fed pigeons in order to eat them,'' he said. ``Man
is the pigeon's natural predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But other aviary historians disagree. Richard F. Johnston, a
scholar at the Natural History Museum of the University of Kansas,
said pigeons could be found around coastal Europe in 10,000 B.C.
and were domesticated and cooked by Egyptians, and later the
Etruscans and Romans. According to F.R. Cowell's ``Life in Ancient
Rome,'' pigeons were a delicacy served up at the kind of Roman
bacchanals that enrich ``The Satyricon'' of Petronius.
</P>
<P>
   Art in Assisi, moreover, suggests St. Francis not only met
pigeons, but also talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main art treasures inside the Basilica of St. Francis,
there is a 13th-century fresco attributed to Giotto, which was
covered in dust by the earthquake, and was recently restored. It
shows St. Francis preaching to birds, and some art historians
identify them as sparrows, quails, and also pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Ragni said he had been unable to persuade Perugia's officials to
adopt an effective anti-pigeon campaign, one that includes
extermination, and doubted whether Assisi's elected officials would
summon the political will to sponsor so unpopular a move.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they did, he said, he feared it would spark
widespread civil disobedience. ``Italians are undisciplined,'' he
said wearily, ``and they are also sentimental about very stupid
things.''

   The disturbance that brought rain to parts of southeast Texas on
Friday will weaken as it lifts northeast across the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys. Nonetheless, broken areas of
rain and isolated thundershowers will affect parts of this region.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will increase and thicken over the lower Ohio Valley in
advance of the disturbance, but areas of rain will become more
fragmented and lighter with time, limiting the affects of rain over
the Ohio Valley later Saturday and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stage will be set for heavy snow this weekend in
the Cascades as moist Pacific winds are forced to rapidly ascend
the sloping terrain. Snowfalls of two feet are possible in the
Washington and northern Oregon Cascades by late Sunday. Mountain
snows will also affect the Bitterroots of Montana and Idaho, the
Tetons of western Wyoming and parts of the Wasatch in Utah this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Vestiges of Arctic air will shrink from the contiguous states
this weekend as Pacific air continues to gain a foothold on the
nation. By Sunday, nearly the entire region east of the Rockies
will record afternoon temperatures that are above the 30-year
average for the date.
</P>
<P>
   However, much of the northern Middle Atlantic and southern New
England states will be mostly cloudy on Sunday, as moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico associated with weak jet stream disturbances
settles over the region. Patchy light rain, snow or freezing rain
could affect some parts of the region on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: STUNTED SNOWPACKS
</P>
<P>
   Snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada of California contain less than
25 percent of the amount of water that would typically be observed
in early January. Because run-off from melting snow during spring
and summer provides a large share of the water used for agriculture
and human consumption, there is growing concern for the possibility
of rationing during the upcoming warm season. Snowpacks play a more
crucial role in southern California, where there are few reservoirs
to catch run-off from rain. No big snows are in the offing in
southern California in the immediate future.

 &HT;    CLINTON BRINGS ISRAELI, SYRIAN NEGOTIATORS TOGETHER AGAIN, LAYS
OUT ROAD MAP FOR PEACE ACCORD
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (w) Washington
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton pulled Israeli and
Syrian negotiators together for a brief huddle Friday and presented
them with a U.S. roadmap of the path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The document, more than a dozen pages of detailed text, was
meant to sidestep an impasse that has bogged down a week of talks
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   The men were expected to recess the talks for most of the day
Saturday, to mark the Jewish sabbath and a Muslim feast marking the
end of the Islamic holy month, Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks were expected to get back underway Saturday night,
however, amid signs that the leaders were trying to wrap up this
round by Monday without reaching final agreement on the contentious
territorial and security issues that divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted a half-hour discussion between the two
negotiators on Friday, their second direct meeting since the talks
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of face-to-face give-and-take,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin. ``This is not warm and fuzzy, but
it is businesslike and professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to nail down and to clarify areas of agreement and
discord, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put together the
document Clinton presented the leaders with on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The text is meant to be a starting point for what U.S. diplomats
hope will evolve into a formal peace accord ending a half-century
of bloodshed and conflict between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fair amount of common ground that exists now,''
Rubin told reporters shortly after Clinton hosted the trilateral
meeting between himself, Barak and Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the remaining areas are big differences,'' Rubin said,
``and they are emotional differences and they carry with them
substantial security implications and political implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the week here was spent in what might be called
diplomatic conditioning, efforts to bring Barak and Sharaa to the
point where they would begin seriously negotiating the terms of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of an agreement are known: Israel would
return the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   That land-for-peace formulation has been fundamentally unchanged
since Israel seized the Golan in 1967, after Syria joined Jordan
and Egypt in attacking the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the arrangement, however, are myriad and fraught
with contention.
</P>
<P>
   Real progress this week, for example, has been largely stalled
by a dispute over how to sequence the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Israel differ, for example, over where the actual
border should be drawn between the two countries following a return
to Syria of the Golan. Sharaa insisted that agreement on that
border should proceed talks on other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, however, said the talks had to begin with discussion of
security arrangements, not borders.
</P>
<P>
   Over that dispute, talks largely bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Four working-level committees of subject experts were assembled
to take up security arrangements, overall relations between the two
countries, water rights and border issues.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, though, the latter two committees had not met, while
the others had met only once.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said diplomats remained hopeful that all committees would
meet by Monday. He hinted that this round might wind down by then,
with delegations returning to their respective capitals to try to
assess and digest this week's proceedings, before gathering again
at some point in the future to try to advance their peace
negotiations.

&HT;     TONY THE TIGER GETS A ROOT CANAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tony the tiger might not have felt
``grrrrrrrrrreat`` Thursday morning after getting a root canal at
the San Francisco Zoo hospital, but he is sure to feel better soon.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the 7-year-old, 380-pound Siberian tiger
actually broke his lower left canine tooth, said keeper Lori
Komejan, who noticed the snaggletooth about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She then found the missing piece _ a conical tip of bone about
the size of her thumbnail _ while draining a water pool in the yard
Tony shares with his twin sister, Emily.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when they knew he had to have a root canal,`` she said,
explaining that the blackened core of the tooth indicated severe
decay.
</P>
<P>
   First thing Thursday, zookeepers used a dart to sedate and
anesthetize Tony, loaded him onto the bed of an orange zoo cart and
drove across the quiet grounds toward the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   Tony looked as harmless as an oversized house kitty, yet it took
five employees to lift Tony's limp body onto a gurney and wheel him
inside.
</P>
<P>
   His gigantic paws _ each one large enough to fill a dinner plate
_ dangled over the side of the table as he was prepared for the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues and caretakers looked on in awe as veterinarians set
up a ventilator, injected an intravenous needle and put a catheter
in place. A cord was knotted on top of his nose to keep the
breathing tube in place and a plastic cylinder was fitted onto the
upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of Tony's mouth to
prop it open. His long tongue extended past his black lips, folded
over on itself like a piece of velvety pink ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Three dentists dealt with dental concerns while the
veterinarians monitored Tony's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to work on such big teeth,'' said Mehran Fotovatjah,
one of the dentists. And his breath wasn't too offensive, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a lot worse,`` said Fotovatjah, who had a
paper mask to wear just in case. ``Like that black tiger we did,
oooh, that was bad.``
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly a big event for Tony and his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The actual work on the tooth lasted only a few minutes, and the
dental crew worked swiftly with shiny silver tools to extract the
dead nerve, which looked like a thin piece of spaghetti burned on
one end.
</P>
<P>
   The real drama came minutes afterward when Tony's temperature
started rising, going from a normal 101.5 degrees to a high of 107
in just a few minutes as a reaction to the anesthetic, said staff
veterinarian John Ochsenreiter. Since anything above 103 is
considered dangerous and could result in shock, organ failure or
brain damage, the crew quickly placed pillowcases filled with
chipped ice between the tiger's legs and draped cool, wet blankets
to reduce Tony's temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The dentists worked quickly to fill the cavity in Tony's tooth
with the same zinc-based paste used for human fillings and filed

NATIVE SHRUBS: STAR PERFORMERS EVEN IN A DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)  
 (bl)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the withering heat and unprecedented dryness of last summer,
it was hard to imagine that a group of untended, unwatered shrubs
would decorate my garden with white flowers and spectacular
scarlet, wine-red and lemon-yellow foliage in the fall. That's what
happened, however. I found it quite wondrous, because in earlier
years the same shrubs had sailed through unremitting spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   But the real surprise is that several of these exceptional
native plants are so little known. Most shade gardeners would find
their borders enriched with the easy-care attributes of spicebush
(Lindera benzoin) and fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica). These shrubs
are also highly recommended by the Garden Club of America in its
book ``Plants That Merit Attention: Shrubs'' (Timber Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, spicebush's airy, arching branches are dotted
with small yellowish-green flowers, which appear shortly before the
3-to-5-inch-long leaves open. The flowers mature in late summer
into red fruits that nestle as precious gems among lemon-yellow
autumn leaves. If left unpruned, this deciduous shrub will reach 6
to 12 feet. I keep mine trimmed to a more demure 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One of my spicebushes is paired with a 3-foot-tall fragrant
sumac cultivar known as Gro-Low. Its dark green, glossy leaves are
somewhat similar to Irish shamrocks, with the center leaf 2 inches
long and each flanking leaf 1 inch. The triangular configuration
contrasts nicely with the spicebush's lanceolate leaves. And
Gro-Low's denser habit sets off the more open form of spicebush.
</P>
<P>
   Garden books say Gro-Low's inconspicuous spring catkins mature
into red berrylike fruit, but this has yet to happen on mine. The
fall foliage _ a deep wine red often streaked with scarlet _ is so
handsome, however, that further decoration is really not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither one of these undemanding shrubs is a spring star,
I underplant them with a variety of bulbs like white snowdrops,
pink corydalis, blue muscari and multicolored crocuses. The light
dusting of flowers on the upper branches of the shrubs provides a
gauzy covering for the splashy bulb display below.
</P>
<P>
   While both spicebush and fragrant sumac sparkle in sun, their
location in cooling shade on my property seems to have helped them
to withstand last summer's heat. I let three other underutilized
native shrubs bake in full sun, however, and they didn't mind a
bit. These star performers are groundsel bush (Baccharis
halimifolia), white autumn sage (Salvia greggii Alba) and red
chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia).
</P>
<P>
   Groundsel bush grows 6 to 12 feet tall and is native to
coastlines from Massachusetts through Texas. Property owners in
these areas plant it because of its salt tolerance. I treasure it
in my inland central New Jersey garden as a privacy screen and as
an unusual fall decoration.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, the slim leaves (1 to 3 inches) of the multistemmed
groundsel bush create a soft gray-green wall. In late September,
multitudes of grayish-white buds start to swell at every branch
tip. Then, in early October, silvery-white seed hairs burst forth
and hold for weeks. The overall effect is that of billowing clouds
crowning the shrub, a picture that is especially dramatic when
flanked by the scarlet foliage of trees like amelanchiers and
stewartias.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, white autumn sage is elusive. It is often
classified as a perennial; its bloom period, despite its popular
name, starts in mid-May, and unknown to many horticulturists, it is
hardy as far north as Zone 5. (The red and pink forms are hardy
only to Zones 7 or 8.)
</P>
<P>
   Once planted, however, this shrub is valued for its continuous
outpouring of creamy white 1 inch tubular flowers. These spray
forth in single blossoms from wiry stems that almost seem to float
above the rich green pungent foliage. While each flower is not
showy in itself, the overall presentation is one of quiet charm. In
its native southern haunts, this shrub is often called Texas sage.
There, it remains evergreen; in my borders, it loses its leaves and
flowers by late November.
</P>
<P>
   Red chokeberry is a beautiful vase-shaped multiseasonal shrub 6
to 10 feet tall. In early May, clusters of white blossoms drift
through slate-gray stems. Throughout summer, dark green leaves 1 to
3 inches long present a handsome backdrop to other plantings.
</P>
<P>
   I have the Brilliantissima cultivar, noted for its abundant
production of red berries and extravagant flame-scarlet fall
foliage. The berries, shunned by birds, remain on leafless branches
throughout much of winter.
</P>
<P>
   From years of growing experience, I know that these five shrubs
not only ignore drought and deluge but are also disease- and
pest-resistant and thrive without fertilizers. All they need is
well-drained, reasonably fertile soil _ and a little more
appreciation from the gardening public.
</P>
<P>

   All the plants mentioned except white autumn sage are available
from Forestfarm, 990 Tetherow Road, Williams, Ore. 97544; (541)

<P>
   DETROIT _ Having closed its books on a golden year, the auto
industry's movers and shakers gather here this week to congratulate
themselves and to contemplate the possibility, however remote, of
equaling or surpassing their impressive totals for 1999: an
unprecedented 16.9 million cars and trucks sold in the United
States, topping the previous record of 16 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that they operate in a business in which everything
comes down to product, product and product, the world's automakers
are using the North American International Auto Show to roll out
the vehicles that will fill showrooms in the months ahead, along
with concept cars that usually provide a sneak preview of the
vehicles that will be on the streets in a year or two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit show, once a backwater, has in recent years become
one of the world's top automotive venues. It now attracts the top
executives of most of the world's car companies, who want to be on
hand when the drums roll, the lights dim and the sheets are pulled
off their latest and shiniest creations before a 5,000-member press
corps.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, press previews of the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show
offered a warmup for Detroit; mindful of California's importance in
sales numbers and in setting style trends, many manufacturers are
now introducing models there but not in Detroit, or are showing
them in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the vehicles that made their debuts in Los
Angeles last week: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACURA 3.2CL This redesigned luxury coupe will go on sale in
March, equipped with the larger V6 and other underpinnings of the
successful Acura 3.2TL sedan. Like the TL, the CL is likely to have
a highly competitive price, probably in the mid-$20,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   SUBARU ST/X Those who remember the Subaru Brat of the 1970s will
not be too surprised by this car-cum-truck concept vehicle. Based
on the Legacy station wagon, the ST/X has four doors plus an
exposed cargo bed. A gate between the pickup box and the cabin
allows long items to be carried partly inside the passenger area.
Nissan has previously shown a truck with a similar design.
</P>
<P>
   BUICK REGAL CIELO Last year in Detroit, Buick displayed a
futuristic car, the Cielo, whose hardtop slid back in sections to
form a convertible. Now the General Motors subsidiary has given a
similar treatment to its midsize Regal sedan; it is unclear whether
the car will be offered to the public.
</P>
<P>
   MERCURY MOUNTAINEER On display in both Los Angeles and Detroit,
this show truck appears to be a thinly veiled version of the next
Mercury sport utility. The Mountaineer has a sharp-edged look in
keeping with the styling of the Mercury Cougar _ and setting the
SUV further apart from its sibling, the Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC AZTEK Shown last year in conceptual form, this
``crossover vehicle'' _ so called because it straddles the
traditional lines between cars, trucks and vans _ returns to
Detroit and Los Angeles in the form it will take when it goes into
production this summer. Based on the Montana minivan, the Aztek has
the exterior style and all-wheel-drive prowess of a sport utility.
It has removable seats, a pull-out cargo tray, removable utility
packs in the doors and a portable cooler that latches between the
front seats like a center console.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, where press previews begin Sunday, the Cobo Center
convention hall is expected to take on the look of GM's
headquarters, which are now just down the street at Renaissance
Center. The company made it clear three months ago that it would no
longer sit on the sidelines in its hometown while Ford and
DaimlerChrysler made headlines with extravagant stage shows and
critically acclaimed concept cars.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, GM has constructed the largest exhibit ever at the
Detroit show. With two decks and 164,456 square feet of floor
space, GM will, for the first time, display in a single location
many past, present and future vehicles from its various divisions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Aztek, GM will feature another crossover, the
Chevrolet Avalanche, that will also go into production. (Cadillac
is expected to get a version, too.) It has four doors and a roomy
cab for five passengers, along with a pickup bed that can be
expanded by opening a ``midgate'' between the bed and the passenger
cabin. The rear window can be removed, and the sides of the bed
have lockable storage bins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other GM show cars in Detroit that were previously revealed to
the press at the company's virtual-reality center are the Buick
LaCrosse, a luxury sedan with a pickup bed; the Chevrolet SSR,
which looks like a 1950s pickup and has a sporty interior like an
early Corvette's; the GMC Terradyne, an industrial-grade pickup
truck with an extra-large cab and expandable pickup bed; and the
Opel CVC, a compact van outfitted in winter garb, including a
plastic hatch lid that can be used as a toboggan.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will presumably try to build on Chrysler's
recent history of developing innovative concept and production
vehicles and unveiling them in a highly theatrical style. The
company is expected to show its next-generation minivans, which
will go on sale as 2001 models. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will also display four concept vehicles. The
Varsity, a five-door ``urban adventure'' Jeep, has the cab-forward
design of Chrysler's cars, with the wheels pushed toward the
corners to create a spacious interior. The Chrysler 300 Hemi C is a
luxury convertible with a powerful V8 engine, suggesting where the
automaker might go if it were to produce an all-American,
rear-drive performance car evocative of the 1957 Chrysler 300C. The
Dodge MAXXcab is a truck that promises comfort and ride on par with
a sedan; the Dodge Viper GTSR is a street-legal coupe inspired by
Le Mans racecars.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford will unveil highly fuel-efficient vehicle concepts
that stem from joint research efforts of the industry and the
federal government. Both the Ford Prodigy and GM Precept use a
combination of electric motor and small diesel engine to travel up
to 80 miles on a gallon of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to reality, Nissan will unveil its 2000 Sentra, an
efficient and extremely clean car that goes on sale this year. The
Sentra's 1.8-liter engine was certified this fall by the California
Air Resources Board as the cleanest gasoline-burning engine in the
world. Nissan will also introduce a restyled Pathfinder sport
utility in Detroit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Acura will also show in Detroit its MD-X, a slightly disguised
version of the next-generation sport utility that will replace the
SLX, which has been built by Isuzu. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sporty roadsters always draw crowds at auto shows, and there
will be several new ones on hand, including a Jaguar show car; the
production version of the BMW Z8, which has already appeared in a
James Bond film; and two from Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   One, based on the A-Class sold in Europe, is a foot shorter than
the existing SLK and borrows styling cues from the SLR supercoupe
shown at last year's auto shows. The other, larger roadster
actually is a topless version of the SLR. Both evoke Mercedes'
legendary Silver Arrow racers of the 1950s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several vehicles that were shown at the Tokyo Motor Show last
fall will also make their first North America appearances in
Detroit. Ford will show its quirky 021C concept, the first car
designed by Marc Newson, an Australian known for his trendy designs
of kitchen accessories, watches and other consumer products. This
urban vehicle is built around elements of Ford's next-generation
small-car platform.
</P>
<P>
   The Mazda RX-Evolv is a four-seat, four-door sports car with a
new version of Mazda's rotary engine. It may presage the next
edition of the RX sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Toyota's luxury division will show the Lexus Sport
Coupe, which is destined to replace the current two-door Lexus SC
models. The aluminum hardtop on the concept car drops in seconds,
turning the four-seat coupe into a convertible. Lexus will also
show its next-generation flagship sedan, the LS430, which is being
restyled and given a more powerful V8 engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rear-drive car called the XVL, which wore a Nissan badge in
Tokyo, will appear in Detroit as an Infiniti concept car.

   NEW YORK _ Youth and age seemed relative Thursday night, as did
notions of gay and straight, in an evening that involved Grace
Kelly, Eartha Kitt, Noah Wyle and the drag entertainer Divine. It
started at the Walter Reade Theater, where the producer James C.
Katz was introducing his latest work, a restored version of the
1954 Hitchcock classic movie ``Rear Window.'' Katz and his partner
Robert A. Harris _ they also restored ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Vertigo'' _roam the world like detectives searching for bits and
pieces of original film and piecing them together.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd line of work, part schmoozing Hollywood to raise
cash and part staring at Jimmy Stewart's blue eyes for days.
</P>
<P>
   After years of slogging through piles of old film, this was
Katz's night to let the film shine for film scholars and buffs. The
cocktail party following the screening was no fashion show, with
lots of critics in baggy sweaters and overcoats. Katz, looking at
60 like Daddy Warbucks in his Brooks Brothers chalk-stripe suit,
cut out to hit the town.
</P>
<P>
   His taste in New York like his taste in film is strictly
vintage. With his wife, Marty Wyle, 54, he swept a small entourage
into a waiting car. They would have hit Mortimer's, but it is gone,
and La Goulue is being renovated. So they went to Jo Jo to soak up
a couple of drinks. They are a good match. She drinks her Bombay
martini with olives, he with a twist; she thinks Grace Kelly had
the more luminous skin, he thinks Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   The Katzes have lived in the Hollywood Hills for decades in a
1922 Mediterranean-style house where they raised six children,
Brady Bunch fashion, three of hers, three of his. One of her sons
is Noah Wyle, the star of the television series ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   His conversation is nostalgic, especially about the Upper East
Side. ``I really enjoy coming back,'' he said. ``But it seems so
big now. You never used to go to Canal Street or SoHo. You know,
I'm not very with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he said, he would go see Angela Lansbury sing.
``I'm accused of having a gay gene,'' Katz said of his love for
cabaret, old movies and old standards. He met Michael Feinstein,
the lounge singer, when Katz produced ``Scenes From the Class
Struggle in Beverly Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he produced ``Lust in the Dust'' and befriended
Divine. ``Did you know his parents were nursery school teachers?''
asked Ms. Wyle, a retired nurse, whose experience paid off when her
husband was in charge of the 1983 rerelease of ``Rear Window'' and
Jimmy Stewart was ailing. ``They only let him go to Europe because
I was a nurse,'' she recalled. ``We all shared a two-bedroom hotel
suite.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was time to dash to the Cafe Carlyle, where Eartha
Kitt was about to do her 10:45 show. The Katzes took a table front
and center. More martinis. Ms. Kitt took the stage like a griot of
some ancient animistic cabaret religion. She overcame pepper-mill
bearing waiters, late hours and gravity by sheer force of will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her in 1952,'' Katz said with excitement. ``My dad took
me to see her 48 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She announced from the stage that she'd be turning 73 on Jan.
17. ``She's still got the voice, that's a relief,'' Katz said.
``Great body, great dress.'' His appraisal was in keeping with his
passion for all the great old classics.

 &HT;    BRITISH TV PERSONALITY'S MYSTERIOUS MURDER STILL STUMPS
INVESTIGATORS
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   LONDON _ Eight months after the mysterious murder of one of
Britain's most beloved television personalities, Scotland Yard
remains short of clear suspects mired in inconclusive leads.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Dando, 37, died instantly April 26 when she was shot once
in the head with a 9mm pistol at the front door of her house in
London's trendy Fulham district. In addition to anchoring the BBC's
Six O'Clock news, Dando also hosted two popular weekly shows _ the
detective series, Crimewatch, and the travel show, Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The murder and its implications about the cost of fame still
trouble TV personalities here. ``When you are in people's living
rooms, there is always the risk of attracting unwanted attention,''
said Sue Barker, a BBC sportscaster and Dando's friend. ``If you do
a job like mine _ and I love what I do _ you can't live your life
constantly looking over your shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the shooting took place in broad daylight, there
were no witnesses. Neighbors reported seeing more than 20 men who
seemed even a little suspicious _ leads still being followed by
police.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Scotland Yard said it will send investigators to the
United States to consult with FBI ballistic and forensic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul Conlan, the longtime Scotland Yard chief, lists the
unsolved case among the major frustrations that will haunt him
after he retires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the privilege and joy of knowing Jill,'' Conlan told The
Evening Standard. ``If you know the victim the challenge seems that
much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Conlan is convinced that the killer will not go unpunished.
``This case is solvable _ and it will be solved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Scotland
Yard has spent more than $60,000 a week investigating what a police
agency spokesman describes as ``thousands of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to establish a clear motive for the killing.
Dando wasn't robbed, and there was no apparent burglary of the
home. Some investigators have speculated that she may have been the
victim of a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of progress, detectives met secretly in
mid-December at a London hotel to assess where the investigation
was heading, according to local press reports. The meeting also was
meant to bring in the probe's new chief, Brian Moore, a former
undercover investigator assigned to target police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These days investigators are focused on records of mobile phone
calls made in the area the day Dando was killed. An estimated
10,000 calls were made in the heavily populated neighborhood that
day, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the killer made at least one call soon after
the shooting. Witnesses reported seeing a man talking on a mobile
phone between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. outside Dando's home. A
sweating man later was seen talking into a phone as he ran up a
street away from the scene of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Police found six distinctive marks on the cartridge case of the
fatal bullet. Experts believe the round may have been tampered
with, possibly to reduce the amount of powder to deaden the sound
of the blast. Neighbors told police they heard no shot, only a
scream.
</P>

 &HT;    BRITISH TV PERSONALITY'S MYSTERIOUS MURDER STILL STUMPS
INVESTIGATORS
 &HT;    With Photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Eight months after the mysterious murder of one of
Britain's most beloved television personalities, Scotland Yard
remains short of clear suspects mired in inconclusive leads.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Dando, 37, died instantly April 26 when she was shot once
in the head with a 9mm pistol at the front door of her house in
London's trendy Fulham district. In addition to anchoring the BBC's
Six O'Clock news, Dando also hosted two popular weekly shows _ the
detective series, Crimewatch, and the travel show, Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The murder and its implications about the cost of fame still
trouble TV personalities here. ``When you are in people's living
rooms, there is always the risk of attracting unwanted attention,''
said Sue Barker, a BBC sportscaster and Dando's friend. ``If you do
a job like mine _ and I love what I do _ you can't live your life
constantly looking over your shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the shooting took place in broad daylight, there
were no witnesses. Neighbors reported seeing more than 20 men who
seemed even a little suspicious _ leads still being followed by
police.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Scotland Yard said it will send investigators to the
United States to consult with FBI ballistic and forensic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul Conlan, the longtime Scotland Yard chief, lists the
unsolved case among the major frustrations that will haunt him
after he retires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the privilege and joy of knowing Jill,'' Conlan told The
Evening Standard. ``If you know the victim the challenge seems that
much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Conlan is convinced that the killer will not go unpunished.
``This case is solvable _ and it will be solved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Scotland
Yard has spent more than $60,000 a week investigating what a police
agency spokesman describes as ``thousands of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to establish a clear motive for the killing.
Dando wasn't robbed, and there was no apparent burglary of the
home. Some investigators have speculated that she may have been the
victim of a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of progress, detectives met secretly in
mid-December at a London hotel to assess where the investigation
was heading, according to local press reports. The meeting also was
meant to bring in the probe's new chief, Brian Moore, a former
undercover investigator assigned to target police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These days investigators are focused on records of mobile phone
calls made in the area the day Dando was killed. An estimated
10,000 calls were made in the heavily populated neighborhood that
day, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the killer made at least one call soon after
the shooting. Witnesses reported seeing a man talking on a mobile
phone between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. outside Dando's home. A
sweating man later was seen talking into a phone as he ran up a
street away from the scene of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Police found six distinctive marks on the cartridge case of the
fatal bullet. Experts believe the round may have been tampered
with, possibly to reduce the amount of powder to deaden the sound
of the blast. Neighbors told police they heard no shot, only a
scream.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard detectives will consult with U.S. ballistic
experts about the type of gun used in the attack and the apparent
modification of the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Conlan denied that the force's decision to seek help in
the United States represents an act of desperation. ``There's a
premier league of police forces around the world,'' he said. ``The
FBI and the (Metropolitan Police) are world players. We work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 20 years to catch the Uni-bomber in the United States.
We will keep looking for Jill's killer until he is found.''
</P>
<P>

gynecologist Alan
</P>
<P>
   Farthing. They were to be married in September. On the day of
her shooting, she reportedly told Farthing's mother that she
planned to spend the day planning for the big event.

<P>
   Sales of luxury cars (and luxury trucks) rose again last year,
and most manufacturers reported gains. Conspicuous exceptions were
the two American luxury brands, Cadillac and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the American marques lost their place at the top
of the sales chart for the first time ever. Mercedes-Benz moved
into the No.1 spot with sales of 189,437 cars and sport utility
vehicles. Second place went to Lexus _ a brand that celebrated its
10th birthday only last year _ with 185,890 sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, which a year ago passed Cadillac for the first time
since 1939, fell to fourth place as its sales plunged by 10,628.
Cadillac was in third, ahead of Lincoln once again, but its sales
fell, too, by 4,063.
</P>
<P>
   With an increase of more than 22,000, to 153,658, and a hot new
sport utility, the X5, BMW is also within striking distance of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Other big gainers were Jaguar, up 56 percent; Audi, 39 percent;
Land Rover, 37 percent, and Saab, 29 percent.

ON THE PANTS FRONT: THE WAR OF THE PLEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 (For release on Sunday, Jan. 9.)  
(DW) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some things I refuse to wear. Shoes that buckle up on
the side, those brown thatched leather belts that scream ``casual
Friday'' and pleated pants. The first two have been easy enough to
avoid. The pleats have been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, if you were a guy who preferred flat-front to
pleated pants, you were in trouble. You had to track them down,
like a big-game hunter on the trail of an endangered species, or
else have them made. I did both, until flat started to come back in
the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Prada and Gucci led the return to 1960s sleek. Their neo-Rat
Pack silhouette began to elbow out the drapy Armani look, whose
multipleated nadir may have been those white Aladdin-style pants
Don Johnson wore on ``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Barneys does not even sell pleated pants in its
sportswear department. Donna Karan men's wear is 85 percent
flat-front. There is evidence, too, that in Middle America the
pendulum is swinging back to flat. In November, the men's-wear
trade publication DNR reported the good news on its cover: ``In Age
Old Debate, Flat-Fronts Now Gain on Pleats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all those who lose sleep at night waiting for a silhouette
change,'' the article announced, ``it's here, with all the
ramifications.'' At Banana Republic, flat chinos were for the first
time narrowly outselling pleats at the 300-plus stores in the
chain, DNR said. Sales of flat-front casual pants at Federated
Department Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's _ bastions
of Dockers and Haggar pleats _ are approaching 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering where J. Crew, another bellwether of mainstream taste,
is lining up on this ``age-old debate,'' I called Emily Woods, its
chairwoman and co-founder. ``My first inclination is to say flat,
flat, flat,'' Ms. Woods said. ``We have moved from 60 percent
pleats just under two years ago in both styles and sales to just
over 50 percent flat-front.'' She added that J. Crew's first
stone-washed, stone-colored chino, introduced when the company
started in 1983, was flat-front.
</P>
<P>
   We know fashion goes back and forth, and back again. But for
men, trends seem to cycle more slowly than for women. I've been
waiting a long time for pleats to go away. Or maybe it just feels
that way because pleats make me look fat. Or at least a little
fuller in the hip area than I'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Pleats are allegedly more comfortable. But if you're a
relatively young man and you're wearing clothes primarily for
comfort, rather than to look good, you've sort of given up, haven't
you? Perhaps you've also started wearing Rockports instead of
proper dress shoes? Are pleats actually more comfortable? A 34
waist is a 34 waist, whatever kind of accordioning of fabric and
fat is going on underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have really learned to understand flat-front pants,'' said
Don Witkowski,'' the president of Donna Karan and DKNY men's wear.
``I think they thought pleats hid parts of the man's body, like
overweightness or whatever, because there was more fabric on the
front, which is just a fallacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of stretch fabrics has gone hand in hand with
the flat revival, and stretch will do more on the comfort front
than pleats ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the vanity issue, the slim, clean line of flat-front,
straight pants are part of aretro aesthetic I've had since I used
to borrow my dad's skinny ties in high school. It goes with the
mid-century mod furniture in my apartment and the voices in my head
telling me I was born 30 years too late to buy one of Rob Petrie's
Botany 500 suits or guzzle highballs at El Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``The Graduate'' (1967) the other night on Turner
Classic Movies, I coveted Dustin Hoffman's wardrobe, his preppy
button-downs and flat-front chinos. Steve McQueen and Sean
Connery's James Bond set off similar pangs of sartorial envy.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a little historical perspective, I asked John Weitz,
the 77-year-old designer, about pleats versus flat-front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it all goes in circles,'' he said. ``The modern-day
circle started after the war, when the men came back wearing what
are now unfortunately known as chinos but were then called suntans,
because they were a tan pant and they were flat.'' Until then,
Weitz continued, ``the only people who wore flat pants were the
upper classes. You saw them in Brooks Brothers and the Ivy League.
The rest of the country wore great big pleated pants in a rather
bad imitation of the Duke of Windsor.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Weitz boils it down, Americans wore flat-fronts until
Europeans, trying to look like Americans in old Hollywood movies,
started doing pleats and convincing Americans to copy them.
Head-spinning, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   He's right about Brooks Brothers, though. Three years ago, I
finally got around to buying a tuxedo and the only place I could
find one with a flat-front pair of pants was at Brooks Brothers.
(J. Press, the other old-money clothier, also stuck with
flat-fronts during the dark ages.) The leg was a little wide, but
it was the best I could do at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I would also argue that flat-front is a more enduring way to go.
Sure, Cary Grant was always dapper in pleats. He was Cary Grant.
But in the '60s, when flat-fronts were standard issue, you didn't
have to be President Kennedy to look sharp in them. They could make
Joey Bishop look hep. Try digging up a picture of yourself in a
pair of billowy triple-pleats, circa 1984. Now burn it and if you
still have them, the pants, too.

   FBN-AFC-LEDE _ Once again, the-little-QB-who-could is in the eye
of a storm. The Bills wanted to rest starter Doug Flutie last week
to keep him healthy and give Rob Johnson a chance to play. The move
backfired. Johnson had one of his best performances ever, creating
a playoff-eve QB controversy. (Schlabach, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 22.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NFC-LEDE _ History suggests that Detroit will make a quick
exit from the playoffs today. The Lions haven't won in Washington
since 1968, a string of 17 straight losses. And players are aware
of the history. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-MARINO _ And so after nearly 17 seasons, it has come to
this: Dan Marino, the most productive passer in NFL history, being
mentioned in the same breath as Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Y.A.
Tittle. Only these days, the 38-year-old Marino is conjuring up
images of a sorry sort: A 40-year-old Unitas getting sacked on his
final play. A battered Broadway Joe hobbling off the field in a
Rams uniform. Tittle, on his knees, blood dripping from his face.
(Capozza, Palm Beach Post). 32. WITH PHOTOS.

   FBN-NFL-EUROPE _ IRVING, Texas _ On a rare day off, Brandon
Noble would sit on his hotel balcony in northern Spain, wondering
if the NFL was on his horizon. The beautiful scenery surrounding
the tiny town of Sitges, a suburb of Barcelona, is a perfect
honeymoon destination, but in the spring of 1999, Noble was on a
business trip. He was a defensive tackle for the Barcelona Dragons,
a charter member of NFL Europe, so the nearby Mediterranean beaches
and old Spanish castles had to wait. ``I lived in a little resort
area for two springs,'' Noble said during a break from practice
this week. ``The first year I took in all the sites. The second
year I really was more wrapped up in football.'' For Noble and
hundreds of other football players, NFL Europe is a breeding ground
for future NFL prospects. Players who live in Barcelona or
Frankfurt or Berlin aspire to catch the attention of scouts from
Dallas, Green Bay or Kansas City. (Cantu, Austin
American-Statesman). 20-24.

SEEING FICKLE FINGERS IN A NASDAQ DOWNTURN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (Eds: Questions may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Everett M. Dirksen, the late senator from Illinois,
reportedly said, ``A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon
you're talking real money,'' it was the 1960s, and he was talking
about the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, the standard was ratcheted up a tad. Consider the
technology-laden NASDAQ stock market: Last year, the capitalization
for the market's stocks doubled from the end of 1998, to $5.2
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar number ran up so fast _ particularly in December _
that few people actually thought of it as real. But the $500
billion or so that was cashed out or lost in NASDAQ's 4.6 percent
slide last week is not funny money.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager for Firsthand Funds, which
invests exclusively in technology, has seen NASDAQ sell-offs
before. He took some time last week from his office in San Jose,
Calif., to talk about what he sees in this one. Following are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Most observers were expecting a sell-off in technology stocks
early this year, after the huge run-up in 1999. Has its magnitude
surprised you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I look at this as mood swings: I can't predict mood swings,
but I am not surprised by them. I don't try to time market
sell-offs, but when I see one I try to take advantage of it. Last
year, we had three different dips in the NASDAQ of between 8
percent and 10 percent, and each time it was down for only a brief
period.
</P>
<P>
   We have a fair amount of cash on hand, and a bunch of companies
we like are more affordable now than they were a week ago. We
intend to go shopping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would give you cause for concern that this is something
more serious? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If we had fundamental bad news about the technology industry
in general or any of these companies in particular, then you could
argue that there is a lot more room to fall. But there is not a lot
of fundamental news that is driving the sell-off. It is psychology.
Some investors have been trying to pick the point where they are
going to take their profits. And a number were holding on for dear
life. Now that they think they have seen the near-term peak, they
want to get out. As usual, they all want to do it at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, many have referred to what happened last year as a
mania, or a speculative bubble. Is that a fair assessment? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Every time stocks go up aggressively, people come out of the
woodwork to say it is a bubble, but nobody really knows.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Cisco Systems and Microsoft bubbles that weren't
bubbles. Look at the eBay bubble that so far hasn't been a bubble.
Most of this is real. It's not tulip bulbs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the Lucent Technologies earnings warning on Thursday
qualify as a fundamentally bad development? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Companies miss their numbers. Big companies can have a bad
mile and still run a great race. This is nothing more than that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you give some past examples of bad fundamental
developments? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Think what happened to personal computer stocks over the last
few years, where price elasticity turned pretty unfavorable in that
market and price pressure intensified. Think about all the wireless
companies during the Asian financial crisis, when rollouts in those
markets were postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Downward revisions of basic demand would be bad. That is not
happening here. In fact, there re a number of interesting
catalysts that could be spurring demand.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the time and effort corporate America has been
putting into testing systems for Y2K is going to be used in the
e-commerce transformation, and I think that will lead to some
fairly aggressive spending in that area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can investors look to see if demand has materialized? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a couple of quarters it will show up in results from
companies like Exodus Communications, which provides Internet
system and network management solutions to business, or at Commerce
One or BroadVision, which are e-commerce software companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you among the many folks who worry about the threat that
rising interest rates seem to pose to technology stocks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Whenever interest rates become an issue, it lasts for a few
days, and then it is back to buying. What would worry me in terms
of a big compression in price-earnings multiples is if there were a
lot of other really compelling investment alternatives for people.
Absent that, I don't worry too much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of companies do you like now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The types of companies we have been most interested in lately
are those that provide underlying e-commerce technology and
photonics companies, those who make equipment to move data on
lasers. In general, we have avoided the dot-com names. That has
made us a little less volatile and allowed me to sleep better at
night. I think we will continue that way.

 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
    c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi is following a formula perfected
by Republican Rep. Tom DeLay as she revs up her campaign for
Democratic whip in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The DeLay formula: Raise campaign funds and share the money with
fellow House candidates in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   If Pelosi's efforts are successful, the Democrats would regain
control of the House and she then would call in her chits to win
election to the majority whip's post, the No. 3 job in the party's
House hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, said last week she thus
far has raised $700,000 and contributed nearly $500,000 to her
party's House candidates, mostly to women and minorities and to
candidates in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi brushes aside any comparison to DeLay. She says
fundraising is essential for victory and that without aggressive
fundraising, Democrats will ``get overwhelmed by Republican
money.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay clinched the Republican whip's job after his party
captured a majority of House seats in the 1994 election, the first
time in 40 years that the GOP controlled the House.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay gave nearly $2 million to Republican House candidates in
that election. They showed their appreciation by electing him whip
over two rivals in the secret ballot of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides handing out cash, DeLay helped GOP candidates by hiring
a political consultant to provide campaign tips. He also
distributed a video of his own motivational advice for the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said last week that his victory had ``nothing to do with
money.'' Instead, ``It has to do with building relationships,'' he
said, adding that the key to his success was ``analyzing races and
making sure you're involved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who
managed DeLay's whip campaign, said a lot of members ``owed'' DeLay
because of his hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay really took it to a new level with the amount of money
he raised,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   The whip is elected by party members who cast secret ballots for
leadership posts _ usually in December after an election. The whip
is the party's top vote-counter in the House. As the party
disciplinarian, the whip also works to keep members in line on
leadership votes. The job requires organizing coalitions, listening
to members and sometimes twisting their arms.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats seize control of Congress, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, now the Democratic leader in the House, is expected to be
elected speaker. Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, now the party
whip, would become majority leader, leaving open the post of
majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   For Pelosi's scenario to have a chance, the Democrats must first
win control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi created a political action committee, called PAC to the
Future, which she uses to raise funds and contribute to her
selected candidates. Federal law limits her PAC to $5,000
contributions to a candidate in the primary election and $5,000 for
a candidate in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $700,000 raised by her PAC came from a San Francisco
fund-raiser at the St. Francis Hotel in November with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she has given Democratic candidates and her party
more than $300,000 so far from her PAC and more than $150,000 from
her own campaign coffers, which she says she can afford because her
seat is safe.
</P>
<P>
   She says `'is not trying to break any records'' raising money
but will raise more if candidates need it.
</P>
<P>
   She also plans to hold four fund-raisers in her home in
California for Democratic candidates before the March primary. Her
preferred California candidates are Mike Honda, who is running for
the seat vacated by Rep. Tom Campbell; Susan Davis, who is
challenging Rep. Brian Bilbray; Jane Harman, who is running against
Rep. Steve Kuykendall, and Adam Schiff who is challenging Rep.
James Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi also says she is ``going one step beyond with helping
women candidates and minority candidates'' even if they aren't in
the most competitive races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to encourage more diversity in Congress,'' Pelosi
said.
</P>
<P>
   She says the 10 percent representation women have in the House
is inadequate, especially when the lawmakers consider such issues
as Social Security, Medicare and women's health.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., who would be her chief rival in the
whip's race if Democrats win control of the House in November, says
he is relying on relationships he has established, rather than on
dishing out dollars. Hoyer says he has given less than $100,000 to
Democratic candidates, and has about $225,000 in his political
action committee left to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``If money is the arbiter of who's going to win this race, I
don't expect to win it,'' Hoyer said. He says he has traveled from
Alabama to New York to work for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, Hoyer
has another link with his Democratic colleagues. He offers them
advice and counsel on how to manage their offices and finances.
``While members are going to think raising money is important, I
think they'll appreciate my focus on winning the House back,'' he
said.

   Nietzsche and Math, Together Again
</P>
<P>
   In the latest effort to convert the mathematically squeamish,
Dartmouth College has developed a new program, ``Math Across the
Curriculum,'' that integrates the subject into some very unlikely
places _ art and literature, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Matter of Time'' pairs a comparative literature professor
and a math professor to lead discussions on the fourth dimension.
Readings include ``One Hundred Years of Solitude'' by Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, the Book of Genesis and works by Freud, Nietzsche,
Poe and Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pattern'' explores elementary group theory and its
applications to art, ranging from mandalas to Escher to Islamic
tiles. For die-hards, ``Integrated Mathematics and Physical
Sciences'' combines math, science and physics.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is financed by the National Science
Foundation, ``presents math in the most integrated fashion, using
students' interests as the hook,'' explained Dr. Jane Korey, an
anthropologist and consultant on the project. ``We all learn better
if we can attach ideas to something we already know, so if you're a
strong literature person and the math you use has to do with
literature, you can bootstrap your way up.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It shows students that math is relevant to their
lives and will be useful to their futures. Math is a whole way of
looking at the world.''

   Changing Times at Harvard Law
</P>
<P>
   Image is everything, especially if you are a hallowed
institution trying to alter unflattering public perception. So it
is with Harvard Law School, long synonymous with cut-throat
competition, back-stabbing students and terrorizing professors a la
``Paper Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is indeed afoot. The school's Institutional Life
Committee is exploring ways to diminish the emphasis on grades,
including making the first term pass-fail and reducing the
distinctions from nine letter grades to four categories _ high
honors, honors, pass or fail. The changes could be carried out as
early as next fall, said professor Elizabeth Warren, the committee
chairwoman. The school is also hoping to hire more teachers to
reduce class sizes and offer students more individual attention.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are being considered at the suggestion of McKinsey &AMP;
Co., a New York consulting firm that was hired last year to gauge
the school's mood. The company held dozens of focus groups with
students, faculty members and alumni on everything from the state
of the gymnasium (shabby) to class size (too large) to grading
(fierce) to professor accessibility (limited).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small part of a broad review of the law school's
academic enterprise,'' said Michael Chmura, the law school news
director, explaining the study and proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do, he added, with the fact that Harvard Law
has slipped to No. 2 in the U.S. News &AMP; World Report rankings,
behind its archrival, Yale.

   No Sex, No Alcohol, Just Government
</P>
<P>
   On 44 acres of secluded land in Virginia, about an hour west of
Washington, the foundation is being laid for an experiment in
higher education _ the nation's first post-secondary institution
designed for home-schooled students and a training ground for
Christian political advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Henry College, to open this fall in Purcellville, aims
to ``help return America to its biblical and constitutional
roots,'' as the literature states. Initially, only bachelor's
degrees in government are being offered, though Michael P. Farris,
the founder and president, is considering an entertainment major _
to nurture a generation of Christian ``storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In very broad terms, I want our students to engage the
culture,'' said Farris, who heads the Home School Legal Defense
Association and was the 1993 Republican nominee for lieutenant
governor of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year, officials expect to enroll 100 students, 80
to 90 percent of whom would be home-schooled _ a movement fueled,
in part, by parental discontent over the secularization of schools.
All Patrick Henry students must be Christians who can demonstrate
``a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' Farris said, and
should engage in Christian social activities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a gentleman who wishes to court a young lady will
be encouraged to contact her parents, or at the least have her seek
their permission before joining him on group outings. Male and
female dorms will be on opposite sides of the campus, and
premarital sex and alcohol are to be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a philosophical level, we want to encourage students to
think of relationships as preparing for a lifelong commitment,''
said Bradley P. Jacob, the provost and dean of the college.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators say there are no plans for any dating police.
``The essence of the Christian life is forgiveness,'' Farris said.
``We're not going to ask them what they did. We're going to ask
them what they plan to do.''

   Don't Call Them Kelly Girls
</P>
<P>
   The business of hiring substitute teachers _ once a low-key,
word-of-mouth affair and increasingly a frenetic, haphazard
scramble _ has just become a little more crisp. Kelly Services,
whose so-called Kelly girls began pinch-hitting in the office in
1946, now recruits, trains and manages substitute teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is starting the program in response to a nationwide sub
shortage: 96 percent of roughly 500 school districts that were
surveyed by the Substitute Teaching Institute at Utah State
University said they often came up short. According to Geoffrey G.
Smith, who manages the institute, an educational group that helped
Kelly create its training program, the shortage is fueled by the
lack of available labor in a hot economy and an increase in
professional development sessions, which take teachers away from
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   A Kelly manual explains the mysteries of school life, like
passes and study halls. The service also trains substitute teachers
to handle situations like what to do when the lesson is over but
the time period is not (beforehand, make a ``super sub pack''
filled with time-consuming activities).
</P>
<P>
   So what gives first-timers the most jitters? ``The first five
seconds,'' said Carl Camden, Kelly's executive vice president.
``You walk into the room, and things are flying in the air and
children are involved in their own conversations. If you speak,
will they listen? How do you get their attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Camden's advice: Speak softly. It's far more effective than
shouting.

   Spirits and Spirituals
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to develop character while living in Animal
House? ``Colleges That Encourage Character Development,'' a new
guide to 400 institutions with programs fostering honesty,
integrity and all-around good character, has made room for the
State University of New York at Albany. Singled out for a peer
counseling program, Albany was also ranked No. 1 party school last
year by another organization, the Princeton Review.
</P>
<P>
   Four colleges on this year's party list, compiled from a survey
of students nationwide, showed enough sobriety and good ethical
form for the guide's publisher, Templeton Foundation Press, which
is part of the foundation financed by Sir John Templeton, the
mutual fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have completely reversed our character,'' said Vincent
Reda, a spokesman for SUNY Albany, which like other institutions of
higher education denounces the Princeton Review list as a gross
misrepresentation of its campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schwartz, who edited the new guide, said Albany's feeling
of vindication might be appropriate: A university with a drinking
problem can promote ``spiritual growth'' if it is trying to
discourage bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges qualifying for both the party and character list
include Michigan State University in East Lansing (for encouraging
community service); Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.
(for its volunteer service requirement for freshmen); the
University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa (for a theater group that
addresses social temptations), and Washington State University at
Pullman (for freshmen seminars urging research of social issues).
</P>
<P>
   Selections were gleaned from 2,000 nominations and made by a
panel of educators in conjunction with the Institute on College
Student Values at Florida State University in Tallahassee. That
would be the Florida State University that was ranked No. 1 party
school this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character is a lifelong process, and college has a unique role
to play,' Schwartz said. ``So many kids were party animals even
before they came to college.''

   Live From College, It's ... a Messy Room
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to modern technology, students can broadcast their very
own ``Real World'' from the privacy of their dorm rooms. All they
need is a Webcam and the sense that the minutiae of their everyday
lives _ He eats! He studies! He sleeps! _ are worth sharing 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought college kids are an interesting
demographic,'' said Alex Chriss, 22, who founded WebDorm last
February (www.webdorm.com) when he was a junior at Tufts University
in Medford, Mass. ``It's the only time of your life you're all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 students from around the country are ``featured Web
dormers'' for one semester. In exchange for software and Webcams,
which beam their images onto the Internet, they must write and post
journals, chat online at least two hours a week, keep cameras
turned on at all times and have a roommate who doesn't mind living
in a fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   The images, which are updated every 25 seconds, are often
blurry. But they are good enough to decipher what the students are
doing. Sex, drugs and nudity are forbidden, but that's a small
price to pay. After all, being a featured dormer is prestigious:
During a flesh-and-blood meeting in Boston, Chriss said, several
Web dormers were walking through Harvard Square when a group of
Harvard and MIT students stopped them and said, ``You're the Web
dormers, I've seen you online!'' Chriss added, ``They were
attaining this celebrity status.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody Ward, 21, a senior at the University of Florida at
Gainesville, was a Web dormer last spring and still keeps a camera
aimed at himself, posting images on his own site
(www.geocities.com/g8rcody/). ``It just seemed like something fun
to do, just for the thrill of letting my friends and family see
me,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's a purely American phenomenon,
but people like spying on other people and seeing what they're up
to. As long as people want to watch, I don't mind broadcasting my
life.'' People evidently watch; Ward meets five to 10 new people
online each day.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life broadcast was popularized, of course, by ``The
Real World,'' the MTV show that offers a peek into the lives of
Generation X roommates. Jennifer Ringley, who perched a Web camera
in her dorm room at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., in 1996,
was a pioneer of the format online; she can still be found going
about her business at www.jennicam.com. Now there are virtual dorm
sites like www.vdorm. com/thedorm/main.asp, a forum for live-action
chats among students.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is life like with a camera trained on every move?
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget the camera is on,'' Ward said. ``I've had it on for
over a year and only occasionally turn it off. It feels weird
turning it off, I'm so used to being watched.''

   BLACKBOARD: TECHNOLOGY: Bedside Classrooms
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough for children to be hospitalized. Falling behind
in school and losing touch with friends only adds to the trauma. To
combat that isolation, hospitals are incorporating technology into
children's wards to help patients stay connected with their lives
back home.
</P>
<P>
   When Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., opens a
children's hospital next year, every child's bedside will be
equipped with a computer that has Internet access. Similar plans
are under way for new children's facilities at the Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., and the Columbia-Presbyterian
Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, children's wards have included classrooms. The
New York City Board of Education runs a program in 40 hospitals for
public and private school students, coordinating lesson plans with
each child's school district. Patients who are well enough attend
morning classes; those who are not ambulatory receive bedside
teaching in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Using computers, students can communicate directly with their
own teachers and tap into hospital databanks to get information
about their illness. And Starbright, a nonprofit computer network
for hospitalized children, puts students in contact with peers who
may be struggling with the same disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child wants to feel like every other child,'' said
Cynthia N. Sparer, the executive director of Babies Hospital at
Columbia-Presbyterian. ``It is particularly important for children
with chronic conditions, like cancer or cystic fibrosis, to keep
up. And that achieves one of our other goals: We do not want them
to focus 100 percent on their medical problems. We want them to
focus on being kids.''

<P>
   For the past 2,000 years, millennial visionaries have
periodically forecast the arrival of ten-horned beasts and lakes of
fire and brimstone. On the eve of this millennium, the
end-of-the-world brigade foresaw doom because some computer
software confused 2000 with 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this vision has melted in the dawn, leaving many people
wondering whether the gurus who prophesied this secular apocalypse
were just as unreliable as the mystical millenarians of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the absence of bug-induced problems has been
remarkable. There were no falling airplanes, no exploding power
stations, no rogue missiles. Those horrors were always the stuff of
myth.
</P>
<P>
   But so sparse were tales of disaster that journalists were
driven to reporting on malfunctions in the breath-testing machines
used on drunken motorists by the Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
   More problems may emerge in the coming weeks. Overall, though,
Y2K has turned out to be Y2OK.
</P>
<P>
   One partial explanation is that the huge effort lavished on
bug-squashing has worked. The United States, according to a
Commerce Department estimate, spent about $100 billion on the
problem; the rest of the world probably spent about the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are far smaller than some of the more exotic
figures trailed a few years ago, but they are still substantial.
Yet even the countries that had begun work late and done little _
southern Europe, Russia, much of Asia _ had a trouble-free new
year.
</P>
<P>
   So was the money wasted? Simply comparing who spent what
provides no answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy reliance on information technology is confined to a
relatively small group of countries, most of which began work early
on solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are more likely to use IT which is relatively
new or off-the-shelf (and so easy to fix): it was software which
had been customized by people who had long since retired, used on
old systems, that gave most problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an unprecedented amount of information on potential
problems and solutions was shared within industries such as
finance, aviation and communications. As a result, countries and
organizations that came late to the problem were able to hitch a
free ride on the experience of those that had begun first.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded systems _ fragments of software burned on to computer
chips _ once seemed likely to cause special chaos, given that
nobody knew how many of them took account of time; that fear had
gone in the countries that were first off the mark before most of
the laggards realized they were supposed to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that late starters did not suffer a computerized
comeuppance does not mean that those who took the bug seriously
were wasting time and money. The wastrels were those who did too
much: who failed to differentiate between the big risks and the
unimportant ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible risk management meant fixing the showstoppers, not
fixing everything. That distinction was frequently lost on
politicians, who wanted to avoid blame for inaction, and ignored by
IT consultants, who found bug-squashing a handy source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the bug, many organizations have thought hard about
their computer systems for the first time. They have cleared out
old code, made inventories and invested in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The work may not justify the cost: some of it might eventually
have been done anyway; and some might be a worse use of scarce
resources than devising new products. But at least there will be
some gain.
</P>
<P>
   A further legacy may be a wiser approach to technological
scares. The bug is merely the most prominent in a succession of
computer frights about viruses and sensitive dates. Such scares
have invariably faded.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the correct approach is to treat them like threats to
public health _ indeed, computer technology is now so ubiquitous
that it is as important as safe drinking water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   People need to take sensible precautions, but not to panic. If
squashing the bug ends the apocalyptic approach to technology, it
will bring a happy start to the new year. &QL;

wondering whether the gurus who prophesied this secular apocalypse
were just as unreliable as the mystical millenarians of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the absence of bug-induced problems has been
remarkable. There were no falling airplanes, no exploding power
stations, no rogue missiles. Those horrors were always the stuff of
myth.
</P>
<P>
   But so sparse were tales of disaster that journalists were
driven to reporting on malfunctions in the breath-testing machines
used on drunken motorists by the Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
   More problems may emerge in the coming weeks. Overall, though,
Y2K has turned out to be Y2OK.
</P>
<P>
   One partial explanation is that the huge effort lavished on
bug-squashing has worked. The United States, according to a
Commerce Department estimate, spent about $100 billion on the
problem; the rest of the world probably spent about the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are far smaller than some of the more exotic
figures trailed a few years ago, but they are still substantial.
Yet even the countries that had begun work late and done little _
southern Europe, Russia, much of Asia _ had a trouble-free new
year.
</P>
<P>
   So was the money wasted? Simply comparing who spent what
provides no answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy reliance on information technology is confined to a
relatively small group of countries, most of which began work early
on solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are more likely to use IT which is relatively
new or off-the-shelf (and so easy to fix): it was software which
had been customized by people who had long since retired, used on
old systems, that gave most problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an unprecedented amount of information on potential
problems and solutions was shared within industries such as
finance, aviation and communications. As a result, countries and
organizations that came late to the problem were able to hitch a
free ride on the experience of those that had begun first.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded systems _ fragments of software burned on to computer
chips _ once seemed likely to cause special chaos, given that
nobody knew how many of them took account of time; that fear had
gone in the countries that were first off the mark before most of
the laggards realized they were supposed to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that late starters did not suffer a computerized
comeuppance does not mean that those who took the bug seriously
were wasting time and money. The wastrels were those who did too
much: who failed to differentiate between the big risks and the
unimportant ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible risk management meant fixing the showstoppers, not
fixing everything. That distinction was frequently lost on
politicians, who wanted to avoid blame for inaction, and ignored by
IT consultants, who found bug-squashing a handy source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the bug, many organizations have thought hard about
their computer systems for the first time. They have cleared out
old code, made inventories and invested in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The work may not justify the cost: some of it might eventually
have been done anyway; and some might be a worse use of scarce
resources than devising new products. But at least there will be
some gain.
</P>
<P>
   A further legacy may be a wiser approach to technological
scares. The bug is merely the most prominent in a succession of
computer frights about viruses and sensitive dates. Such scares
have invariably faded.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the correct approach is to treat them like threats to
public health _ indeed, computer technology is now so ubiquitous
that it is as important as safe drinking water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   People need to take sensible precautions, but not to panic. If
squashing the bug ends the apocalyptic approach to technology, it
will bring a happy start to the new year. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia needs a strong leader, able to get laws passed and
obeyed, and institutions built, rebuilt or cleansed of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, its new president, seems a strong, determined
man, supported since parliamentary elections in December by a
fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing a fine chance of
being elected as president in the popular vote that is now due on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin is just what the Russian doctor ordered? Not so fast.
Before jumping to that conclusion, it is as well to review what is
known about this man and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a secretive, clannish place, Putin's
background is fairly clear but that still does not make him
well-known. The trouble is that the few facts that are available
reveal little about his political inclinations or his ideas about
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became prime minister just over four months ago, and
especially since becoming president last week, he has made sure to
offer reassuring noises to all the appropriate constituencies: to
sound democratic to democrats, reform-minded to reformers, tough to
tough-guys, reasonably western to reasonable westerners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what he says that matters. It is what he does. And
most of the significant things that he has done, both in his short
career as a political leader and in his longer career as a spy,
have been scary.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that longer career that the worries begin. In any
country, it would be hard to imagine the former head of the
domestic counterintelligence service becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush may have been head of America's CIA, but that was a
political appointment and he was not a career spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, you might argue, everyone who is anyone has a dodgy
background of some sort, given seven decades of communism. And in
lawless Russia, to have the trust of the secret police and the army
will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But a more sinister interpretation is just as
plausible. For much of this year, the role and influence of the
secret police and the army have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated by Russia's failed war in Chechnya in 1994-96,
derided around the globe for years as a clapped out bunch of
incompetents, the Russian army has long been looking for a way to
restore its pride and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NATO offensive in Kosovo left Russia looking both
unprepared and fourth-rate, apparently incapable of defending
interests or standing by allies. This was an exaggeration, but one
the security services and the military appear to have exploited to
begin their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the incursion by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Dagestan in the summer came a series of deadly bomb explosions in
Moscow and other Russian cities. This was the beginning, remember,
of Putin's rise to power and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   No clear evidence has yet been found for who was responsible for
those bombs, and no one has claimed responsibility. Chechen rebels,
which include some pretty nasty characters, may well have been the
culprits. But, in the absence of evidence, other candidates should
also be kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the very service that Putin used to head, once
the core of the KGB and now called the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that it laid the bombs, either. Yet given
the huge benefits that he, and the security forces in general, have
gained from those tragedies it would be foolish to rule that
thought out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this possibility needs to be weighed in
any assessment of what a long-term President Putin might be like.
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, the manner of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation was also ominous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that it was long overdue; Yeltsin would have
done his country a service by standing down at least two years ago.
But there is also a lot of doubt over whether he really wanted to
stand down even six months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to protect him and his family from prosecution for
corruption, struck with a powerful prospect in the forthcoming
elections, may be explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look terribly voluntary, and despite gestures of
change in the Kremlin (such as the ostentatious sidelining of
Yeltsin's daughter) the signs are that the same court of business
oligarchs and security toughs will be running things in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was, at least in his last years, their puppet. Which end
of the strings Putin holds remains to be seen. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, better possibilities. Out of the
Putin-strengthening evil of the Chechen war could come
institution-building, rule-of-law-enforcing, enterprise-creating
good.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin may indeed believe, as he says he does, in an
open society, with free speech, democratic liberties and pro-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to crush the Chechen rebels may, in due course, be
tempered by a realpolitik desire to stay on reasonable terms with
the Islamic world. His desire to stand up for Russia against the
West may be tempered by a realpolitik desire to keep open Russia's
access to foreign money and to avoid outright confrontations with
America. &QL;

   All this suggests that outsiders and Russians alike should give
President Putin the benefit of the doubt. They should keep an open
mind, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the sobering truth is that the facts _ such
as they are, given that he is a former spymaster _ lean more
towards doubt than benefit. &QL;

   FLA-DEATH _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Republican lawmakers scrambled
Friday to round up the votes to pass a law that would allow the
state to kill its Death Row inmates quicker, even if it meant
taking a lawmaker away from his sister's funeral. Chartered planes
_ paid for by the state Republican Party _ were dispatched across
the state to bring GOP lawmakers to Tallahassee to vote. One was at
his sister's funeral. Another at the birth of his first child. Two
were ill. Supporters _ who need 2/3 majorities in both chambers to
approve laws that would change court appellate procedures _ say the
average of 14 years of appeals of Death Row inmates is an insult to
their victims and should be shortened to 5. On Thursday, lawmakers
in both chambers overwhelmingly approved

to get a driver's license. He says too many teenagers have been
involved in serious accidents at younger ages, and have proven that
there are problems with maturity and experience. Lt. Gov. Mark
Taylor also is receptive to the idea of increasing the driving age,
and a Cobb Republican has introduced a bill to do just that. If
Barnes weighs in to try to push the legislation through, it could

<P>
   ``The greatest central banker in the history of the world.''
That is Phil Gramm's judgment on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Gramm, a senator from Texas, is chairman of the
committee which will soon confirm Greenspan's reappointment as Fed
chairman for a fourth four-year term, one can assume that he will
not face an unduly rough ride in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's view hardly counts as hyperbole these days. In 1998, the
New Republic ran an article describing how brokers at one New York
investment house had set up a little shrine to Greenspan in their
office; traders were said to pop in there for guidance and
inspiration whenever the action on Wall Street got too frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true that this story was entirely made up and the
author has been sacked. But the striking thing about it was how few
people realized it was fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This week Greenspan's cult status helped him gain the expected
presidential nomination yet again. Imagine any other bureaucrat of
influence being reappointed in the dog days of one presidency for a
term that runs for three-quarters of the next term.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton can act in the full confidence that
everyone with any chance of becoming president is competing to show
how much they love the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain won the contest by saying that if he were president,
and Greenspan died, he would prop him up at his desk, put dark
glasses on him and reappoint the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's cult status does not come out of nowhere. It has
been hard-earned over a dozen years. He has proved adept at dealing
with crises, such as the stock market crash of 1987 and the Asian
meltdown of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   He won his own anti-inflation spurs by hiking interest rates in
1988-89 and again, preemptively, in 1994-95, courting unpopularity
with politicians but reinforcing the Fed's independence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently and controversially, he has reinforced his cult
status by arguing that technological change may be increasing
American productivity, making it possible to run the economy at a
higher rate of growth without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On several earlier occasions, Greenspan's judgment, criticized
at the time, proved sound in retrospect. More than that, as time
has gone on, his personal credibility has contributed to the
orderly calming of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' confidence in him made them willing to take on trust
that 1998's loosening was necessary and sufficient to prevent a
global meltdown, though this was by no means self-evident at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   So the cult has its advantages. But it has three big drawbacks
as well. The first, of course, is that when the object of worship
does make a mistake, the error is magnified hugely. No one knows
whether this is happening now, but the risk is plain.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Greenspan is deemed the patron saint of
America's ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about whether there really is
such an animal (The Economist is at best only a half-believer), and
the hard evidence remains sketchy. But what is certain is that if
there isn't, any future correction will be all the more severe. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 550, OR CONTINUE TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   A comparison with Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in the
1980s is worrying. Like Greenspan, the long-serving Nigel Lawson
was a trained economist held in awe by many in his field and with
strong, even overbearing influence in the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely credited with creating a British ``economic
miracle.'' But this mattered not one jot when his policies came
unstuck in a welter of asset-price inflation and slumping personal
savings. Britain suffered the consequences for years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more immediately, the personalization of monetary
policy creates its own form of moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are so confident of Greenspan's magic touch that they
may well be bidding up equity prices in the belief that he will
bail them out if things start going wrong. Inadvertently,
therefore, there may be a Greenspan bubble in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   It can reasonably be objected that this has more to do with the
sheep-like attitudes of Greenspan's followers as the Delphic
utterances of the Oracle himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he is at least partly at fault for giving the impression
that he will loosen monetary policy whenever Wall Street plummets
(as in 1987 and 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, whether you blame the High Priest or the Temple
prostitutes, the real danger lies in cultism itself.
</P>
<P>
   Third, what happens when the Oracle retires or goes into the
wilderness? If the credibility of your monetary policy is bound up
in one individual, you face an obvious risk when he or she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that risk proved minimal in 1987 when Paul Volcker,
Greenspan's respected predecessor, stepped down. But to expect
lightning to strike twice is to stretch not only the law of
averages but also the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious replacement with even half Greenspan's
status in the markets (unless perhaps Robert Rubin, the former
treasury secretary, were to want the job).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of a successor is contributing both to
Greenspan's influence and to the ease of his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution to the dangers of cultism: embody in
institutional form some of the personal credibility the chairman
himself now has.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many central banks, the Fed's workings are murky.
The minutes of one Fed meeting appear only after the next is over.
The body has relatively wide powers of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds further to Greenspan's status as a market
magician. Giving the Fed clearer goals _ most obviously a formal
inflation target _ and requiring greater transparency about how
these are being achieved would limit his personal influence.
</P>
<P>
   In America now, that would hardly be regarded as a blessing. But
if you look past Greenspan's formidable reputation and ask whether
the United States has the best central bank in the world, as
opposed to the best central banker, the answer must be no. Now is
as good a time as any to do something about that. &QL;

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In 1943, the Soviet army saved the world from Nazism by holding
Stalingrad while the Germans pounded it to rubble. Today, that
army's delinquent stepchild, the Russian army, is fighting a city
battle of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are pounding their own city, Grozny, to rubble and
are murdering Russian civilians in the process. Their conquest of
Grozny, which should conclude by the end of January, will complete
a methodical campaign of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, more than 100,000 Russian troops have inched
through Chechnya, leveling villages with low-precision artillery
and dumb bombs. This ``pacification'' has killed many Chechen
guerrillas and civilians and has turned most of the survivors into
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its indiscriminate use of firepower against civilian
targets, it is as bad as anything since World War II,'' says Lani
Kass, a professor of military strategy at the National War College.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The war against the Chechens, who are despised as
Muslim terrorists in slavic Russia, is wildly popular, proof that
Russian military power is returning. Chechnya is payback for
Afghanistan, for the first humiliating Chechen war of 1994-96, and
for NATO's bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The army's triumph will ensure Vladimir Putin's election as
president in March. It has already restored the military's prestige
and budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion that Chechnya's rape represents a return of
Russian military glory is preposterous. Russia is turtling through
Chechnya partly because it doesn't have enough competent troops to
fight more quickly. Russia can rely on only about 20,000 skilled
soldiers in an army of 700,000. Analysts believe that Russia could
muster ``one or two'' decent army divisions out of a paper strength
of 70 divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military is a lumpen-army, the dregs of dregs.
Conscription remains mandatory, but more than 80 percent of young
Russians avoid it. The enlisted ranks fill with the stupid, the
sick, and the criminal. These soldiers are little better than
cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Russia makes no serious effort to train them, because it doesn't
have qualified noncommissioned officers, and its officers can't
control the conscripts. Hazing is unbelievably brutal: More than
1,000 soldiers are murdered every year by their brothers-in-arms,
and more than 500 kill themselves because of the horrific
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Pay is laughably small and usually in arrears. Russia has
shelved its longstanding plan to switch to a volunteer army because
it can't pay enough to recruit soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CIA, Russia spends only one-sixth as much on
the military as the Soviet Union did during the '80s. Clothing and
rations are scarce: Navy servicemen have starved to death.
Alcoholism is rampant, as soldiers drink everything they can get
their hands on. (In the '80s, the Mig-25 was nicknamed the ``Flying
Restaurant'' because crews would drain and drink its alcohol-based
hydraulic fluid.)
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis flourishes because troops don't know how to dig
latrines. The army is ``a kingdom of darkness,'' says U.S. Army War
College professor Stephen Blank.
</P>
<P>
   Russia can't afford to equip its so-called soldiers. Only a tiny
fraction of Russian materiel is equal to modern Western equipment.
Russia lacks up-to-date communications, computers, and precision
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Much hardware remains from the Soviet buildup, but most of it
doesn't work. Soldiers cannibalize spare parts to keep a few
vehicles working. Pilots lack the fuel and equipment to fly
training missions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian arms plants still produce excellent weapons for export
(anti-ship missiles, for example), but the Russian military can't
afford to buy any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian conventional forces have grown so flaccid that Russia
has altered its nuclear policy. It used to abjure first-use of
nukes. Now first-use is an essential part of military doctrine,
because Russia knows it can't defend itself conventionally. (The
only good news about the military is that it has regained secure
control over its active nuclear weapons--though not over discarded
nuclear material.)
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, which has long featherbedded its budget by
inflating the Moscow threat, has largely stopped pretending that
Russia can endanger U.S. military interests. The Russian army is no
longer the great Russian bear but a ``rather vicious ferret,'' says
Mark Galeotti, a Russian military analyst at Britain's Keele
University.
</P>
<P>
   This military has decayed immeasurably since the glory days of
the Mighty Red Army. The Russian army broke Napoleon. Soviet
troops, in Winston Churchill's words, ``tore the guts'' out of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials certainly exaggerated the competence of the
Soviet military during the Cold War, but it was still a great
force: 6 million men under arms, a 3-to-1 tank advantage, a 2-to-1
aircraft advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army was the only institution that matched the Communist
Party in prestige. The best and brightest joined the officer corps.
There were 15 applicants for every slot at some military schools.
The state pampered officers with special stores, chauffeured cars,
and dachas.
</P>
<P>
   The Czarist and Soviet armies were not artful, but they were
often effective: weak on offense, strong on defense. They performed
poorly in far-flung adventures (the Russo-Japanese War, for
example) but savaged invaders when the Motherland was under attack.
They mastered brute-force warfare, throwing huge numbers of troops,
tanks, and shells at the enemy. The USSR won World War II by losing
8 million soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghanistan invasion vanquished the myth of Soviet military
invincibility and aroused the popular mistrust of the army that
persists today.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the USSR shattered the army into 15 pieces, as
Russia lost nukes, ships, bases and many of its best officers to
newly independent republics. In the post-Soviet chaos, youngsters
found more ways to duck conscription, and the quality of the
average soldier plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin, who didn't trust the army, further damaged it by
elevating the interior ministry--with its hundreds of thousands of
soldiers--as a separate, independent foundation of military power.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chechen war dealt the final disgrace. The hardened
rebels slaughtered Russia's ill-prepared men, ambushing them by the
hundreds in Grozny. Russian mothers traveled to Chechnya, pulled
their sons off the front lines, and brought them home.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's generals and politicians essentially ginned up the new
Chechen war as a confidence builder. Russia has reason to invade
Chechnya: The rebellious province has been agitating to form a
separate, antagonistic Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia was itching for an excuse to attack. When Chechens
raided the Russian territory of Dagestan, and bombs wrecked Moscow
apartment buildings, the army seized the opportunity. (Many suspect
that the bombings were staged to marshal support for war.)
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a win-at-all-costs war to restore military
prestige, Russian generals have shown utter indifference to
civilian casualties and a willingness to lie to retain popular
support. (Russia, for example, consistently undercounts its war
dead.)
</P>
<P>
   The West tolerates Russia's atrocities because it has no choice
and because it is better for Russia to take out its aggression on
its own citizens than to go adventuring abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman's march through Chechnya is not just boosting
Russian military pride. It is also increasing the military's
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has long been politically quiescent because
a tradition of professionalism pervades the officer corps. But the
general staff insisted that Putin grant them total freedom to
prosecute the war. Putin, who wants a victory to boost his own
prospects, granted it, essentially castrating the civilian defense
ministry and subordinating the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts now fear that the generals are using Chechnya
to reassert control over national security and foreign policy.
Their militarism and nationalism bode ill for future relations
between Russia and the West. The general staff, for instance, has
essentially forbidden Russia from talking to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   As for the victory in Chechnya, it's a mirage. For Russia's
generals and politicians, victory simply means flying the Russian
flag in downtown Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   But Chechens are fighting a guerrilla war. Russian soldiers will
shell Grozny to its foundations and fly their flags, but they won't
engage in street-to-street fighting: It's too bloody. So the rebels
can melt away and join their comrades in Chechnya's southern
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya has been fighting Moscow for 217 years and hasn't
surrendered yet. It won't stop now. When the Russian army continues
south, it will find itself in another mountain war--a
mini-Afghanistan, this time against a tougher and better-organized
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens will gradually bleed the Russian garrison--one car
bomb, one mine, one mortar at a time--until the Russians withdraw
in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Putin and his generals will get their victory --a
Potemkin triumph for a Potemkin army.

   Russia can't afford to equip its so-called soldiers. Only a tiny
fraction of Russian materiel is equal to modern Western equipment.
Russia lacks up-to-date communications, computers, and precision
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Much hardware remains from the Soviet buildup, but most of it
doesn't work. Soldiers cannibalize spare parts to keep a few
vehicles working. Pilots lack the fuel and equipment to fly
training missions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian arms plants still produce excellent weapons for export
(anti-ship missiles, for example), but the Russian military can't
afford to buy any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian conventional forces have grown so flaccid that Russia
has altered its nuclear policy. It used to abjure first-use of
nukes. Now first-use is an essential part of military doctrine,
because Russia knows it can't defend itself conventionally. (The
only good news about the military is that it has regained secure
control over its active nuclear weapons--though not over discarded
nuclear material.)
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, which has long featherbedded its budget by
inflating the Moscow threat, has largely stopped pretending that
Russia can endanger U.S. military interests. The Russian army is no
longer the great Russian bear but a ``rather vicious ferret,'' says
Mark Galeotti, a Russian military analyst at Britain's Keele
University.
</P>
<P>
   This military has decayed immeasurably since the glory days of
the Mighty Red Army. The Russian army broke Napoleon. Soviet
troops, in Winston Churchill's words, ``tore the guts'' out of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials certainly exaggerated the competence of the
Soviet military during the Cold War, but it was still a great
force: 6 million men under arms, a 3-to-1 tank advantage, a 2-to-1
aircraft advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army was the only institution that matched the Communist
Party in prestige. The best and brightest joined the officer corps.
There were 15 applicants for every slot at some military schools.
The state pampered officers with special stores, chauffeured cars,
and dachas.
</P>
<P>
   The Czarist and Soviet armies were not artful, but they were
often effective: weak on offense, strong on defense. They performed
poorly in far-flung adventures (the Russo-Japanese War, for
example) but savaged invaders when the Motherland was under attack.
They mastered brute-force warfare, throwing huge numbers of troops,
tanks, and shells at the enemy. The USSR won World War II by losing
8 million soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghanistan invasion vanquished the myth of Soviet military
invincibility and aroused the popular mistrust of the army that
persists today.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the USSR shattered the army into 15 pieces, as
Russia lost nukes, ships, bases and many of its best officers to
newly independent republics. In the post-Soviet chaos, youngsters
found more ways to duck conscription, and the quality of the
average soldier plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin, who didn't trust the army, further damaged it by
elevating the interior ministry--with its hundreds of thousands of
soldiers--as a separate, independent foundation of military power.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chechen war dealt the final disgrace. The hardened
rebels slaughtered Russia's ill-prepared men, ambushing them by the
hundreds in Grozny. Russian mothers traveled to Chechnya, pulled
their sons off the front lines, and brought them home.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's generals and politicians essentially ginned up the new
Chechen war as a confidence builder. Russia has reason to invade
Chechnya: The rebellious province has been agitating to form a
separate, antagonistic Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia was itching for an excuse to attack. When Chechens
raided the Russian territory of Dagestan, and bombs wrecked Moscow
apartment buildings, the army seized the opportunity. (Many suspect
that the bombings were staged to marshal support for war.)
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a win-at-all-costs war to restore military
prestige, Russian generals have shown utter indifference to
civilian casualties and a willingness to lie to retain popular
support. (Russia, for example, consistently undercounts its war
dead.)
</P>
<P>
   The West tolerates Russia's atrocities because it has no choice
and because it is better for Russia to take out its aggression on
its own citizens than to go adventuring abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman's march through Chechnya is not just boosting
Russian military pride. It is also increasing the military's
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has long been politically quiescent because
a tradition of professionalism pervades the officer corps. But the
general staff insisted that Putin grant them total freedom to
prosecute the war. Putin, who wants a victory to boost his own
prospects, granted it, essentially castrating the civilian defense
ministry and subordinating the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts now fear that the generals are using Chechnya
to reassert control over national security and foreign policy.
Their militarism and nationalism bode ill for future relations
between Russia and the West. The general staff, for instance, has
essentially forbidden Russia from talking to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   As for the victory in Chechnya, it's a mirage. For Russia's
generals and politicians, victory simply means flying the Russian
flag in downtown Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   But Chechens are fighting a guerrilla war. Russian soldiers will
shell Grozny to its foundations and fly their flags, but they won't
engage in street-to-street fighting: It's too bloody. So the rebels
can melt away and join their comrades in Chechnya's southern
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya has been fighting Moscow for 217 years and hasn't
surrendered yet. It won't stop now. When the Russian army continues
south, it will find itself in another mountain war--a
mini-Afghanistan, this time against a tougher and better-organized
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens will gradually bleed the Russian garrison--one car
bomb, one mine, one mortar at a time--until the Russians withdraw
in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Putin and his generals will get their victory --a
Potemkin triumph for a Potemkin army.

   ``The greatest central banker in the history of the world.''
That is Phil Gramm's judgment on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Gramm, a senator from Texas, is chairman of the
committee which will soon confirm Greenspan's reappointment as Fed
chairman for a fourth four-year term, one can assume that he will
not face an unduly rough ride in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's view hardly counts as hyperbole these days. In 1998, the
New Republic ran an article describing how brokers at one New York
investment house had set up a little shrine to Greenspan in their
office; traders were said to pop in there for guidance and
inspiration whenever the action on Wall Street got too frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true that this story was entirely made up and the
author has been sacked. But the striking thing about it was how few
people realized it was fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This week Greenspan's cult status helped him gain the expected
presidential nomination yet again. Imagine any other bureaucrat of
influence being reappointed in the dog days of one presidency for a
term that runs for three-quarters of the next term.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Clinton can act in the full confidence that
everyone with any chance of becoming president is competing to show
how much they love the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain won the contest by saying that if he were president,
and Greenspan died, he would prop him up at his desk, put dark
glasses on him and reappoint the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's cult status does not come out of nowhere. It has
been hard-earned over a dozen years. He has proved adept at dealing
with crises, such as the stock market crash of 1987 and the Asian
meltdown of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   He won his own anti-inflation spurs by hiking interest rates in
1988-89 and again, preemptively, in 1994-95, courting unpopularity
with politicians but reinforcing the Fed's independence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently and controversially, he has reinforced his cult
status by arguing that technological change may be increasing
American productivity, making it possible to run the economy at a
higher rate of growth without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On several earlier occasions, Greenspan's judgment, criticized
at the time, proved sound in retrospect. More than that, as time
has gone on, his personal credibility has contributed to the
orderly calming of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' confidence in him made them willing to take on trust
that 1998's loosening was necessary and sufficient to prevent a
global meltdown, though this was by no means self-evident at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   So the cult has its advantages. But it has three big drawbacks
as well. The first, of course, is that when the object of worship
does make a mistake, the error is magnified hugely. No one knows
whether this is happening now, but the risk is plain.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Greenspan is deemed the patron saint of
America's ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about whether there really is
such an animal (The Economist is at best only a half-believer), and
the hard evidence remains sketchy. But what is certain is that if
there isn't, any future correction will be all the more severe. &QL;

<P>
   A comparison with Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in the
1980s is worrying. Like Greenspan, the long-serving Nigel Lawson
was a trained economist held in awe by many in his field and with
strong, even overbearing influence in the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely credited with creating a British ``economic
miracle.'' But this mattered not one jot when his policies came
unstuck in a welter of asset-price inflation and slumping personal
savings. Britain suffered the consequences for years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more immediately, the personalization of monetary
policy creates its own form of moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are so confident of Greenspan's magic touch that they
may well be bidding up equity prices in the belief that he will
bail them out if things start going wrong. Inadvertently,
therefore, there may be a Greenspan bubble in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   It can reasonably be objected that this has more to do with the
sheep-like attitudes of Greenspan's followers as the Delphic
utterances of the Oracle himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he is at least partly at fault for giving the impression
that he will loosen monetary policy whenever Wall Street plummets
(as in 1987 and 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, whether you blame the High Priest or the Temple
prostitutes, the real danger lies in cultism itself.
</P>
<P>
   Third, what happens when the Oracle retires or goes into the
wilderness? If the credibility of your monetary policy is bound up
in one individual, you face an obvious risk when he or she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that risk proved minimal in 1987 when Paul Volcker,
Greenspan's respected predecessor, stepped down. But to expect
lightning to strike twice is to stretch not only the law of
averages but also the current evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious replacement with even half Greenspan's
status in the markets (unless perhaps Robert Rubin, the former
treasury secretary, were to want the job).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of a successor is contributing both to
Greenspan's influence and to the ease of his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution to the dangers of cultism: embody in
institutional form some of the personal credibility the chairman
himself now has.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many central banks, the Fed's workings are murky.
The minutes of one Fed meeting appear only after the next is over.
The body has relatively wide powers of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds further to Greenspan's status as a market
magician. Giving the Fed clearer goals _ most obviously a formal
inflation target _ and requiring greater transparency about how
these are being achieved would limit his personal influence.
</P>
<P>
   In America now, that would hardly be regarded as a blessing. But
if you look past Greenspan's formidable reputation and ask whether
the United States has the best central bank in the world, as
opposed to the best central banker, the answer must be no. Now is
as good a time as any to do something about that. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, Russian President Boris Yeltsin abruptly
resigned, leaving Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as the country's
acting president. Everyone expects Putin to win the presidency
outright in the upcoming elections. But what kind of man is Putin?
</P>
<P>
   His detractors say he's a KGB spy, a believer in centralized
power, and a ruthless prosecutor of the war in Chechnya. And what
do his defenders say? That each of these vices is really a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   --HE'S A SPY. Critics point to Putin's 15 years in the KGB,
calling him a ``KGB spy,'' ``KGB agent,'' and ``KGB colonel.'' One
antagonist says Putin was dubbed ``Stasi'' (the name of the former
East German secret service) for wielding behind-the-scenes power.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors use these terms to portray Putin as a Cold Warrior
who can't be trusted with Russia's nukes. On television last
weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger lent credence to this theory by
arguing that Putin has ``two strands'': on one side, his KGB years,
and on the other, his years as a ``democratic reformer'' in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's allies reject the two-strands theory. They argue that
his KGB experience actually reinforced his interest in economic
liberalization. As Putin's spokesman explained on ``Meet the
Press,'' ``Mr. Putin worked in the West. That's a very positive
point. The people in the KGB, in some way, prepared perestroika
because they were very open and they knew the exact situation in
the economy, inside Russia, and what was happening outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's former mentor in St. Petersburg, ex-Mayor Anatoly
Sobchak, told The New York Times, ``He is a convinced supporter of
the market economy. He knows the western model of economic and
political life not as an outsider but from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   This counterspin is already making headway. Putin returned from
his KGB service ``steeped in Western business knowledge,'' says the
Times. On ``This Week,'' Times Washington bureau chief Michael
Oreskes noted that according to Putin's colleagues, ``In his years
as a KGB agent in Europe, he learned a lot about Western business
practices, and that may be exactly what he needs to understand to
solve'' Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S A SOCIALIST. American skeptics worry that Putin might wield
too much state power over the economy and society, thereby
undermining both capitalism and democracy. Putin, however, sees the
state as the protector of honest capitalism and true democracy.
``Any attempt to exceed the limits of the law and Russia's
Constitution will be decisively crushed,'' he warned in his New
Year's Eve message. ``Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience,
freedom of the press, the right to private property--all these
basic principles of a civilized society will be reliably protected
by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's Russian allies, and even his enemies, agree that the
chief threat to freedom in Russia today is too little power in the
central government, not too much. But how can they make this case
to the world's most powerful lender, the United States, in terms we
can understand? By comparing Putin to former American presidents.
``Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russia what the
Roosevelts are for America,'' Sobchak told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Times buys this analysis: ``Theodore Roosevelt took on
entrenched monopolies, helping small businesses to thrive and
competition to flourish. Franklin Roosevelt reworked the federal
government to aid the poor, improve education and create a less
crash-prone financial system.'' Both men ``amassedstate power over
the government and economy to shape the capitalistic system that
exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'S A STRONGMAN. Critics call Putin ``cruel,'' a ``dictator,''
and a ``Russian Pinochet'' who might suspend civil liberties to
whip Russia into shape. They're particularly outraged by ``Putin's
War'' in Chechnya. George W. Bush says he's ``troubled'' that Putin
owes his popularity to the Chechen war. Bill Bradley and John
McCain demand economic sanctions against Russia for its ``brutal''
assaults on Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert said Putin had called the
Chechen rebels ``dark-skinned people who must be annihilated'' and
had warned that ``they will be found in latrines and killed.''
Furthermore, Russert noted, ``His first official visit was to
Chechnya giving hunting knives to the Russian military.''
</P>
<P>
   To make nice with Putin, U.S. officials have begun to rephrase
complaints about the war. When asked about Russian ``atrocities,''
they express regret about Russia's ``actions.'' But they also frame
the war as an unfortunate expression of a trait that could serve
Putin well in other pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Putin's vow to ``annihilate'' the Chechens,
Albright called Putin ``very determined'' and ``action-oriented.''
The media, too, have begun to use positive adjectives to describe
Putin's conduct of the war: ``aggressive,'' ``tough-minded,''
``determined,'' ``decisive,'' ``uncompromising,'' ``no-nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   How, according to Putin's supporters, will these traits make him
a good leader?
</P>
<P>
   First, he can halt Russia's slide into chaos. Putin frames the
Chechen war as a struggle to rein in ``terrorism'' and ``the
breakup of Russia,'' a rationale for which Berger and Albright
express sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he can confront cronyism. Critics portray Putin as
Yeltsin's pawn, installed by Yeltsin's daughter and other cronies
to safeguard their financial interests and shield them from
prosecution for corruption. By underscoring his image as a fearless
strongman, Putin defies this critique.
</P>
<P>
   He began by ``firing'' Yeltsin's daughter, eliciting oohs and
aahs from the world press, even though everyone expects her to stay
on as an informal adviser. In view of Russia's endemic corruption,
American pundits are reconsidering whether a strongman president is
such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have the power and the will to take on the robber
barons?'' asked George Stephanopoulos on This Week. ``Will he tax
them? Will he crack down on them? Will he clean them up?''
</P>
<P>
   Third, a ruthlessly efficient leader can win a ruthlessly
efficient election and craft a ruthlessly efficient economy.
Arguing for a quick end to the Chechen war, both Albright and
Berger appeal not to Putin's mercy but to his political interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He now faces an election in three months,'' says Berger. ``If
the costs become too high for the Russians this could become an
albatross around his neck in March.'' Never mind morality. When
asked whether the United States should oppose loans to Russia
because of the war, Berger replies, ``It's a premature question
because the predicate question is whether they get the economic
reforms in order,'' at which point ``we'll have to look at what's
in our national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is an argument Americans can understand: We should judge
Russia's president the same way we judge ours. ``The test for
Putin,'' says Berger, ``is the economy, stupid.''

JOB GROWTH CONTINUED AT A ROBUST PACE IN DECEMBER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers added jobs at a surprisingly robust rate
in December, propelling the economy into the new year with
considerable momentum, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The economy created 315,000 new jobs last month, 75,000 more
than economists had predicted and the biggest one-month gain since
July. With more people entering the job market, the unemployment
rate remained at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, where it has been
for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.4 percent,
slightly higher than expected. But because workers are producing
more for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far shows few
signs of setting off a surge in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While good news across the board, the figures substantially
increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will act to keep
the economy from overheating by raising interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investors acknowledged that a rate increase is
now all but certain, but concluded that inflationary pressures are
so muted that the Fed would limit the increase to a quarter of a
percentage point rather than the half point increase that the
markets had come to fear in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Both blue chip and technology stocks rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough strength in this report to make it a virtual
certainty the Fed will tighten in February,'' said Stuart G.
Hoffman, an economist at PNC Corp. in Pittsburgh. ``But I think a
quarter of a point is all that's likely to come from the Fed, and
appropriately so because this report is not so exceedingly strong
as to force the Fed into a more aggressive increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The report left little doubt that the economy would continue
growing for another month, all but assuring that the current
business expansion will become the nation's longest in February at
8 years and 11 months, breaking a record set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the report was further
evidence that their policy of fiscal prudence was helping to create
jobs across the income spectrum. And with the presidential race
heating up, the figures gave Vice President Al Gore a boost in his
effort to cast himself as the best candidate to keep the economy on
a roll.

<P>
   SAN JOSE _ In November, when Intel named a new boss for its
Costa Rica operation, President Miguel Angel Rodriguez joked that
the new manager's job was more important than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was right. Since Intel, an American semiconductor
maker, opened a factory outside the capital, San Jose, in March
1998, Costa Rica's economy has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   So the statistics suggest, at least. After stagnating in the
mid-1990s, the economy has surged: officials estimate that GDP grew
by almost 8 percent in 1999, and that the increase in chip exports
(to $2 billion) gave Costa Rica a trade surplus for the first time
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But these dizzy figures mask a more complex story.
</P>
<P>
   While last year, the value of the Intel factory's production
almost tripled, the rest of the economy grew more modestly, by
around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a second bright spot: Costa Rica's beaches, rain
forests, and volcanoes attracted more than 1 million foreign
visitors to the country in 1999. But farming, traditionally the
mainstay of the economy, is suffering from low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some Costa Ricans worry that their country now has a ``dual
economy,'' and is swapping one form of economic dependency for
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago we depended on coffee and bananas; today we
depend on Intel,'' the central bank president, Eduardo do Lizano,
complained recently.
</P>
<P>
   One statistical effect of that dependency is that once the Intel
plant reaches full capacity by the middle of this year, the
economy's rate of growth will plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that national income (as opposed to GDP) grew by
only 2 percent last year, because of the outflow of profits.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to keep growth going by seeking more
foreign investment. Manufacturers who export their output get an
eight-year tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Other Central American countries offer more generous incentives,
but Costa Rica has other advantages, rare in the region. These
include a democratic tradition, respect for the rule of law, and a
well-educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors led Intel to choose Costa Rica for its only factory
in Latin America. Rodriguez's people are now concentrating on
improving Costa Rica's infrastructure. The main airport is being
expanded, and there is much road-building.
</P>
<P>
   Despite resistance from traditionalists, they are also pushing
ahead with plans to allow private investment in ICE, the
state-owned electricity and telecommunications monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts seem to be paying off. Other foreign investors
have followed Intel. Even if growth now slackens a bit, Costa Rica
has started to make the transition from banana republic to
high-tech manufacturing center. &QL;

&HT;     POLICE PREPARE FOR SECURITY AT TRIAL OF NEW YORK OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MELISSA GRACE  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Authorities here said they would ban the use of
bullhorns by the thousands of demonstrators expected to come to
protest during the trial of four white New York City police
officers accused of murdering a West African immigrant in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The police are revealing few details about the security plans,
except to say they expect up to 1,000 protesters a day.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Police Chief John C. Nielsen said any demonstrators would
likely be confined to a park across from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   And if supporters of Amadou Diallo, the 22-year-old victim, or
the officers accused in the racially charged shooting travel from
New York City to demonstrate, local officials will have to guard
against potential clashes between the two groups in the park,
Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said bullhorns will be banned to keep the noise down and
that if any are used they will be confiscated. He said that
crowd-control measures, including mounted police officers and a
barricade around the perimeter of the courthouse, would be in place
when the trial opens Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the Bronx officers was moved to Albany last month
after an appeals court ruled that blanket media coverage of the
case had poisoned the New York City jury pool.
</P>
<P>
   The case sparked weeks of demonstrations in New York City, where
more than 1,500 people were arrested in protests in the weeks after
Diallo was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief said that he was in contact with the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the Harlem-based civil rights leader, about the number of
demonstrators he intended to organize. Nielsen declined to give
specifics about the potential number of protesters aside from
saying that up to 1,000 a day could travel to Albany. Sharpton did
not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sharpton supporters, the police say officers from
the New York City force might come to show solidarity for the
accused men _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who are white, are accused of gunning down Diallo,
22, outside his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999, at about 12:40 a.m.
Diallo, who was black, was unarmed at the time and was struck by 19
of 41 shots fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   Security is an issue both inside and outside the Albany County
courthouse where the trial will be held. But with large protests
over the course of weeks, security is likely to be heightened at
nearby facilities as well, including the state Court of Appeals
building. Beyond the courts is City Hall, and a short distance
beyond it are the state Capitol building and the Empire State
Plaza, where thousands of workers migrate daily.

TRUST (Phoenix) - More than a tenth of the land in Arizona is
dedicated to making money for schools. But for years, no one paid
much attention to those 8.1 million acres because they didn't bring
in much cash. Now, though, that state trust land is the center of a
hot debate. Some educators want the earnings from trust land to do
more for Arizona's schoolkids. On the other hand, some
enviornmentalists want to preserve some trust land from development
and argue that it would have little financial impact on education.

MENDOZA (Phoenix) - David Mendoza, the youngest heart transplant in
Arizona and the first to have two transplants (he eventually had a
third), died last night. A look at David and the history of
Arizona's transplants. By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PIMENTEL-COLUMN (Phoenix) - My mother smoked, and she paid the
price for it. Watching her die was painful. Yes, I know about
personal responsibility, but smokers have such vile accomplices.
Tobacco companies know about finding the weak ones as well. That is
why the young, whose chink is believing they are invulnerable, have
been favorite targets. We've now concluded that tobacco companies
should also be punished, though, because it's now personal with me,
this seems way late and way too little. Helping tobacco's victims
and dissuading future ones seem particularly appropriate uses for
this money. By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL. Column will move in the ``K''
category. &QL;

   DETROIT _ The Chevrolet Traverse may look like a sport-utility
vehicle, but to Joel Piaskowski, a designer, it is ``Chevy's
reinvention of the traditional family sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Half car, half truck, the Traverse is one of nine ``concept''
vehicles that General Motors will roll into Detroit's auto show in
a few days' time.
</P>
<P>
   The new vehicles are designed to support the pledge made by Ron
Zarrella, the president of GM's North American operations, that
fully half of its forthcoming products will break new ground in
design, engineering or creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The car maker urgently needs something special. As well as using
fancy designs, GM is trying to tempt buyers with the promise, on
Jan. 4, of a ``loyalty'' voucher, which will give anyone who is
interested $500 off the price of a new car.
</P>
<P>
   In November its share of the American car market slipped to 27.2
percent, the lowest since the Depression, excluding years of
strikes or wars, before climbing sharply in December, to 30.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For much of 1999, GM blamed the decline on demand that
outstripped its production capacity. But in recent months, GM has
caught up with demand _ and discovered that many consumers don't
want its products.
</P>
<P>
   GM assured the world that it would thrive once 1998's strike was
out of the way. ``We have absolutely not delivered on our
commitment,'' lamented Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After battling cancer for much of the past year, Pearce is
suddenly appearing all over town, insisting that top managers must
be held ``accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time this idea has popped up at GM. But
despite the company's problems, few executives have fallen on their
swords since the boardroom coup of 1992. If rumors swirling around
Detroit are true, however, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   GM's chairman, Jack Smith, offers less-than-heartfelt denials of
an impending shake-up _ though he dismisses talk of a hostile
takeover as ``beyond anything imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains popular with the GM board, and he has honored at
least one promise: to coax the North American car operations back
into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street thinks GM should earn $8.49 a share in 1999, up from
$5.30 in 1998. But profits seem certain to dip in 2000, especially
if, as expected, GM chooses to fight for market share with costly
incentives for car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Smith say he is hinting that it may be time to
retire. Pearce is seen as the front-runner to succeed him, though
GM may yet reach outside.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the next chairman will have to stir things up. That
may explain why the publicity-shy Zarrella has seemed so edgy in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the North American operations and the man who brought
the marketing skills of the packaged-goods business to cars, he is
in the firing line should GM's American market share slip further.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Zarrella's mentor and protector on GM's board, John
Smale, a former chairman of Procter &AMP; Gamble, will be retiring next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Much as executives are trying to stay cheerful (``I'd caution
you all not to panic,'' urges Richard Wagoner, GM's president), it
is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a cool head.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, GM no longer sets a market-share target. But it was
no secret that executives wanted the company's market share to
recover briskly after the strike. It hasn't; and if demand grows
more slowly in the current year, as many expect, even incentives to
customers may fail to restore GM's position in the market.
</P>
<P>
   That is why GM will be hawking the Traverse, along with other
``innovative'' vehicles going into production next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bluster about brand management, GM is discovering a
simple truth: nobody will buy your cars unless they like them.
Unless GM's new products hit the mark, the car maker's market share
will continue to shrink, whether it likes it or not. &QL;

<P>
   Everyone accepts that a mother-to-be is at the mercy of her
raging hormones. She is, after all, hosting someone else inside her
body, and that body is bound to react to the metabolic needs of its
lodger.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that expectant fathers, too, may suffer symptoms
such as anxiety, fatigue and a ravenous appetite during pregnancies
for which they are responsible is less familiar _ which is curious,
since three-quarters of fathers do, indeed, experience such
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, no one had bothered to look at what happens to
the hormones of expectant men.
</P>
<P>
   But, after studying the literature on expectant males of other
species, Anne Storey, a psychologist at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland, in St. Johns, Canada, decided it was time to look
into the matter in people, too. Her results are about to be
published in ``Evolution and Human Behaviour.''
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal changes in a pregnant woman are not concerned
solely with the fetus's immediate well-being. They are also a way
of preparing her for her forthcoming role as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   In most animal species, however, the role of the father is
limited to insemination, so no hormonal change connected with
incipient fatherhood would be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. Over 90 percent of bird species, for
example, are ``biparental.'' This means that their couplings are
largely monogamous (with a little adultery on the side) and that
both parents help to look after the brood.
</P>
<P>
   And male birds which assist in child-rearing do, indeed, tend to
go through big hormonal changes before their young emerge _ as do
males of the much smaller proportion (fewer than 10 percent) of
mammal species that are biparental.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman is pregnant, the levels of several of her hormones
will rise. These hormones include cortisol (which is related to
stress), estradiol (the main female sex hormone) and prolactin
(which, as its name suggests, triggers her breast tissue to develop
the ability to secrete milk).
</P>
<P>
   Levels of all these hormones are also known to be correlated, in
the females of at least some species, with the quality of
subsequent maternal behaviors such as bonding to newly born
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's first task was to see what hormonal trends occurred
in men. To do so, she recruited 34 couples from an assortment of
prenatal classes and sampled their blood.
</P>
<P>
   The men in these couples, she discovered, exhibited significant
changes in their levels of cortisol, testosterone (the principal
male sex hormone, and thus in some sense the masculine equivalent
of estradiol) and prolactin over the courses of their partners'
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case the level of the hormone in question changed in a
way that matched the pattern that is seen in pregnant women _ which
is, presumably, why men experience many of the same pre-birth
symptoms as women do.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's hypothesis, which is supported by evidence from
other biparental species, is that these increased hormone levels
predispose a man to behave in a fatherly way when his child is
born.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to following long-term changes, Dr. Storey was also
interested in the expectant fathers' short-term responses to things
infantile.
</P>
<P>
   To test these, she and her colleagues took blood samples before
and after a half-hour procedure that involved both members of a
couple watching a video of a breast-feeding mother, listening to a
recording of a distressed newborn, and holding a doll which was
draped in a blanket that had recently been worn by a real newborn
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The parents-to-be were thus exposed to visual, auditory, tactile
and (from the blanket) olfactory stimuli associated with having a
baby around.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, like mothers, fathers show a
significant drop in cortisol levels during this procedure. The
closer a man's partner was to giving birth, the steeper the
hormonal plunge he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men who held the doll throughout the entire
30-minute experimental period showed bigger declines in
testosterone than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that fathers-to-be are undergoing almost
as much of a change of life _ probably as a result of behavioral
and chemical signals from the mother _ as that mother is herself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this extends as far as switching off the
``going-off-for-a-drink-with-mates'' circuits in a man's brain, and
activating the ``cleaning-dirty-bottoms'' circuits, is, however,
something that many women might beg leave to doubt. &QL;

AUTHOR PATRICK O'BRIAN: CREATED A LITERARY IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In keeping with the mysteries of his life, there was doubt
exactly when Patrick O'Brian, the hugely popular author of the
Aubrey-Maturin historical novels, died in Dublin: either Tuesday or
Sunday. What was known Friday is that he was 85 and that the
recently published ``Blue at the Mizzen,'' No. 20 in the series, is
indeed the last.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other contemporary novelist, Patrick O'Brian
created his own literary identity. More than a pen name, it was a
formal persona both droll and dignified that was at one with the
18th-century world he wrote about. Beginning with ``Master and
Commander,'' the Aubrey-Maturin saga followed the adventures of
Jack Aubrey, the dashing Royal Navy captain, and his physician
friend, Stephen Maturin, through the Napoleonic wars and manifold
related maritime-political affairs of the period.
</P>
<P>
   While thick with enough derring-do and battle scenery to absorb
any schoolboy, the books are distinctive for their elegant syle and
their command of naval practice and technology, medicine, science,
politics, music, philosophy, natural history, and especially
manners. Jack and Stephen, sharply contrasting characters, are
close friends who call one another ``My dear,'' and their
characters are governed by a refined code of propriety amid shot
and shell and bodies falling left and right. Though the action
takes place in the early 19th century, the sensibility is
late-18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a good guide to the 18th century,'' said Katherine
A. Powers of Cambridge, Mass., an O'Brian aficionado who writes for
the Sunday Globe book pages. ``He almost seemed to have journeyed
into the 18th from the 20th and come back to us. He had adopted
this literary persona, so much so that it was him. He became an
18th-century man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. O'Brian had written several all-but-unnoticed novels in the
1950s and 1960s, including ``The Golden Ocean'' (1956), a
historical novel. In the late 1960s his American publisher,
Lippincott, suggested he write a series of the same type. The
result was the first Aubrey-Maturin novel, ``Master and Commander''
(1969). It sank in the United States but sold well in England, and
that was the pattern for the four that followed. Lippincott gave up
after ``Desolation Island'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Starling Lawrence, an editor at W. W. Norton, was urged
by a cousin to read a book by this by-now-unknown Anglo-Irish
novelist. Lawrence was electrified and prevailed on a reluctant
Norton to publish ``The Letter of Marque,'' No. 12 in the series,
in 1990. After a rave review in The New York Times boosted sales,
Norton republished the earlier installments and has issued every
one since.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 2 million O'Brian novels in print. For
the faithful, there is also ``The Patrick O'Brian Newsletter,'' a
cookbook (``Lobscouse &AMP; Spotted Dog''), a CD (``Musical Evenings
with the Captain: Music from the Aubrey-Maturin Novels of Patrick
O'Brian''), all found at a popular Web site, ``The Patrick O'Brian
Page'' (at www.wwnorton.com).
</P>
<P>
   Mr. O'Brian's reticence was legendary. Before an interview
during his 1993 American tour, Lawrence firmly warned a Boston
Globe writer not to ask personal questions; when a previous
interviewer had asked, ``Mr. O'Brian, where were you born?'' the
author had angrily ended the interview and fumed later, ``Can you
imagine the impertinence of such a question?'' &UR;  &LR; It was eccentric
but consistent with the manners of his literary world: In one of
the novels, Maturin observes, ``Question and answer is not a
civilized form of conversation.'' Yet he talked wittily and volubly
about literature: His models were Jane Austen, Dr. Johnson, William
Cobbett, and George Borrow.
</P>
<P>
   It was long believed that Mr. O'Brian was born in Ireland in
1914, lived as a small child in Galway, and later with family
friends in England. Because of illness he never went to university,
and he drove an ambulance during the London Blitz, and served in an
intelligence unit in World War II. He spoke or read French,
Spanish, Catalan, Italian, and Irish. He and his wife moved to the
village of Collioure in the south of France in the 1950s, where he
lived for the rest of his life. Besides his fiction, he wrote
biographies of Picasso and the naturalist Joseph Banks, and
translated into English works by Colette and Simone de Beauvoir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, American journalist Dean King dug into the
O'Brian story and discovered that Mr. O'Brian's real name was
Richard Patrick Russ and that he was born in England. After an
early marriage that produced two children, one of whom still lives,
he changed his name and assumed the Anglo-Irish identity.
</P>
<P>
   Although King praises the novels, his book, ``Patrick O'Brian: A
Life Revealed,'' to be published in April, is censorious, as if Mr.
O'Brian were a fraud for changing his name and a beast for his
apparent estrangement from his siblings and son. Of course his
minor mythmaking annoyed some journalists. It's as if, Lawrence
said in an interview Friday, Mr. O'Brian's change of name ``is
evidence of moral turpitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But the publishing facts are not in doubt. That a formal elderly
writer with an 18th-century style could become a sensation in the
age of ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' demonstrated that there were still
unmet desires in the reading public. In Mr. O'Brian's fiction,
Lawrence said, ``the social and personal relationships restore
something that no longer exists'' in most contemporary literature:
``honor, trust, loyalty, fidelity, open exchange of ideas among
intimate friends, always within the structure of a social contract
that dictates when you should be silent and what subjects shouldn't
come up.''

<P>
   Everyone accepts that a mother-to-be is at the mercy of her
raging hormones. She is, after all, hosting someone else inside her
body, and that body is bound to react to the metabolic needs of its
lodger.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that expectant fathers, too, may suffer symptoms
such as anxiety, fatigue and a ravenous appetite during pregnancies
for which they are responsible is less familiar _ which is curious,
since three-quarters of fathers do, indeed, experience such
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, no one had bothered to look at what happens to
the hormones of expectant men.
</P>
<P>
   But, after studying the literature on expectant males of other
species, Anne Storey, a psychologist at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland, in St. Johns, Canada, decided it was time to look
into the matter in people, too. Her results are about to be
published in ``Evolution and Human Behaviour.''
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal changes in a pregnant woman are not concerned
solely with the fetus's immediate well-being. They are also a way
of preparing her for her forthcoming role as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   In most animal species, however, the role of the father is
limited to insemination, so no hormonal change connected with
incipient fatherhood would be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. Over 90 percent of bird species, for
example, are ``biparental.'' This means that their couplings are
largely monogamous (with a little adultery on the side) and that
both parents help to look after the brood.
</P>
<P>
   And male birds which assist in child-rearing do, indeed, tend to
go through big hormonal changes before their young emerge _ as do
males of the much smaller proportion (fewer than 10 percent) of
mammal species that are biparental.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman is pregnant, the levels of several of her hormones
will rise. These hormones include cortisol (which is related to
stress), estradiol (the main female sex hormone) and prolactin
(which, as its name suggests, triggers her breast tissue to develop
the ability to secrete milk).
</P>
<P>
   Levels of all these hormones are also known to be correlated, in
the females of at least some species, with the quality of
subsequent maternal behaviors such as bonding to newly born
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's first task was to see what hormonal trends occurred
in men. To do so, she recruited 34 couples from an assortment of
prenatal classes and sampled their blood.
</P>
<P>
   The men in these couples, she discovered, exhibited significant
changes in their levels of cortisol, testosterone (the principal
male sex hormone, and thus in some sense the masculine equivalent
of estradiol) and prolactin over the courses of their partners'
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case the level of the hormone in question changed in a
way that matched the pattern that is seen in pregnant women _ which
is, presumably, why men experience many of the same pre-birth
symptoms as women do.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storey's hypothesis, which is supported by evidence from
other biparental species, is that these increased hormone levels
predispose a man to behave in a fatherly way when his child is
born.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to following long-term changes, Dr. Storey was also
interested in the expectant fathers' short-term responses to things
infantile.
</P>
<P>
   To test these, she and her colleagues took blood samples before
and after a half-hour procedure that involved both members of a
couple watching a video of a breast-feeding mother, listening to a
recording of a distressed newborn, and holding a doll which was
draped in a blanket that had recently been worn by a real newborn
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The parents-to-be were thus exposed to visual, auditory, tactile
and (from the blanket) olfactory stimuli associated with having a
baby around.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, like mothers, fathers show a
significant drop in cortisol levels during this procedure. The
closer a man's partner was to giving birth, the steeper the
hormonal plunge he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men who held the doll throughout the entire
30-minute experimental period showed bigger declines in
testosterone than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that fathers-to-be are undergoing almost
as much of a change of life _ probably as a result of behavioral
and chemical signals from the mother _ as that mother is herself.
</P>

activating the ``cleaning-dirty-bottoms'' circuits, is, however,
something that many women might beg leave to doubt. &QL;

MY MOTHER SMOKED, AND SHE PAID THE PRICE FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Watching her die was painful.
</P>
<P>
   In those last months, talking was difficult, the words coming
out in ragged gasps.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted us to know she loved us, that we shouldn't worry,
that she was ready to go because living _ bedridden and drugged _
had become so very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She'd motion me to come closer. Her hand would flutter down,
across and over in the sign of the cross, a mother's blessing as
she did every night when I was a youngster being put to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' she'd say. ``Que Dios te bendiga.'' May God
bless you.
</P>
<P>
   The last blessing came on Sept. 30. My mother died on Oct. 1.
Tobacco and emphysema killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know about personal responsibility, but smokers have such
vile accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   She started smoking at 14, a young immigrant girl fresh from a
Zacatecas farm, working in laundries and eager to be grown up and
thinking smoking made it so.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Gaeta Pimentel had few vices, rarely drinking and an
unfinished ``Aye que la . . . (what the . . .)'' being the extent
of her curse-word vocabulary. I often wondered as a kid how ``Aye
que la'' was supposed to end.
</P>
<P>
   But smoking was definitely her demon. We'd plead, cajole and
respectfully request that she quit. The answer was always the same.
``I can't, mijo (my son).''
</P>
<P>
   Even after being diagnosed with emphysema, she'd sneak
cigarettes. Tobacco's grip is that strong, that deadly.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a fact of life. If you've got something bad to sell,
your best customers are the weak ones, the ones with chinks in
their armor. Drug pushers know it. Con artists know it. Society
knows it as well, which is why we punish drug pushers and con
artists when we catch them.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies know about finding the weak ones as well. That
is why the young, whose chink is believing they are invulnerable,
have been favorite targets.
</P>
<P>
   We've now concluded that tobacco companies should also be
punished, though, because it's now personal with me, this seems way
late and way too little. It's funny thinking of $3 billion _
Arizona's share of a national settlement with the tobacco industry
_ as being too little.
</P>
<P>
   Helping tobacco's victims and dissuading future ones seem
particularly appropriate uses for this money.
</P>
<P>
   On this last part, dissuading future victims, I think my mother
would want to do her part. So, I don't think she'd mind if I
described her last days to you if it means even one cigarette going
unsmoked. Or maybe, this is just me wanting her death to not seem
so useless.
</P>
<P>
   She'd lie in her bed laboring to breathe. As a young woman, she
was lively, on the go, enjoying family, particularly enjoying doing
things for family. But here in her bed, trying to find that next
breath, she'd think only, ``How much longer?''
</P>
<P>
   Her advancing illness meant being constantly medicated in the
final years _ things to help her breathe, things to help with the
pain, things to help her deal with the effects of all the other
things she was taking. Diabetes set in. Someone said the steroids
had something to do with that _ I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Where she was once slight, she became heavy and puffy. Her whole
body seemed swollen, as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   She'd lie in bed, waiting for the next dose of whatever. Nights
were scary. Her husband, my father, is hard of hearing, so she
wondered what would happen if one of the bad spells came on again.
So, the family took turns spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   We'd hover and tend to her needs. And this was the most
difficult thing for her.
</P>
<P>
   She had been the one to care for others. Her menudo and tamales
were legend. Her sweetness and caring were, too. But being cared
for made her feel so helpless, so frustrated. She'd get depressed
about that and about the waiting. The tears, in those last days,
flowed easily.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, there was the constant fight for breath. Her
chest felt like it was being crushed, she'd say.
</P>
<P>
   The priest and the lay ministers visited often. She went quickly
one morning, knowing she was ready. The rest of us couldn't
possibly have been.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she did this to herself, but she did it with tobacco. &QL;

<P>
   Names can be such awkward things. Since the days of Adam, man
has busily tagged his things and thoughts and, more recently, even
his increasingly careful measures of time.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been nothing if not demanding: decades and eras have
gained not just a noun but also an adjective. The ``hungry
forties'' summed up times of want in Britain 150 years ago. This
century the twenties have roared in America and the sixties have
swung in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser decades have had labels: the depressed thirties, the
square fifties and the greedy eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a challenge. So far, the next decade is unbaptized.
</P>
<P>
   An adjective, in advance of actually experiencing the period,
would be too much to expect. But a noun is needed to follow on from
the seventies, eighties and nineties. But what? The problem is all
those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of candidates for the new name. One Web
site (www.namethedecade.com) has instituted a competition to decide
on one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 or so candidates are the millies, the singles, the
two-thousands, the two-Gs, the zips or zippies, the blanks, the
O-somes, the zeros and the ``tainties'' _ ``'cause it t'aint the
nineties, and it t'aint the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Internet-style, may be one way to find an answer, and
readers may well wish to make their votes count. But only after
proper reflection and even _ despite this e-era _ respect for
history.
</P>
<P>
   At the last century's turn a similar problem was solved when the
first decade became known as the nineteen-hundreds. Follow that
principle and we will soon enter the twenty-hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Too fuddy-duddy and pre-millennial? Some prefer instead the Y2K
(Year Two Thousand) as the first of the D2K, and the D2k the first
of the C2K.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a terrible shame: no sooner had we rid ourselves
of the perhaps-awful-but-certainly-awfully-named Y2K bug than we
would be bugged by a whole algebraic era.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, faced with that ghastly prospect, favor various
permutations of zeroes instead. Yet the ohs, triple-ohs, trios,
noughts or the (minimalist) nils and nulls all fail to inspire _
although the zeroes were reckoned, by one British polling company,
to be a popular choice among the public.
</P>
<P>
   Equally the 0-0s, pronounced as the ``uh-oh,'' are really too
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some good names remain available. The millies, or
the millie-nillies, could be popular and appropriately millennial.
But they are surely too flighty.
</P>
<P>
   One can proudly boast of being a child of the swinging sixties;
who would want to be a child of the silly millie-nillies?
</P>
<P>
   The aughts or naughts could also tempt, but lack the satisfying
``ties'' which give other decades' names a pleasing ring at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   So there can be only one solution, which fortunately can already
be found on the popular lists: a name which has the right tone,
rhythm and sense of fun, yet won't saddle the next generation with
distracting connotations.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the naughties. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Names can be such awkward things. Since the days of Adam, man
has busily tagged his things and thoughts and, more recently, even
his increasingly careful measures of time.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been nothing if not demanding: decades and eras have
gained not just a noun but also an adjective. The ``hungry
forties'' summed up times of want in Britain 150 years ago. This
century the twenties have roared in America and the sixties have
swung in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser decades have had labels: the depressed thirties, the
square fifties and the greedy eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a challenge. So far, the next decade is unbaptized.
</P>
<P>
   An adjective, in advance of actually experiencing the period,
would be too much to expect. But a noun is needed to follow on from
the seventies, eighties and nineties. But what? The problem is all
those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of candidates for the new name. One Web
site (www.namethedecade.com) has instituted a competition to decide
on one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 or so candidates are the millies, the singles, the
two-thousands, the two-Gs, the zips or zippies, the blanks, the
O-somes, the zeros and the ``tainties'' _ ``'cause it t'aint the
nineties, and it t'aint the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Internet-style, may be one way to find an answer, and
readers may well wish to make their votes count. But only after
proper reflection and even _ despite this e-era _ respect for
history.
</P>
<P>
   At the last century's turn a similar problem was solved when the
first decade became known as the nineteen-hundreds. Follow that
principle and we will soon enter the twenty-hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Too fuddy-duddy and pre-millennial? Some prefer instead the Y2K
(Year Two Thousand) as the first of the D2K, and the D2k the first
of the C2K.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a terrible shame: no sooner had we rid ourselves
of the perhaps-awful-but-certainly-awfully-named Y2K bug than we
would be bugged by a whole algebraic era.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, faced with that ghastly prospect, favor various
permutations of zeroes instead. Yet the ohs, triple-ohs, trios,
noughts or the (minimalist) nils and nulls all fail to inspire _
although the zeroes were reckoned, by one British polling company,
to be a popular choice among the public.
</P>
<P>
   Equally the 0-0s, pronounced as the ``uh-oh,'' are really too
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some good names remain available. The millies, or
the millie-nillies, could be popular and appropriately millennial.
But they are surely too flighty.
</P>
<P>
   One can proudly boast of being a child of the swinging sixties;
who would want to be a child of the silly millie-nillies?
</P>
<P>
   The aughts or naughts could also tempt, but lack the satisfying
``ties'' which give other decades' names a pleasing ring at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   So there can be only one solution, which fortunately can already
be found on the popular lists: a name which has the right tone,
rhythm and sense of fun, yet won't saddle the next generation with
distracting connotations.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the naughties. &QL;

STAKES HIGH AS REPUBLICANS TRY TO KEEP CONTROL OF CONGRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 9, 2000) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans head toward the most important election
of their six-year term as the majority party on Capitol Hill and
following a lackluster first run of the 106th Congress, they are
hoping for a better review in the coming session.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. The Democrats must win only five more seats
in the 2000 elections to retake control of the House, which the
Republicans captured in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate, where the GOP has a 55-45 seat edge, is not
likely to see a Democratic takeover, the chances of the Democrats
re-emerging in the House look better than at anytime in the past
six years.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true most incumbents on both sides of the aisle will
have little trouble winning re-election, the bad news for
Republicans is that they will be defending 19 open seats to only
five for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 19, seven to 10 may be in jeopardy if Democrats field
the right candidate and spend enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Neither recruitment nor money appears a problem this year for
Democrats, who have done better than usual in raising money for
crucial House and Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact they've done so well that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the GOP's top fund-raiser, has had to work hard and
creatively to keep dollars pouring in to help Republican races.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own political action committee, known as
Americans for a Republican Majority, DeLay and some of his former
aides have helped create several groups to collect additional money
for the GOP cause. Plans are, said one DeLay associate, ``to spend
it heavily in competitive districts'' where the Democrats have a
good shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay normally channels much of the bounty from his fund-raising
efforts to conservative Republicans. But this year, a lot of the
money will end up going to moderate GOP candidates in threatened
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What wealth we have, we plan to share _ wherever it's
needed,'' said the DeLay associate.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how close some of the congressional contests
will be, business has stepped up its giving to Democrats this
election cycle as opposed to past years when Republicans usually
got two-thirds more from special interest givers than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said one Washington corporate lobbyist whose company
has given more to Republicans in recent years than Democrats, is
because ``2000 is viewed as pretty much a toss-up election year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have a good shot, and I think that's what a lot
of business givers believe right now,'' the lobbyist said.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than money and attractive candidates for
either side to do well next November. The crucial element, both
sides agree, will be ``message.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many political analysts agree, the Republicans
are struggling with message. A year-end attempt to recast
themselves as the protectors of Social Security instead of tax
cutters must resonate with the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of the GOP during the budget
negotiations last fall with President Clinton, polls show that most
Americans still believe that Democrats will do a better job of
protecting Social Security than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, have been encouraged by recent polls
showing that most Americans are more in tune with their views on
major issues than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Several year end polls, for example, including a Washington Post
study of major voter concerns, gave Democrats a 6 percent to 7
percent edge over Republicans in this fall's election showdown.
</P>
<P>
   And the top issues identified by those surveyed in the Post and
other studies resemble items that the Democrats tried to get
through the first session of Congress against strong Republican
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   They include managed health care reform known as the ``patients
bill of rights,'' gun control measures, prescription drug benefits
for Medicare patients, a boost in the minimum wage, campaign
finance reform, and improved public education through teacher
hiring and reduced class size.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the spring trying unsuccessfully to convict
Clinton on impeachment charges, the only major legislation
Republicans pushed hard was a $792 billion tax cut bill. But most
Americans turned a deaf ear on GOP attempts to sell it. Clinton
vetoed it without any public backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans are scrambling to find ways to avoid being
labeled a do-nothing Congress as they begin campaigning in earnest
for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is talking about reviving
the managed care reform bill, the minimum wage measure, gun control
legislation, and even Social Security and Medicare reform measures.
But most of those issues are still viewed as Democratic agenda
items. So Republican leaders are also talking about breaking out
provisions of their failed tax cut package last year and offering
them as separate pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   They include bills that would eliminate estate taxes, expand
education savings accounts and repeal the marriage penalty. They
may also try to pass another overhaul of welfare laws, a victim's
bill of rights and Internal Revenue Service reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is an offensive plan to make (the
Democrats) vote on our issues rather than them forcing us to vote
on theirs,'' said one top Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who heads the National Republican
Campaign Committee, acknowledged recently that the Republican goal
last year was to do ``no harm'' instead of aggressively pushing an
agenda that might conflict with the presidential campaign of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush. Bush has the backing of 160 of 222 GOP members
of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush political strategist Karl Rove told reporters recently that
if the governor wins the nomination he hopes to ``set the tone and
the agenda'' for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects the leadership of the Republican Congress will be
supportive of that,'' Rove said, adding that a Bush victory in
November could help in tight congressional races that ``will be
decided on the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the elections are still 11 months away, many
Republicans are banking on being able to ride Bush's coattails to
an increased majority in Congress. But while Bush's favorability
ratings have remained high among likely voters, those for members
of Congress have sunk, indicating that voters may be more than
willing to separate the two when they go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on coattails. They just don't exist anymore,''
said Eric Smith, communications director for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats learned that lesson in 1996 and 1998 when Clinton won
re-election. Although they picked up seats in each of those
election cycles, Clinton's strong job approval ratings and the
booming economy didn't help at all in the closer races.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Republicans will find the going tough next year when
they try to ``improve their favorability ratings in a year in which
they're going to be competing with their presidential candidate''
for the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to try and hustle and redefine themselves. ...
But it's too late. They've really squandered a year,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most generic matchup polls indicate that the race for
control of Congress nationwide is a dead heat, analyses of the open
district seats show a slight edge for the Democrats. The most
likely gains for Democrats include seats in California, Washington,
Montana, Oklahoma, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But many surveys of likely voters also suggest there is a huge
number _ 31 percent in a few polls _- of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, seven to 10 Republican seats could be in
danger, compared to only three or four for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent polls showing her trailing New York City Mayor
Rudolf Giuliani to fill the seat of retiring Democrat Patrick
Daniel Moynihan, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is still
considered to have a good chance of winning the New York race.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans seem likely to win the Nevada seat of retiring
Sen. Richard Bryan, and they also have an excellent shot at
Democrat Chuck Robb of Virginia, who is being challenged by former
Gov. George Allen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, retiring Florida Sen. Connie Mack's seat
may go Democratic. Six other Republican incumbents facing tight
races are William Roth of Delaware, John Ashcroft of Missouri, Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania, Rod Grams of Minnesota, Lincoln Chaffee
of Rhode Island and Spencer Abraham of Michigan.

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ Employers added jobs at a
surprisingly robust rate in December, propelling the economy into
the new year with considerable momentum, the Labor Department
reported on Friday. Average hourly earnings for the month rose by
0.4 percent, slightly higher than expected. But because workers are
producing more for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far
shows few signs of setting off a surge in inflation. While good
news across the board, the figures substantially increased the
likelihood that the Federal Reserve will act to keep the economy
from overheating by raising interest rates next month. By Richard
W. Stevenson.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Mozdok, Russia) _ Frustrated by bad weather and
fierce rebel resistance, the Russian military on Friday suspended
its assault on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Maj. Gen. Gennady
Trochev, the deputy commander of the Russian troops in Chechnya,
said the pause was intended to give the thousands of civilians
trapped in the city a chance to escape from the fighting. But the
Russian military appeared to be putting the best face on an
increasingly difficult situation. By Michael R. Gordon.

   ASSISI-PIGEONS (Assisi, Italy) _ The battle between man and
pigeon is waged daily in almost every European city, but it has
reached a whole new dimension in Assisi, where the age-old debate
over animal rights and the protection of historic monuments _ and
human health _ is colored by the moral teachings of St. Francis of
Assisi, the humble friar (born in 1182 and died in 1226) who loved
animals and preached to the birds. Assisi, still recovering from
the 1997 earthquake that damaged its famous basilica and killed 11
people, is now traumatized by a new city ordinance that bans the
feeding of pigeons. By Alessandra Stanley.

   FLA-DEATH-PENALTY (Tallahassee, Fla.) _ Florida lawmakers
approve a bill that they say will limit the appeals process so
death row inmates can be executed more quickly. The vote parallels
steps Congress took in 1996 to limit the ability of state inmates
to seek review in federal court, and opponents say the effect of
the two actions together, the congressional and now the state,
would greatly impair the ability of Florida's death row inmates to
assert their constitutional rights. By Sara Rimer.

COKE EXECUTIVES APPOINTED TO NEW POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its second round of major changes this week, Coca-Cola
announced Friday that its chief marketing officer, Charles S.
Frenette, would be president of its troubled European operations.
His replacement is a veteran of Coke's business in Japan, long the
biggest single profit source for the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Carl H. Ware, the company's highest ranking black
executive who said in November that he would step down later this
year, was named executive vice president for corporate affairs and
government relations. Ware's departure plans, disclosed after a
management shuffle that effectively demoted him, had caused concern
within Atlanta's civil rights community and among some investors,
particularly since the company is facing a racial-discrimination
lawsuit filed by eight of its black employees.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard in the marketing department comes just
days before the company is supposed to announce its new campaign
for Coca-Cola Classic. The campaign, which urges the consumption of
ice-cold Coke in hopes of increasing sales and was developed under
Frenette, will now be supervised by Stephen C. Jones, who has spent
the last five years overseeing Coke's operations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There Jones worked closely with Douglas N. Daft, Coke's
president and chief operating officer who is expected to become
chairman and chief executive in three months. Jones supervised some
200 brands sold in Japan, where sales were flat in 1998 compared
with 1997 but appear to have been improving lately. He was named
head of the company's Minute Maid juice business in late October;
his successor in that position has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be intriguing to watch,'' said Andrew J. Conway, a
beverage stocks analyst for Morgan Stanley. ``This will be a year
of Steve Jones coming up to speed on the marketing issues in
several important profit centers, not only the U.S., where the
concentrate-price increase means Coke has to be a meaningfully more
efficient marketer, but also in Europe and Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones had barely unpacked in Houston, where Minute Maid is
based, the openings created by the retirement of William P. Casey
as president of Coke's European business made him a candidate for
the marketing job. ``The timing allowed Doug Daft to move Steve
into this position without a whole lot of disruption to Minute
Maid,'' said a company spokesman, Ben Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette will replace Casey, 58, who is retiring after 32 years
with Coke, much of that on the bottling side. He was appointed
president of Europe in 1998 by M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's chairman
and chief executive who is retiring in April.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Coke had the biggest product recall in its history in
Belgium, which cost the company an estimated $200 million in
marketing and other costs to alleviate the damage to its image,
which spread beyond Belgium to France, Spain and other parts of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette was named the company's chief marketer just 22 months
ago. He spent a large part of last year in Belgium, supervising the
marketing of Coca-Cola in the wake of the recall, which included
giveaways of Coke that officials ordered stopped after competitors
complained.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from recent Coca-Cola tradition, Frenette
will be based in London and A.R.C. Allan, who was named head of the
Asian and Middle East operations in October, will be based in Hong
Kong. Jones will be based in Atlanta, although other executives
might soon find their headquarters moved closer to the territory
they oversee as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's move from Atlanta is the first concrete evidence
we've seen of the decentralization of Coke's top management,'' said
John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daft is likely to make other changes in the company's highest
echelons before the Coke board meets on Jan. 18, Sicher added. Most
analysts expect him to tap Jack Stahl, a senior vice president who
oversees business in the United States and Latin America, as his
president and chief operating officer, and say the announcement
could come early next week. Stahl, a former chief financial officer
at the company who was the second-highest-paid executive in 1998
after Ivester, has long been seen as a candidate for the top jobs
at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would complement each other very nicely _ Jack the
strength in financial, Doug Daft the strength in operational,''
said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for
Merrill Lynch. Ivester's refusal to name a second-in-command
worried some on Wall Street and may have been one of the sticking
points between him and the board that led him to resign suddenly
last month, although neither he nor anyone on the board has
publicly said that.
</P>
<P>
   One question that remains is whether James E. Chestnut, the
chief financial officer until last month, will stay on. Chestnut
was given wider responsibilities, including technical services,
corporate affairs and government relations, in the management
shuffle Ivester announced in October. Several of his duties are now
being handled by Ware, and Gary P. Fayard, the new chief financial
officer, may end up reporting to Daft or Stahl.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; More Small Businesses Get A Piece of the R &AMP; D Pie &QL;   &UR; By
Laura Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 -
NASA announced Thursday that it will fund 25 small business
research and development proposals expected to cost the agency $15
million over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from possible congressional budget cuts,
officials for NASA's Small Business Innovation Research program
chose in August 103 proposals from 90 companies for phase II of the
program. The 25 new proposals, submitted from as many companies,
were accepted in addition to the original number, representing an
increase of the program's budget last year, said SBIR Program
Manager Paul Mexcur.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for this phase may give each proposal up to $60,000 to
continue research and development projects. The first two phases
must be funded through the SBIR office inside of NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 companies and NASA can now start negotiating over the
total price of each of their proposal contracts. The small
businesses whose proposals are selected for phase III will work
directly with NASA project scientists and engineers with future
missions in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ResearchSouth, in Huntsville, Ala., made the list of 25 with its
software that simulates hypersonic aerodynamics. The software takes
an aircraft design and simulates the airflow and stress it might
experience travelling at a speed many times that of sound - all
inside a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually used the software to simulate the airflow over
some airplanes with finished designs and the data matched,'' said
Lawrence Spradley, the company's chief scientist. ``We validated
our software. It was such a good comparison that NASA decided to
move us into phase II.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, owned by Spradley's wife of 37 years, has grown to
six employees in seven years. It is just this type of company,
Mexcur said, SBIR is designed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a small company and would like to do work with the
federal government and are one the high end of developing
technology, this program provides the best opportunity,'' Mexcur
said.
</P>
<P>
   The SBIR has been financing small business research into
high-risk, high-payoff technologies since Congress created the
program in 1982. Mexcur said NASA's 500 small business contracts
last year were developed through his office.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's 2,000 evaluators nationwide whittled the 2,335 proposals
first received in July 1998 down to 206. Mexcur said he was simply
content that the budget was increased enough to fund 128 total
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have executed a budget at about double of what I
got,'' Mexcur said. ``We fill up the cup until we say we have
bought all that we can.'' A call for submissions for this year's
round of research and development proposals will open in April. All
submissions must be received by mid-July.

CLINTON AGAIN MUST INTERVENE IN MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ In an attempt to focus peace talks,
President Clinton presented a ``working document'' to Syrian and
Israeli leaders Friday summarizing the issues that have kept the
two sides from reaching an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is difficult stuff,'' Clinton told reporters before
flying here from Washington to intervene for a fourth time in
stalled negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged there is still hard work ahead as the two
leaders wind down their first round of discussions and prepare to
head home either Sunday or Monday. But the president added that the
two sides are still ``trying to find ways to resolve their
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to imagine the end of the road here,'' Clinton
said. ``It's a difficult, difficult set of negotiations, but we're
working in a steady way and I'm satisfied that everybody is working
in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's return trip here Friday morning, after staying late
Thursday to meet with the Israelis and Syrians, marked a last-ditch
effort to get the talks moving again and to lay the groundwork for
continued discussions at a later date, either back in Shepherdstown
or at another venue.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the working
document, which was drafted on orders from Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, ``provides a summary of the issues to be
decided and the differences between the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart described it as a ``procedural tool'' designed to help
motivate the parties rather than a framework for a final
Syrian-Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin later told reporters that
the document includes new ``creative'' ideas and recommendations
from the president and Albright that could help spur progress
toward a deal between the two long-time enemies, who have been in a
state of war since Israel was established in 1948. But Rubin
stopped short of calling the document an official U.S. proposal for
a final agreement that would return the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in 1967, to Syria in return for normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright ordered the document drawn up on Thursday after it
appeared the Syrians might be on the verge of breaking off the
discussions. The Syrians have been complaining since Tuesday that
the Shepherdstown meetings have focused too much attention on
security arrangements for a possible Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, and not enough on when and how that pull-out will
occur, or where the final border between the two countries will be
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Syrian concerns had now been addressed, Rubin
said the working document does include a discussion of ``the border
issue'' and every other item of contention standing in the way of
peace. He insisted as well, that one of four technical committees
formed this week to deal with all the disputes would meet before
Monday to hold a thorough airing on the border matter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., Israeli and Syrian teams participating in the
negotiations are expected to take a break for religious observances
and begin work again Saturday night and Sunday. But Rubin suggested
that the Shepherdstown round of talks would likely end Sunday night
or early Monday since Barak and al-Sharaa are planning to return
home. He stressed, however, that ``accelerated'' discussions will
continue between the Israelis and Syrians in the coming weeks,
leading to another round of talks involving Barak, al-Sharaa and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said Barak and al-Sharaa, who also held a
brief face-to-face discussion after their meeting with Clinton and
Albright, plan to study the document presented to them over the
weekend. He said the two told Clinton they regard it ``as a good
way to move the process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks began here on a cautious note Monday, with U.S.
officials saying they did not expect a breakthrough in the first
round of discussions that would lead to what they called ``a core
agreement.'' They reiterated that view Friday, despite Clinton's
presentation of the U.S. document detailing ``where things stand,''
as one official put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very limited expectations of what can be achieved in
one round,'' Rubin said. ``This is a long, long-standing dispute.
It is one that is very emotional and very substantive, and carries
with it enormous security implications. We don't expect in a few
days for those kind of issues to move dramatically forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has pursued a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement
between Israel and all its Arab neighbors since he took office. He
was instrumental early on in helping to strike a tentative deal
between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993, followed by a second
agreement between Israel and Jordan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He has now made the search for an accord between Syrian and
Israel a top priority of his final year in office.

&HT;     SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT AGE IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Never mind the new millennium. This year marks a
new age of retirement, at least as far as Social Security is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The official age for full retirement benefits now begins
creeping up from age 65 to age 67 in 2027. The rise, mandated by
Congress in 1983 as part of its effort to preserve Social Security,
affects 150 million working Americans. But it does not touch any of
the 31 million retired workers and dependents already collecting
some $22.3 billion in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Only individuals born in 1938 or afterward must plan on retiring
later than they anticipated if they want full benefits. Those born
in 1938 turn 62 this year, and if they opt for early retirement,
their monthly benefits under the 1983 law will be reduced by 5/9 of
1 percent. By 2003, they will find that they won't be eligible for
full-retirement benefits until they are 65 years and two months
old.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the age for full-retirement benefits jumps two
months each year between 2004 and 2007 for persons born between
1939 and 1942. For instance, those born in 1939 will reach that age
at 65 years and four months. Those born in 1940 will reach it at 65
years and six months. The full-retirement-benefit age goes to 66
for those born between 1943 and 1954 and 67 for people born in 1960
or later.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 76-million-strong baby-boom generation begins
retiring in massive numbers in 2012, the Social Security system
projects it will run short of money and not be able to pay full
benefits beginning in 2034. However, with the rise in the
retirement age, the Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates
it will save $22.1 billion through 2009.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important step to assure the financial security of
the system,'' said Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been made, the long-term problem we face in
Social Security would be 50 percent larger than now.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sweetener, the law provides for a ``delayed retirement
credit'' to workers who stay on the job past the retirement age.
Benefits are increased until age 70. The yearly rate ranges between
5 percent for those born in 1931 and 1932, who turn 70 in 2001 and
2002, and 8 percent for those born in 1943, who start retiring in
2009.
</P>
<P>
   The SSA has made a massive effort to remind current workers of
the rise in the age of eligibility and to tell them what they can
expect from Social Security upon retirement. Last October, the
agency began mailing individualized Social Security statements to
125 million workers over age 25.
</P>
<P>
   The statements list each individual's expected monthly benefit
at age 62, at the age of full retirement and at age 70. The letters
also estimate monthly Social Security disability benefits that will
be paid if the worker becomes disabled and the amount the worker's
family will receive if he or she dies.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel said the statements provide ``not only a projection of
benefits but also good information about when to retire.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apfel said the hike in the retirement-benefit-eligibility age
rise is justified by rising life-expectancy rates. When the Social
Security system was created in 1935, analysts projected that
65-year-old benefit recipients would live another 12 and 1/2 years.
Now the projection is 17 and  &QC;  years.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the retirement age in 1983 drew a lot of fire, and it
remains controversial. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading
Republican presidential contender, created a mini-firestorm late
last year when he said he would not close the door on yet another
rise if other ways were not found to bail out Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP candidate, publishing magnate Steve Forbes, called
Bush's position a ``betrayal.'' When Forbes attacked Bush on Social
Security at a debate of Republican contenders on Dec. 2, Bush
struck back. He produced a column that the publisher had written in
Forbes magazine in 1977 advocating an age hike.

&HT;     STROKE VICTIM STILL HOPEFUL THAT CELL TRANSPLANT WILL PAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Four days before Christmas,
occupational therapist Tara Van Buren gave stroke patient Maribeth
Cook the same command she had given numerous times since Cook's
experimental fetal pig brain cell transplant in Brookline, Mass.,
on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open your left hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The response of Cook, 39, to that command had not changed since
the Saratoga Springs woman's stroke in 1994. No matter how much she
willed it to move, Cook's damaged left hand remained paralyzed _
rigid and seemingly as lifeless as a block of wood.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 21, however, Cook experienced what she described as a
breakthrough during a therapy session at the Wesley Health Care
Center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My left hand opened a little bit for the first time,'' Cook
said. ``It was very slight and nobody would notice it but me and my
therapist. Something's happening. I'm very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some slight flexion for the first time in her left
hand,'' Van Buren said. ``I'm trying to be optimistic, but I also
don't want to give Maribeth any false hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four months since Cook became the world's first stroke
patient to receive the unproven and controversial animal-to-human
cell transplant procedure, improvements in the function of Cook's
partially paralyzed left side have been incremental, anecdotal and
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   What Cook felt she experienced as a breakthrough has not been
confirmed by any irrefutable evidence. ``It's hard to be patient,''
Cook said. ``I really want something major to happen. I want to be
able to wriggle the fingers of my left hand more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, follow-up visits and medical tests at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center _ where 30 million fetal pig brain cells
were injected with a long needle deep into the stroke-damaged
region of Cook's brain _ have not detected new cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early to tell,'' said Loretta Barron, study
coordinator for Cook's clinical trial. ``Since Maribeth is the
first stroke patient, we don't have anything to measure her
against. We're not unhopeful after four months. We're also not
surprised that we're not seeing any dramatic improvements at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron said new cell growth has not been detected in the damaged
region of Cook's brain, where the fetal pig cells were injected.
Her brain has been analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging to look
at tissue and brain structure and magnetic resonance angiography to
observe any changes in blood vessels or circulation.
</P>
<P>
   If the xenotransplantation is successful, the fetal pig brain
cells will survive, grow and form tissue that will refill the
``black hole'' of Cook's deadened stroke region. Those cells, in
theory, would then repair her damaged brain circuitry and
eventually restore function on her left side.
</P>
<P>
   Cook currently wears a brace on her left leg, walks with a
pronounced limp, holds her left arm rigid and cannot use her left
hand. A stroke five years ago left her unable to continue working
as a dental hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barron, Cook's condition has shown some slight
improvements during the four months since the transplant surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough to deem the pig brain cell transplant a
success or to confirm cause and effect. Only an MRI, MRA or similar
test that revealed new cell growth in her deadened brain region
would prove that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that the MRI didn't show cells growing,''
Cook said. ``I believe they're growing, but just not enough to show
up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, one conclusion that is definitive _ based on the results
of blood samples and other tests _ is that Cook has not shown any
signs of contracting a pig virus. That concern about passing
viruses across species is one of the potential problems cited by
those who oppose xenotransplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Diacrin Inc., the Boston biotechnology company conducting and
paying for Cook's FDA-approved clinical trial, said none of the 25
patients they are tracking after pig cell transplants for diseases
other than stroke have experienced any pig virus infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt great from five minutes after surgery, and I still
do,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fetal pig brain cell transplant for Parkinson's
disease developed by Diacrin in a joint venture with Genzyme Corp.
has produced dramatic, measurable improvements for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult to know how closely changes over time in Cook
would mirror the track record of Parkinson's transplant patients,
according to Michael Egan, senior vice president at Diacrin.
``Since she (Cook) is the first stroke patient, it's hard to
compare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diacrin's goal is to recruit five additional stroke patients who
meet certain criteria for its clinical trial, but Cook as yet does
not have company in the fetal pig brain cell study.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 60-year-old man who had agreed to undergo the transplant last
month pulled out just before the scheduled operation. ``I'm not
sure what made the man nervous,'' Barron said. She added that a
number of people who wanted the transplant and contacted the
hospital failed certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Other female candidates of childbearing age withdrew when they
learned that conceiving children was strongly discouraged after the
transplant because of uncertainties of a pig virus being passed to
a fetus, according to Barron.
</P>
<P>
   Barron and her boss, Dr. Louis Caplan, a neurologist at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an internationally recognized
authority on stroke, continue to evaluate potential patients.
They're hopeful that another transplant will be performed later
this month at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Barron and Caplan will continue to evaluate Cook for the next 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cook's friends and family remain upbeat about
improvements that can't be measured at the hospital. Many have
remarked that Cook's voice now sounds more animated and clear after
the transplant, less slurred and monotone as it had been since the
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice a lot more confidence in Maribeth,'' said her mother,
Marie Verdile, of Mechanicville, N.Y. Verdile said she does not
worry as much about her daughter, does not feel compelled to visit
her as often and was not calling all the time during a three-week
vacation as she had done previously.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and her husband, Paul Cook, a sixth-grade math and science
teacher, bought a new minivan that Maribeth drives with much more
confidence than previous vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just doesn't give up and keeps moving forward in positive
directions,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's therapists have observed the same determination. During a
recent session at Wesley Health Care Center, physical therapist
Judy Trier said Cook has gained a total of 28 degrees of ankle
motion in all directions since the Sept. 1 transplant. Trier said
the 28-degree gain is substantial, but she can't say it was a
result of the fetal pig cells. It might instead simply be the
cumulative effect of a renewed commitment to therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She works really hard at her sessions,'' Trier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go ahead and say it. I'm pigheaded,'' Cook said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said she continues to enjoy hearing new pig jokes from
friends after the transplant. ``My favorite one is from my Jewish
friend who said she can't talk to me anymore because she's
kosher,'' Cook said.

<P>
   Now that the Playboy Mansion has been reborn as a hipster
hangout, its parties full of young Hollywood bloods like DiCaprio
and Affleck, what is to become of the scene from the good-old,
bad-old days _ the '70s and '80s, when unfamous, middle-aged men
cavorted with much-younger women in a setting still considered
cheesy, not yet chic?
</P>
<P>
   Is there no place left where 40-something men can pursue women
young enough to be their daughters, the age difference overcome by
the size of their portfolios?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes _ at a Ted Field party.
</P>
<P>
   Field is the Hollywood financier who, twice a year, gives a big,
splashy, over-the-top party in St. Barts, Aspen, East Hampton or
Paris during fashion week _ wherever the action is. The guest lists
are drawn up by professional party planners well connected to
modeling agencies, and the ratio of women to men is usually about
two to one. The evenings draw hundreds, sometimes thousands, no
matter what island, yacht or ocean-front mansion is chosen as the
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would fly anywhere in the world to go to a Ted
extravaganza,'' said Ivan Wilzig, 44, an heir to a banking fortune,
who has a castle in Water Mill, N.Y. ``It will totally have an
eclectic group of people with different backgrounds, and it's a
guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve in New York, Wilzig brought Mina Otsuko, 21,
whom he calls his ``main squeeze,'' to Studio 54, where Field had
spent over $700,000 to recreate the disco's heyday. They came with
another friend, Robert Hantman, 48, a lawyer who represents models,
and his date, Ina Shapiro, 27, a student (yes, Ina and Mina). At
the stroke of midnight, Ms. Shapiro threw off her top and started
dancing; Ms. Otsuko attempted to peel down her silver bodysuit but
found it too tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud,'' Hantman said later. ``It's a Ted Field party.
You expect a mixture of decadence, sophistication, good cheer and
fellowship.''
</P>
<P>
   Field seems intent on making the world safe for the last
stalwarts of the Playboy philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Studio 54 dance floor was full of men in suits and leggy,
wiggling, size 2 women. There was a reproduction of the famous
15-foot gold moon and coke spoon suspended above the crowd. On a
night when many celebrities stayed home or left town, the party
drew a B list of boldfacers, including Harvey Keitel, Grace Jones,
models like Kylie Bax and rappers like Dr. Dre and Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   Field himself did very little mingling. For more than three
hours after corks popped and the champagne sloshed at midnight, he
took over a black leather couch on the perimeter of the dance
floor, where he was surrounded by five women who looked to be 18 to
23. When he got up to dance, two or three women danced with him.
When he sat, the women danced together before him or sat down next
to him. They would stroke his shoulders and knees, and he would
caress their legs. They never disconnected, but they never kissed,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The music, disco chestnuts, was so loud you could feel it in
your ribs. Field would whisper into the ears of his companions, but
they had a hard time hearing, so he would just stroke their
shoulders or necks and prompt them to get up again to dance.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m., he and two young women formed a sandwich, one rubbing
up from behind him and another, in a black halter top, wiggling in
front of him. They were joined by a third woman, and then Field sat
down to watch. He was surrounded by two more women in backless
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice life that guy has,'' said one of four stoic security
guards, who stood behind the couch all night.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Ted Field's name outside Hollywood, and many people
can't place him, not even some of the guests at his parties. ``Ted
gives the hottest, hottest parties,'' said Kristi Horton, 32, an
analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, dressed in a backless
halter t Studio 54. Asked how she knew her host, she
replied, ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some party pros are stumped. ``He's a shadowy, mystery
figure of some sort,'' said R. Couri Hay, a society writer who has
attended several of his parties, including the one at Studio 54.
``I don't think I know what Ted Field looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Field, 47, is a huggy-bear figure who wears round glasses and
keeps his brush mustache well-trimmed. Amid a sea of spangles and
animal prints at Studio 54, he wore a black V-neck sweater that
could have been ordered from L.L. Bean. An heir to the Marshall
Field department-store and newspaper fortune (the family owned The
Chicago Sun-Times until 1983), he embodies a cross between
impeccable, preppy manners and studied contrariness.
</P>
<P>
   After turning his back on his Chicago roots, he founded
Interscope Communications in 1982, which has produced hit movies
like ``Runaway Bride'' and ``Three Men and a Baby.'' The Interscope
record label he began in 1990 has had hit releases by No Doubt and
a string of hard-edged rappers, from Snoop Doggy Dogg to Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   Variety editor in chief Peter Bart recalled that when Field
first came to Hollywood, ``He was originally thought of as the rich
kid who came to town and was exploited by some hungry agents and
producers.'' But that changed. ``He has become a very shrewd and
very successful, respected executive in Hollywood,'' Bart said.
``He has long since shed the image of poor little rich boy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the party-hearty guy that much of the world knows, Bart
said that was not the whole story. Field ``enjoys the good life,''
Bart said, but he added, ``He's a serious guy who reads and
thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Field spent his formative teen-age years in Alaska, where his
mother, Katherine Fanning, had moved following a divorce. (She went
on to become the editor of The Anchorage Daily News and later The
Christian Science Monitor.) When Field was 25, he came into a large
trust fund, which allowed him to continue an infatuation with
Porsches and Lolas, racing the cars around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a first cousin of Field, a man entrenched in the
leisure-class life, acknowledged that he had never met his relative
but said the family lore was that Ted, after growing up cloistered
in Alaska, had gone a bit wild once he came into his inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Field says he is hardly wild; he is a workaholic and says he
doesn't drink or take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He has three ex-wives and six daughters, ages 6 to 21, by four
different women. Currently, he's rekindled an on-again, off-again
relationship with Elizabeth Nottoli, 32, a former model, who is a
partner in a party-planning company, La Bonvie, which lays much of
the groundwork for his parties. The couple met seven years ago,
separated, had babies with other people, then got back together.
They don't live together. Hey, it's Hollywood in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Field saysd he doesn't think he will ever marry again.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Barts over the New Year's holiday two years ago, where he
brought along a dozen beautiful young women to live on his
chartered 190-foot yacht, he could be seen, day after day, in town,
shopping with one or another of them, buying them Italian shoes and
designer dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Is he the playboy he appears to be? Are the women who surround
him a harem?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview (Field rarely gives one), he did not dodge the
question, but he declined to be quoted verbatim, fearful his words
would be lifted out of context by another publication.
</P>
<P>
   He said that because he is in the entertainment business, and
because he is single, it is natural for him to be surrounded by
attractive young women. He doubted they would be around if he sold
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he dates the very young women he is seen dancing
or shopping with, he said yes, sometimes. He says that in the eight
years since his last divorce, he has had eight to 10 steady
girlfriends, all models, whom he met at parties.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Tracy Tweed, is the mother of his youngest
daughter, born out of wedlock. Speaking on the phone from a Los
Angeles hair salon, where she was having her hair highlighted, Ms.
Tweed said, ``Ted has made it possible for me to quit working and
raise our daughter.'' He pays for the 6-year-old's private school
and her own horse and an eight-bedroom mansion in Beverly Hills
with a pool and a tennis court, where mother and daughter live.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a mensch,'' Ms. Tweed added. ``He's true to his word.
Honest to a T.'' She recalled that when she met Field (they were
introduced at a party by Gene Simmons of Kiss), she slouched so as
not to tower above the 5-foot-10 Field. ``Why are you slouching?''
he asked. When she explained, he told her to stand up straight. ``I
can handle 6 foot 2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nottoli, Field's current girlfriend, maintained that she
doesn't mind all the other women Field surrounds himself with.
``Women are fascinated with him,'' she said. ``He's so intelligent,
he's handsome, he's funny, he's definitely spontaneous. He's very
free-spirited, and he loves life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that he is worth $1.2 billion, according to
Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Norah Lawlor, a publicist who has been to six Ted Field parties
and who gives parties of her own for nightclub and restaurant
clients, said the young women who eagerly attend are often models
or aspiring entertainers who think they will meet a rich and
powerful man.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they are going to be discovered,'' she said. ``They
hear two big shots are going to be at a party, and they think, `Wow
this might be my chance: husband, money, next movie role or
supermodel career.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the men, their interest is not always the obvious one,
she added. ``There are so many rich men I know that want me to
bring young models to dinner,'' Ms. Lawlor said. ``They don't want
to sleep with them. They just like to have them around. The guys
can relive their youth with women who are not jaded and see the
world from a young eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Ola Solomatina, 22, a six-foot model with short black hair and
blue eyes who was at Studio 54, said that there was an appeal to
being around worldly, older men. She has never been invited to St.
Bart's with Field, but she says that she's available. ``I would
join Ted on his yacht in a minute,'' she said. ``Why not? Whether
it's Ted Field or someone else, it doesn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it more entertaining talking to a 47-year-old man like
Ted than a 20-year-old,'' she said. ``He has interesting people at
his parties. It's very trendy. Like at his Halloween party, I met
Donald Trump. At New Year's Eve, Enrique Iglesias. I like being
around successful people. It's better than hanging around with a
bunch of losers.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:45 a.m., Field put on his leather jacket by the door,
standing in the middle of a circle of six women. ``Where is he
going?'' a man nearby asked, wondering if there was another party.
</P>
<P>
   No, there was no other party, one of the women in the entourage
said. They were all going back to Field's hotel.

   When the Crowbar club opened in Miami last week, so many people
in the crowd milling around outside were wired into their cell
phones that ``it looked like some sort of commando operation was
about to be enacted,'' said Tom Austin, who writes about night life
for Ocean Drive magazine in Miami Beach. ``I swear there were,
like, 14,000 cell phones,'' he continued, ``and guys were talking
into their shirts, trying to call the owner of the club to get in.
Those headset things have become the weirdest accessory down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lana Bernstein, a colleague of Austin's, reported that at an
Ocean Drive staff meeting, wires were hanging from everybody's
ears. ``It's quite a look,'' she said, ``especially when they leave
the meeting and start talking to themselves and waving their hands
around.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the public use of cell phone headsets hasn't
quite reached Miami levels yet, but the sets are poised to become
the big accessory for spring _ more useful on the head than a bra
strap, and more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen these things? They are little wires hanging from
earplugs, and together with a microphone that clips to your shirt
they relay conversations to and from a cell phone stashed in a
pocket. Why? To a certain degree, because people are worried about
brain tumors. My friend Bob has been talking about the boiled egg
trick for weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put an egg between two cell phones and in a few minutes.
. . .'' He pauses dramatically. ``In a few minutes the egg has
boiled!'' You will not be able to duplicate these results at home;
cell phones don't really boil eggs. But you might take note, as Bob
and others have, of the genesis of the egg myth, which is rooted in
increasing uneasiness about the health effects of cellular phone
use. Or you might just respond, as I did, by pointing out that the
egg didn't get cancer, so why worry?
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over cell phones and brain tumors, which has been
present in some form almost since the phones' invention, traces to
the fact that their antennae emit radiation, or microwaves, which
is how they find and receive signals from network beacons. Recent
news reports have stirred a new round of jumpiness over the idea of
microwaves pouring into peoples' heads, and thus the craze in some
cities for headsets, which allow the phones to be somewhere other
than next to the ear.
</P>
<P>
   No studies directly link cell phone use to brain cancer. But all
sorts of weird data is accumulating, said Dr. George L. Carlo, a
lawyer with a Ph.D. in pathology, who was hired by the wireless
phone industry's trade association to head up research in the area.
Last fall Dr. Carlo broke ranks with the industry, announcing that
study results he had marshaled from around the world added up to
one big question mark. He has scolded cell phone makers for saying
their technology is safe without qualification, and urges further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, the ABC News program ``20/20'' broadcast a
report detailing tests that it said were independently conducted
and measured the amount of radiation that penetrated the head from
different cell phone models being used in different positions.
Radiation from four of the five phones tested exceeded a Federal
Communications Commission guideline in at least one position in
analog mode, ``20/20'' said, except when headsets were used.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless telecommunications industry quickly denounced the
``20/20'' methodology, along with Dr. Carlo's apostasy, but by then
many people had jumped to their own conclusions. Publicists,
Hollywood agents, rap stars and other cell phone abusers bought
headsets by the carload, and the public areas of certain cities
began to look like the grounds of an old-fashioned mental
institution, its inmates pacing and frantically gesturing, all
engaged in heated conversation with . . . themselves. Or so it
seemed to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The latest headsets, which hook behind the ear, are a logical
evolution from an earlier look, the headband headset with a
microphone arm, worn by Madonna during her ``Blond Ambition'' tour,
as well as by the actors in most Broadway musicals, N.F.L. coaches
and the sales folk in Gap stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, walking around with discreet wires trailing from their
ears, whole segments of the citizenry seem to be auditioning for a
``Mission: Impossible'' sequel. ``It was the whole thing of `I can
be a secret agent,''' said Megan Matthews, a spokeswoman for Nokia,
the giant cell phone maker. ``All of a sudden you saw people in
airports talking to themselves. We've been making headsets for
about four years; this is not a new thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matthews said sales of headsets have been steady since their
introduction, which was ``an extension of the whole personalization
thing and the convenience factor'' and had nothing to do with
perceived health risks. People want their hands free while talking
on a cell phone. ``The `20/20' show had no effect on our
business,'' she said. ``Today there is no reason for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Polone, a talent manager and producer in Hollywood who
started using a headset about three months ago, called from his car
to talk about it. ``I produced two movies in one month last year,
and I was talking on my cell phone constantly,'' he said. ``Maybe
it was psychosomatic, but I had headaches all the time. Anyway,
it's just easier to do other things, like drive, with a headset.''
</P>
<P>
   Headset prices range from about $30 to $70. Cellwest.com sells a
clear plastic one that lights up when you have a call. As with any
hot consumer product, selling accessories to go with it is a smart
business move. This would seem especially true with cell phones,
which, like the Nasdaq stock index, have had a giddy rise.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 70 million cell phone subscribers in the
country, and counting. Clearly, no one is going to stop talking.
Now companies like Wavelength Technologies are making cell phone
sheaths designed to absorb the radiation emitted by both the phone
and its antenna. Made of leather, wire mesh and PVC laminate, among
other things, the Microshield sheath costs $59 and is available at
www.wavelengthonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   What's the appeal? Well, consider that you've bought a headset,
but while you use it, your cell phone is shoved into a hip or
breast pocket, theoretically pumping microwaves into some other,
more vulnerable part of your body. ``I mean, at least your head is
covered by your skull,'' said Kimberly Thier, who leases commercial
real estate in Manhattan and was ``totally freaked out last month
by the `20/20' thing.'' Ms. Thier and her friends are all using the
Microshield. ``Everywhere I go,'' she said, ``people are asking me
about it. I'm not into this health stuff, but for me it's a win-win
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With your hands free while using a headset, what else might you
do? How about going online? Ms. Matthews of Nokia said one big
trend for her company was wireless and Internet combinations, so
that now you can buy a phone with a built-in Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervasive computing'' is the buzz phrase for such activity,
said Michael Wolff, author of ``Burnrate: How I Survived the Gold
Rush Years on the Internet'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster). ``Also, digital
assistants,'' he added. ``That is, those devices you surround
yourself with to put you into even closer touch with the
information flow. It's about intense wireless abilities, so you can
get your e-mail basically pumped into your head.''
</P>
<P>
   But can e-mail boil an egg?

 &HT;    Florida GOP rallies to approve limits to Death Row appeals
 &HT;    By S.V. Date and Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Dragging Republicans away from a family
funeral and a wife in childbirth, and aided by a key Democratic
defector, Gov. Jeb Bush salvaged the necessary votes Friday to
radically limit the court appeals of Death Row murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Condemned inmates would have to meet strict deadlines for filing
their claims, would be limited to how many appeals they could file,
and would have to file both their first and second round of appeals
simultaneously _ all with the goal of putting them to death within
five years of conviction, rather than the current 14-year average.
</P>
<P>
   Bush predicted the first execution by lethal injection would be
``a matter of months, not a matter of years.'' He is expected to
sign the legislation within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without rushing into anything, I tend to sign death warrants
pretty quickly,'' he said and later added, ``It's always longer
than you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Death Row convicts who can afford their own lawyers, however,
are not subject to the limits passed Friday. The new law covers
only those using state-paid lawyers _ one of many questionable
features defense lawyers say could lead the courts to overturn much
of the new legislation and thus add even more delays.
</P>
<P>
   Those criticisms notwithstanding, Florida's all-Republican
triumvirate stood with Democratic Attorney General Bob Butterworth
to praise the new law as something, finally, on behalf of the
families of murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here and did what we had to do,'' said House Speaker
John Thrasher, whose miscalculation on how many votes his chamber
needed required an extra day's worth of arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims of crimes are the people we should revel for,''
said Senate President Toni Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth _ who originally called for a special session in
November specifically to switch from the embattled electric chair
to the more judicially palatable lethal injection _ hailed both the
lethal injection bill passed Thursday and the appeals measure both
chambers passed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate originally passed its appeals bill 30-7 on Thursday,
only to watch it fail to win the necessary two-thirds majority in
the House. The 75-36 vote there effectively made the bill merely a
recommendation to the Supreme Court to change its rules, rather
than a repeal of existing rules that 80 votes triggered.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers overwhelmingly passed the lethal injection bill
Thursday: 37-0 in the Senate and 102-5 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth can now use the new law to ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to drop its review of Florida's electric chair, just as in
past cases it declared moot pending reviews of California's gas
chamber and Washington's gallows when those states switched to
lethal injection amid court reviews.
</P>
<P>
   CALLING THE SICK AND GRIEVING
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Bush had worried that the more independent Senate
might balk at such radical changes to death penalty appeals,
particularly given the risks that the new law might force the
system to a grinding halt if the courts rule it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the House was where the proposal got snagged.
To reach the two-thirds of the required votes, Thrasher had to find
five votes.hursday night, the calls went out. Four Republican votes popped
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ocala Rep. George Albright climbed inside his red pickup truck
at 7 p.m. for the three-hour drive to Tallahassee, leaving behind
his wife, who is nine months pregnant. ``I felt I had a moral
obligation'' to vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Starks of Casselberry, a Delta pilot, rose from the bed
he had slept in for four days while battling the flu to board a
9:35 p.m. commercial plane in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The other two were whisked back to Tallahassee on private planes
solicited by the Florida Republican Party. One carried Rep. Everett
Kelly of Tavares, who was in Alabama for his sister's funeral,
scheduled for Thursday afternoon. ``This is one of the most
important bills I have passed in my tenure in the Florida House. My
sister would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The other plane retrieved Bradenton Rep. Mark Ogles, who had
been staying with his sick wife in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was help members get here to do their job,'' said
Florida Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas, who came to watch
the vote from the public gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when the House opened for business at 9 a.m.
Friday, Republicans were still one vote short.
</P>
<P>
   The arm twisting intensified.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, debate began and abruptly ended. Republican
vote-getters, called whips, paced the floor. Thrasher leaned on the
podium, not smiling, but on the phone. Democrats kept tabs on their
own members.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the mostly Democratic black caucus took a
headcount. Two members were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes they were found _ seated inside the speaker's
office, off the House floor, chatting with Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan,
who sat behind Thrasher's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tallahassee Rep. Al Lawson and Miami Rep. Beryl Roberts
denied Brogan had offered or promised them something to gain their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But that did little to relieve two of their black caucus
colleagues, Miami senators Daryl Jones and Kendrick Meek, who
stood, bitterly, outside Thrasher's closed office door.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just after noon, it was time for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened: Rep. John Cosgrove of Miami _ the second
highest-ranking House Democrat _ voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrove, who in November wants to be elected Florida's next
insurance commissioner, had planned to use a rule that would allow
him not to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But after Thrasher challenged him _ a planned Republican
maneuver _ Cosgrove backed off, ensuring the Republican victory. He
said he did it because he was ``voting the conscience of my
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seethed. One called him a ``traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach Rep. Lois Frankel _ who in March will become the
House's top Democrat, stormed over to his desk.Come November, she
said, ``You aren't going to have one Democrat in this state
supporting you.''
</P>
<P>
   PUT OFF UNTIL SPRING
</P>
<P>
   With the new laws to take effect within days, the offices of the
state-paid lawyers who defend Death Row inmates will likely go on a
hiring binge, signing contracts to bring aboard some 100 new
attorneys to file appeals for those inmates already on Death Row by
the Jan. 8, 2001 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators expect to spend an additional $10 million to $15
million a year to pay for the simultaneous filing of the first and
second round of appeals, the so-called ``dual track'' system copied
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is after we last year gave $1 billion back in taxes,''
Frankel said. ``Why didn't we put more money into the court system
so we could have more judges to speed up this process?''

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The historian weighs his words. Because his subject is
Germany and the modern history of that nation is a minefield, this
precision is understandable. Yet it is evident that in the crafted
phrases of Fritz Stern, in the sentences that circle a subject like
a hunter closing on his prey, a personality as well as a calling
are revealed. He is a man of nuances; when he defines himself, it
is with a kind of fastidious detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a full-blooded non-Aryan,'' he said, an amused twinkle in
his small eyes, hands so mobile they appear to be plucking each
shade of thought from the air. ``That is a definition I like. Of
course, I am completely of Jewish descent. But my stumbling block
with the description of myself as a Jewish historian is that it was
Hitler that decided I was a Jew. My grandparents converted to
Christianity; my parents were baptized at birth; I, too, was
baptized. It took Hitler's racial laws to turn me into a Jew, and
that provokes a certain _ let me put it like this _ a certain
hesitation in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1926 in the German town of Breslau (now Wroclaw in
Poland), later a child-escapee from Hitler, now a U.S. citizen,
Stern is a natural builder of bridges. For without such connections
_ between Germany and the United States, between Jews and Germans,
between Berlin and Warsaw, between the horror of then and the hope
of now _ what chance would he have to make himself whole?
</P>
<P>
   His historical writing amounts to a quest to go beyond the
fragments offered by memory. ``Memory may be mighty,'' Stern said
in Frankfurt, ``yet it can also be inaccurate. It keeps us on our
toes, but it brings us only to the threshold of historical
understanding.'' At a time of intellectual turmoil in Germany, this
quest for understanding has earned Stern, a professor at Columbia
University, a special role in the country of his birth. He has
emerged as a sort of moral arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Germany has been seeking a new 21st-century
identity. It has manifested impatience with the stigma of the Nazi
past, a thirst for normality, a new readiness to talk openly of
German power, and a hankering for some acceptable German
patriotism. Many Germans feel the ``constitutional patriotism'' of
philosopher Jurgen Habermas _ the neutered national identity that
substituted values like democratic government for the treacherous
emotions of anthem and flag _ is no longer enough. In short,
Germans are unbuttoning themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But as Germany searches for its new self, Germans are still a
little unsure, giddy with the new vocabulary of interests, great
European power and influence where once the talk was only of Europe
and detente. They tremble at their boldness in moving beyond the
self-imposed constraints of the postwar years. In this shifting
environment, symbolized by the move of the capital from small-town
Bonn to brash Berlin, Stern has emerged as perhaps the closest
thing to a trusted external judge of the country's bitter internal
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Germans often turn to Americans when problems of memory are
particularly intense. It is not for nothing that an American,
Michael Blumenthal, runs the new Jewish Museum, whose architect,
Daniel Liebeskind, is also an American, or that the planned
Holocaust Memorial was designed by Peter Eisenman, another
American. The basic difficulty behind these choices is an old one:
how should the perpetrator commemorate or simply remember the
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the author of several books on Germany, including ``The
Politics of Cultural Despair,'' is a victim. His world began to
fall apart in 1933; the family fled to New York in 1938, when young
Fritz was 12. But as a historian he has been little interested in
victimhood. This flight from emotion to reason reassures Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Stern has been interested in trying to recreate the time
in which his father, a prominent doctor named Rudolf Stern, long
thrived, in order to understand the political, cultural and
economic forces that ultimately destroyed the fecund German-Jewish
world of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His affection for
the pre-Nazi Germany of his parents is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Ulmer, the president of the German Booksellers' and
Publishers' Association, said: ``The skill of Fritz Stern's
depictions and his integrity have generated an atmosphere that
provides the descendants of the victims and the descendants of the
perpetrators with the building blocks from which to fashion a
shared memory of a time when German-Jewish patriotism was
thinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is seen as a conciliator at a difficult time.
Ulmer led the jury that in 1999 awarded Stern the Peace Prize of
the German Book Trade, the country's highest literary honor. In
effect, a Jewish American professor was asked to step into another
storm over the Nazi past and calm it. For the recipient of the
prize a year earlier was the German author Martin Walser, who chose
to speak aloud what many Germans silently feel.
</P>
<P>
   Auschwitz, Walser declared in late 1998, should not become ``a
routine threat, a tool of intimidation that can be used at any
time, or a moral cudgel.'' Apparently speaking of claims for
compensation that have led to a 10-billion-mark settlement for
forced and slave laborers put to work by the Nazis, he deplored the
``exploitation of our shame for present purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   A storm duly erupted. Ignatz Bubis, the late Jewish leader in
Germany, called Walser a ``mental arsonist.'' Abruptly all the
unhealed wounds of Germany's trauma were suppurating once more.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that, a year later, Stern should be chosen
to apply some balm. He duly obliged. His response, in a speech
delivered in October, was typically measured, balanced, shaped at
some level by the hesitation of a man who has done something
essentially perverse: grown close to the country that murdered his
uncle and aunt and hounded his parents from their home.
</P>
<P>
   Stern declared that ``any instrumentalization or trivialization
of the Holocaust, consigning the millions of other victims to
oblivion, is a crime against the victims themselves.'' He noted
that the ``first victims of National Socialism and the revival of
torture were so-called Aryans,'' including pastors in Breslau. He
recalled ``how greatly attached my parents were to their home
country, how naturally _ up until 1933 _ they saw themselves as
Germans.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   is was certain to provide some comfort to a German
audience. But Stern was also stringent in his admonitions. He
deplored the government's adoption of the phrase Berlin Republic,
saying ``the result is simply to underline undesirable
discontinuity.'' He warned that what he has called Germany's second
chance could be undone if understanding did not overcome suspicion
between Germans and from the west and the east. Above all, he
suggested that the enormity of the Holocaust was such that ``every
attempt to escape into `normality' is vain.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was marked by a favorite word: context. It was the
absence of context, as he saw it, that led Stern to a sharp
condemnation of the most controversial recent work on Germany,
Daniel Goldhagen's best-selling ``Hitler's Willing Executioners.''
In an essay reprinted last year in ``Einstein's German World,''
Stern's latest work, he charges Goldhagen with ``the indictment of
a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldhagen, a social scientist at Harvard, retorted that Stern's
was the ``reaction of the old guard, and one of striking
intellectual bankruptcy.'' He continued, ``I was accused by him of
defaming the German national character, but all I said was Germans
believed certain things at a certain time, just as it is clear that
in the 1860s most whites in the American South were racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldhagen book was troubling to Stern because he has been
concerned with steering a repentant postwar Germany toward the
stable democracy with strong trans-Atlantic bonds that it is today.
For Stern, the Goldhagen work _ with its thesis of a deeply rooted,
widespread and peculiarly German anti-Semitism as the basis of the
Holocaust _ was shallow and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   For him, it underplayed the role that the national humiliation
of Versailles had in igniting anti-Semitism; it ignored the
participation or complicity of other European nations in the
annihilation of European Jews; it might only reignite ``latent
anti-German sentiment among Americans, especially Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument simmers on. Goldhagen makes a powerful case that
anti-Semitism was part of the ``cultural cognitive model'' of the
German society that produced Hitler; Stern says that ``is an
incredibly simplistic view.'' His reality is another: the ambiguity
of German sentiment toward the Jews and the Jews' painful German
patriotism, which together made up the unquiet world of his
forebears. Anti-Semitism was not the whole story as the Sterns
lived it in Breslau.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, unlike some Germans, has no illusions that the world of
interwoven German and Jewish culture into which he was born can be
restored. The Jews arriving from Russia, drawn by financial
enticements, will not recreate what Hitler destroyed. Germany must
help bring Central European states like Poland firmly into the
Western fold. For in illusions about the past lies the danger of
another departure down some shimmering, unique and volatile German
path, which Stern has always feared and always fought.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, Stern quotes Einstein on the Germans: ``A
country of mass murderers.'' He also quotes another brilliant
scientist and German Jew, Fritz Haber: ``The nation is bourgeois to
its very depths.'' Germany, of course, has been both those things.
Therein lies its fascination. Einstein never converted; Haber was
baptized at the age of 24. Both veered between love and despair at
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   These are the intellectual struggles between attraction and
repulsion that intrigue Stern; in some measure they are his own.
``In retrospect,'' he says, ``I can understand what motivated my
paternal grandparents to convert, as I think a historian must
understand things in the context of when they occurred. I am not
necessarily happy about it, because I do not like the idea of
changing religion for national advantage, but I can certainly
comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   This baptized German Jewish family was not simply persecuted,
for it first advanced thrillingly in the politically unstable,
fast-growing, inventive and finally humiliated German world of the
first third of this century. Germans, ever torn between the light
and dark of their natures, ever harboring secrets, are drawn to
Stern because he has sought to portray all these shadings of the
German tragedy. At another moment of uncertain change, he helps
them believe in themselves _ with wariness.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since 12 Victorian gentlemen gathered for its first
meeting on April 6, 1858, in the New York home of Augustus B. Sage,
the American Numismatic Society has grown into a research
institution with one of the finest collections in the world,
holding nearly a million Greek, Roman, Islamic, Asian and medieval
coins.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, thanks in part to its low profile and, some
say, its distant site in upper Manhattan, the society has largely
been forgotten by the public. Now a plan to reduce the society's
annual deficit of nearly $1 million by offering buyouts to its five
curators while at the same time spending most of its endowment on a
new home downtown has sparked a rebellion among a group of its
devoted members.
</P>
<P>
   A special meeting of the society's 16-member board, which it
calls the council, will be held Saturday, Jan. 15, to discuss the
changes. The protesters plan to appeal to the society's leaders to
freeze the buyouts for a year and to reconsider its decision to
spend $16 million to move the society downtown from the
neo-Classical villa on 155th Street and Broadway that has been its
home for 93 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unique as a cultural institution,'' said Dr. James H.
Schwartz, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, who is leading the
revolt. He accused the council of acting without properly
consulting the society's 2,000 members and said its actions
threaten the organization's strongest asset: its international
reputation for scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   But Ute Wartenberg, the society's executive director, says that
she is simply following through on the council's directive to cut
the annual deficit by $400,000. In addition to offering to buy out
the curators, the senior staff took a 7.5 percent salary cut, six
guards and maintenance workers were laid off Dec. 31 and the
society is now closed to the public on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we want to get rid of the curators,'' said Ms.
Wartenberg, who has a doctorate in papyrology and is an expert on
ancient Greek coins. ``We are trying to cut the deficit to half a
million dollars and hope that the move downtown will allow us to
raise money and build the organization back up.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing the Numismatic Society are similar to those
that confront many museums as government support has waned in
recent years and the competition for private philanthropy has grown
more fierce. But the adjustment has been particularly difficult at
the society, which is also having an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the question of: Who are we?'' said Arthur A.
Houghton III, who stepped down as president of the society in
October. ``Are we a learned society or are we a museum?''
</P>
<P>
   The society houses what is widely acknowledged to be the best
numismatic library in the world. Both the librarians and the five
curators are recognized by other scholars around the globe for
their expertise. (Several scholars have sent letters of protest to
the council since word of the proposed cuts has spread.) The
society's graduate summer seminar is famous as a training ground
for budding archaeologists and historians.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The society's deficit has been growing for more than a decade. A
campaign raised $3.6 million in the late 1980s but that was not
sufficient to cover annual losses. In 1998, the American
Association of Museums revoked the society's accreditation. It said
the society's public community and education programs were too
weak, and criticized the society for raiding its endowment, which
it said was inflated by the booming stock market, to pay for its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years many members of the council also came to the
conclusion that the society would not survive unless it moved from
its historic location at Audubon Terrace on 155th Street, which is
also home to the Hispanic Society of America and the American
Academy of Arts and Letters. (The Museum of the American Indian and
the American Geographical Society were once located there as well.)
</P>
<P>
   They say that it is too difficult to get people to visit the
society and that wealthy benefactors do not feel comfortable with
the location. ``Where we are now we can't raise funds,'' said
Donald G. Partrick, a Long Island real estate developer who is the
society's new president.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhaustive search in which the society contemplated
moving to San Francisco, Philadelphia and a site on Central Park
West, it bought a building at 140 William St. in the financial
district for $7.8 million. Proponents of the move say that a museum
devoted to the history of money, located in the heart of Wall
Street, will draw wide interest.
</P>
<P>
   To buy the building, which formerly housed a bank, the society
borrowed $4.2 million from its $16 million endowment. It plans to
spend $6 million to create a library, vault and office space in the
first phase of a renovation and $4 million to create exhibition and
lecture space in a second phase that won't be completed for at
least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Partrick said the society had already paid back $1.2 million to
the endowment and has pledges of $5.2 million toward the cost of
the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz, the chief critic, said that the move amounts to a
Faustian bargain. He says he does not believe the society can be
turned into a museum that will mount blockbuster exhibitions. The
decision to move should be reconsidered, he added, if it means
having to eliminate the society's curatorial staff. ``If they can
drum up $10 or $15 million for the building, why can't they drum up
half a million a year for curatorial salaries?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Partrick countered that one has nothing to do with the other.
``Pledges have been made for the new location,'' he said. ``They
are not available to fund our deficit. Nobody wants to support a
sinking ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Though all five curators have been offered the severance
package, which includes up to 18 months' pay and a year of health
insurance, it is not clear how many positions will be cut. Schwartz
wants the council wait a year before eliminating any positions so
that he and other society members can mount a major fund-raising
campaign. He freely admits that the society's bylaws give the
fellows no power over the council.
</P>
<P>
   Partrick does not sound like he will be moved. ``These people
suggest that we may be able to raise funds to save the curators,''
he said. ``I hope they are right, and I will try as hard as I can
to help them. But I have to be realistic. I honestly don't think it
is going to happen. We need an angel.''

PANEL SEEKS 100 PERCENT CANADIAN CONTENT ON CBC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Quebecer Celine Dion may sing the theme song, but
Canadian broadcast regulators want to scuttle ``Titanic.'' And they
want movie spy Austin Powers to keep his shagging self south of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the stage for a Canadian clash over American culture,
government regulators this week told the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation to stop showing blockbuster Hollywood movies in favor
of loftier Canadian-produced fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Radio-Television and Communications Commission,
which regulates the country's airwaves, also wants the
government-funded CBC to cut back on highly popular showings of NHL
games and concentrate on home-grown drama, dance, documentaries,
and ``amateur athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprising show of defiance, the CBC's boss has vowed
to resist nationalist meddling, saying it would economically
endanger the venerable network by driving away viewers and
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to transform CBC into the PBS of the north,
with nothing but elitist programming,'' said CBC President Robert
Rabinovitch, referring to America's highbrow Public Broadcasting
System.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need those American shows to generate revenue,'' he said at
a news conference. ``There is no way CBC can implement these
decisions, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission flatly instructed CBC to stop showing ``big box
office, non-Canadian'' movies _ read, American _ within three years
or risk losing its license. Although it seems doubtful the
regulatory body has authority to shut down the national
broadcaster, it can certainly turn the debate over programming from
the United States into a hot political issue, and perhaps force
Parliament to resolve what could turn into an ugly controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The CBC is a national institution created in 1936 as a radio
counterweight to the deluge of broadcasts from the giant neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   CBC Radio offers commercial-free programming that is nearly 100
percent Canadian in content. But CBC TV, which airs commercials, is
a curious melange of Canadian ``public interest'' programming,
including newscasts and documentaries, coupled with entertainment
that includes Canadian-produced dramas and sitcoms but also
Hollywood films. The movies attract big audiences and big
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   CBC TV competes against two smaller Canadian commercial
networks, both of which have complained that ``Mother Corp,'' as
the CBC is sometimes called, receives $515 million a year in
government subsidies, or about three-quarters of its budget. The
private networks serve mainly as profitable platforms for American
TV. Nearly every Canadian can tune in US channels via cable or
satellite, or because they live close enough to American cities.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the Radio-Television Commission was taking aim at
a perceived onslaught of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CBC is a critical pillar of Canada,'' said Elizabeth
McDonald, president of the Canadian Film and Television Production
Association. ``The fact that the CRTC sees this is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   But many ordinary Canadians turn to nightly TV for a good flick
or rousing sports match, not caring too much about its national
origin. There are extremely popular Canadian shows, such as the
comedy ``This Hour has 30 Minutes,'' but also lots of stultifying
programming subsidized by this or that provincial film board. It's
a standard complaint among Canadians that they are force-fed too
much ``this is good for you'' programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatize the CBC, and let the public decide what they want to
see and hear in a mandarin-free environment,'' urged viewer Robert
Wilson in a letter to the Toronto-based National Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, polls show that most Canadians see CBC as an important
guardian of national culture and values. Rabinovitch noted that CBC
is Canada's biggest producer of home-grown television, but it needs
some American fare to survive in an era of government budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new conditions are fiscally irresponsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ban on Hollywood movies, the commission
instructed CBC to make a 20 percent cut in professional sports
programming (including NHL games, which are very popular), dedicate
more prime time to ``dramas, music, dance, and variety shows''
produced in smaller provinces, and emphasize ``cross-cultural
French-English'' programming.
</P>
<P>
   The CBC has been the subject of fierce debate in Canada for five
years, ever since the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien
cut public funding by $250 million, which resulted in more
commercial programming.

PLAN WOULD STRENGTHEN TIES BETWEEN ISRAEL AND YOUNG JEWS ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., N.Y., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As loudspeakers blared a welcome at Ben-Gurion
Airport, Michael Sherman stepped off a jumbo jet one recent morning
with more than 400 other American Jewish college students.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the group, Sherman, 21, had never been to Israel
and had only tenuous links to Jewish life back home, in Orlando,
Fla. Standing on the sun-drenched tarmac, he seemed expectant that
his 10-day visit would reconnect him to his Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will spark something inside me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's group was the first planeload of students brought here
as part of Birthright Israel, an ambitious effort to stem erosion
of Jewish communities abroad by bringing young Jews on free
educational visits to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to reach the Jewishly uninvolved, strengthening their
ties to Israel and Judaism, thus bolstering Jewish communities that
have been hard hit by intermarriage and a drifting away of their
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been nothing quite like this in Israel,'' said
Shimshon Shoshani, the chief executive officer of Birthright. ``We
will lose the Jewish people if we don't do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vast scope of the project, the first of its kind funded
by the Israeli government, in partnership with Jewish
philanthropists and communities abroad, has generated heated debate
about the allocation of Jewish resources. The ultimate goal is to
draw 50,000 young Jews a year to Israel, both high school and
college students.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Birthright's long-term impact is impossible to
assess, and that it would be better to spend the money on Jewish
day schools and social services in Israel than on giving free tours
to people who could well pay. The critics ask whether the students
are just coming for a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing vast sums of money to youngsters, including many
from affluent homes, for 10-day junkets without requiring any form
of commitment is demeaning to Israel,'' Isi Leibler, the chairman
of the board of the World Jewish Congress, wrote recently in The
Jerusalem Post. ``It is inconceivable that a 10-day trip can be the
jump-off point for creating newly committed Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers reply that they are seeking the uncommitted, and that
reaching them could transform the relationship between Israel and
the Jewish diaspora. They argue that Jewish communities could be
energized by the vastly increased numbers of young Jews who would
experience Israel and return home with a heightened awareness of
their Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of visitors expected through February, 6,000
college students are supposed to arrive from a dozen countries,
mostly the United States. The visitors typically heard about the
program on their campuses, and competed in a lottery for spots.
Many more high school students come in as first-time visitors.
``This would change the Jewish world,'' said Michael H. Steinhardt,
a former Wall Street financier and philanthropist from New York. He
initiated the project with Charles R. Bronfman, co-chairman of
Seagram Co. and a prominent contributor to Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by an idea first proposed several years ago by Yossi
Beilin, now the justice minister, Steinhardt said that his ideal
would be to provide ``every young Jew on the planet a free
educational trip to Israel as a birthright.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-Orthodox diaspora is in crisis, and we've reached the
point where the decline in numbers is critical,'' Steinhardt said.
``None of the efforts Jewish communities are making are reaching a
substantial portion of the young people, who are uninvolved and
remote from the community. We have to reinvent this connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle is a visit to Israel. According to current
estimates, more than 80 percent of the 1.2 million Jews who are 15
to 26 years old and living outside Israel have not visited the
country, and 65 percent of American Jews have not been to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Students visiting under the program go to some of Israel's most
evocative sites like the Western Wall, the ancient Jewish fortress
of Massada and the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, and have meetings
with Israeli students and discussions about Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences touched Gabriel Stern, 19, a Duke University
student from Long Island, N.Y., who described himself as an
atheist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always impressed upon me that I'm Jewish, but I
never really bought into it,'' he said. ``But after going to
Massada, seeing that my people were there 2,000 years ago, touching
the stone, it hits home. There's a passion here. People my age are
walking around with guns, defending their country, all with a
purpose. In Long Island, the biggest problem is what I'm going to
wear the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students said they were struck by the secular character of
a country they had always thought of in religious terms, and some
said they were intrigued enough to consider a return trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here and seeing the diversity of opinions raises more
questions,'' said Sari Altschuler, 20, of New York City, a student
at Swarthmore College. ``In Israel, you see hundreds of different
viewpoints of what it means to be Jewish. Does it mean religion,
ethnicity, or a culture?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the students have begun criss-crossing Israel, key
elements of Birthright have yet to fall into place, raising doubts
about its future.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish communities in the United States are still hesitant to
contribute money, worried that the project will draw funds and
people away from their own programs, including youth trips to
Israel for which participants pay.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 14 philanthropists that are supposed to help finance
the effort has yet to be completely assembled. And the Israeli
government, though it agreed to provide $70 million over five
years, has allocated only $8 million in its current budget,
according to Rabbi Michael Melchior, the Israeli minister of
diaspora affairs, who is a strong advocate of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Blumenthal, a member of the opposition Likud party, who
chairs the Israeli Parliament's committee on immigration and
diaspora affairs, said the government was throwing money at the
wrong people for the wrong purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that huge sums are being spent to bring young
people here for free, while children in poor Israeli towns can't
afford a class trip,'' Mrs. Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main goal of the project is not immigration to Israel but
strengthening Jewish communities abroad. That's not the thrust of
the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoshani, of Birthright, noted that many public buildings in
struggling Israeli towns were built with contributions from Jews
abroad, and he argued that a vibrant diaspora was a critical
support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the strategic assets of the state of Israel,'' he
said.

TOUGH TALK FROM BOTH SIDES MARKS ISRAELI-SYRIAN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying the Israeli-Syrian peace talks were ``hard
stuff,'' President Clinton presented leaders of both sides a
working document Friday to help them bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   While Syrian and Israeli sources called the document helpful,
they compared five days of talks so far in a conference center in
the Shepherdstown, W. Va., hills to two foes peering at a
chessboard, neither side moving key pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants Israel to declare first that it will retreat from
the Golan Heights, restoring the border to where it was on June 4,
1967, before Israel seized the high plateau. And Israel wants Syria
to say first what Israel will get in return, both in terms of
peaceful relations and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the pairs of Middle East peace negotiators, there is
no dynamic as cool and calculating as the Israeli-Syrian one, where
developing personal relations has almost no importance.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin spoke Friday of an
improving ``chemistry'' between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa after their second
meeting alone with President Clinton, but he quickly added, ``This
is not warm and fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his fourth visit to West Virginia in five days, Clinton
would only say the teams were ``working along, working along.''
Rubin suggested that Barak and Sharaa might return to their
respective homes early next week, leaving technical teams behind to
work on details. Clinton, he said, might return over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Early difficulties for Syria and Israel do not mean they cannot
strike a deal, but the opening round shows the going will be tough
and business-like.
</P>
<P>
   That's how one man wants it. He is Syrian President Hafez Assad
in Damascus, who gave Sharaa enough direction to consummate the
final steps of a deal, as long as it includes all of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a Syrian bluff,'' said Murhaf Jouejati, a Syrian
foreign policy analyst. ``There have been a series of crises in
West Virginia that are all related to the same point: the Syrians
insist on hearing a commitment from the Israelis that in the end
they will withdraw to the June 4 lines. And we want to make damn
sure that the Americans are witness to this, so it's not some
exercise in futility.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the discussions provides a glimpse into the future
difficulties of establishing a relationship after more than three
decades of war, regardless of whether Israel opens an embassy in
Damascus or Syria installs one in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is one of the world's most diplomatically isolated
countries, and Assad is one of the world's most isolated leaders,
having never traveled to the United States and rarely going abroad,
with the exception of Egypt. Since the early 1970s, he has
controlled a vast bureaucracy, and along the way he has shrunk the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to its skeletal state.
</P>
<P>
   The post of ambassador is vacant at about 40 Syrian embassies
around the world; Assad's apparent disdain for diplomacy is so
great that he even pulled out his longtime US ambassador, Walid
Moualim, on Dec. 22, just 11 days before the peace talks with
Israel began anew.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sharaa stopped recently in Cairo to talk with Eygptian
officials, a sign that he is looking elsewhere in the Arab world
for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Syria has learned something from Egypt and the
Palestinians . . . to hold back more, so they didn't have to come
forward too much in these talks,'' said Mohammed Wahby, a former
diplomat and now a columnist at the Egyptian newspaper Al-Mussawar.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on Syria, including Richard W. Murphy, the longtime
American diplomat who served as US ambassador to Syria from 1974 to
1977, believe that Assad gave one clear order to his negotiators:
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is where it was June 4, 1967,'' Murphy said. ``It
doesn't take too much creativity to say, `June 4, 1967, do you
understand me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   After earlier Israeli-Syrian talks, from late 1995 to March 1996
in eastern Maryland, all parties said the outlines of a deal were
either two-thirds or three-quarters complete. In 1995, secretary of
state Warren Christopher told Assad that Israel would withdraw to
the June 4 lines, but Israeli leaders later said that was only a
hypothetical position, contingent upon other parts of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, who was then head of the Israeli delegation, cited
progress in eight broad fields. Moualim, the just-recalled Syrian
ambassador who headed the Syrian side, generally agreed with Savir,
telling Helena Cobban, an author, that the two sides had completed
arrangements on a two-stage Israeli withdrawal from the Golan;
early-warning systems monitored by airplane and satellite; zones of
demilitarization and limited forces _ in all, nine of 15
``elements'' on the table for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Process: 1,100 Days That Changed the Middle
East,'' Savir said shifting from talking with the Palestinians to
negotiating with the Syrians took much adjustment for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, the negotiations were a more difficult
intellectual challenge than the talks with the Palestinians,
because we had to adjust to dealing with a mindset radically
different from our own,'' Savir wrote. ``. . .If the negotiations
with the Palestinians turned with time into a dance in which each
side tried to outdo his partner, . . . the negotiations with Syria
were like a complex, multilayered chess game in which the players
had to finish in a satisfactory draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Singer, the Israeli legal adviser to the Syrian talks and
now a Washington lawyer, also described it as a chess game. ``You
are calculating,'' he said in an interview. ``You can smile if it
fits your purposes, but it's not a spontaneous smile. With the
Syrians, either none are smiling, or all are smiling, depending on
their instructions. It's all part of the rules of the game that are
provided to them from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday night during the 1996 Israel-Syria talks, a Syrian
official flew to Damascus to brief Assad in person because the
Syrians did not trust the security of telephone lines, Cobban said.
At the beginning of each week, the official returned with new
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian and Israeli teams in West Virginia are largely made
up of the 1996 players, with the exception of Sharaa and Barak.
While Barak's presence ensures fast decision-making on the Israeli
side, there is still doubt about Sharaa's leeway, although it would
be greater than Moualim's in 1996, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian side includes three generals who sit on committees
dealing with security arrangements and borders; two former
ambassadors to the United States, Moualim and Rafiq Jouejati; four
water experts; and Assad's translator, Bouthaina Shaban, a
professor of literature who has written about feminism in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, the former Israeli legal adviser, said that regardless
of the personalities involved, ``the negotiations will be conducted
in a pressure cooker,'' and the Israelis shouldn't expect as much
as a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Palestinians, I was shocked when I first met with a
PLO representative in Oslo and he kissed me,'' Singer said.
``Generally, I'm not used to this man-kissing-man thing, and
specifically I'm not used to when it comes from a member of a
former terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But does this mean negotiations are easier with the
Palestinians than with the Syrians who will not shake hands with
Barak? Not necessarily. To get a deal you need to talk and talk and
talk. That's what it takes.''

GHOSTLY SIGHTINGS LEAVE PRISONERS, GUARDS ON EDGE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 9, 2000) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Sam Houston was new to the Walls Unit in
1985 and to the cell block known as the Old East Wing, but he had
heard stories about the strange assortment of convicts that faded
in and out of the place. Not long after his arrival, he met one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just come in from work about 11 that morning,'' he says.
``I was in my cell layin' down and a guy came by wearing a coat ...
a white coat like the inmates wear. But it was warm, too warm for a
coat. I thought it was Sam Hoover, the guy in the cell next to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled, `Hoover, what are you doing, having the chills?'
Then I thought, `Hoover don't walk that way.' I went over to the
door and looked through the bars and this guy was walking past
Hoover's cell and just disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, a 66-year-old lifer with a famous name and a string of
auto theft convictions, had no doubt he had seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people laughed at me, but I know I seen what I seen,''
says Houston, a trusty who was moved to the Walls Unit 15 years ago
to cook for the warden. He was so unnerved by the experience that
he arranged to be moved to another cell block.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone laughed. Similar sightings have been reported in
the prison for generations by inmates and guards alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some guards who won't come back here,'' says prison
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald, standing deep in the abandoned cell
block, near the solitary confinement box where outlaw John Wesley
Hardin once spent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The East Wing, built in 1848, was the original Texas prison and
was changed little over the years. Plaster eventually covered the
brick walls and a larger structure was built around it; otherwise,
it retained the grim texture of a frontier lockup, adjacent to the
present-day execution chamber.
</P>
<P>
   It was closed to inmate occupancy in 1990 and the 120 cells have
since been used for storage while the building awaits conversion to
a museum or is preserved for some other use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of history and a lot of sadness here,''
Fitzgerald says.
</P>
<P>
   Suicides were common during the nearly 140 years that the East
Wing was occupied. The most storied was that of Santana, a
marauding Kiowa chief, who flung himself off the third-story
catwalk rather than live behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the apparitions are believed by the inmates to be the
ghosts of convicts who died in the cell block.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one called Ax Man,'' Houston says of a spirit thought
to be that of a convicted murderer who decapitated his victim. ``A
lot of people have seen him. He walks around carrying a head in his
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners also tell stories of ghosts that hovered or walked
through walls as they move from nowhere to no place, of barber
chairs that spun mysteriously when no one was near them, of
footsteps on the stairs when all the inmates were locked down, of
moaning and wailing coming from empty corners and ashen men seen
sitting in cells that had been vacant for years.
</P>
<P>
   Houston never saw any ghosts there after the 1985 incident, but
as recently as four months ago he felt their presence. He went to
the cell block, escorted by a captain, to look for a mattress. The
captain waited at the entrance, while Houston went to the second
floor, where mattresses were stored in abandoned cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't go up there with me,'' Houston says of the
captain. ``I don't blame him. I'd never go in there if I didn't
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second level, Houston reached through the bars of a cell
door that was closed and padlocked and inspected the mattresses.
Not finding a suitable one, he moved on to the next cell and then
returned to the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped back over there and that door was open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost stories have persisted for so long that it is
difficult to dismiss them as the delusional babbling of stir-crazy
convicts. The guards tell similar tales.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Rod Kukua was introduced to the ghostly inhabitants shortly
after he began working at the Walls Unit 15 years ago. All the
inmates had been locked in their cells and Kukua was walking the
corridors counting heads, making certain that every prisoner was in
place.
</P>
<P>
   After counting rows on the first floor, he went up to the second
level and saw an inmate standing outside a cell, looking into it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; I was going to ask him what he was doing out there, so I
counted my way toward him. When I got to where he had been
standing, nobody was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukua went to the back of the cell block and circled back to
where he had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find him,'' he says. ``All the doors were locked,
so it couldn't have been one of our inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Bill Holmes, a 14-year veteran of the Walls Unit, was
working the graveyard shift in the East Wing several years ago.
Looking up from a table where he was doing paperwork, he saw
something, or someone, come out of the exterior wall and enter the
last cell at the far end of the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hairs on my neck raised up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He walked to the cell and asked the inmate if he had seen
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir, Mr. Holmes,'' the inmate said, ``he comes through
here every once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes requested, and was granted, a transfer to another area of
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had worked here and he told me a lot of stories
about this place,'' he said. ``In the early stages, I didn't want
to go in there.''
</P>
<P>
   One story his father had told him was about a night when he was
stationed in the guard tower at one end of the East Wing. The steel
trap door into the tower began jumping up and down, as though
someone were pounding it from below.
</P>
<P>
   ``There couldn't have been anyone there,'' Holmes says. ``For
anyone to get onto the stairs to the tower, my father would have
had to lower the key to them on a string. He had the only key and
he hadn't lowered it to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bother him that there are skeptics who scoff at such
tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer,'' he says.

RUSSIAN BOMBARDMENT OF GROZNY HALTED AMID ARMY SHAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In an apparent sign that Russia's campaign against
separatist rebels in Chechnya may be running into trouble, military
officials Friday announced a shakeup of its top combat generals and
called a temporary halt to the bombardment of Grozny, the breakaway
republic's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were the first sign of concern in Moscow about
the three-month-old military operation in Russia's restive Caucasus
region. For months, Kremlin and military officials have been
claiming that the war was going smoothly, and that Chechnya would
soon be under their control.
</P>
<P>
   The changes came as Russian forces remained bogged down on the
outskirts of Grozny, as they have been for weeks. Moscow had hoped
to capture the capital by New Year's, but its forces appear to have
been frustrated by the mobile and determined, albeit outnumbered,
Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said Lieutenant General Gennady Troshev,
commander of Russia's forces in eastern Chechnya, and Major General
Vladimir Shamanov, who heads federal troops on the western front,
were being replaced. Troshev was replaced by his deputy, Major
General Sergei Makarov, and Shamanov was succeeded by Major General
Alexei Verbitsky.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials insisted that such command reshuffles are
common and that the changes were not related to the performance of
the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The command changes were ``not the result of any professional
errors of the commanders, who are simply returning to their former
positions,'' said a Defense Ministry statement read on television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders also said they were scaling back air and
artillery strikes on Grozny, although details were sketchy and
statements on the matter contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grozny has today been officially declared a risk area, an
ecological danger zone. That chiefly affects civilians and
children,'' Troshev told NTV television from the Russian military
headquarters in Mozdok, outside Chechnya. ``Therefore the military
command decided to suspend operations _ suspend does not mean
discontinuing military actions. Military actions are being carried
out round the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   In other televised comments, Troshev said the assault on Grozny
would continue ``in areas where there are no civilians.'' The
Russian state news agency Itar-Tass said Troshev's comments
referred only to air and artillery bombardment of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russia claims that some 20,000 civilians remain trapped in
Grozny and are being used as human shields by the rebels. The
separatist fighters, however, say 40,000 civilians remain in the
capital and are unable to leave due to constant Russian
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Moscow also said the rebels have been blowing up
containers of toxic chemicals in Grozny. The Chechen fighters
denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Russian forces launched artillery attacks on the
town of Vedeno, a rebel stronghold in the mountains of southern
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin launched its military assault on Chechnya in late
September after a series of apartment bombings that killed hundreds
of people in Moscow and other Russian cities. Russian authorities
blamed Chechen rebels for the bombings, although the Chechens deny
involvement.

ARMY IS CHANGING ITS ADVERTISING AGENCY AND PROBABLY ITS SLOGAN

   WASHINGTON _ With recruiters struggling to fill its ranks and
public perceptions of its role apparently blurring, the Army plans
to overhaul its advertising and marketing campaign, ending its
contract with the advertising agency Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. after 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate and perceptible impact of the changes, which
the Army announced Friday, may be the demise of ``Be all that you
can be,'' the Army's slogan for two decades, but one that officials
said may no longer attract the prospective enlistees the Army
desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   ```Be all you can be' is a great slogan,'' P.T. Henry, the
assistant secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs,
said Friday. ``It is the trademark of the Army, known around the
world, and it has served the Army well. The question is, is it the
right slogan today to recruit young men and women for the Army of
the 21st Century?''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's announcement underscored the nagging difficulties
that all of the nation's armed services are having signing up new
recruits at a time when the economy is booming and more young
people than ever are finding college an attainable goal. Despite
higher bonuses and grants for tuition, the services' harried
recruiters have been scrambling, often unsuccessfully, in recent
years to meet their recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended last September, the Army fell
short of its goal of 74,500 recruits by 6,291, an 8 percent
shortfall, while the Air Force missed its goal 32,673 by 1,727, or
5 percent. A year before, the Navy fell short by 7,000 recruits or
12 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this fiscal year, the Air Force has
again fallen short. While the Army has reached its monthly
recruiting goals, officials worry that the service could fail to
reach the more ambitious annual goal of 80,000 new enlistees it
needs to maintain its current force of 480,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do anything,'' Henry said of the Army, ``we're not
going to make the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army did not formally dismiss Young &AMP; Rubicam, which took
over the service's advertising campaign in 1987. But in an unusual
move, the secretary of the army, Louis Caldera, decided to exercise
the Army's option not to renew the agency's contract when it
expires on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract, worth about $14 million a year, was
negotiated in 1997 and included four one-year options, renewable
each year. Had the Army continued its renewals, the contract would
have continued through 2002.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its announcement, which The Wall Street Journal first wrote
about on Friday, the Army said it would invite major advertising
agencies to bid for a new contract that would link payment to
measurable results in increasing enlistments. The Army hired a
consulting firm, Jones-Lundin Associates Inc. from Chicago, to help
in the search.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Army said it hoped Young &AMP; Rubicam would
compete for the new campaign, but officials at the agency sounded
irked by the Army's handling of the contract and its decision to
exercise its option seven months early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made a decision yet as to whether we'll take part
as the Army recompetes the contract,'' said Bill Kelly, managing
partner for the agency's U.S. Army Group, overseeing general
advertising, direct marketing and public affairs. ``We're not
balking at recompeting. That's a fact of life for a government
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We have real issues with the process and the
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Army has taken the most drastic step, all of the armed
services have begun to rethink their advertising and marketing
strategies in the wake of several years of recruiting difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, no longer content with public service television
announcements, the Air Force began paying for television
advertising for the first time, and so far has spent $29 million
this year to put them on the air, though officials say it is too
early to tell if those ads have helped boost enlistments. Last
fall, the Navy took the unusual step of mailing letters to 65,000
retired sailors and officers, asking them to consider rejoining.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's changes grew in part from a critical study completed
last fall for Secretary of Defense William Cohen by two prominent
political consultants, Carter D. Eskew, a Democrat, and Michael R.
Murphy, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In it, they criticized the services for failing to articulate
their mission and for spending advertising dollars inefficiently,
by broadcasting ads during national sports events, for example,
rather than targeting niche markets on syndicated or cable
programs. The consultants also recommended that the services
conduct better research into young people today in order to target
advertising to different audiences.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Army announced it was creating a marketing
division to do just that. It also plans to hire market-research
firms to devise ways to learn more about attitudes and tastes of
young people so that the Army's advertising budget, which has risen
from $85 million two years ago to $115 million today, is better
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said that officials now believed that people enlist for a
variety of reasons _ patriotism, college tuition, adventure _ while
the Army had a broad, blunt message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the case the Army has not maintained a
communication link with America,'' he said. ``We used to do that,
but we're not making the case as well as we used to.
</P>

AS EXPECTED, HEATING OIL PRICES SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What a difference a year has made for Massachusetts
householders who heat with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Last January's rock-bottom average heating-oil prices, between
75 and 80 cents a gallon, are but a memory. The state office that
monitors prices this week said the prices being charged by
full-service dealers across Massachusetts ranged from 94 cents to
$1.30 per gallon, averaging $1.12.
</P>
<P>
   That's up 30 to 35 percent on average, and perhaps as much as 50
percent if you were buying cheap in 1998-99 but got caught at the
high end of the scale this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Runups like these were predicted last fall in a federal agency
report that cited production quotas imposed by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries as the reason, and recalled that
warmer-than-average weather last year reduce the need for heating
oil and helped keep prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many consumers apparently were numbed by the smaller
bills they paid last winter and and spring and even as recently as
last October, and caught off guard by the upturn that crossed the
$1-dollar-a-gallon mark in November and kept on climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find some of my automatic-delivery customers aren't filling
up their tanks,'' Diane Silvia, manager at the Top Fuel Co. in
Woburn, said. ``They say, `Give me a hundred gallons,' hoping it is
going to go down. I say to them, `It's like going to Las Vegas.
It's a gamble.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Also, more of Silvia's customers are asking to pay with credit
cards this year. ``I do feel sorry for the elderly and for the
young kids,'' she said. Her cash-on-delivery customers this week
were paying 99.9 cents a gallon; those on automatic delivery plans
and those who get monthly bills were charged a dime more.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Condon, who manages the family-owned G. W. Condon Inc. oil
dealership in Randolph, says he's not getting complaints. He said
his $1.16-per-gallon price included a set operating margin that
doesn't vary no matter what wholesale prices are.
</P>
<P>
   But this price also reflected a nickel-a-gallon boost Condon and
other dealers saw from suppliers between Christmas and New Year's
Day. ``It was just before the millennium kicked in,'' said Pat
Murphy, manager at D.J. Cutter Oil in Dorchester. The price hike
apparently was based on expectations that consumers would demand
tank fill-ups in case Y2K computer failures stalled deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale price fell back when no problems occurred. But
Condon said it was no surprise that many dealers tried to make up
for last year's low revenues. ``It's been very mild for the last
few winters and you've got to make hay during hay season,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While dealers took abuse from customers, the underlying reason
they are charging more remained unchanged. OPEC, whose members
produce half the world's oil supply, agreed last March that it had
to tighten supplies to raise prices that fell during economic
downturns in Asia, Latin America, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with those regions recovering from their 1997 and 1998
troubles, ``demand is up and production is down, and as a
consequence, predictably, prices go up,'' said David O'Connor,
commissioner of the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The price shock was made more severe because it was hidden from
view during the summer, when demand for heating oil is almost nil.
Gasoline prices meanwhile were rising steadily, to a Massachusetts
average of $1.36 a gallon for unleaded regular at self-service
dealers in December, up 34 cents from February.
</P>
<P>
   According to US Energy Information Administration data, the
price of heating oil last winter was the lowest since 1979. The
agency, using a different statistical method than the state, said
Massachusetts consumers paid an average of 75.3 cents per gallon
last January.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that because last winter's low demand forced
distributors to carry over stocks until fall, this season's first
deliveries cost less than they might have, averaging 95 cents a
gallon in two state surveys made in October.
</P>
<P>
   The state survey is limited to 20 dealers, and excludes dealers
who give discounts for cash payment on delivery. It also excludes
consumer buying groups. One such group, the Boston Oil Consumers
Alliance, said its prices Friday were 94.5 cents per gallon for
cash on delivery and 98.9 cents per gallon for customers who wanted
30 days to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange and other
spot markets fell somewhat Wednesday and Friday on forecasts that
US and European weather may remain warm through January and reports
that some OPEC members increased production in December.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald B. Gold, a vice president at the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation in New York, said there is no sign of OPEC
members or other exporting nations that went along with the quotas,
including Mexico, are about to break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warmer weather has taken the edge off things, but it also has
taken the pressure off OPEC to open the taps a little bit wider,''
Gold said.

   GRIDLOCK-EMERGENCY (Los Angeles) -- Frustrated by delays in
improvements to the 101-405 freeway interchange, California
Assemblyman Tom McClintock said he will push to declare a state of
emergency becaus the level of congestion has hit 3,000 hours of
delay a day. McClintock, R-Granada Hills, said his will propose
legislation that would empower Gov. Gray Davis to speed work on the
interchange to solve ``emergency gridlock.'' McClintock, director
of policy for the Assembly Republicans and vice chairman of the
transportation committee, said problems at the 101-405 interchange
could be solved as quickly as were those along the Santa Monica
Freeway after the Northridge Earthquake. McClintock also said that
California has $4.7 billion in transportation money that is unused
and could be directed immediately to the junction. By Steve Carney

   GANG-SPIKE (Los Angeles) -- Federal agents have been called in
by the LAPD to help reverse a spike in gang violence, as reflected
by the recent gang-related shooting in San Fernando. The rise
continues a disturbing trend that began with the dissolution of the
gang truce in 1999. Violent gang crimes are on the increase
citywide and valleywide -- with a 3.3 percent increase in 1999 over
1998 citywide and 25 percent valleywide. In an attempt to avoid
more serious crimes, the city of San Fernando will devote an
officer to the schools. And the LAPD is revamping its approach to
gangs in the Valley, with better communication amongst divisions
and doing more undercover operations with federal task forces. By

   WORKERS-COMP (Los Angeles) -- Workers comp rates are

they do business because in the last few years they were
underpricing the rates to increase market share. Checking to see if
new laws also impacted industry. By Dereck Andrade (Will move on

   In This Market, It Seems, No Index Is an Island &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ 100-stock index, on fire last year, cooled
considerably in the first week of 2000. But investors in funds that
mimic the performance of other major market indexes may not be
immune to the effects of a NASDAQ crunch.
</P>
<P>
   That is because many of the stocks that pushed NASDAQ to its
record 84.5 percent gain last year are also big contributors to the
moves in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the Russell 1000 and the
Russell 1000 Growth indexes. Douglas Cote, a portfolio manager at
the Aeltus Investment Management unit of Aetna Inc. in Hartford,
points out that those disparate indexes have 36 stocks in common,
including Qualcomm, Intel, Yahoo and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   That overlap helps explain how those stocks climbed so far so
fast. Given that so many investors use the S&AMP;P 500 and the Russell
indexes as the benchmarks for judging their fund managers'
performance, the managers must own the stocks that are propelling
those indexes. Cote observes that money managers, therefore, are
stumbling over themselves to own the same 36 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Such universal interest has a fun result on the upside. But if
the shares keep drifting down, the managers are likely to be
stumbling over themselves to sell. &QL;

   You might think Mitsubishi Motors would avoid the word ``zero''
in an American ad campaign, considering that the Mitsubishi Zero
fighter terrorized the skies during World War II. But since July,
the automaker (which no longer has ties to the plane's maker,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) has been offering ``zero zero zero
till '00'' _ zero down, zero interest, zero payments until the new
year _ an offer it has extended until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi wasn't oblivious to the volatile verbal juxtaposition
but decided that it wasn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some informal research,'' said Peg Dilworth-Hunt,
director of marketing for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, ``and
it didn't seem to be a concern among people we were targeting.''
The age of that group? Up to about 54, she said. Precisely those
born since the war's end. &QL;

ANALYSIS: RULES PUT ACCOUNTING FIRMS ON THE DEFENSIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1931, the American Institute of Accountants heard a plea from
its immediate past president that it adopt a rule to require that
auditors not be officers or directors of the companies whose books
they were certifying. It was needed, he said, to preserve public
confidence in the integrity of financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal did not get a warm reception. ``We have too many
rules already,'' one accountant complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the spirit of the resolution, but I think it is
far too broad and sweeping,'' another said. ``It is dangerous
because it would prevent, or tend to prevent, a perfectly proper
relationship that might come under it ethically.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the proposal was shelved. ``The profession,'' wrote
John L. Carey, in his book, ``The Rise of the Accounting
Profession,'' ``had missed a chance to take a forward step
voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the first rules on that question were imposed in
1933 by the Federal Trade Commission, which administered the first
federal securities law until the Securities and Exchange Commission
was created in 1934. That rule barred auditors from investing in
companies that they audited, as well as barring them from being
officers or directors of those companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules have continued in force for nearly seven decades,
required by both the SEC and the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the successor to the American Institute of
Accountants. Details have been added, but the principle has never
changed.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that many in the accounting profession have agreed
with the 1931 accountant who thought there were ``too many rules
already.'' While some have pushed for rules changes, others seem to
have concluded that the existing rules were more in the way of
suggestions than requirements. The regulators made the rules, and
the accountants promised to obey them, but no one seems to have
checked to be sure that was happening.
</P>
<P>
   At the world's largest accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
a report released by the SEC on Thursday concluded that the vast
majority of partners had violated the rules. Partners pleaded that
the rules were too complicated and said they had not understood
them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the SEC and the Public Oversight Board gear up to
inspect other accounting firms _ with the expectation that the
results are likely to be similar _ the accounting profession is on
the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has a right to expect the profession to adhere to the
rules,'' said Barry Melancon, the president of the accountants'
institute. But, he added, ``the profession has a right to expect
the regulatory environment to remain modern.''
</P>
<P>
   To some in the profession, the old rules are a handicap because
they have failed to keep up with changes in two areas _ the
expansion of the accounting firms and the growth of two-earner
families.
</P>
<P>
   The current rules say that partners in the firms _ whether they
are audit partners, or tax partners, or management consulting
partners _ are covered by rules barring them from having most types
of financial interests in companies that are being audited. A
management consulting partner based in San Diego may have nothing
at all to do with the audit of a company based in Bangor, Me., but
it is a violation if she, her husband or her minor children have a
stake in that company.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund rules also seem to have led to many violations.
It is acceptable to own shares in a mutual fund, even if that fund
owns shares in an audit client, but it is not acceptable for a
partner to own shares in a mutual fund if the accounting firm is
the auditor for that fund or for its investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to modify some of those rules. The
Independence Standards Board, an organization that monitors auditor
independence and has the authority to make changes in the rules,
subject to SEC approval, has proposed new rules on mutual fund
investments _ opening them up to all but people directly involved
in the audits of the fund companies _ and is seeking opinions on
changes regarding the way rules affect the employment of spouses.
Melancon of the institute is a member of that board, as is James J.
Schiro, the chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a rapid growth in the services, most notably
management consulting, that are provided by accounting firms. As an
accounting firm does more and more business with a company, is
there a risk that an auditor, faced with a tough decision on an
accounting issue, will be influenced by the chance the firm will
lose the other business?
</P>
<P>
   The most important issue for the accounting profession,
particularly the Big Five that audit most large public companies,
should be the preservation of a reputation that investors are
willing to rely on.
</P>
<P>
   That reputation is coming under attack again, particularly with
the disclosure that most of the senior executives of
PricewaterhouseCoopers had violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-interest has replaced much of the profession's fidelity
to the public trust,'' wrote Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., in a
letter to the SEC on Friday, inquiring what the SEC was doing to
``clean up this mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Few investors seem to share Dingell's suspicions. But that could
change. The establishment of accounting independence rules in the
1930s came after the stock market had collapsed, when many
investors were looking for someone to blame for their losses.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a new millennium. Is it also a new stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the first week of trading, 2000 looks little like
the last half of 1999. The biggest about-face came in the NASDAQ
composite index, which rose 39 percent in the last two months of
last year. The composite ended the week down 4.59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One week's trading does not make a trend, of course, and the
NASDAQ paddled furiously upstream on Friday. But several of last
week's developments, taken together, may presage a market shift.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened to shares in Lucent Technologies when the
company announced flat sales and a profit decline in its first
quarter. Investors who had been happy to pay 65 times trailing
earnings for the company couldn't sell fast enough. By the end of
the week, the shares were down 25.7 percent, wiping out some $59
billion in investor wealth. Lucent closed at $53.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the news that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had sued the Internet's best-known stock guru, accusing
him of fraud. The SEC said Yun Soo Oh Park, aka Tokyo Joe, enriched
himself at the expense of his subscribers. When he urged his nearly
4,000 disciples to buy certain stocks, he was often selling shares
in the same stocks at a tidy profit for himself, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Activities of Tokyo Joe may seem unrelated to the future
performance of the market over all. But his actions and those of
other Web stockjockeys have been responsible for some of the wilder
rides in NASDAQ stocks of late. If the SEC's suit has a chilling
effect in the Internet chat rooms _ which seems likely _ that could
reduce some of the volatility in the NASDAQ stocks that Web traders
like to duck in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert mutual
fund and an investor who likes to take a sharp pencil to company
financial statements, believes that the market is indeed at a
turning point. He thinks that investors, burned by companies whose
shares plunge a la Lucent, will start to exit sexy stocks with
excessive valuations _ and rediscover undervalued shares of
companies with venerable, if boring, businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of great companies in the nifty 50,'' he said.
``But the valuations are going to be looked at in a different
light.''
</P>
<P>
   If investors are at an inflection point, the new world may take
some getting used to. Stocks with no earnings will no longer
outperform those with solid earnings. Investors who buy stocks
based on gossip will no longer run circles around those who study
financial statements and invest based on sound business trends. The
something-for-nothing stock market will go the way of all good
things.
</P>
<P>
   Olstein may be a bit early in his call of a market sea change.
He was also early when he warned last April that Lucent was not
growing as fast as its earnings seemed to indicate. Most of the
growth in Lucent's earnings, he maintained, had come from
accounting cleverness rather than from an improving business; at
the time, the stock was trading at around $64.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent lovers scoffed. They are not scoffing now.

   Freedom of Speech, But Freedom of Chat? &QL;

<P>

</P>
<P>
   It seems some speech is freer than others.
</P>
<P>
   Yun Soo Oh Park, better known as Tokyo Joe, and his lawyer, Ira
Lee Sorkin, are likely to mount a free-speech defense in the first
case the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought against an
Internet stock-picking celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the SEC said Park lied about his past returns,
secretly accepted a company's shares in exchange for recommending
its stock and regularly sold shares he owned at the same time that
he was urging his subscribers, roughly 4,000, to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin suggested that his client was simply exercising his First
Amendment right to free speech in his investing chat room.
</P>
<P>
   But after news of the case hit Tokyo Joe's Web site on
Wednesday, the chat room's operators sent a message instructing
participants to limit discussions to stocks; anyone who tried to
discuss the case, was ousted from the room, a participant said.

   The sirens of Silicon Valley have called again. Gerri E.
Detweiler, a longtime consumer advocate, is the co-founder of a new
dot-com, Money for Mail, which pays consumers to read e-mail
advertisements directed to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Detweiler was quick to describe her company as a
``pro-consumer organization,'' because consumers are being paid per
advertisement read to volunteer information about themselves. She
has joined with Larry Chiang, founder of United College Marketing
Services, which markets credit cards to college students.
</P>
<P>
   Money for Mail keeps individual data private _ a pledge that Ms.
Detweiler says she is working hard to make credible _ but provides
information to companies in bulk form, to help focus their
advertising. ``Our main goal is to show consumers, by paying them,
that their information is worth something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years with nonprofit organizations like the National
Council of Individual Investors, Ms. Detweiler says she is prepared
for the for-profit world. She will help persuade investors to buy
stock in the company if it goes public.

   The Wrong Number on Lucent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Lucent Technologies stunned investors Thursday night by
announcing that first-quarter profits would fall far short of
expectations _ 36 to 39 cents a share, versus forecasts of 54 cents
_ no one, except perhaps the chairman, Richard McGinn, could have
been more disappointed than Steven Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Levy, a highly regarded analyst for Lehman Brothers,
repeatedly raised concerns. Even after Lucent's shares rose
strongly in October on better-than-expected earnings, he said
management was promising faster growth than it could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 8, with Lucent at $67.50, Levy changed his tune.
In a report entitled ``Risks Abate ... a Buy We Now Rate!'' he
raised his rating from neutral and predicted that Lucent would hit
$90 within a year. Last Thursday morning, Levy raised his target to
$95, citing his ``bullish outlook'' for telecommunications
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said Lucent management convinced him in November that the
business and balance sheet were improving. But Thursday's
announcement evidently showed him the limits of skillful accounting
and explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only were they going to stretch a lot,'' in reporting
their results, he said, ``but they couldn't get where they were
going.'' On Friday, Lucent closed at $53.9375, still off 28 percent
since Dec. 31. &QL;

   Attention all seekers of doctorates or MBAs: Don't send your
applications to Gabelli University just yet. Yes, there is a
Gabelli University Press. It is the publisher of ``Deals, Deals and
More Deals,'' a risk-arbitrage guide just out. And there is a
Gabelli (as in Mario, the money manager). But a Gabelli University?
``I don't think you'll get a PhD there,'' said Regina M. Pitaro, a
managing director of Gabelli Asset Management and author of the
risk arbitrage book. ``I don't think Columbia has anything to worry
about'' _ Columbia being where Gabelli earned his own MBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Gabelli University Press can get along without bricks,
mortar or ivy, Gabelli said, because his firm does a lot of
research and wants to share its efforts. ``The notion of doing
things a la the Gabelli University is not inconsistent with our
whole persona,'' he said, adding, ``we may have overreached in
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon, in the university press tradition of issuing books
unlikely to result in brisk bidding for movie rights: a guide to
convertible bonds.

MAKING STOCK CARS FAMILY FARE 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lesa France Kennedy started at the bottom of her family
business, literally. As a child growing up, one of her duties was
to help wipe down the seats at the Daytona International Speedway
before races so that the customers wouldn't get dirt on their
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great proving ground for a young motor sports executive
whosow entails overseeing all aspects of entertainment for
the 11 tracks that are a part of the International Speedway Corp.,
based in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy, 38, is the daughter of Bill France Jr., president
of NASCAR and chairman of International Speedway, and the
granddaughter of Bill France Sr., NASCAR's founder. Her brother,
Brian France, is senior vice president of NASCAR, the privately
held business that governs stock car racing. Her upbringing
included learning to drive on the straightaways of Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   As executive vice president and a member of the board of
International Speedway, Mrs. Kennedy is second only to her uncle,
James France, president of the company. That makes Mrs. Kennedy not
only heir apparent but also one of the highest-ranking women in an
industry that has long been dominated by men. In the high-octane,
high testosterone world of motor sports, Mrs. Kennedy is in the
fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely bright, has incredible street smarts and her
people skills are outstanding,'' said Jim Hunter, president of
Darlington Raceway in Darlington, S.C., one of the 11 tracks owned
by International Speedway. ``She's definitely opening doors for
women in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also helping the sport overcome its raffish regional
roots to become viewed as wholesome family entertainment for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Kennedy plays down her role as a pace-setter for women
in racing. ``It's not my focus,'' she said. ``I don't spend a lot
of time thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides working with her company's existing tracks, Mrs. Kennedy
is trying to develop tracks in the Kansas City, Chicago and New
York areas.
</P>
<P>
   Stock-car racing has been growing rapidly, and NASCAR has just
negotiated a five-year, $2-billion television package.
International Speedway bought seven tracks from Roger Penske in
July and added the Richmond International Raceway in December,
making the company, which is publicly traded, the largest motor
sports operator in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were the boldest since International Speedway was
founded by Bill France Sr., in 1953, five years after he
incorporated NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Mrs. Kennedy's parentage furthered her career, it was
also a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her biggest challenge has been trying to satisfy her father,''
said Hunter, who has worked for the France family for 30 years.
``Anything less than terrific is just not acceptable to him. I
think that has made it tougher for her than it would for any other
woman or man.'' France Jr., he said, has given his children ``every
opportunity to get out of the business, because he's made them
understand it from the restrooms up.''
</P>
<P>
   That extensive knowledge of the racing business and her
attention to detail have won Mrs. Kennedy credibility among her
male counterparts. Nobody doubts her seriousness, but she can also
poke fun at her family and herself.
</P>
<P>
   Over a recent breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria a few days before
the annual NASCAR awards banquet, Susan Schandel, her chief
financial officer, joked that running into Mrs. Kennedy in the
lobby could mean another chore rather than being able to go
shopping. Mrs. Kennedy agreed but then reminded her that at times
they both slipped away for some shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy will need all her wit and charm to keep other track
owners happy. Drivers say NASCAR has already scheduled as many
races as they can handle, but the other track owners want more
races.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy said that other women in her family had schooled
her in NASCAR's macho, demanding world. Her grandmother, Annie B.
France, who operated the ticket office at Daytona International
Speedway for many years, encouraged her to pursue a career in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks from Duke University, where she graduated in 1983
with bachelor of arts degrees in economics and psychology, Mrs.
Kennedy worked in the Daytona ticket office and in the complaint
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great training experience, because you were directly in
touch with the fans,'' Mrs. Kennedy said. ``You can't replace that
with research. It was problem resolution at the source. You could
hear their ideas and what they wanted from the sport. People would
come in and say, `We want to buy a T-shirt. Where's the gift shop?'
We don't have one. Build one and sell the merchandise. It's not
quite rocket science, but if you listen to the customers you can't
go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Mrs. Kennedy came up with the idea for Daytona
USA, a $20 million, 50,000-square-foot, year-round entertainment
complex at the racing track. Over the years, she pulled together
projections on construction costs, researched the market and
finally convinced her father, her uncle and other senior executives
that it was worth the risk. It opened in 1996 and attracts about
500,000 fans a year.
</P>
<P>
   As assistant manager of the Daytona Speedway ticket office after
she graduated, she also pushed to computerize ticket sales at
Daytona. ``That didn't fall easily on dinosaurs like myself,'' said
Hunter, who at the time was a vice president in marketing at
NASCAR. ``Convincing us was no easy task, because we had always
done things the same way for years. The big question was: Why
should we change if it works? Her answers were: Because it's cost
effective, it's fast, it's efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   After working in the ticket office, Mrs. Kennedy moved over to
International Speedway in 1986 and worked in jobs throughout the
company, serving as secretary and treasurer before becoming
executive vice president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy is married to Dr. Bruce Kennedy, a plastic surgeon,
and has an 8-year-old son, Benjamin. She said it's too early to
tell whether Benjamin is destined for the family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more of a sports fan,'' she said. ``He's only in the
second grade. But he does have several computer racing games.''

PAKISTAN SAYS CHARGES THAT IT WAS BEHIND HIJACKING ARE BASELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A day after India accused Pakistan of
sponsoring the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet, Pakistani
officials said Friday that the charges were baseless and that India
was making them in an attempt to persuade other nations to declare
Pakistan a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing statements made by the military ruler of Pakistan, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, one of the general's close advisers said he and
the general believed that it was possible that India had engineered
the hijacking in an effort to malign Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of absurd objective would Pakistan achieve by
supporting such an incident?'' asked the adviser, Javed Jabbar, who
is also a close friend of Musharraf. ``Are we bereft of reason? Why
would we give something to India that they could use to distort
Pakistan's image, disinform the world about what we are as a people
and demonize us?''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, India and Pakistan have been
fighting over Kashmir, a territory that lies between them. And the
hijacking has turned into another bitter and spectacular episode in
that conflict, one that has brought out the extraordinary levels of
distrust between the countries created from the British Indian
empire in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the hijacking would seem to have been carried out
by militants who are fighting against predominantly Hindu India's
rule of mostly Muslim Kashmir. The hijackers sought and won the
release of three anti-India militants in exchange for freeing more
than 150 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the bloody dispute over Kashmir, little is
as it seems. Over the years, the intelligence agencies of both
India and Pakistan have accumulated daunting powers, and each
country routinely accuses the other of being behind acts of
violence in Kashmir, as well as in India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last week, a bomb blew up in a vegetable market in
Srinagar, the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir, killing more than a dozen people. In Hyderabad, Pakistan,
a bomb exploded in a crowded marketplace, wounding 18 people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people have died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But the hijacking, a single dramatic event, has grabbed the
world's attention in a way that the everyday death and destruction
have not. Other countries have watched in dismay as these two
nuclear-armed nations have gone at each other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India said
Pakistan had backed the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Musharraf said, ``At the outset, I had a suspicion
that the hijacking could be a big drama, and the statement of the
Indian prime minister confirms that India had staged this drama to
give Pakistan a bad name.''
</P>
<P>
   India said on Thursday that it had the smoking gun to prove
Pakistan's role. Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani said that
authorities had seized four agents of the Pakistani military
intelligence agency in Bombay. Advani also said that the four men
had identified the five hijackers as Pakistanis and had admitted
that Pakistan was behind the whole episode.
</P>
<P>
   But Jabbar said he believed that India's evidence might be
fabricated and raised questions for India to answer. He asked how
grenades and guns got onto an aircraft of India's national carrier,
which was hijacked when it left the airport in Katmandu, Nepal, on
Dec. 24 with 178 passengers and 11 crew members on board. He wanted
to know why the Indian government allowed the plane to take off for
Pakistan after it had stopped in Amritsar, India. And he asked why
the Indians had made a deal with the hijackers and had not insisted
that they first take off their masks and identify themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbar also said Pakistan had initially refused to allow the
plane to land in Lahore and relented only after the plane,
dangerously low on fuel, nearly crashed.
</P>
<P>
   That account was confirmed by the commander of the plane, Capt.
Devi Sharan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want that flight in our territory,'' Jabbar said.
``Who would want it?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry also enumerated
for reporters in Islamabad what he described as unbelievable Indian
assertions. He said that it was not credible that the Pakistani
embassy in Katmandu would use one of its own cars and that ``three
officials'' would publicly proceed to the departure lounge before
the plane had departed if they were connected with the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman was also skeptical that India had managed to
obtain photographs of the hijackers from their reported
accomplices. ``It is curious,'' the spokesman said, ``that the
hijackers, who were not seen throughout the hijacking drama, would
have left their passport-size photographs with the accomplices to
be handed over the Indians on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jabbar had no apologies for Pakistan's decision to allow a
released militant, Masood Azhar, to return to Pakistan and openly
inflame passions for the fight in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar, a Pakistani leader of the Harkat ul-Ansar, a Kashmiri
nationalist group that the United States considers a terrorist
organization, had been imprisoned in India since 1994. He was never
convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indian commentators have said that if Pakistan was serious
about helping India find the hijackers, who may well be in
Pakistan, its authorities would have questioned Azhar.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbar disagreed. He said India had violated ``all norms of law
and justice'' by imprisoning Azhar for six years without finding
him guilty of a crime in a court of law. ``They have not been able
to convict and sentence him,'' Jabbar said. ``What are we supposed
to do? He has not committed any crime on Pakistani territory.''

 &HT;    MIAMI CALM(ER), ATTORNEYS FOR FAMILY FILE PETITION FOR CUSTODY
OF CUBAN BOY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As the city's streets settled into an uneasy calm, the
battle over six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez moved to court
Friday with the boy's Miami relatives hoping to overturn a decision
by federal immigration officials to send him back to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile case also drew attention in Washington, where
Cuban-American members of Congress discussed strategies for keeping
the boy here through legislative action, even as President Clinton
confirmed his support for the decision that Elian should go back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said of officials
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who ruled the boy
belongs with his father. ``This is a volatile and difficult case.
... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the biggest news for many residents was the absence of
a new round of protests like the ones that hampered traffic around
the city on Thursday. Police arrested more than 100 people in those
demonstrations, which temporarily blocked the street entrance to
the Port of Miami and triggered some bloody scuffles between
officers and protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exile leaders had called for people all over Miami-Dade
County to drive at 15 mph Friday to tie up traffic. By late in the
day, however, there were only a couple of reports of such actions,
which police quickly quelled by pulling over and arresting the
slow-moving drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, activists called for a day-long slowdown Monday at
Miami International Airport, hoping to win more media attention for
their cause. Airport officials said they would be ready with teams
of police and tow trucks to stop any attempts to block traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let the airport be shut down,'' said the airport's
director, Carlos Alvarez. ``We will take whatever steps are
necessary to keep the airport open.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration
officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed. The boy, who survived
a boat capsizing that killed his mother and nine others on
Thanksgiving Day, played with a puppy outside the Little Havana
home of his relatives Friday, seemingly oblivious to the horde of
media camped out on a nearby street.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, residents of his hometown, Cardenas, held a massive
rally, decrying U.S. imperialism and the delays in Elian's return.
His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appeared, saying he has no plans
to travel to Miami, as his relatives here have requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply appreciate all the people all over the world who have
come together to condemn the psychological torture we're being put
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a
county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
asking for temporary custody of the boy. If the court grants the
petition, Gonzales plans to request a federal asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have given the strategy little hope, saying the
decision to send the boy back to his father is firmly grounded in
both U.S. and international law.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the impact of possible congressional action
on the case might be. Cuban-American representatives from South
Florida asked House Government Reform and Oversight Committee
Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., to issue a subpoena requiring the boy
to testify before his committee, a move that would bar Elian from
leaving this country.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he would seriously consider the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he will continue to
push for an act of Congress that would declare the boy a U.S.
citizen, thereby changing his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   With events moving forward on several fronts, it appears the
battle over the boy is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his father spoke in Cuba, thanking Fidel Castro for his
support, Elian's Miami relatives claimed in court papers that going
back to Cuba would amount to psychological abuse for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has repeatedly stated that he does not want to return to
Cuba,'' their petition stated.
</P>

   MIAMI _ As the city's streets settled into an uneasy calm, the
battle over six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez moved to court
Friday with the boy's Miami relatives hoping to overturn a decision
by federal immigration officials to send him back to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile case also drew attention in Washington, where
Cuban-American members of Congress discussed strategies for keeping
the boy here through legislative action, even as President Clinton
confirmed his support for the decision that Elian should go back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said of officials
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who ruled the boy
belongs with his father. ``This is a volatile and difficult case.
... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the biggest news for many residents was the absence of
a new round of protests like the ones that hampered traffic around
the city on Thursday. Police arrested more than 100 people in those
demonstrations, which temporarily blocked the street entrance to
the Port of Miami and triggered some bloody scuffles between
officers and protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exile leaders had called for people all over Miami-Dade
County to drive at 15 mph Friday to tie up traffic. By late in the
day, however, there were only a couple of reports of such actions,
which police quickly quelled by pulling over and arresting the
slow-moving drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, activists called for a day-long slowdown Monday at
Miami International Airport, hoping to win more media attention for
their cause. Airport officials said they would be ready with teams
of police and tow trucks to stop any attempts to block traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let the airport be shut down,'' said the airport's
director, Carlos Alvarez. ``We will take whatever steps are
necessary to keep the airport open.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration
officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed. The boy, who survived
a boat capsizing that killed his mother and nine others on
Thanksgiving Day, played with a puppy outside the Little Havana
home of his relatives Friday, seemingly oblivious to the horde of
media camped out on a nearby street.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, residents of his hometown, Cardenas, held a massive
rally, decrying U.S. imperialism and the delays in Elian's return.
His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appeared, saying he has no plans
to travel to Miami, as his relatives here have requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply appreciate all the people all over the world who have
come together to condemn the psychological torture we're being put
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a
county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
asking for temporary custody of the boy. If the court grants the
petition, Gonzales plans to request a federal asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have given the strategy little hope, saying the
decision to send the boy back to his father is firmly grounded in
both U.S. and international law.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the impact of possible congressional action
on the case might be. Cuban-American representatives from South
Florida asked House Government Reform and Oversight Committee
Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., to issue a subpoena requiring the boy
to testify before his committee, a move that would bar Elian from
leaving this country.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he would seriously consider the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he will continue to
push for an act of Congress that would declare the boy a U.S.
citizen, thereby changing his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   With events moving forward on several fronts, it appears the
battle over the boy is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his father spoke in Cuba, thanking Fidel Castro for his
support, Elian's Miami relatives claimed in court papers that going
back to Cuba would amount to psychological abuse for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has repeatedly stated that he does not want to return to
Cuba,'' their petition stated.

 &HT;    Mosque's leader chants entire Koran from memory
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Before Imam Dr. Zafar Ali Anjum was a
Muslim cleric or a Ph.D. in Arabic literature or the leader of the
largest mosque in Palm Beach County _ before, in fact, he was even
an adult _ he was just Zafar, a 7-year-old son faced with a
daunting task: Memorize the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Anjum was as prepared as any boy that age could be. Growing up
near New Delhi, India, the son of one of the area's most renowned
Islamic scholars, he had studied Arabic _ along with his native
language of Urdu _ since he was 4. But still, the task was
daunting. His older brother had not been able to memorize the whole
sacred book of Islam, nor had anyone else he knew.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason: The Koran is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Between the words ``All praises are due to Allah'' and ``We
always seek refuge in Allah'' are about 1,000 pages of text and
more than 6,000 footnotes. Within those lines are everything a
Muslim man or woman needs to know to live a well-informed and holy
life, according to tradition. There is the story of creation, the
history of Noah, David, Solomon, Ishmael, Isaac, Joseph and Jesus.
There is criminal and civil law, morals, manners and philosophy, as
well as instructions for the proper way to worship, dress and eat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Koran tells a Muslim how long a child should be
breast-fed (two years) and how and where to hit an enemy in a fight
(mightily, and in the neck). It contains the four types of liquids
the rivers in heaven run with (water, milk, honey and wine that
doesn't cause hangovers) and the maximum number of times a man can
divorce and remarry the same woman (twice).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I memorized two or three lines a day,'' Anjum
said this week at the mosque he now leads on Purdy Lane in West
Palm Beach. ``It's very hard because the mind isn't used to it, but
as I did it more and more I started to take half a page a day and
then a page a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when he was 10 years old, he finished. And
this month that Herculean feat was put to the test for the 19th
year in a row as Anjum chanted the entire Koran from memory over
the course of the 30 nights of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Each
recitation lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes and took place
in front of about 300 Muslims. Congregants stood shoulder to
shoulder, kneeling and bowing in unison and listening to Anjum
chant in a haunting, melodic rhythm that has been handed down,
Muslims believe, since Allah spoke to his prophet Mohammed 1400
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to Muslim belief, the Koran was dictated to Mohammed
by Allah over the course of several years. Because Mohammed
couldn't write, he memorized the words Allah spoke to him and then
recited them to followers who wrote them down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason imams memorize the Koran today is as a kind of
insurance, Anjum said. In case there is ever an uprising against
Muslims and every Koran in the world is destroyed, the word of
Allah will be preserved in memory. Every Muslim boy _ and some
Muslim girls _ are asked to memorize at least a portion of the
Koran. Anjum estimated that perhaps one in 10,000 successfully
memorizes the entire book. And though imams are not required to
memorize it, most have.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his memory sharp, Anjum said he studies the Koran for
about a half-hour a day throughout the year and two to three hours
a day during the month of Ramadan, which, depending on the moon,
will likely end this evening.
</P>
<P>
   When Anjum was a boy and he finished the memorization, his
grandfather threw a party to celebrate the achievement and invited
500 people. The imam, now 34, remembers the lamb curry and sugar
pudding and his grandfather's praise. He never doubted he would
become an imam after that day.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment was not only his, it was also his family's:
It is written that the parents of a child who memorizes the Koran
will be treated especially well in heaven. So Anjum is keeping a
watchful eye on his son, Sabeeh, now 11 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try my best to start with him as soon as possible,''
Anjum said. ``As soon as I see that his mind is developing he will
begin to learn.''

 &HT;    Consensus in mental health field: Rocker not mentally ill
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do making racist remarks and tossing around bigoted
opinions like wild pitches mean Braves reliever John Rocker is off
his rocker?
</P>
<P>
   Whether racism is a mental disorder had been pondered by experts
long before people began scratching their heads about Major League
Baseball's order that Rocker undergo psychological evaluation for
his slurs against blacks, gays, foreigners and women in the Dec. 27
issue of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Braves president Stan Kasten said Friday that what baseball
commissioner Bud Selig mandated for Rocker on Thursday ``isn't
exactly'' a mental-health check. ``The medical professionals
involved may be psychologists,'' Kasten said, ``but they're really
there to sit down and evaluate and suggest what the next step
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commissioner's order has been widely interpreted as a
attempt to find out whether Rocker's behavior is rooted in a
psychological problem. The consensus in the mental health field is
that racism is not a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Keith Woods, a psychologist and director of the mental
health center at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, says there are
so many variations of prejudice among people that finding a
psychological label to fit them all might be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many forms of racism and sexism and other `isms'
that typically aren't defined as mental disorders,'' Woods said.
``They are defined as issues we all have that we try to deal with.
But it's like gambling or other things. When it becomes excessive,
it becomes a disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mental disorders have symptoms that might cause people to
say racist things, Woods said _ such as Tourette's Syndrome, which
can cause sufferers to utter profanities and racial slurs
involuntarily. ``These are disorders,'' Woods said, ``where people
say things without the editing that most of us go through.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that he does not think Rocker is so afflicted.
``My assumption,'' Woods said, ``is that (the evaluation) is buying
time. They just want to put off having to do something about his
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sabina Widner, a clinical psychologist who teaches at
Augusta State University, sees something much more sinister in
what's being done to Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear these types of things, I think about Russia,'' she
said, ``where people who are dissidents, people who don't hold
majority views, are subjected to psychiatric treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a clinical professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School, is one of the few voices advocating that
racism be declared a mental illness. But he would limit the
diagnosis to ``extreme'' or ``delusional racism.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rocker has done doesn't fit that definition, but it's
``right on the edge,'' Poussaint said. ``Now, if he were to walk
into the clubhouse and punch a black teammate simply because he was
black, then I'd say he has a mental disorder.''

BUSH TRIES TO CLARIFY VOW ON TAXES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.H. _ As Republican front-runner George W. Bush
equivocated Friday on whether he had pledged not to raise taxes if
elected president, rival Steve Forbes launched a new television
commercial in New Hampshire accusing Bush of breaking an anti-tax
pledge as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking at a Rochester, N.H., news conference, described
the new ad as a ``negative'' attack by a candidate who knows the
``political clock is ticking.'' The first-in-the-nation New
Hampshire primary is Feb. 1, and Forbes is trailing in public
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's other problem Friday was his effort to convince
reporters they had heard what he said but not what he meant during
a debate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stunned many observers during a GOP debate Thursday when he
made a pledge that sounded like his father's ill-fated 1988
presidential campaign promise of no new taxes. But Bush Friday said
that is not what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. I made a vow to cut the taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters then read Bush his exact statement: ``This is not
only, `No new taxes' _ this is `Tax cuts, so help me God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then tried to clarify his statement, apparently to limit it
to the $483 billion tax-cut plan he has already proposed, using
money from the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a new announcement. It's just that I've
reconfirmed my commitment to get done that which I have done as
governor,'' noting he signed $1 billion in Texas tax cuts in 1997
and another $2.8 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in the course of a debate, and I meant what I said,''
Bush said. ``When I say something, I mean to get it done. I've got
a record of getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, at the Republican National Convention in 1988,
pledged: ``Read my lips: No new taxes.'' But after he was elected
president, he was compelled to raise taxes in 1990, and many
believe that broken promise led to his re-election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The new Forbes commercial, running in New Hampshire and nearby
Boston, features Houston taxpayer watchdog Mary C. Williams saying
Bush's tax record in Texas is a ``record of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, head of Taxpayers for Accountability, says Bush signed
a pledge for her group during his first gubernatorial campaign in
1994, promising to oppose increases in sales or business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge that bears Bush's signature is a promise to oppose a
state personal income tax or an increase in the sales tax, but it
says nothing about business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, Williams says that Bush broke the pledge in
1997 when he asked the Texas Legislature to enact a new business
tax and raise the sales tax. But Williams doesn't say in the ad
that the governor's proposed tax increases were part of a package
of tax tradeoffs that would have cut school property taxes by $3
billion and produced an overall net reduction in state and local
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected Bush's proposal and, in the end, simply
increased the homestead exemption on school property taxes from
$5,000 to $15,000. That resulted in many, but not all, Texas
homeowners receiving tax cuts of as much as $140 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which Bush supported, was the first of the ``two
largest tax cuts in Texas history,'' for which the Texas governor
has repeatedly claimed credit during his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Forbes ad does say is as a part of my plan I was
cutting taxes on the taxpayers and did. Go back and look at the
history of the tax package. It was a tax cut from day one and it
ended up being a tax cut on the final day,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base line of our budget would have been $1 billion larger
had I not stood up and said, `We're going to cut taxes by $1
billion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not demand that Forbes remove the ad, but
said New Hampshire voters will know all the truth before they vote.
But he likened the commercial to ones Forbes ran against Republican
front-runner Bob Dole in 1996, ads that many Republicans believe
crippled Dole's general election campaign against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he ought to have withdrawn the ads he ran against
Bob Dole in 1996. But he's an independent-minded person, and we'll
just have to deal with it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said commercials like Forbes' are bad for the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good for the process for candidates, when
their political clock is ticking, not to lay out all of the
facts,'' Bush said. ``There's always a tendency in politics when
things aren't going well on the positive side to resort to the
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, whose campaign is struggling, has made reform of the
federal tax system a major priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes' ad carries a disclaimer that Williams' group doesn't
endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Friday that the Forbes campaign asked her to
appear in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   She said she initially refused, but changed her mind after
deciding that voters have a ``right to know the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the Bush campaign now
believes Bush's signature on the 1994 anti-tax pledge was written
by an automatic signature pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he used an auto-pen,'' Williams said. ``Who's
going to believe (Bush's denials)?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams admitted that Bush, despite what she says in Forbes'
commercial, didn't promise to oppose an increase in business taxes.
But she said an ill-fated proposal to expand the corporate
franchise tax to business partnerships and sole proprietorships,
which Bush also supported in 1997, could have been construed as a
personal income tax, which the governor did vow to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are now witnessing is the dissembly of Mr. Bush's
campaign into its own version of Clinton denial,'' Forbes spokesman
Keith Appell said.
</P>
<P>
   Appell said the Forbes campaign also may run the TV spot in Iowa
and South Carolina, two other key early nominating states.

 &HT;    Couple may destroy embryos
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The fight to give life to six embryos,
frozen for more than a decade, may soon be over. Their parents,
frustrated for two years after doctors repeatedly steered potential
couples toward ``fresher'' embryos, are considering letting them
thaw into oblivion _ even though they believe them to be living
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may resort to some sort of memorial service and put them
to rest because it's been so frustrating,'' said Charlotte Danciu,
a Boca Raton lawyer who specializes in adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wanted to give them a chance to have life,'' Danciu
said Friday. ``For them, it's been very emotional because they do
value these lives. It's not just something they want to discard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron, a 45-year-old production manager, and Donna, a 43-year-old
homemaker _ the western Broward County couple doesn't want to be
identified for fear of harassment _ had tried for 15 years to
conceive. In 1989, doctors fertilized 15 eggs and implanted four of
the resulting embryos. One took: Young Ronnie was born in May 1990.
But the pregnancy was difficult and Donna almost died. The couple
decided not to try again, but procrastinated on the fate of the
other nine embryos. After Donna later learned a vial containing
three embryos had broken and that the clinic planned to begin
charging $600 a year for storage, the couple announced in December
1997 they wanted to give the embryos away.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Danciu said, her office has received about 70
responses. Seven times, Danciu said, couples have met Ron's and
Donna's standards _ mostly that they be ``good people and
Christians'' _ but each time the effort has fallen through, most
recently within the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle has been doctors' concern that freezing
techniques weren't as good a decade ago as now and that the embryos
have been frozen so long they wouldn't survive the thaw just before
implantation. Because the procedure is expensive and requires the
potential mother to take many drugs, both orally and through
injections, doctors have suggested potential parents seek other
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get up to the end, some doctor or fertility
center says, 'You've got a 5 percent chance of it working and
you're going to be spending $10,000 and we can get you some fresher
stuff.' That's how the doctors, unfortunately, look at them _ very
clinically. They (the couple) look at it like these are their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Drury, director of the In-Vitro Fertilization
Laboratory at the University of Florida, said frozen embryos have
only a 50 percent chance of surviving a thaw, but that doesn't
change over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they've been looked after, there's an almost unlimited time
span,'' Drury said from Gainesville. ``People have talked about a
thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple did not respond to a request for comment made through
Danciu. Anne DeLong, spokeswoman for the Catholic-based Human Life
International, said the embryos are live humans and it would be
wrong to destroy them. But she could offer no solution because, she
said, the couple should never have artificially created them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad when a man and woman are married and are unable
to conceive, but there comes a time when they simply must accept
that that must be part of God's plan for their lives,'' DeLong
said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical industry is wrestling with the ethics of
infertility, which affects 5.3 million Americans _ about one in 10
of reproductive age _ and has generated a $2 billion-a-year
business. While selling embryos for profit violates medical ethics
and is illegal in Florida and other states, some clinics around the
country reportedly sell eggs left by patients and fertilized by
donor sperm to desperate couples. Ethicists have said the practice
could lead to ``designer babies.'' And it's been estimated that,
across America, 100,000 human embryos sit in cold storage.

its innovations have flourished primarily in the United States. The

   ROCKER-RACISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is making racist or xenophobic
remarks a sign of mental illness? Major League Baseball seemed to
suggest it was last week when it demanded that John Rocker undergo
psychological testing following his rantings about immigrants and
blacks. But the consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is
that racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless
combined with a host of other problems. If it were, then a huge
swath of society would be considered mentally ill. By James C.
McKinley.

   FOOTBALL-COACHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The history of the rising
power and prestige of football coaches. In football's early years,
coaches were not venerated figures; in fact, players sometimes
ejected them from the field by when they became too dictatorial.
Today, a top coach like Bill Parcells _ who turned three losing
franchises into winners _ had achieved the superstar free-agent
status that team owners succeeded in denying the players. By Allan
Barra. (Also moving in `s' category)

   ATTICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why rehash the bloody Attica prison
uprising of 1971 almost 29 years later? Because its demons have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same. They were back last week when a
federal judge announced a settlement that may at last bring
finality to Attica's painful aftermath. By Clyde Haberman.

interest demands that the usual right to confidentiality be waived.
Others question whether the public needs, wants or has the right to
such information and whether it serves a legitimate purpose. By
Denise Grady.

<P>
   TRAFFICS-SUVS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once the province of city
councils and mayors, suburban traffic problems have grown
sufficiently pervasive that they are drawing attention from
presidential candidates like Al Gore. Little noticed is an
intriguing new debate among civil engineers over whether traffic is
made worse by changes in the vehicles that Americans drive. The
question is whether increasingly popular sport utility vehicles,
pickup trucks and minivans clog intersections and slow traffic. By
Keith Bradsher.

<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-REVIEW (Houston) _ The thought of Texas as a
national role model for capital punishment is enough to make death
penalty opponents shudder, but at least a few places regard the
state worth emulating. Yet whether this suggests a growing national
appetite for more executions, carried out more quickly with fewer
appeals, is unclear. A national review of capital punishment last
year reveals several conflicting signals. By Jim Yardley.

   BRAND-NAMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In today's cluttered and

must bend in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries, where
it exists alongside Christianity and indigenous traditional
beliefs. In recent years, Sudan's Islamic rulers have grabbed the
West's attention in this region, as Khartoum became a harbor for
anti-American terrorists and a long-running civil war against a
mostly Christian and animist south killed 2 million people. But it

   U.S.-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet was supposed to be
a global medium and a stateless realm, a kind of cyber-Pangaea. But
its innovations have flourished primarily in the United States. The
generally-cited reasons include America's entrepreneurial climate _
venture capital financing, close ties between business and

   MIDEAST-TALKS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In some ways, comparison
between the 1978 Camp David talks and the current talks in
Shepherdstown is unfair. Camp David _ 12 excruciatingly long days
in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat hammered out
a framework of peace _ was the climax of a process. Shepherdstown,
where bilateral contact has been limited to clipped utterances, is
an opening scene. But the comparisons and contrasts are inevitable,

CLINTON INTERVENES IN MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton on Friday intervened in
the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria by presenting
leaders of both countries a seven-page ``working paper'' defining
their differences over a deal that would return the Golan Heights
to Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's action on Friday, during his fourth trip to
Shepherdstown this week, marked his first effort to define the
terms of a ``core agreement'' that could lead to a far more
detailed peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   It came after five days of wheel-spinning during the talks in
this small town 70 miles from Washington, and was presented only
after U.S. officials concluded that both Prime Minister Ehud Barak
of Israel and Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, had
sufficiently demonstrated to their domestic constituencies that
they were holding out on the emotional questions of new borders and
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly part of the thinking,'' a diplomat involved
in the talks said Friday, when asked why Clinton had waited until
his fourth trip here to make the U.S. draft paper the centerpiece
of the talks. ``We had to give everyone time to vent, and they did
so pretty thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat described the document as containing a proposed
text for an agreement, with points of dispute contained in
brackets, the standard method of hashing out textual differences in
diplomatic and trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials familiar with the talks said on Friday that
there was virtually no chance that the ``core'' text would be
agreed to before Barak and al-Sharaa return to the Middle East,
probably on Sunday or Monday. But a second round of talks is
expected to reconvene in the next few weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar technique _ allowing both sides to vent and then
interceding with a U.S. proposal _ was used by President Carter in
1978 on the sixth day of the Camp David meetings, which ultimately
resulted in the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel the next
year. But the United States had to go through 22 more drafts before
the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented the U.S. working paper to Barak and al-Sharaa
on Friday morning, as they were seated around a fireplace in the
Clarion Hotel and conference center here, where both the Israeli
and Syrian delegations have been confined all week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wore a sweater and looked more like he was ready for
skiing than presiding over peace talks. Al-Sharaa showed up in a
suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose team here drafted
the paper, and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, also
attended the session.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, abiding by the news blackout that has surrounded
the entire week of talks, said little about the contents of the
paper. But James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said on
Friday that in defining the differences of position, the U.S. paper
would pave the way for ``some new ideas for bridging'' differences.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the paper had been constantly revised during the week
to reflect Clinton's and Albright's private conversations with both
sides. He described the talks as ``not warm and fuzzy, but
businesslike and professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides suspended the talks late Friday afternoon for 24
hours of religious observances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to present the paper was clearly motivated by
frustration at the slow pace of the first substantive negotiations
between the two countries since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides argued all week over what issues will be
negotiated first. The Syrians were intent on establishing for their
domestic audience that Jerusalem was committed to giving back the
Golan Heights, which Israel seized during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war, before the subject turned to the kind of security guarantees
that Barak would get in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis wanted just the opposite: a discussion of security
first, to make the case in Israel that they have obtained
concessions more valuable than the Golan Heights buffer zone, which
has been their main deterrent to Syrian attack for a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   If a treaty is reached, Barak has promised to hold a national
referendum before signing it. And it is far from clear that Israeli
citizens, who have been told for years that the Golan is the key to
national survival, will be persuaded to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-page document covers all the major areas of dispute,
starting with whether the border would go back to the 1967 line _
whose exact location is also in dispute _ or the 1923 line that
runs along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. That is closely related
to the question of water rights: Israel fears that if Syria can tap
the sea, Israelis will lose some of their most vital water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is what U.S. officials call ``normal peaceful
relations,'' the issue of whether Syria would allow Israel to open
an embassy in Damascus and, ultimately, open the border to tourism
and commerce. Syria has opposed any symbols of Israeli presence.
None of these issues are new; all have been exhaustively discussed
in past negotiations, reaching back to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the U.S. effort to get the talks started by
creating committees of Israelis, Syrians and Americans to take up
each subject broke down by mid-week. No one could agree on what
would be discussed first. Two of the committees _ one on borders,
one on water _ have yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural argument, however, may have been largely for
show. For while they argue over the details, both sides are aware
of the changing strategic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   For the Syrians, the cost of continuing isolation, the U.S.
economic sanctions applied against a terrorist state and a
fast-declining economy have all put pressure on an ailing President
Hafez Assad to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Israelis, the security gains of the Golan have been
offset by better defense technology, although the Israeli right
wing argues that no amount of weaponry could replace the security
of holding on to the Golan.

&HT;     STUDY FINDS MILITARY MORALE, READINESS SINKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     For release Monday, Jan. 10)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Morale and overall preparedness of U.S. troops are
sinking because the stepped-up pace of peacekeeping missions over
the last decade has taxed a shrinking and underfunded American
force, a new study being released Monday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted over the last two years by the nonpartisan
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) here, found
that ``morale and readiness are suffering from force reductions,
high operational tempo and resource constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Many service members, the study said, ``have deep concerns about
the state of training and readiness in their units'' and military
``leaders at all levels are frustrated by the signs of declining
readiness in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study's authors wrote, officials at the Army's
premier training facility _ the National Training Center at Ft.
Irwin, Calif. _ said they have observed ``a marked decrease in the
proficiency'' of the service's frontline units.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt in the minds of the study participants
that conditions within the armed forces are far less favorable than
they were a decade ago,'' said the 200-plus page report. It was
based on 99-question surveys of 12,000 U.S. service members in the
United States, Korea, Europe and Hawaii. The surveys were
supplemented by interviews of 125 ``focus groups'' of service
members.
</P>
<P>
   The study was headed by Edwin Dorn, a former undersecretary of
defense for personnel and readiness during much of the Clinton
administration, and Howard Graves, a retired Army lieutenant
general and former head of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
A major problem, according to the report, is the rapid growth of
peacekeeping, or humanitarian, missions that the military has
conducted since the George Bush administration, coupled with
shrinking budgets and a significant reduction in the size of
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon figures, the rate of overseas deployments
of Army units has increased 300 percent and the number of deployed
Navy ships has increased by 52 percent since the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989, Bush's first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   But during the same period, the size of the Army has fallen 38
percent, the number of Navy ships, 30 percent and Air Force
personnel, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the U.S. military has dropped from a force of 2.1
million men and women in 1989 to 1.4. million today. In constant
dollars, defense budgets have dropped 31 percent during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced budgets, low pay and far-flung peacekeeping
operations to such places as Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo have
contributed to ``a profound stress on the armed forces,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the leadership of the armed forces has not yet
adjusted to the reality that there are insufficient operating
resources and personnel to match missions,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Collins, a senior fellow at CSIS who helped conduct the
surveys, said in an interview with the Hearst Newspapers that
understaffing and equipment shortages are a ``major problem very
intimately connected with morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to get these words out of my mouth as an old
soldier but there is a significant morale problem,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   He added that troops in all services made such comments as
``people in my unit are stressed out,'' ``my unit is continuously
being surprised with new missions,'' and ``it's impossible in my
service to have a balance between work and family life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon offered no comment on the report. But in the last
six months, military leaders have begun to acknowledge that
readiness is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, testified that while the readiness of so-called
`first-to-fight units'' was satisfactory, weaknesses in other areas
threatened the overarching U.S. strategy of being able to fight two
major foreign wars at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take longer to respond to hostilities which, in turn,
means territory lost and an increased potential for casualties,''
he said, citing problems in maintaining equipment and difficulties
in recruiting and retaining personnel.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, two Army divisions fell to the military's
lowest level of combat readiness, and the Pentagon acknowledged
that recruiters were struggling to meet their quotas for new
soldiers. To combat readiness problems, the Pentagon is asking
Congress to increase military budgets by $112 billion over the next
five years. The current annual budget is $267 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The increase will be used in part to improve the quality of life
for the troops and to modernize weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's budget, President gave the military a 4.8 percent
pay raise, the largest since 1981. Congress also gave a one-time
boost to many pay scales so that about 75 percent of all service
members will receive extra raises on July 1. In addition, the
administration recently announced hikes in housing allowances for
military members who live off base.
</P>
<P>
   In other conclusions the CSIS said race relations in the armed
forces generally are better than in the society at large. The study
found that 71 percent of all respondents said their units didn't
have racial discrimination problems, although 36 percent of
minority respondents disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The CSIS also reported that that 28 percent of female
respondents and 13 percent of males said sexual harassment or
gender discrimination was a problem.

MORGAN STANLEY WINS RIGHT TO INTERNET DOMAIN NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time around, David had a Web site but Goliath prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the big securities firm, won
its legal fight to take possession of an Internet domain name that
purportedly was registered for a teen-ager's Web site dedicated to
mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley plans to use the domain name, www.msdwonline.com,
as the World Wide Web address for its new online trading service,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan Stanley introduced the service in November, it was
stuck with a cumbersome address, www.online.msdw.com, because the
address it preferred had been registered by a California family
using the name Smart Ideas. Sau Wong, a resident of Hillsborough,
Calif., claimed that his son Ivan, a 17-year-old high school
student, wanted the domain name for a mountain-biking Web site
called Mud Sweat's Downhill World.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wongs rejected Morgan Stanley's offer of $10,000 and
demanded $75,000 for the domain name, Morgan Stanley filed suit in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The defendants asked the court to
dismiss the suit because they did not live or do business in New
York, but Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein rejected that motion three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very purpose of the defendant's act, it is alleged, is to
attack Morgan Stanley and extort money from Morgan Stanley because
of a confusingly similar domain name that was created for no
legitimate purpose,'' Hellerstein said during a Dec. 15 hearing on
that motion.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the case said they thought the judge's statements in
the hearing over jurisdiction indicated that he would favor Morgan
Stanley if the case continued. At that hearing, Hellerstein said
the court had jurisdiction because the Wong family's offer to give
up the name for $75,000 _ ``outrageous terms'' in the words of the
judge _ meant they were attempting to do business with a New
York-based company. ``That's business. It may not be nice business,
but it's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Wongs agreed to turn over to Morgan Stanley that
domain name and another they had registered,
morganstanleydirect.com, at no cost to the firm. Those domain names
were among dozens the Wongs had registered that contained
well-known brands and the names of Wall Street firms, like
goldmansachsdirect.com and jpmorganonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's lawyers pointed to the long list of corporate
and brand names the Wongs had registered as evidence that they were
``cybersquatters'' seeking to profit by selling domain names to
companies that had a business purpose for them. They also pointed
out in their complaint that the Wongs did not create the
mountain-biking site until after Morgan Stanley sued them.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation late last year that was aimed at
preventing cybersquatting by making it punishable with damage
awards of up to $100,000. Steven Lincoln, a lawyer in San Jose,
Calif., who represents Wong, said the new law spurred his client to
consider giving up the domain names based on corporations and brand
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Smart Ideas does not retain
registration of any domain names that are similar to or contain any
corporate names,'' Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   After that law passed, Morgan Stanley wrote a letter to the
judge stating that the firm believed the Wongs would be liable for
damages. The Wongs quickly shut down the Web site, replacing the
pictures of downhill bike racers with the message: ``This site will
be inactive until further notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong's lawyers said his clients have registered another domain
name, www.msdhw.com, that will be the new home of Mud Sweat's
Downhill World, which they described as a Web site ``devoted to
promoting the sport of mountain-biking over the Internet.''

KOREAN LEFTHANDER LEE JOINS RED SOX BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If the Eck was lefthanded and Korean, and dyed his hair
a shade this side of orange, he might look something like Sang-Hoon
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   And if Lee throws his fastball and slider anything like the Eck,
then the Red Sox might have themselves a surprisingly effective
addition to their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, on the day he was presented a Red Sox cap and
jersey by a sore-thumbed Dan Duquette, who has been pursuing Lee
for years, only this much is certain: Lee, whose gaudy statistics
on the far side of the international dateline led the Sox to give
him a two-year, $3.35 million contract (with a club option for
2002), has the makings of a genuine character.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: When the 28-year-old Korean went to the mound to pose
for pictures Friday, he pantomimed a pitcher watching a long drive
disappear overhead. After another ghostly delivery, he clutched his
left shoulder in mock pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Korean, he is very unique,'' said Michael Min, a
journalist for the Chosin Sports Daily, one of several Korean
papers that dispatched reporters to Fenway Park for Lee's formal
introduction by the Sox. ``He's a very different guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows it, too. Two years ago, when the Red Sox thought they
had a deal for Lee only to have it scotched by Major League
Baseball, Boston Globe reporter Kevin Paul Dupont interviewed Lee
in Korea and mentioned another notable Sox pitcher of the same
surname.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Lee was crazy?'' Lee repeated. ``So am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee not only has a rock star's tresses, but likes to sing and
play the guitar, too. He has had not one nickname, but at least
three. When still in college, according to another Korean
journalist, he was known as Papillon, after the Steve
McQueen-Dustin Hoffman prison thriller, for his repeated (and
successful) attempts to escape dorm life. The long hair inspired
another handle, Samson, and during his time with the LG Twins, his
Korean team, he was also known as the Wild Horse, back when
Duquette swears his shoulder-length hair was jet black and not the
Tang-colored look he now sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like to go to barbershops,'' he said Friday. ``And
now it has become my trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was asked what he knew about Red Sox history, he
revealed that rumors of the Curse apparently have circulated in his
native Seoul, too. With his words translated by his Korea-based
agent, Jung hon Lee, who works for Cleveland-based IMG, Lee said;
``I know that Babe Ruth was here and was traded (sic) to the
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Korea, Lee is big news. He has a chance to become the
first player from his country to pitch professionally in Korea,
Japan, and the United States. When his deal with the Sox was
nullified two years ago by MLB, which temporarily quashed all
signings of Asian players until a protocol could be worked out, Lee
wound up spending the last two seasons in Japan, with far more
modest results than he had in Korea, where he won 20 games as a
starter in 1995 then two years later led the league in saves with
37.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, of course, have tried these cross-cultural experiments
before. You might recall the $3 million investment they made in the
Dominican mystery man, Robinson Checo, who came to the Sox via
Japan and in two years won one game in a Sox uniform before going
to the Tigers and then the Dodgers, who recently designated him for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, however, had had some elbow problems in the past, and
hurt his elbow again when he overdid it in his first workout with
the Sox. Lee has not had any arm problems, except for an injury to
his right (nonthrowing) shoulder, according to one of his Korean
chroniclers, that made him exempt from the military service
compulsory for all Korean males.
</P>
<P>
   Though he started 11 games last season in Japan, where he was
6-5 in 36 appearances for the Chunichi Dragons, the plan is to use
Lee exclusively in relief, according to Duquette, who expects Lee
to join Rheal Cormier as the Sox' lefthanded setup men.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said that Lee, like Korean imports Jin Ho Cho and Sunny
Kim before him, will undergo an orientation program here to make
the transition easier. He did not say whether catcher Jason
Varitek, who is facing the prospect of handling a pitching staff
that also includes Dominicans (Pedro and Ramon Martinez, Juan
Pena), a French-Canadian (Cormier), a Japanese rookie (Tomo Ohka)
and a native New Englander (Brian Rose), will be enrolling soon in
Berlitz courses.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is married and has two daughters, plans to return to
Korea before reporting to Fort Myers Feb. 1 to begin informal
workouts with the club. According to agent Lee, the Sox gave him a
$1.05 million signing bonus and a contract that calls for him to be
paid $850,000 in 2000 and $1.45 million in 2001. Duquette, who on
Monday underwent surgery for a torn ligament in his left thumb, an
injury he sustained last week in a skiing accident, was unfazed by
the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great premium for lefthanded pitchers throughout
baseball,'' said Duquette, who noted Lee throws three pitches _ a
fastball, slider, and split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The $850,000 reportedly matches the money he was paid in Japan
last season. Chunichi wanted him back and told him he could be a
closer, but Lee has had his sights set here for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his long flowing hair,'' Duquette said, ``he'll be a good
complement to Rod Beck. He's a colorful player. We're looking
forward to having him here.''

TITANS-BILLS SEEN AS LIKELY SUPER BOWL MATCHUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It goes by the name of a wild-card game, but this
could be good enough for a Super Bowl matchup in this season of
parity and surprise. Both Buffalo (11-5) and Tennessee (13-3) are
playing that well.
</P>
<P>
   NFL rules require that the two most-mediocre AFC teams in the
playoffs _ Miami and Seattle _ play. (The division-winning Seahawks
draw the team with the worst record.) The result is that the Bills
and Titans, either of whom could win the Super Bowl, are paired on
what usually is a lost weekend of football.
</P>
<P>
   All varieties of subplots abound. The Titans will be playing
their first postseason game Saturday (12:30 p.m.) in the noisy and
hot cauldron that is Adelphia Coliseum. Tennessee running back
Eddie George, like so many of his mates, will be making his first
playoff appearance ``and I'm sure I'll be nervous; I'm going to
have to calm myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills and the Titans will be meeting for the first time
since one of the most memorable playoff games in NFL history, when
the Houston Oilers _ the Titans' former nom de plume _ jumped out
to a 35-3 lead Jan. 3, 1993, as Warren Moon directed the Oilers'
run-and-shoot offense with ease and precision. But, with 13:15 left
in the third quarter, Buffalo backup quarterback Frank Reich began
the greatest comeback in NFL playoff history, capped when the
Bills' Steve Christie kicked a winning 32-yard field goal in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I remember the pain of that game,'' said Titans guard and
old warrior Bruce Matthews, ``I would never play football again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, of course, are coached by Wade Phillips, who just
happens to be the son of Bum Phillips, the most storied coach the
Oilers ever had. But the son has taken a huge gamble that his
risk-taking father never took _ changing quarterbacks on the eve of
a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on playing a great game,'' said new starter Rob
Johnson, who was inserted by Phillips _ although some in Buffalo
believe owner Ralph Wilson might have taken a part in the move _ to
replace Doug Flutie. Johnson's status rose after playing very well
last Sunday against the Colts, as he threw quickly and with
confidence. The knock against Johnson in the past was that he held
the ball too long and was not quick in his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Indianapolis defense is the weakest in
the AFC East and the Colts, according to some in the Bills
organization, were not playing with their usual gusto. Johnson's
performance, therefore, should have an asterisk next to it.
</P>
<P>
   Still in all, he looked sharp and efficient in his only start of
the season, and Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said Johnson put on
``one of the best performances'' of any quarterback this season.
Fisher's quarterback, Steve McNair, is similar to Johnson in that
he, too, will be making his first playoff start.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have other problems. Veteran wide receiver Andre Reed
chose this week to announce that he is done in Buffalo and no
longer wants to play with the Bills. Reed, who has been known to
sulk in the past, also took some shots at Flutie. ``At this point,
I just want to go where I'm appreciated and respected,'' said Reed,
``and I haven't had that here.'' Flutie and Reed spoke Friday,
however, and cleared the air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the status of Buffalo offensive tackles John Fina and
Robert Hicks remains uncertain for the game. Fina did not practice
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The game will feature two of the best lead blockers in the NFL _
the Bills' Sam Gash and Tennessee's Lorenzo Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Plots abound, but so will some excellent football between two of
the NFL's best teams, each forced into a wild-card matchup that is
good enough for an AFC title game . . . or even a Super Bowl, if
quality of the teams is all that mattered.

 &HT;    Revamped magazine keeps tales from the Old West aliveBy Michele
Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The headline reads like an old-style movie
trailer in melodramatic boldface: ``Fringe Benefits of a
Prospector: He lives on the fringe of society, borders on the
fringe of starvation, skirts the fringe of paranoia _ and
undoubtedly is the luckiest man in the world!''
</P>
<P>
   It's the true story of ``Seldom Seen Slim,'' a prospector from
Sierra Nevada _ and it was typical of the tales of prospectors and
mountain men, lumberjacks and gunfighters, outlaws and cowboys that
have filled the pages of True West magazine since its inception in
the 1950s. Five decades later, though, the venerable publication
was hovering close to extinction _ until 1999, when two lifelong
fans decided to rescue it by investing their money and bringing
ownership of the magazine back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   True West was founded in Austin in 1953 by Joe Small, and its
editors included ``Old Yeller'' author Fred Gipson, former Texas
state historian Walter Prescott Webb and renowned Austin folklorist
and author J. Frank Dobie.
</P>
<P>
   With a colorful cover and adventure-driven copy, it was the kind
of magazine boys in the 1950s and '60s adored, full of tales of
murder, train robberies and lost treasure taken from the pages of
history. It was ``All True _ All Fact _ Stories of the Real West,''
as its masthead trumpeted, but never let the fact that its stories
were true get in the way of their bravado and suspense. You can
practically hear the guitar picks behind song verses quoted in
early issues of the magazine: ``Young Billie Grounds, he was wild
and free/He was still in his teens, just a kid you see. /Young
Billie Grounds, reckless, brave and bold./ He lost his life and
caused much grief/ All for the sake of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, in the 1960s when Western-themed TV shows like
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza'' were popular, True West had a
circulation of more than 500,000. But over the years, the
magazine's ownership drifted and its circulation began to drop. Its
headquarters moved away from Austin, first to Michigan, then to
Oklahoma. Its readers were mostly older men, and the publication
was struggling, its circulation dropping to a paltry 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like a sheriff and his posse riding in to save a frontier
town, two die-hard fans of True West magazine stepped in to save
it. Robert McCubbin, the recently retired vice president of
operations of El Paso Natural Gas Co., and Richard Baish, who just
retired as president of El Paso Natural Gas, began reading ``True
West'' when they were in their teens. Both have made a love of the
Old West part of their lives. McCubbin has a large collection of
Western artifacts, photographs and rare books. Baish owns a
17,000-acre cattle ranch in New Mexico and a lot of Western
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with historian and author Bob Boze Bell, Baish and
McCubbin bought True West last fall. This month's issue is their
first, and these El Pasoans say they are proud to bring ownership
of the magazine back to Texas. The new publishers have already
begun renewing and improving the magazine, overseeing a redesign,
adding new columns, adding color inside and improving the quality
of the paper, hoping eventually to go to glossy pages inside. Baish
and McCubbin say they plan to add more stories about Texas Rangers
and Texas history. Although they both live in El Paso, they
temporarily moved the headquarters of the magazine to Cave Creek,
Ariz., where Bell oversaw the redesign. Most of the writers
featured in True West are free-lance contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The stories in their first issue bear the colorful flavor that's
such a trademark of True West: the adventures of John Horton
Slaughter, Texas Ranger; the story behind a mysterious highwayman
who roamed northern California in the winter of 1889; an interview
with ``Lonesome Dove'' author Larry McMurtry about his Crazy Horse
biography.
</P>
<P>
   In the February issue, one story begins ``Deep along the
unforgiving pines, their search for gold ends in a pitched light
and sudden death.'' It's not quite as kitschy as '70s-era stories
like ``He Killed A Cagey Outlaw,'' but the romantic devotion to the
Old West remains.
</P>
<P>
   One feature they're adding is a column called ``Wild Wild Sex,''
about brothels in Montana in the Old West. It's about the lives of
the women who worked there, and is an attempt to broaden the
magazine's appeal, McCubbin says. (The first line in the February
installment of the column: ``Whores have always been a hardy
breed.'') McCubbin would also like to see the publication read by
younger people and is working on ways to appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   For Baish, taking over ownership of True West means preserving
something that was integral to his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a business deal for us,'' says the retired
businessman, who has degrees from Southwest Texas State University
and the University of Texas. ``It's worth preserving as part of the
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Baish says, is to see if he and his friends can
make True West adapt and evolve, so that it not only survives but
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to go in and find something that maybe other people
thought should be written off and turn it around.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers added jobs at a surprisingly robust rate
in December, propelling the economy into the new year with
considerable momentum, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The economy created 315,000 new nonfarm jobs last month, 75,000
more than economists had predicted and the biggest one-month gain
since July. With more people entering the work force, the
unemployment rate remained at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, where
it has been for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.4 percent,
slightly more than expected. But because workers are producing more
for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far shows few signs of
setting off a surge in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While good news across the board, the figures substantially
increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will act to keep
the economy from overheating by raising interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investors acknowledged that a rate increase is
now all but certain, but concluded that inflationary pressures are
so muted that the Fed would limit the increase to a quarter of a
percentage point rather than the half point increase that the
markets had come to fear in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Both blue chip and technology stocks surged. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 269.30 points, to 11,522.56, a record.
The Nasdaq composite index reversed three days of sharp declines,
rising 155.49 points, to 3,882.62. Bond prices also rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough strength in this report to make it a virtual
certainty the Fed will tighten in February,'' said Stuart G.
Hoffman, an economist at the PNC Corp. in Pittsburgh. ``But I think
a quarter of a point is all that's likely to come from the Fed, and
appropriately so because this report is not so exceedingly strong
as to force the Fed into a more aggressive increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Job gains were particularly strong in retailing and construction
last month, while a prolonged decline in manufacturing jobs slowed
as exports showed signs of picking up.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that unemployment for all of 1999 averaged 4.2
percent, down from 4.5 percent in 1998 and the lowest rate since
1969, when it was 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among black workers, the rate for the full year fell to 8
percent from 8.9 percent a year earlier, the lowest since the Labor
Department started keeping separate records by race in 1972. Among
Hispanic workers, the rate fell to 6.4 percent in 1999 from 7.2
percent a year earlier, the lowest since the department began
breaking out statistics on Hispanic employment in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The report also left little doubt that the economy would
continue growing for another month, all but assuring that the
current business expansion will become the nation's longest in
February at 8 years and 11 months, breaking a record set in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential campaign heating up, the figures suggested
that the economy will only be a political issue during the primary
season to the degree that Vice President Al Gore can claim credit
for its strength or to the degree that the other candidates in both
parties can convince voters that they have the prescription for
keeping the good times rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy's resilience presents a tricky challenge for the
Fed, whose chairman, Alan Greenspan, was nominated to a fourth
four-year term this week by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been increasingly blunt in warning over the last
few months that the economy is running out of workers, and that
even the substantial gains in productivity growth generated by huge
investments in technology are not sufficient to eliminate the risk
of spiraling wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised its benchmark Federal funds target rate three
times last year in quarter-point increments, to 5.50 percent. The
central bank's policy-setting committee meets again on Feb. 1 and
2, and analysts are almost unanimous in expecting another
quarter-point increase then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers suggest that economic activity continues to be
strong, and undoubtedly stronger than the Fed believes is
consistent with holding down inflation,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   So far there is little hard evidence that inflation pressures
are taking root. Although wage growth is running slightly higher
now than it was last summer _ average hourly earnings were up 3.7
percent last month over the same month a year earlier, compared
with 3.4 percent in August _ the average increase in the fourth
quarter was actually lower than in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hoffman said Friday's numbers provided some clues that
productivity growth continued to be strong at the end of the year,
allowing employers to absorb higher wage costs without having to
raise prices or sacrifice profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been tentative signs that higher interest rates
are beginning to slow the housing market, a possible precursor of a
more generalized economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasriel cited two statistics watched closely by Greenspan
that suggest a potential for trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One is a broad definition of the number of available workers _
people who are officially unemployed, plus those not actively
looking for a job but interested in working. By that measure,
joblessness fell last month to its lowest level during this
business cycle, 4.5 percent, down from 4.6 percent a month earlier
and 4.8 percent a year earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the ``quit rate,'' or the number of people who have
left their jobs voluntarily as a percentage of total unemployed
workers. That rate rose to 14.4 percent from 14.3 percent last
month, also a high for this business cycle, indicating that workers
are increasingly confident of their ability to find a new and
better paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that you're going to have to pay more to
retain your staff,'' Kasriel said.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the Fed is likely to have to raise rates a
number of times this year to slow the economy to a noninflationary
pace. Economists at Salomon Smith Barney forecast Friday that the
Fed would raise rates at least three quarters of a point, and
perhaps a full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan has proven to be a gradualist when it comes to
adjusting monetary policy, raising and lowering rates a quarter of
a point at a time and reassessing the economy every few weeks or
months. He has not raised rates by half a percentage point since
1995.

MARKET RALLIES TO FINISH WEEK STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market Friday rallied across the board,
wiping out most of the losses of a topsy-turvy week that began with
interest rates surging and equity investors running for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after falling 4.3 percent
Monday and Tuesday, rallied the last three days to finish the week
at a new high, eclipsing the record set New Year's Eve. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks bounced back to just 28
points shy of its record. The Nasdaq composite index, which fell
prey to the rush to dump technology stocks, was off 9.8 percent
through Thursday, but its 4.2 percent rally Friday left it down a
more modest 6 percent for the first week of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The selling in New York early in the week sent stocks in Europe
and Asia tumbling. But those markets also rebounded Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street rally showed that investors, despite a surge in
interest rates since mid-November and the imminent threat of rate
increases by the Federal Reserve, still want stocks _ even if they
are ones they had avoided before. The rally also makes one wonder
if selloffs will ever spook investors.
</P>
<P>
   As all three major stock gauges rose together for the first time
this year and trading volume neared record levels, investors bought
nontechnology stocks that were shunned last year. At the same time,
they picked up some of the technology stocks that had been hammered
Tuesday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, the office equipment retailer, which plunged almost 29
percent last year, climbed 1 3/8, to 25 5/16, and is up 22 percent
this week. Caterpillar, the manufacturer of big machinery, climbed
1 11/16, to 53 5/16, rising for a third consecutive day. It is up
13.3 percent for the year after rising just 2.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the technology side, Qualcomm rallied for the first time in
three days, rising 7 15/16, to 150. After being one of the
top-performing stocks last year, surging 2,616 percent, Qualcomm
fell 21.9 percent from Tuesday through Thursday. Yahoo and Cisco
Systems also rose Friday after falling this week. The three stocks
led the Nasdaq composite index up 155.49 points, or 4.17 percent,
to 3,882.62 _ 248 points below the high it hit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 269.30 points, or 2.39
percent, to 11,522.56 _ 25 points above its previous record. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index rose 38.02 points, or 2.71 percent, to
1,441.47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market hit a speed bump this week,'' said Thomas
M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, referring to the incredible 53.7 percent drive in the
Nasdaq index since Oct. 19. ``But the appetite is there to buy
stocks,'' he said. ``Money doesn't want to leave the stock market
so it is searching out safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Among these are drugs, consumer staples and old-line industrial
companies. Another sign of that shift was the jump in the price of
Coca-Cola Friday, which rose 3 3/4, to 60 3/4, after the company
announced some top executive appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in stocks came after the Labor Department announced
that 315,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs had been created in December
and that the nation's unemployment rate had remained at 4.1
percent, a 30-year low. The December data also showed that average
hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent last month and 3.7 percent for all
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While the jobs increase was higher than the 240,000 to 250,000
predicted by analysts, it did not seem to worry investors, nor did
the jump in average hourly earnings. Treasury bond and note prices
fell after the jobs data were announced but rallied later in the
day. The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 6.54 percent, from
6.56 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose 6/32, to 94 18/32.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Slifer, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said
one reason for the muted response is that the yields of Treasury
bonds and notes have already risen sharply in anticipation of
interest rate moves by the Federal Reserve, probably beginning with
a quarter-point increase at the Feb. 2 policy-makers' meeting. He
also said that although wages were rising, the rate of increase was
below the pace of more than 4 percent of early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of the forces driving selling earlier this week was the fear
of an increase of at least half a percentage point in the Fed's
short-term interest rate target as the central bank seeks to slow
the economy to an acceptable, noninflationary pace of growth. With
the economy growing at a 5 percent rate in the last six months
there is no sign of a slowdown yet. That concern sent the yield on
the 30-year bond up to 6.62 percent on Monday and again on
Wednesday, the highest in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors with profits in technology stocks in 1999 seemed
to have delayed their move to lock up their gains until the new
year so that their due date for capital gains would be put off as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in interest rates and some negative earnings
announcements from technology and Internet companies, including
Amazon.com, Gateway and Lucent Technologies, helped accelerate
selling.
</P>
<P>
   But as investors abandoned technology they picked up other
stocks, including hard-hit financial shares, sending the Dow and
the S&AMP;P 500 indexes, which are less heavily weighted in technology
than the Nasdaq, turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, the maker of telecommunications equipment,
set a one-day trading volume record with 179 million shares
changing hands, including 136.6 million on the New York Stock
Exchange and the rest on other trading systems. The volume exceeded
Oracle's 171.8 million shares traded on Dec. 9, 1997. Lucent
plunged 24.7 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, a fall
reflected in Friday's results, with the stock down 15 3/4, at 53
3/4. Lucent announced late Thursday that its first-quarter revenue
and earnings would fall well short of analysts expectations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Dreamlife appears to be just another Internet
company with high hopes and hazy prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But it is majority owned by Anthony Robbins, the motivational
speaker and star of TV infomercials. And it has a roster of
big-name investors, including NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw, tennis
player Andre Agassi and securities lawyer Joseph Flom, who bought
their shares months ago at lower prices than were available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   This week, those minority investors filed with regulators for
the flexibility to sell their shares _ even before Dreamlife's web
site gets going.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at the company's own filings shows some reason for
caution beyond the usual Internet uncertainties. The company says
it will need to raise more money by September, so Brokaw and his
fellow investors may simply be being prudent. After all, as Robbins
explains on wealthmastery.com, ``Your decisions, not your
conditions, determine your financial destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who created Dreamlife last spring and whose stake is
now worth $370 million, specializes in helping the successful
become more successful. At his day-long seminars, which regularly
draw audiences of 10,000 or more, he encourages people to take
control of their lives and make more money by overcoming fear and
unleashing the passions that drive them. In addition to the
seminars, he hosts smaller, pricier retreats, including a week-long
``Date with Destiny'' at his private island in Fiji for $12,000. He
has also sold millions of tapes and books.
</P>
<P>
   Though Robbins did not return calls last week, Dreamlife
president Beth Polish said her company would become the online side
of Robbins' burgeoning empire. ``His online presence with content
or communities will be through Dreamlife,'' she said. ``And that
obviously is a tremendous benefit to Dreamlife.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is Dreamlife? It is described as a network of
Internet sites focused on personal and professional improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is build a place where people will go
and assess their life,'' Ms. Polish said. ``Then, after they've
assessed their life, define their dreams or their goals, and after
they've defined their dreams or their goals have the opportunity to
pursue their dreams or their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to learn how to write a screenplay, how to find
a new job, how to have better communications skills, because it's
really the whole person that we're interested in,'' Ms. Polish
said. ``We really view ourselves as a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamlife began its life as a publicly traded company last year
through a complex and unusual deal. In what is known as a reverse
merger, Robbins struck an agreement in April to turn a little-known
developer of high-tech cancer treatments called GHS into his
Internet venture. In exchange for his participation, Robbins and
other investors received 30 million new shares in GHS, which at the
time had just 7 million shares. With 23 million shares himself,
Robbins took control of the company. GHS then spun off its old
assets into a new company called U.S. NeuroSurgical, and changed
its name to Dreamlife in November.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction had the effect of putting Dreamlife shares in
public hands while bypassing the traditional scrutiny of a stock
offering in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dreamlife worked with Allen &AMP; Co., a boutique
investment bank known for its media company clients, to sell $15
million of stock to a small group of wealthy investors at a 40
percent discount to the price then being paid by the public. The
shares, which were issued as preferred but converted to common
stock in September, were sold at the equivalent of $9 a common
share, when the public price was $16.625.
</P>
<P>
   The discount reflected the restrictions on trading the shares,
Ms. Polish said. ``They were locked up for over six months,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The private placement was needed to raise capital in lieu of a
traditional public offering of stock. Most private companies go
public by finding a securities firm to sell shares directly to
investors, a practice that raises capital for operations or other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because a reverse merger does not really raise money from
outside investors, the technique is rarely used by well-known
companies, said Richard Peterson, market strategist for Thomson
Financial Securities Data, which tracks initial public offerings.
``It's something I would not perceive as a boon,'' he said. Perhaps
the best known example in recent years was Muriel Siebert's move to
become a public company by acquiring a furniture company and then
selling those assets.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jan. 4, the investors in the Dreamlife private
placement filed a statement with the SEC registering their shares
for sale to the public. Along with Brokaw, Agassi and Flom, the
list of nearly three dozen prospective sellers includes Wayne
Huizenga, the billionaire owner of the Miami Dolphins, NBC
president Robert Wright and CBS talk show personality Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   The registration statement does not compel the investors to
sell, and at least one said last week that he had no plans to do so
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   And Agassi, at least, is a fan of Robbins, whose well-known
clients include the New Jersey Nets and President Clinton. But
skeptics say Robbins' true genius is self promotion. In 1995,
Robbins agreed to pay more than $220,000 to settle a complaint by
the Federal Trade Commission that he and his company, Robbins
Research International, had overstated the earnings potential of
his franchisees, which sold his tapes and organized seminars.
Robbins did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of Internet companies, Dreamlife is
unusual. The company has no sales, much less profits. In the three
months ended Sept. 30, Dreamlife lost $3.2 million on revenues of
$155,000, all from interest on its bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the small matter of Dreamlife's Web site. While
Robbins has his own well-developed website, which will eventually
be linked closely with Dreamlife, Dreamlife's site consists of
nothing more than one page for people to submit e-mail and a notice
that ``We'll be launching soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's ever perfect _ it's hard to build a business,
whether you're public or you're private,'' Ms. Polish said. ``We
are a public company, we opted that route, but not everybody who's
a public company from day one is actually launched.'' She said the
Dreamlife web site would be running by mid-February and its first
offerings would include some type of self-improvement classes.
</P>
<P>
   Web users, though, have shown great reluctance to pay for
content, making advertising space and product sales the major
source of revenue for most online companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, investors are valuing Dreamlife at $650
million. That's more than bigger and better known Internet content
companies such as financial news provider Marketwatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made an investment in it because I think it's an interesting
content area, and it piqued my interest,'' said Dr. Samuel Waksal,
chief executive officer of ImClone Systems, who bought 66,660
shares in the May placement. Though he has registered to sell, he
said he has no plans to do so. Allen &AMP; Co., he said, handled the
filing for all the investors.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Gumbel, who owns 15,000 shares, and Brokaw, who
owns 22,220, said they had no comment on Dreamlife. A spokesperson
for Huizenga, who owns 222,220 shares, called the investment
``typical'' for Huizenga. One of the biggest investors in the
private placement, Huizenga now has more than $1.6 million in
profits on paper for his $2 million investment. Flom, a top
fund-raiser for Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, did
not return calls for comment. He owns 5,550 shares. Calls to other
investors were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   While the investors who bought in the private placement have
seen gains of more than 80 percent in seven months, public
shareholders have not fared as well. Dreamlife's shares closed
Friday at $16.50, down about 1 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   If all the registered sellers follow through, it would put
nearly 50 percent more shares in public circulation, almost
certainly putting downward pressure on the stock.

SOLUTION TO HARVARD PILGRIM WOES WILL TAKE MORE THAN A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Warning there may be more financial bombshells buried
deep in Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's books, state officials say it
will take them more than 30 days to put together a plan to save the
ailing health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   When the state took over management of the $2.8 billion-a-year
health plan on Tuesday, it promised the Supreme Judicial Court a
rescue plan within a month. But officials Friday backpedaled on
that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically what we'll be able to do in 30 days is to report
back to the court as to what our status is,'' said Dean Richland,
who is Atty. General Thomas Reilly's first deputy. ``We're not in a
position to say we'll have a plan in 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is a critical factor in the efforts to save New England's
largest health maintenance organization, because pressure is
building from the HMO's creditors, who want their money, and from
its customers, especially large employer groups which must decide
in the next few months whether to stay with Harvard Pilgrim or jump
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Richland said the task of coming up with a rehabilitation plan
for the HMO ``is complicated by the fact that we don't know what
the real financial condition of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care is
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Any new financial surprises could well affect the structure and
feasibility of any plan to rehabilitate Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we know the worst, but I don't think we know the
worst yet,'' Richland said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Only last weekend, according to Harvard Pilgrim officials,
accountants discovered an additional $58.5 million in financial
losses for 1999, on top of $118.5 million in projected losses.
Faced with that revelation, state officials asked the state's high
court to put the health maintenance organization into state
receivership to block creditors from demanding payment _ a scenario
that would have led to the HMO's total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials don't even know how much Harvard Pilgrim owes
hospitals, doctors, suppliers and other creditors. ``We're told by
Harvard Pilgrim they owe something like $300 million, but they
don't know how much of that is real, since billing practices in the
health care industry aren't the greatest,'' Richland said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the $300 million figure dates from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated wrangling over Harvard Pilgrim indebtedness is
reflected by the Massachusetts Hospital Association's claim this
week that Harvard Pilgrim owes $300 million to hospitals alone. It
is not certain what the hospitals included in their aggregate
total.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Division of Insurance, Chris
Goetchius, indicated the daunting task that faces insurance
commissioner Linda Ruthardt, the court-appointed receiver who is
charged with coming up with a rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   Goetchius said Ruthardt's staff and two outside auditing firms _
Price WaterhouseCoopers for Harvard Pilgrim and KPMG Peat Marwick
retained by the insurance division _ are expected to work through
the weekend to reexamine the health plan's tangled accounting
records, digging as far back as 1997 for more hidden debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a very big surprise on Jan. 3rd, and obviously,
we'd like to know if there are any more,'' Goetchius said. ``We'd
also like to get a more exact accounting of what they owe and what
kinds of things are outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was confident that there aren't further unpleasant
surprises lurking in those books, Ruthardt replied: ``To be honest,
I'm not. If I felt confident I wouldn't have gone into
receivership. I'm hoping to know before the first week in February,
when I make my next report to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   While state officials begin their financial archeology, Harvard
Plan executives scrambled to assure their customers that they can
deliver services and survive over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been thousands of phone calls and e-mails,'' said
Harvard Pilgrim spokesman Alan Raymond. ``We're sending letters to
all our providers and employers who use the plan, anybody we feel
would benefit from communication from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried Harvard Pilgrim patients and health care providers have
also been calling state agencies to ask about the Harvard Pilgrim
crisis. The attorney general's office has received about 1,500
telephone calls since Wednesday, and traffic on its website has
been twice the normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is inviting Harvard Pilgrim subscribers and
providers to register questions and complaints through a hotline,
1-888-830-MASS.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers may have valid complaints about denial of care.
For instance, one woman said a pediatrician in the HMO's network
said she was no longer accepting Harvard Pilgrim patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would violate the court injunction, which requires that
all provides in the network continue to provide services to all
Harvard Pilgrim members,'' Richland said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubts began to surface Friday about whether Harvard
Pilgrim could survive without a tax-funded bailout of some sort _
whether an outright grant or perhaps a loan, similar to the federal
government's loan in the Chrysler Corporation case.
</P>
<P>
   Two planned bond issues that would have yielded Harvard Pilgrim
up to $237 million were cancelled on Tuesday when the additional
1999 debts were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   With the bond deal at least temporarily on the rocks, some
industry leaders said Harvard Pilgrim is unlikely to find an
alternative way of raising enough money to get back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody sees how they can do it on their own,'' said an
executive at another major health plan who asked not to be
identified. ``That looks very grim. The only way I see them
surviving is a state bailout.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office will assess the ability of other
Massachusetts HMOs to absorb Harvard Pilgrim's million-plus
subscribers if the health plan does fail. But Richland said such
speculation is premature.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, the state's second-largest HMO, Friday
challenged a published report that its financial reserves sank to
only 16 days of cash on hand last summer, compared with Harvard
Pilgrim's 34 days.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-day figure didn't take into account $147 million in stock
investments, Tufts officials said. Including that money, the health
plan had 47 days of available cash. Though Tufts is expected to
post losses of $45 million for 1999, its condition has improved
through the year, said chief financial officer Richard Hallworth.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, where Harvard Pilgrim's subsidiary declared
bankruptcy last fall, Secretary of State Jim Langevin proposed
borrowing $7 million from the state's rainy day fund to help former
Harvard Pilgrim doctors build new practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't only about helping doctors, but providing an
adequate pool of doctors for our patients,'' Langevin said.

THE TURMOIL BEHIND THE BROWSER AT VALUE AMERICA

<TEXT>
<P>
   A nagging question lingers as one new Internet company after
another bursts into public view, offering glittering Web sites,
charismatic founders, innovative business models, surging sales and
soaring stocks. What, exactly, is going on behind the screen?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, at least in the case of Value America, the once
highflying Internet department store based in Charlottesville, Va.,
is not pretty. It is also most likely not unique to the company,
though a war among board members that broke out in recent months
has focused considerable public attention on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Craig Winn, a co-founder and the chairman, and his
handpicked chief executive, Tom Morgan, have left the company. And
the new chief, Glenda Dorchak, has put forward a turnaround plan
that repudiates much of what Winn did.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the discord, each faction is in remarkable agreement about
many elements of the Value America saga:
</P>
<P>
   They agree the company has been mismanaged. They accept that
entrepreneurial founders of companies are often not the best
executives to run them as they grow. And they say that things have
gone so far off track for Value America that it would probably be
better off if it were bought, at least in part, by a larger
company.
</P>
<P>
   As to what the management errors were and who made them,
however, there is no shortage of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Such recriminations, about tactics, people and plans, are likely
to reverberate around many companies in the next year as the wings
melt off many an Internet Icarus. Some companies are realizing that
the rising tide of e-commerce did not in fact raise their ships.
And some investors are beginning to see the downside of backing
companies that put growth over discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Value America's board ultimately came to accept the view of Ms.
Dorchak, who had been president, that the company had expanded too
fast, selling a sprawling jumble of goods from barbecue grills to
breakfast cereal, when most of its business was in computers and
office products.
</P>
<P>
   William D. Savoy, a board member, said Value America stumbled,
as much as anything, because it lost the confidence of Wall Street.
``They got themselves in a box by creating different expectations
than what the company's core competencies were,'' said Savoy, who
represents the interests of the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen,
a Value America backer.
</P>
<P>
   Winn defends the broad selection and grand pronouncements to
investors. And he contends that Morgan and Ms. Dorchak mishandled
the company's marketing and botched a computer upgrade. ``There
will be no slow-growing e-tailing companies,'' Winn said. ``I
believe that entrepreneurs should eventually phase themselves out,
and I handed an aggressive and well-managed company over to Tom in
March. In retrospect, the company needed the entrepreneurial spirit
and leadership for another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dorchak declined to be interviewed. Morgan said Winn did not
criticize his leadership while he was chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts and competitors raise a more fundamental
question about the business model developed by Winn, who
established Value America as the most virtual of companies. It
holds no inventory, simply passing the telephone and Internet
orders it receives to manufacturers, which send goods directly to
the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, manufacturers have been so lackadaisical
about shipping that customers have suffered unusual delays.
</P>
<P>
   The current scene at Value America could not be more different
than on April 8, 1999, the day after its initial public offering.
The stock hit $55 a share, giving the company a market valuation of
$3.2 billion and making Winn, who owns 35 percent of the company, a
paper billionaire for 24 hours. The shares have been on a steady
slide since, closing on Friday at $5, for a market value of $224
million.
</P>
<P>
   With the luxury of hindsight, investors might have seen some
warning signs. The company's initial prospectus disclosed that its
auditors found significant gaps in its inventory tracking system,
although the issue was cleared up before the offering. And Dynasty
Classics, the lighting company that Winn founded and ran from 1986
to 1993, wound up in Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   None of this kept investors from flocking to the offering. And
who could blame them, in a market where everybody is making it up
as they go along?
</P>
<P>
   Winn's energetic persuasion attracted a star-studded list of
investors, including Allen; the FDX Corp., parent of Federal
Express; and Frederick W. Smith, its chairman. He also persuaded
some of the world's biggest manufacturers, including IBM and
General Electric, to sell their products through Value America.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, revenues grew even faster than projected.
But so did expenses, and Value America's underwriters, Robertson
Stephens, downgraded the company several times, out of fear that it
was not getting the leverage from its huge expenditures on
newspaper and television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Winn reacted to the falling stock price alternately by telling
investors that they were applying flawed analysis and by making
ever bolder promises about the company's future plans. That was a
particular frustration to the company's management and board
because Morgan, who became chief executive in March, was supposed
to be the one dealing with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   By November, Morgan, angry that Winn was meddling in management
affairs, handed in his resignation. Winn convinced him to stay, but
they continued to spar. Two weeks later, Morgan resigned again;
this time, Winn accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves started a monthlong battle for the soul of the
company. The board appointed Ms. Dorchak as chief and Wolfgang R.
Schmitt, former chief of Rubbermaid, as chairman. They contended
that the company should pare its product line and focus on serving
business and government customers rather than consumers. Winn, then
still a board member, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the board decided to back Ms. Dorchak's plan to
switch gears and dismiss nearly half the company's 600 employees.
Winn and his co-founder, Rex Scatena, who owns 15 percent of the
company, left the board.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been running through its cash, now $100 million,
at a rate of $10 million a month. Smith of FDX has been put at the
helm of a committee charged with considering a sale of all or part
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Board members say Value America's technology would be of great
value to a traditional retail company looking to catch up with the
Internet leaders. But with Value America's founders gone and its
strategies repudiated, buyers will have to think long and hard
about what is left behind the screen.

MANY ENGINES LIFT FIVE PORFOLIOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most mutual fund investors closed 1999 with fireworks,
rebounding smartly from third-quarter losses in a stock market led
by technology and smaller issues.
</P>
<P>
   The market revival brought plenty of cheer to investors with
diversified portfolios, including the five professional money
managers who have built hypothetical retirement portfolios for The
New York Times. All five earned double-digit returns in the fourth
quarter, and four of the five beat the average return of 19.6
percent for diversified domestic equity funds as tracked by Lipper
Inc. All five outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which posted a 14.5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the managers expects those heady returns to
continue. ``I believe we are in a bubble that has the potential to
end badly,'' said Sheldon Jacobs, who edits The No-Load Fund
Investor in Irvington, N.Y. ``The market is overvalued by a number
of measures, and the advance this year has been narrow, focusing on
technology stocks. I would look to see whether the market broadens
out in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was the leader for the quarter, with a portfolio gain of
27.68 percent. He rode the strength of the technology sector with
stakes in Janus Olympus, Marsico Focus and T. Rowe Price Science
and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of 2000, he is consolidating most of his
15 percent holding in the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which mimics the
S&AMP;P 500, into an existing 35 percent position in the Vanguard Total
Stock Market fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Total Stock Market is 80 percent invested in the S&AMP;P
500,'' Jacobs said, ``the remaining 20 percent is in mid- and
small-cap stocks, which I think will do relatively better in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He is increasing his international exposure by taking 5 percent
of the portfolio's assets out of his index-fund position and
redirecting them to Asia and Europe in equal measure. Strong Asia
Pacific and Scudder Greater Europe will each get one-tenth of the
portfolio; the Scudder fund replaces T. Rowe Price European Stock,
which has performed less strongly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs retains the lead among the five managers with a gain of
212.31 percent since the contest began in July 1993. In that time,
the five portfolios have grown by an average of 174.71 percent,
compared with a 277.92 percent return for the Vanguard 500 Index
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical portfolios' performances are tracked each
quarter by Lipper, the research firm in Summit, N.J. They exclude
sales charges and transaction costs, and because most retirement
money is held in tax-deferred accounts, the effects of taxes are
excluded. The five managers can choose from among all funds open to
new investors and can shift money quarterly. The portfolios are
meant to grow until July 2013, some 20 years after the competition
began.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also gave a big boost to Eric M. Kobren,
president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in
Wellesley, Mass. His all-Fidelity portfolio rose 25.49 percent in
the quarter, the second best of the five.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, Kobren is dropping Fidelity International Value
and Fidelity Capital Appreciation, beefing up Fidelity Aggressive
Growth and adding Fidelity Europe Capital Appreciation. ``I think
Europe could surprise everyone in how rapidly it will incorporate
technology into the workplace and garner productivity improvements,
focus on improving shareholder value, accelerate cross-border
acquisitions and show improved economic growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he is sanguine about the American economy, he is worried
about investors' seeming greed. ``The percent of household assets
in equities is at historically high levels,'' he said. ``My advice
to investors is to control their expectations and not become
complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack A. Brill, who has joined Natural Investment Services in San
Diego as vice president, created a ``socially responsible'' fund
portfolio that took third place for the quarter with a gain of
20.73 percent, buoyed by technology issues in IPS Millennium and
Citizens Emerging Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Following his view that broad portfolio diversification will be
more important than ever in the coming year, Brill is moving 6
percent of his portfolio's assets into Calvert New Visions, a
small-cap fund that blends growth and value stocks, while trimming
positions in Ariel Appreciation and MMA Praxis International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the coming year will be very volatile,'' Brill said.
``I am optimistic that the market will rise, but less than in 1999.
Technology stocks will continue to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
plans no changes in his broadly diversified portfolio in the first
quarter, despite placing fourth in the most recent period with a
19.98 percent gain. His market outlook is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the large-cap domestic market going straight up,
nor do I see it achieving `riskless' returns remotely comparable to
those of the '90s,'' he said, adding that investors might
reasonably expect returns in the range of 9 percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dziubinski, until recently editor of Morningstar Fund
Investor, was in fifth place for the quarter with a gain of 17.68
percent. Ms. Dziubinski is handing over the reins to Russel Kinnel,
director of the Morningstar.com Web site, who is replacing all the
holdings for the new quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Large chunks will go into the Vanguard 500 Index as a low-cost
diversified anchor, and into MAS Mid-Cap Growth Institutional for
inexpensive but superior performance, he said. T. Rowe Price Small
Cap has the potential for above-average returns with lower risk,
Kinnell said.
</P>
<P>
   For overseas exposure, Kinnel will place 18 percent of the
portfolio's assets in Fidelity Diversified International, a
quantitatively run fund, and 8 percent in Harbor International
Growth, whose 30 stocks are selected with a growth slant, he said.
A concentrated fund, Oakmark Select, and MSDW Institutional U.S.
Real Estate round out the new portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether technology stocks continue to deliver good growth has
a lot to do with where the market goes,'' he said, adding that 2000
can't possibly be as good 1999.

THOSE LITTLE DVD EXTRAS HELP PRESERVE THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: replace (AT) with that squiggly computer `at' symbol for the
e-mail address at the bottom). 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite things about the DVD explosion is that so
many of the discs, and certainly the ones I highlight in this
column, come loaded with extras designed to appeal to movie fans.
Those extras are almost never included on video releases, and often
are otherwise just plain unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But they're great fun for movie buffs, and in many cases,
important tools in helping fans understand a film's historical
import and what prodigious effort was needed to create it.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly so with the documentaries that are commonly
included on DVDs of most major releases. The productions have even
created a dream job for one West Hollywood-based Frenchman, Laurent
Bouzereau, who has now done 24 of them, first for laser disc
releases and now for the burgeoning DVD market, for some of the
biggest films by some of the biggest directors ever, from Alfred
Hitchcock to Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up outside of Paris, Bouzereau said, he was a little
different from many of the kids he knew. Not only was he a big
movie fan, as many French are, he particularly loved big,
mainstream American movies, which many of his countrymen disdain as
too commercial.
</P>
<P>
   He particularly loved the work of directors such as Brian
DePalma, George Lucas and Martin Scorsese, so much so that at 19,
he came to Hollywood with few skills and no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all kinds of jobs in the film business: I was a
publicist, a journalist, did feature development for Bette
Midler,'' Bouzereau said. ``I had all kinds of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote six books, including one, when he was 25, about
DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, (laser disc maker) Criterion contacted me to do a
commentary on (DePalma's) `Carrie' for laser disc,'' Bouzereau
said. ``That's when I discovered that whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently was asked to direct the documentary for
Spielberg's modest comedy, ``1941.'' That led to a series of other
laser disc projects, with his last in that now-fading medium in
late 1998, for the release of Spielberg's ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's mostly been doing projects for DVD release,
including three about-to-be-released Hitchcock films: ``Rear
Window,'' ``The Birds'' and ``Marnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent projects include both the original and remake of
``Cape Fear,'' along with ``The Last Picture Show,'' and the ``Back
to the Future'' trilogy. And in a new venture, Bouzereau shot a
``making of'' documentary during the production of ``Snow Falling
on Cedars'' that will be used to help promote the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that's going to be sad is that a lot of
classics are going to be forgotten or left behind,'' Bouzereau
said. ``The only way for them to survive or not be forgotten is to
reinvent them for another medium and that's DVD. Documenting the
history of those movies is my own small contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating documentaries about older films can be especially
difficult, because studios once routinely tossed or lost most
archival materials, outtakes and other odds and ends that could be
used to flesh out a documentary. Thankfully, Bouzereau said,
studios now realize the value of that material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are very careful about saving stuff now,''
Bouzereau said. ``Before, stuff was trashed or not catalogued
properly, or lost and never heard from again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does find archival material, there are other
challenges with older films.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Rear Window,' everybody that's a recognizable name is
gone,'' Bouzereau said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating, of course, is that star Jimmy Stewart was
still alive just a few years ago and could have talked about the
film's making, had someone thought to do it then.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of big names, Bouzereau tracked down one of the actresses
Stewart's character spies on in the film, to provide viwers a sense
of what it was like during shooting. And to give viewers a critical
understanding of the film, he also interviewed a prominent
Hitchcock scholar and Oscar-winning writer-director Curtis Hanson,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Bouzereau, who started his work with little training as a
director, said he tries to create a different tone when he is
interviewing his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a difficult process for them to talk about an
old movie they made,'' Bouzereau said. ``I try to make it
technically very simple and use a very small crew, so the talent is
not intimidated. There's a real sense of something kind of warm.
We're just chatting about the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital explosion has created a whole new field for film
freaks like Bouzereau, both as creators and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird business,'' Bouzereau said, marveling at his own
good fortune. ``I never thought I'd be able to put to good use that
kind of passion that I had for movies. If you have kids and aren't
sure why they're passionate about something, it's important to
encourage that, because you don't know what it will lead to. It
didn't pay off for me for years. Now my parents say, `Hey, you've
found the perfect job for you.''' &QL;

   Think (wish?) Pokemon fever is abating here or in Japan? Nah.
Nintendo says it sold 1 million units of Pokemon Yellow when that
Game Boy title hit U.S. shores ... in a two-week span. That would
make it the fastest-selling videogame here ever, Nintendo claimed.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, the company finally released Pokemon Gold and
Silver, the game's latest iteration, and sold 1.8 million units in
just one !ital!day!off!. Another 600,000 units had been sold by
Dec. 1, the company said. For 8-year-olds, it's a Pokemad, mad,
mad, mad world. &QL;

 &HT;    Southern Co. plans ad effort
 &HT;    to bolster image
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Southern Co. launches an $8 million yearlong national
advertising campaign next week to promote the company as a
dependable source of energy as the nation's $250 billion utility
industry is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the industry is ``full of uncertainty'' with the
transition to deregulation, the newspaper and magazine ads tout
Southern as a ``constant, dependable source of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the strength to fulfill our commitments when other
companies scramble for resources. In fact, we've honored all of our
energy contracts,'' says one of the new ads.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spencer, Southern's director of external affairs, said
the new ads are aimed at three audiences: Wall Street, Washington
policy-makers and potential customers for Southern's growing
national wholesale energy business. ``We want people to buy our
stock and know we're a good value, come to us for advice in the
policy arena and to sell to large customers,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign begins Tuesday with a full-page ad in The Wall
Street Journal that says Southern generates more electricity than
any of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It's Southern's third major national marketing effort in three
years. Southern became the first utility to launch a national ad
campaign in 1997 with a $14 million campaign aimed at building
brand awareness with a broader range of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has also incorporated its Southeastern utilities, such
as Georgia Power Co., into its ``branding'' effort to shore up its
image at home. The parent company's logo has been hoisted to the
top of Georgia Power's downtown Atlanta headquarters. The company
spent $22 million for advertising in 1998 and 1999. The new
campaign is less expensive because it is aimed at targeted
audiences and includes no TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   As national momentum toward deregulation has slowed, Southern
has adopted a strategy that targets five high-growth regions around
the country for wholesale electricity and natural gas sales.
Spencer said the new campaign reflects that shift.
</P>
<P>
   Southern now hopes to influence potential investors in Southern
and inside-the-Beltway elected officials and regulators who will
have a say in deregulation and other legislation that could affect
the company. Southern also wants to reach executives at a growing
number of utilities and large companies that already have the
ability to shop for electricity among competing suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign will be focused on print publications that
circulate in those audiences. These include Bloomberg Magazine,
Barron's, Institutional Investor, The Washington Post, The New York
Times and the Capitol Hill publications Roll Call, Congressional
Quarterly and The Hill. Energy trade publications that reach energy
decision-makers and Internet ads are also anticipated.

 &HT;    Credit boost helps Huffy
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ The investment banker looking at the possible
sale, merger or other strategic alternative for Huffy Corp. has
presented the company with some proposals but no decisions have
been made, according to Don R. Graber, Huffy chairman, president
and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing they've brought back that we agree, `This is a
wonderful idea,''' Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came Friday, the day after Huffy Corp. announced
that seven lenders had agreed to extend a $175 million line of
credit to the company. The pact requires that Huffy meet financial
and performance goals set mutually by the company and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Graber said those lenders have been in contact with PaineWebber
Inc., the investment banker Huffy hired in November after
defaulting on loans, bouncing checks and failing to honor dividend
checks.
</P>
<P>
   He said lenders are not mandating that Huffy accept
PaineWebber's proposals for strategic alternatives, which could
include a sale, merger, joint venture or partnership for some or
all of the company as it struggles to put the bicycle division on
sound footing. Graber has emphasized that a viable alternative for
Huffy Corp. includes remaining independent.
</P>
<P>
   There are changes afoot internally, however, with a new top
financial officer charged with improving lender relationships and
devising a better financial structure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lafferty replaces former chief financial officer Tom
Frederick, who becomes vice president of corporate strategy.
Lafferty, who also will hold the titles treasurer and vice
president of finance, comes from Gencor Industries Inc., a Florida
manufacturer of food processing equipment. He served as senior vice
president and chief financial officer at Gencor. Prior to that he
had financial positions with Hoechst Marion Roussel and Dow
Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Where Frederick's financial expertise is primarily on the
operational side, Lafferty brings extensive experience in working
with banks and structuring arrangements like Huffy's new line of
credit, Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pay a lot more attention to our lender
communications and relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has more to do in the cash management area
and needs to better organize and strengthen its financial
structure. While the lenders reporting demands are ``disciplined,''
they are not ``onerous'' and the targets are in line with Huffy's
own projections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lafferty said he took the job because it looked interesting and
he sees strength in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the basic business, I thought this was
something that could be turned around, righted,'' Lafferty said.
</P>
<P>
   Graber said the company's sporting goods, assembly and inventory
services divisions are strong, so the challenge for 2000 is to put
the bicycle division on the same footing. The restructuring of the
division is complete _ the remaining two American plants closed in
early December and a supplier network is in place in Asia and
Mexico. The company will save $20 million annually in operational
costs by pulling out of the bicycle manufacturing business, a
decision Graber called painful but necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This year Huffy will introduce a line of bicycles, capitalizing
on the extreme sports market, and is diving head-first into
Internet sales of high-end Airborne bicycles, Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring has strengthened Huffy's hand and the new line
of credit brings flexibility to make operational and strategic
improvements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Leibowitz said analysts had expected Huffy to
negotiate a new line of credit, but investors are likely waiting to
see what else happens before interest in Huffy stock drives the
price back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are there,'' said Leibowitz, managing
director for Burnham Securities in New York. ``It's a question of
how quickly we can see some top line growth, which would permit the
company to benefit from the efficiencies that have been put into
place.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Huffy stock (NYSE:HUF) closed at 6 3/16, up 1/16, but
still far from its 52-week high of 16 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Graber said he believes investors are waiting until the line of
credit paperwork is finalized in a couple of weeks, which also is
when the company will honor dividend checks it could not pay during
the November cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The need to improve shareholder value has been a constant
concern during Graber's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we don't deserve long-term to be at six dollars and
change,'' he said.

BRADLEY, GORE CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF IOWA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ While Bill Bradley depicted his campaign as an
insurgency ``against entrenched power,'' Vice President Al Gore
demonstrated his connections to influential Democrats by
barnstorming through Iowa Friday with Senator Edward M. Kennedy on
the eve of another debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore will meet here Saturday in an hourlong,
nationally televised debate at 2 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Although there appear to be no stark differences between the two
Democratic presidential candidates, Bradley used the hours before
he began private debate preparation to renew his pitch for a
universal health care program that Gore has criticized as too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continues to reject Gore's proposal to replace
television commercials with frequent public debates. Nevertheless,
Saturday's encounter will be their fifth of the political season,
and another Iowa debate is scheduled for Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley say Gore's insistence on more debates is an
attempt to divert Bradley from efforts to build a national
organization to compete with the vice president's extensive
operation.
</P>
<P>
   In a Des Moines press conference, Bradley said it would ``not be
a major blow'' to his campaign if he lost in Iowa, and he pointed
out some of Gore's obvious advantages: the support of the White
House political apparatus, the blessings of organized labor, the
loyalty of most members of the Democratic National Committee, and
the financial backing of well-connected fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's alliance extends to the state level. A majority of Iowa's
Democratic legislators and state officials have endorsed Gore, and
Senator Tom Harkin is prepared to throw his organization behind the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In a caucus situation, the impressive coalition would seem to
give Gore an edge when Iowans cast the first votes in the 2000
presidential campaign Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted this week for several Iowa television stations
found that Gore's lead had slipped since he held a 39-point lead
last summer. The survey of 300 likely caucus voters gave Gore 45.4
percent and Bradley 32.3 percent, while showing 22.3 percent
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 5.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors that may have narrowed the race is Gore's tie
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has not campaigned for Gore in Iowa, Bradley's
state campaign manager, Dan Lucas, says, ``Bill Clinton is
everywhere. He's like Banquo's ghost. In terms of the calculations
people are making, they're wondering: Do we want to give a third
term to Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how the Clinton connection will play here.
Throughout his seven years in office and his impeachment ordeal,
the president maintained a base in Iowa, a state he carried in 1992
and 1996. Despite his troubles, he remains popular, Iowa Democratic
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's strategists say they have been able to develop a
following among Democrats weary of Clinton and eager to make a
fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Hildebrand, the director of Gore's campaign in Iowa,
was asked the other day if he wanted Clinton to campaign here for
Gore, he paused before replying. ``That has not really been talked
about,'' he said. ``That's something you'll have to ask the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Gore campaign had no reservations about Kennedy's
appearance, even though the Massachusetts senator has had his own
personal problems and was beaten badly in Iowa when he challenged
President Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Hildebrand said, ``Kennedy's become
the father of the party,'' a champion of Catholic voters, laborers,
and liberals _ constituencies Kennedy campaigned among Friday in
Dubuque, which is heavily Catholic; the working-class city of Cedar
Rapids, and the prosperous suburb of West Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was preceded by Representative Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, who spoke for Gore in several other Iowa cities this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Though both Gore and Bradley danced around the term ``liberal''
without disavowing it during a debate in New Hampshire on Wednesday
night, their campaigns have been targeting liberals here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying in Iowa,'' said Lucas of the Bradley
campaign. ``You can't be too liberal. This state always had a huge
peace community.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bradley reached out to that group by announcing that he
would sign the Ottawa treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jody
Williams, a leader of the campaign against land mines, praised
Bradley. In Iowa to press presidential candidates on the issue, she
said: ``We want them to say they will sign it immediately. I have
read that Gore has endorsed the treaty. That is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton has not signed the treaty, she called Gore's
position ``an echo of the hollow policies of the Clinton
administration.''

<P>
   In its second round of major changes this week, Coca-Cola
announced Friday that its chief marketing officer, Charles S.
Frenette, would be president of its troubled European operations.
His replacement is a veteran of Coke's business in Japan, long the
biggest single profit source for the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Carl H. Ware, the company's highest ranking black
executive who said in November that he would step down later this
year, was named executive vice president for corporate affairs and
government relations. Ware's departure plans, disclosed after a
management shuffle that effectively demoted him, had caused concern
within Atlanta's civil rights community and among some investors,
particularly since the company is facing a racial-discrimination
lawsuit filed by eight of its black employees.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard in the marketing department comes just
days before the company is supposed to announce its new campaign
for Coca-Cola Classic. The campaign, which urges the consumption of
ice-cold Coke in hopes of increasing sales and was developed under
Frenette, will now be supervised by Stephen C. Jones, who has spent
the last five years overseeing Coke's operations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There Jones worked closely with Douglas N. Daft, Coke's
president and chief operating officer who is expected to become
chairman and chief executive in three months. Jones supervised some
200 brands sold in Japan, where sales were flat in 1998 compared
with 1997 but appear to have been improving lately. He was named
head of the company's Minute Maid juice business in late October;
his successor in that position has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be intriguing to watch,'' said Andrew J. Conway, a
beverage stocks analyst for Morgan Stanley. ``This will be a year
of Steve Jones coming up to speed on the marketing issues in
several important profit centers, not only the U.S., where the
concentrate-price increase means Coke has to be a meaningfully more
efficient marketer, but also in Europe and Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones had barely unpacked in Houston, where Minute Maid is
based, the openings created by the retirement of William P. Casey
as president of Coke's European business made him a candidate for
the marketing job. ``The timing allowed Doug Daft to move Steve
into this position without a whole lot of disruption to Minute
Maid,'' said a company spokesman, Ben Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette will replace Casey, 58, who is retiring after 32 years
with Coke, much of that on the bottling side. He was appointed
president of Europe in 1998 by M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's chairman
and chief executive who is retiring in April.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Coke had the biggest product recall in its history in
Belgium, which cost the company an estimated $200 million in
marketing and other costs to alleviate the damage to its image,
which spread beyond Belgium to France, Spain and other parts of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette was named the company's chief marketer just 22 months
ago. He spent a large part of last year in Belgium, supervising the
marketing of Coca-Cola in the wake of the recall, which included
giveaways of Coke that officials ordered stopped after competitors
complained.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from recent Coca-Cola tradition, Frenette
will be based in London and A.R.C. Allan, who was named head of the
Asian and Middle East operations in October, will be based in Hong
Kong. Jones will be based in Atlanta, although other executives
might soon find their headquarters moved closer to the territory
they oversee as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's move from Atlanta is the first concrete evidence
we've seen of the decentralization of Coke's top management,'' said
John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daft is likely to make other changes in the company's highest
echelons before the Coke board meets on Jan. 18, Sicher added. Most
analysts expect him to tap Jack Stahl, a senior vice president who
oversees business in the United States and Latin America, as his
president and chief operating officer, and say the announcement
could come early next week. Stahl, a former chief financial officer
at the company who was the second-highest-paid executive in 1998
after Ivester, has long been seen as a candidate for the top jobs
at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would complement each other very nicely _ Jack the
strength in financial, Doug Daft the strength in operational,''
said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for
Merrill Lynch. Ivester's refusal to name a second-in-command
worried some on Wall Street and may have been one of the sticking
points between him and the board that led him to resign suddenly
last month, although neither he nor anyone on the board has
publicly said that.
</P>
<P>
   One question that remains is whether James E. Chestnut, the
chief financial officer until last month, will stay on. Chestnut
was given wider responsibilities, including technical services,
corporate affairs and government relations, in the management
shuffle Ivester announced in October. Several of his duties are now
being handled by Ware, and Gary P. Fayard, the new chief financial
officer, may end up reporting to Daft or Stahl.

VENTURA AND TRUMP STIR THE POLITICAL POT 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. _ It was politics as theater, and the
matinee attractions Friday were ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura and
mogul-playboy Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   That Ventura is now governor of Minnesota and Trump is pondering
a bid for the Reform Party's presidential nomination bears witness
to the varied tapestry that public life in America can sometimes
weave.
</P>
<P>
   That Ventura and Trump may join forces alerts the body politic
to keep the smelling salts handy.
</P>
<P>
   That on the other side of the Reform Party chasm, spoiling for a
fight, are Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan and similarly colorful
characters from the political fringe has put spring in the wintry
step of late-night television monologue writers and talk-show hosts
of all stripe.
</P>
<P>
   That all this is being taken seriously _ and watched nervously,
especially by Republicans _ points to what could be another
fractious election season in which the two major parties must again
defend their domination of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, the billionaire developer, flew to the Twin Cities area
aboard his customized Boeing 747 to confer with Ventura, the senior
Reform Party officer holder in the nation, and stir the party's
presidential pot.
</P>
<P>
   It was a love feast, but stopped short of Ventura endorsing
Trump's possible campaign. The governor explained that if he
stepped out now and Trump didn't run, he would appear foolish, and
``I don't like looking stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump did not commit to running but dismissed talk that he was
on the political circuit just to boost sales of his fourth book, a
volume on public policy titled, ``The America We Deserve.'' Trump
conceded it was probably easier to peddle his earlier three titles,
all best-sellers, on how to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking very, very seriously as to whether or not it can
be won,'' Trump said of a presidential race. ``If I can win, I
think I can do a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump had been less equivocal in an interview with The
Associated Press earlier Friday when he said only one thing would
keep him out of the race: ``Death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trump told a larger group of reporters that perceptions of
his status are a problem for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think that I'm running, we'll do great,'' he said.
``A lot of people say, `Aw, he's maybe not going to run, he's just
having lots of fun.' That's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosaic point of Trump's trip was to speak to a luncheon
meeting of some suburban chambers of commerce in this Minneapolis
suburb, where Ventura got his political start by winning the
nonpartisan mayor's job in 1990, and to star at a fund-raising
reception for Ventura's political committee. In between, they held
a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Money is the main issue in the fight for the Reform nomination,
attractive since Perot drew almost 20 percent of the national
popular vote on the third-party line in 1992, said Phil Madsen,
founding chairman of the Minnesota Reform Party. Money's needed for
petition drives to get on state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trump has it, Buchanan doesn't,'' Madsen said. Buchanan gave
up his campaign for the Republican nomination last year and was
welcomed to the Reform race by the faction of the party loyal to
Perot, its founder and major funder.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform nominee will be decided by a vote of party members _
by mail, e-mail, phone _ that will precede a national convention
scheduled for early August. The Perot faction has announced the
meeting will be in Long Beach, Calif., but Ventura's backers want
it moved to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Once selected, the Reform Party nominee will be entitled to
$12.5 million in general-election campaign funds from the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Trump and Ventura joined to lambaste the decision of the
commission on presidential debates to prohibit any presidential
candidate without 15 percent popular support in a group of polls to
participate in the fall debates, a decisive element in the national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a clear case of them fearing there could be
another Jesse Ventura and that they're going to stop it any way
they possibly can,'' the governor said. Ventura recalled that he
was polling only 10 percent as the 1998 general-election campaign
began in Minnesota. ``It shows great fear on their part'' that a
lesser-ranked candidate can be included in debates ``and can turn
around in a mere six weeks and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and Trump said the commission is dominated by lobbyists
aligned with Democrats or Republicans, ``and they don't make money
off us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aspersions were cast freely.
</P>
<P>
   Trump made clear he had little use for the current crowd of
presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these people stiffs or what?'' Trump asked the luncheon
audience, referring to the candidate debates he'd seen on
television this week. Ninety percent of the folks in the Northland
Hotel ballroom were ``more capable,'' he assured listeners.
</P>
<P>
   As for Buchanan, Trump said: ``I don't think about him very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Clinton administration foreign policy, Trump said it
was being run by ``a bunch of weak sisters'' who on international
trade issues acted as ``a whipping post.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too much tact and diplomacy'' in dealing with supposed
friends and enemies alike overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said that because of his international business dealings
he knows some foreign leaders ``better than the so-called
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly set straight a questioner who wondered whether it
was really the time for a rich guy to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come from great wealth. I built a lot of great
wealth,'' Trump said, contrasting himself to other current
candidates whom he said were from the ``lucky sperm club'' and born
into great financial or political families.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few of them around,'' Trump said later. He refused
to point the finger at contenders such as Republicans Steve Forbes,
the multimillionaire publisher; or Gov. George Bush of Texas, the
multimillionaire son of a former president and grandson of a
senator; or Democrat Al Gore, the vice president, whose father was
also in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Trump also said he preferred a wealthy candidate over ``losers''
who brag about being from a poor family for generations untold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who the hell wants to have a person like this for president?''
Trump demanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Trump also recalled he'd bounced back from being $9.2
billion down in the early 1990s. ``The world was coming to an
end,'' he said.

SOLUTION TO HARVARD PILGRIM WOES WILL TAKE MORE THAN A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Warning there may be more financial bombshells buried
deep in Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's books, state officials say it
will take them more than 30 days to put together a plan to save the
ailing health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   When the state took over management of the $2.8 billion-a-year
health plan on Tuesday, it promised the Supreme Judicial Court a
rescue plan within a month. But officials Friday backpedaled on
that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically what we'll be able to do in 30 days is to report
back to the court as to what our status is,'' said Dean Richland,
who is Atty. General Thomas Reilly's first deputy. ``We're not in a
position to say we'll have a plan in 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is a critical factor in the efforts to save New England's
largest health maintenance organization, because pressure is
building from the HMO's creditors, who want their money, and from
its customers, especially large employer groups which must decide
in the next few months whether to stay with Harvard Pilgrim or jump
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Richland said the task of coming up with a rehabilitation plan
for the HMO ``is complicated by the fact that we don't know what
the real financial condition of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care is
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Any new financial surprises could well affect the structure and
feasibility of any plan to rehabilitate Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we know the worst, but I don't think we know the
worst yet,'' Richland said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Only last weekend, according to Harvard Pilgrim officials,
accountants discovered an additional $58.5 million in financial
losses for 1999, on top of $118.5 million in projected losses.
Faced with that revelation, state officials asked the state's high
court to put the health maintenance organization into state
receivership to block creditors from demanding payment _ a scenario
that would have led to the HMO's total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials don't even know how much Harvard Pilgrim owes
hospitals, doctors, suppliers and other creditors. ``We're told by
Harvard Pilgrim they owe something like $300 million, but they
don't know how much of that is real, since billing practices in the
health care industry aren't the greatest,'' Richland said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the $300 million figure dates from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated wrangling over Harvard Pilgrim indebtedness is
reflected by the Massachusetts Hospital Association's claim this
week that Harvard Pilgrim owes $300 million to hospitals alone. It
is not certain what the hospitals included in their aggregate
total.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Division of Insurance, Chris
Goetchius, indicated the daunting task that faces insurance
commissioner Linda Ruthardt, the court-appointed receiver who is
charged with coming up with a rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   Goetchius said Ruthardt's staff and two outside auditing firms _
Price WaterhouseCoopers for Harvard Pilgrim and KPMG Peat Marwick
retained by the insurance division _ are expected to work through
the weekend to reexamine the health plan's tangled accounting
records, digging as far back as 1997 for more hidden debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a very big surprise on Jan. 3rd, and obviously,
we'd like to know if there are any more,'' Goetchius said. ``We'd
also like to get a more exact accounting of what they owe and what
kinds of things are outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was confident that there aren't further unpleasant
surprises lurking in those books, Ruthardt replied: ``To be honest,
I'm not. If I felt confident I wouldn't have gone into
receivership. I'm hoping to know before the first week in February,
when I make my next report to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   While state officials begin their financial archeology, Harvard
Plan executives scrambled to assure their customers that they can
deliver services and survive over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been thousands of phone calls and e-mails,'' said
Harvard Pilgrim spokesman Alan Raymond. ``We're sending letters to
all our providers and employers who use the plan, anybody we feel
would benefit from communication from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried Harvard Pilgrim patients and health care providers have
also been calling state agencies to ask about the Harvard Pilgrim
crisis. The attorney general's office has received about 1,500
telephone calls since Wednesday, and traffic on its website has
been twice the normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is inviting Harvard Pilgrim subscribers and
providers to register questions and complaints through a hotline,
1-888-830-MASS.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers may have valid complaints about denial of care.
For instance, one woman said a pediatrician in the HMO's network
said she was no longer accepting Harvard Pilgrim patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would violate the court injunction, which requires that
all provides in the network continue to provide services to all
Harvard Pilgrim members,'' Richland said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubts began to surface Friday about whether Harvard
Pilgrim could survive without a tax-funded bailout of some sort _
whether an outright grant or perhaps a loan, similar to the federal
government's loan in the Chrysler Corporation case.
</P>
<P>
   Two planned bond issues that would have yielded Harvard Pilgrim
up to $237 million were cancelled on Tuesday when the additional
1999 debts were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   With the bond deal at least temporarily on the rocks, some
industry leaders said Harvard Pilgrim is unlikely to find an
alternative way of raising enough money to get back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody sees how they can do it on their own,'' said an
executive at another major health plan who asked not to be
identified. ``That looks very grim. The only way I see them
surviving is a state bailout.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office will assess the ability of other
Massachusetts HMOs to absorb Harvard Pilgrim's million-plus
subscribers if the health plan does fail. But Richland said such
speculation is premature.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, the state's second-largest HMO, Friday
challenged a published report that its financial reserves sank to
only 16 days of cash on hand last summer, compared with Harvard
Pilgrim's 34 days.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-day figure didn't take into account $147 million in stock
investments, Tufts officials said. Including that money, the health
plan had 47 days of available cash. Though Tufts is expected to
post losses of $45 million for 1999, its condition has improved
through the year, said chief financial officer Richard Hallworth.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, where Harvard Pilgrim's subsidiary declared
bankruptcy last fall, Secretary of State Jim Langevin proposed
borrowing $7 million from the state's rainy day fund to help former
Harvard Pilgrim doctors build new practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't only about helping doctors, but providing an
adequate pool of doctors for our patients,'' Langevin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Confronted with fierce rebel resistance, rising
casualties and bad weather, the Russian military announced Friday
that it was suspending its assault on the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the deputy commander of the Russian
troops fighting in the separatist region of Chechnya, said the
pause was intended to allow the thousands of civilians still
trapped in Grozny to escape. He did not say how long it would last.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military appeared to be putting the best face on an
increasingly difficult situation. The command also announced a
shakeup of its top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Though the orders were issued locally, they were likely
coordinated with Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president. Popular
support in Russia for the campaign in Chechnya has been a central
factor in Putin's rapid rise from an obscure prime minister to
acting president and front-runner in Russia's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that this support is waning, but there has
been widespread speculation that rising casualties or continued
setbacks could start to erode it.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension marks an abrupt change for Russia's generals, who
had vowed to make short work of the militants. Just last week, Col.
Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the general staff, predicted
that Grozny would be seized in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   But with Chechnya covered by a dense fog, the Russians have not
been able to use artillery and air power, which are vital to their
operation, to seize Grozny. Russian commanders have also been
surprised by the stubborn rebel resistance and may have been
compelled to rethink their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also use this as a short break for our personnel,''
Troshev said. ``We will regroup, and when we feel that the
civilians have left Grozny we will inflict a resolute and final
blow against the militants who sit in Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, the army said that Maj. Gen.
Vladimir Shamanov, a swaggering and contentious commander, was
removed from his post as the leader of the Western Group of Russian
forces, which is fighting in the southern foothills of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov declared last year that there would be mass
resignations and possibly even civil war if the Kremlin sought to
halt the military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Though such hawkish views on Chechnya are shared by many
civilians, his open challenge to Russia's political leaders was
unusual for a nation in which the military has generally stayed out
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates have also charged that Shamanov's troops
looted homes in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Yurt and executed
civilians who tried to stop them. Russian prosecutors are
investigating the episode, which has become an international
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There had been reports that Shamanov might be forced to retire.
Instead, he was among the Russian commanders in Chechnya who were
decorated with the country's highest military award, Hero of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Now,r, he appears to have been sidelined and will return
to his duties as commander of the 58th Army, which is deployed in
Vladikavkaz, west of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``His political activity went beyond the role outlined in the
constitution for the army, and Alkhan-Yurt was the last straw,''
said Yevgeny Krutikov, a correspondent for the Russian newspaper
Izvestiya.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov was replaced as commander of the Western Group by his
deputy, Major Gen. Aleksei Verbitsky.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev, who announced the suspension, also said he would
himself be replaced as commander of the Eastern Group of Russian
Forces in Chechnya, which is fighting in the Chechen highlands. He
said that his former deputy, Maj. Gen. Sergei Makarov, would take
the position and concentrate on duties as deputy commander of the
forces in the North Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops began the war three months ago by sweeping
through the northern plains and then steadily advancing in the
lowlands. The street fighting in the Chechen capital, however, has
proved more difficult.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Russian forces began their assault on Grozny on Dec. 26,
they planned to surround the rebels in the city and pound them with
artillery to weaken their resistance. Russian Interior Ministry
troops and commandos were then to move through Grozny
house-by-house to ensure that the city was free of rebels. But the
plan quickly ran into problems. The artillery destroyed many of
Grozny's buildings but not the cellars in which the rebels hid.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has generally shied away from carrying out
more powerful air strikes, fearing they would kill many of the tens
of thousands of civilians believed trapped in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers have also been vulnerable to ambushes and
snipers, and their casualty rate is climbing. A thick fog has also
rolled in and prevented the Russians from launching bombing
missions or making effective use of their artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of occupying the city's center, Russian forces have been
battling groups of rebels on its outskirts as the rebels try to
break out of the Russian encirclement.
</P>
<P>
   The dour mood was summed up by a report issued here Friday by
the Russian command, which bluntly stated that the situation in
Chechnya ``continues to remain complicated and tense.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the suspension of the bombardment of Grozny,
Troshev insisted that the evacuation of the city's civilians was
urgent, charging that the militants had blown up several tanks of
chlorine to poison the air and thwart the Russian attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an enemy is encircled they will resort to anything,'' he
said. ``All they want to do is inflict greater casualties on us
without thinking about the future of Grozny and Chechnya. Grozny
has officially been declared today a zone of ecological danger.''
</P>
<P>
   New tactics for taking Grozny seemed to be emerging. Troshev
implied that the civilians needed to leave to provide the Russian
forces with an even freer hand in launching punishing artillery and
air strikes against the city.
</P>
<P>
   The general said that leaflets were being dropped to encourage
the frightened population of Grozny to evacuate the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has scored some successes. Commanders say,
for example, that they have surrounded the town of Vedeno, the
hometown of Shamil Basayev, one of the main rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev said most of the rebel fighters are in the mountains,
with Basayev; Kattab, a rebel fighter who was born in the Middle
East; and Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen president. Only 500 to 1,000
militants are still in Grozny, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With winter and one of the densest fogs in years settling in,
however, the Russian military is afraid of becoming mired in
fighting in Grozny and the highlands. It also faces possible
guerrilla attacks behind its lines.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the difficulty of the military's mission, Troshev
began his news conference Friday by saying he would not discuss
Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me about losses,'' he cautioned. ``Every loss is a
tragedy. Let the analysts talk about this.''

COMMENTARY: `THIS HAS GOT ME IN SOME KIND OF WHIRLWIND' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (th) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mary Anne Gehris was brought to this country from
Germany when she was a little over a year old. She is 34 now, lives
near Atlanta and sounds like Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 she pulled another woman's hair in a quarrel over a man.
She was charged with battery, a misdemeanor, for that and for
grabbing the woman around the neck, which she says she did not do.
No witnesses appeared in court. On the advice of a public defender,
she pleaded guilty. As is the Georgia practice, the judge gave her
a one-year sentence, suspended for a year's probation.
</P>
<P>
   She has not been in any trouble since. She is married to a U.S.
citizen and has a 14-year-old child, also a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But now Ms. Gehris has a further problem from the hair-pulling
incident. The government is seeking to deport her from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the 1996 Immigration Act defined the trivial
misdemeanor to which she pleaded guilty, with its one-year
suspended sentence, as an ``aggravated felony'' requiring
deportation. And the law was made retroactive. So someone like Ms.
Gehris, who committed in 1988 what became an ``aggravated felony''
in 1996, was deportable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrifying thought,'' Ms. Gehris said when I telephoned
her, ``that you've lived in a country 33 years and then suddenly
you could be excluded from it. This has got me in some kind of
whirlwind. I live it, I breathe it, I eat it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an irony in Ms. Gehris' case. It happened because she
applied to become a citizen and answered questions put by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service honestly. In fact, she gave
the INS the Georgia documents about her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   When she got a government envelope in the mail last October, she
said, ``I thought it was a letter telling me to go ahead and get
sworn in as a citizen.'' Instead it was a notice of a deportation
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the law,'' she said. ``If I did, I would never
have started the naturalization process. I didn't know any of this
would come back to haunt me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew the law when she pleaded guilty in 1988 either _
knew the consequences, that is. Her lawyer, if he had, would surely
not have urged her to plead. The judge would likely not have
imposed the formal one-year sentence. But no one could have known,
because the consequences arose from a law passed eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   Retroactivity is one feature of the 1996 act that has now been
shown, in this and many other cases, to be fundamentally unfair. It
is grotesque to throw people out of the country because, years ago,
they were convicted of a minor crime in circumstances where no one
knew that that could destroy their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``aggravated felony'' is a second aspect of
the 1996 law that, by now, can plainly be seen to need revision.
Like Humpty Dumpty, Congress can make any phrase mean what Congress
says it means. But stretching the meaning of ``aggravated felony''
to include trivial offenses not only produces harsh results but
mocks legislative integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be trying to get drug lords, murderers, rapists,''
Ms. Gehris said, ``not someone who pulled a girl's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean I'm not a violent person. I was 23 years old then.
Except for that one mistake, I've been a good person. I just got an
associate's degree from college. Monday I'm starting at Georgia
State, in the criminal justice program. I'm hoping to be a private
investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional authors of the 1996 act say the INS should use
discretion not to bring such outrageous deportation cases as that
against Ms. Gehris. The INS is preparing guidelines for the use of
discretion, and it may be that in time officials will stop the
effort to deport her. But it is still wrong to have on the books a
law that invites outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gehris' son, Shane, suffers from cerebral palsy and other
problems. He is in a hospital. If she is deported to Germany, it
would be hard for him to go with her on a plane because he cannot
sit or lie in one position for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one person I'm fighting this for is my son,'' she said.
``I can't just be taken to an airport, be put on a plane and say to
him, `See you later.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better believe I'm up on the law now. I will walk to
Washington if I have to, to show how unfair it is. It rips my heart
out.''

FORBES DROPS CAMPAIGN CIVILITY IN AD ATTACKING BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Steve Forbes Friday unveiled the first attack ad
aimed by one candidate at another in the current presidential
campaign, in a spot that features an anti-tax activist accusing
Texas Gov. George W. Bush of breaking promises to his home-state
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The ad raised immediate concerns in the Bush campaign,
especially, that Forbes, lagging in the polls, may be poised to
repeat his strategy of 1996, when his harsh TV campaign undermined
the candidacy of the eventual nominee, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the new spot is Mary C. Williams, who described
herself in an interview as the ``housewife-in-charge'' of the
Houston-based Taxpayers for Accountability. Williams says in the ad
that Bush, in 1994, signed a pledge not to support sales or
business tax increases and ``in 1997, unfortunately, he broke this
pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush wants people to examine his record to see how he
will perform as president,'' Williams says, ``and his record as far
as taxes are concerned is a record of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, N.H. Friday, Bush told reporters that Forbes' ad
_ aired less than a day after Bush promised that as president he
would cut taxes ``so help me God'' _ is a disservice to the
political process, launched by a failing candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``His political clock is ticking down, winding down,'' Bush
said. ``And he's now reacting in the year 2000 the way he did in
1996. He must be feeling that sense of gloom that affects
candidates who cannot sell his message in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are and the truth is, every plan I proposed was a
tax cut,'' said Bush. ``As a result of my leadership I signed the
two largest tax cuts in my state's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reluctantly acknowledged that he did sign the Taxpayers for
Accountability pledge promising not to support sales or business
tax increases. ``Yeah I guess so,'' he said, when asked if he had
signed the oath in 1994. ``It was an auto-pen signature, but it was
a signature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes ad comes amid other indications that what has been a
comparatively civil campaign in both parties, thus far, may be
taking a turn to the negative as New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation Feb. 1 primary nears:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley Friday launched a new,
30-second ad in New Hampshire implicitly criticizing Vice President
Al Gore for ``doing nothing'' on gun control, child poverty and
health care. In fact, both Gore and Bradley have offered ideas on
gun violence, child poverty and health insurance, but the two
Democrats disagree on how best to combat those problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Sierra Club environmental organization Wednesday began
airing an attack on Bush's environmental record, charging that
Texas leads the nation in releasing hazardous chemicals to the air
and water and that Bush nevertheless advocated weakening the Clean
Air Act. It's true that Federal regulators have been pressing Texas
to improve toughen environmental regulations, and that Houston this
year displaced Los Angeles as the urban area with the worst air
pollution problems in the nation. But Bush aides claim there have
been major improvements in air and water quality in Texas during
Bush's administration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andy Martin, a fringe Republican candidate, said Friday he
expects to have ready for showing next week an ad attacking Arizona
Senator John McCain for alleged improprieties in dealing with the
Federal Communications Commission. Martin already is airing a
commercial on New Hampshire television accusing Bush of cocaine and
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes press secretary Juleanna Glover Weiss denied that the
commercial is an attack ad, but strategists for other candidates
said it was a classic of the genre because of its apparently
selective presentation of the facts. In the storm stirred by its
release, Forbes' aides and Williams neither accepted nor disputed
Bush's claim to have cut taxes; they said the issue in the ad was
not the total tax burden, it was that Bush broke his word.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the Forbes camp initially contacted her before
Christmas to do the ad' she said she initially did not want to
``but after thinking it over, I thought this story needed to be
told....
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Bush people want the story to be tax cuts _ we call
'em the phantom cuts,'' Williams said. ``The story is that he broke
his pledge, his own pledge, then he began to spin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark MacKinnon, Bush's chief media strategist, said he and other
campaign officials are discussing whether to respond to Forbes on
television. He said the campaign, anticipating just such an attack,
already has prepared several possible responses.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Gore aides lashed out at Bradley for his new
ad, the vice president's camp announced a new commercial of its own
which takes an implicit shot at Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The announcer says that for 70 million Americans, Medicare and
Medicaid are a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore: the only Democratic candidate who saves Medicare by
setting aside 15 percent of the surplus to keep Medicare solvent,''
he says. ``The only Demcratic candidate who preserves Medicaid
instead of replacing it with a $150 a month voucher. Al Gore: The
only Democratic candidate who reforms health care in a way that
protects seniors and working families.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which Gore aides said would be shown beginning this
weekend, suggests that Bradley would do the opposite of Gore and
hurt Medicare. The two have been battling over Medicare, Medicaid
and their respective health plans for months. Bradley has strongly
criticized Gore for suggesting he would not protect Medicare or
safeguard services for those on Medicaid.

 &HT;    Fonda seeking a more spiritual path in life
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the many questions swirling around her separation
this week from media mogul Ted Turner, it's increasingly clear that
spirituality is playing an increasing part in Jane Fonda's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as she approached her 60th birthday, she began to
search for more meaning,'' said the Rev. Gerald Durley, pastor of
Providence Missionary Baptist Church and the former president of
Concerned Black Clergy. ``I am extremely impressed with the
genuineness and sincerity in her search for spirituality and
wholeness.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't known whether that's responsible for the 62-year-old
actress' separation from Turner mere days after they marked their
eighth wedding anniversary. But citing unnamed sources, the
conservative online magazine WorldNetDaily.com reported this week
that the split was partially prompted by Fonda's ``embrace of
`born-again' evangelical Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   It said Fonda, whose husband once derided Christianity as
``religion for losers,'' now attended Bible study, but didn't
specify where.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda was unavailable for comment, representatives of Turner
Broadcasting said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Durley, who speaks to Fonda ``fairly regularly,'' would not
comment on Turner or the couple's marriage. As a board member of
Fonda's Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, or
G-CAPP, he said he is ``around her quite a bit'' and said he
doesn't think that she regularly attends Bible study. But that
doesn't mean she's not spiritual, Durley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's found a certain sense of peace among people
who've found peace with Christianity,'' said Durley, adding that
Fonda has been to Providence Missionary ``a couple of times,''
primarily due to their G-CAPP connection. Durley said Fonda helped
Providence found the Fathers Resource Center, which educates young
males on the emotional and social responsibilities of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Just before celebrating her 60th birthday in December 1997,
Fonda said she had asked herself, ``Where do I want to go with the
last third of my life?'' Clearly, part of the answer was to
continue her work in the area of teen pregnancy, which may have
brought her even more in touch with issues of spirituality and
religion. In that same 1997 interview, Fonda said teen pregnancy
prevention was largely about self-esteem and self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it begins,'' said Durley, who had early
conversations with Fonda about approaching the religious community
in the Bible Belt about the potentially touchy subject of teen
pregnancy. ``You start talking about self-esteem and something
greater than yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's apparent spiritual quest is bound to surprise many
people who still remember her as the outspoken Vietnam War
protester once married to Chicago Seven member Tom Hayden. Nor does
it jibe with the standard image of Turner.
</P>
<P>
   At a banquet where he was named Humanist of the Year in April
1990, Turner said he started to lose his faith when his sister died
after a lengthy illness, despite his prayers. He said the further
from his faith he strayed, ``the better I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The humanists applauded loudly. A few weeks later, he publicly
apologized for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for the things I said
about Christians,'' he told members of the First Baptist Church in
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Turner appears to have publicly hinted at a clash
of spiritual values. Turner confirmed last year that he and Fonda
were seeing a marriage counselor. ``Jane wants me to become a
saint,'' the Jan. 17 People magazine said he groused at a
California awards dinner. ``But I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   The report that religion is at the root of Turner and Fonda's
problems is from a source whose objectivity has been questioned and
that has taken issue with Fonda in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The story was written by WorldNetDaily editor and CEO Joseph
Farah, the one-time editor of the now-defunct Sacramento Union.
After becoming editor in 1990, Farah attracted attention for
editing a description of the National Organization for Women as a
``radical feminist group'' into one story, for banning the use of
the word ``gays'' to describe homosexuals and for describing the
Union as ``a pro-life paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 Los Angeles Times story, the Union's owner said the
paper had a ``Christian philosophy'' and that a prayer committee of
local residents had been established ``... to lift up the Union to
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times story said an editor quit when Farah criticized her
for running a favorable review of a book about Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Farah told the Times he objected to the review because ``it was
a defense of Jane Fonda and Jane Fonda's politics. ... We've got a
readership that's totally at odds with that point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Also quoting unnamed sources, People is reporting in its Jan. 17
issue that Fonda has told friends recently that a sticking point
with Turner was her desire to spend more time in Atlanta with her
daughter, Vanessa, and new grandchild, Malcolm, who live in Grant
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say Fonda indeed has been spending time at her
daughter's Grant Park home. ``She's been seen there two days in a
row,'' Grant Park resident Carol Fisk said late last week. ``She's
definitely helping her daughter out. She was seen raking leaves.''

DONALD TRUMP LETS MINNESOTA SEE A REAL WINNER _ HIMSELF  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. _ Taking potshots at Ed Koch, all the
Republicans running for president, North Korea, Fidel Castro,
Japan, Russia and candidates of humble background, Donald Trump on
Friday brought his presidential exploratory campaign to Minnesota,
where he outlined his vision of a Trump administration and helped
raise money for his Reform Party ally, Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who called himself ``the biggest developer in the hottest
city in the world'' _ that would be New York _ spoke at a Chamber
of Commerce lunch and later at a dinner where more than 200 people
paid $100 a ticket to attend. Aides to Ventura, the Reform Party's
highest-ranking elected official, said the money would be used to
spread the party's gospel around the state.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, however, Trump seemed no closer to announcing
whether he would compete for the Reform Party's presidential
nomination than when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking very, very seriously at whether or not it can be
won,'' he said at a news conference with Ventura, sandwiched
between his scheduled events. ``Instinctively, I want to know if I
have a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   For Trump, the visit was a chance to share with appreciative
audiences his views of just about everything. He said New York
City's inability to fix the Wollman skating rink in Central Park,
which Trump repaired for the city at cost in 1986, showed that Koch
was a bad mayor. Trump said he watched the Republican candidates
debate on Thursday night and concluded: ``Are these people stiffs,
or what? It was pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He described North Korea as the United States' greatest foreign
threat, a country ``run by some very bad people.'' He called
himself ``a big, big fan'' of the economic embargo against Cuba,
whose president, Castro, is ``a bad guy.'' He said that Japan had
been ``ripping us off for 25 years,'' and that Russia was ``totally
mixed up, and they have missiles run by people nobody ever even
heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   He struck a blow for rich people as national leaders, chiding
candidates who express pride in their humble backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're losers,'' Trump said. ``Who the hell wants to have a
person like this for president?''
</P>
<P>
   Without criticizing anyone, he reviewed his proposal to
eliminate the national debt with a one-time tax on the nation's
wealthiest people and said he would put forth his ideas on health
care and overhauling the welfare system within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he came to Minnesota as a favor to Ventura, not to
get his endorsement. But the governor made it clear that Trump
would get it if he decided to run. Otherwise, Ventura said, he
would endorse someone else, anyone but Pat Buchanan, the
Republican-turned-Reform candidate who is seeking the party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Because of policy differences with Buchanan, the governor said,
``It would be very difficult for me to support him.''

DIGGING DEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 9, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the talk about a ``new economy,'' good old technical
economics gives many signs of being in remarkably good shape as it
enters the 21st century. Among the portents has been a certain
amount of stock-taking recently in the technical journals.
</P>
<P>
   The Quarterly Journal of Economics, for example, has a special
issue coming next month on the topic ``What Have We Learned Since
Marshall? '' The answer seems to be: some. (Alfred Marshall's text
``Principles of Economics,'' dominated the teaching of economics in
1900.) The editors of the Journal of Economic Perspectives
organized their Winter 2000 issue around a series of ``Reflections
on Economics at the Turn of the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best evidence of the robust health of the discipline
was to be found in the annual meetings of the American Economic
Association and its affiliates, which ended Sunday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 economists, most of them professors in research
universities or colleges, many of them deeply involved in the
affairs of the world, attended more than a hundred different
sessions at which new work was reported and discussed. There were,
as usual, only two plenary events: a grand lecture, given this year
by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on the subject of financial
crises; and a presidential address, delivered this year by outgoing
president D. Gale Johnson of the University of Chicago, an
agricultural economist who spoke on the future of food. The
convention was organized and presided over, at least in some
distant way, by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, who as
president-elect organized the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The serene collegiality with which the AEA presidency passed
from one leader to the next is another of those signs of a
discipline in firm control of its destiny. However much the AEA
remains dedicated to scientific opennesss and social democracy _
many different organizations gather beneath its big tent and its
commitment to gender and racial equality is pronounced _ the
organization remains a strict scientific meritocracy at its
uppermost reaches. However much economics remains divided into
differing camps _ and it does to some extent _ it has little
difficulty deciding who among its rivalrous leaders have earned
nearly universal admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, a nominating committee recommends a short list of
possibilities, and the executive committee then slates a single
distinguished economist to run for the presidency of the
association. (The other seven offices are contested.) What's the
basis for selection? It's not easy to say, beyond a lifetime's
leadership in the field, intellectual and professional, public and
behind-the-scenes. Whatever arguments take place behind closed
doors, the Association seem to know how to achieve consensus. It
has been decades since the last controversial choice.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of those who held the position over the last thirty
years discloses an unsurprising drift from liberal to conservative.
Because the last act of a president is to head the nominating
committee five years after he or she steps down, birds of a feather
tend to follow one another in office, but only for a a year or two
at a time. Surprises crop up occasionally. The deeper rhythym of
developents in the field obiously has something to do with it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the 1970s saw men such as James Tobin, John Kenneth
Galbraith, Kenneth Arrow, Walter Heller, Robert A. Gordon, Franco
Modigliani, Lawrence Klein and Robert Solow serve as president,
while in the 1980s, economists as various as Moses Abramowitz,
William Baumol, W. Arthur Lewis, Charles Schultze, Charles P.
Kindleberger, Alice Rivlin, Gary Becker, Robert Eisner and Joseph
Pechman served.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, presidents have included Gerard Debreu, Thomas
Schelling, William Vickrey, Zvi Griliches, Amartya Sen, Victor
Fuchs, Anne Krueger, Arnold Harberger, Robert Fogel, D. Gale
Johnson. Jorgenson _ who won distinction as an econometrician
devising new tools for the measurement of capital _ and Sherwin
Rosen, the University of Chicago labor economist who earlier this
fall was was elected to succeed him, will lead the economists into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The president serves for a few years in a high saddle between
the peaks of what has been described as the Reward System and the
Authority Structure of science (in an illumninating article,
``Inside Science,'' in the current issue of The American Scholar.)
David Goodstein and James Woodward, the authors, are professors at
the Califorian Institute of Technology respectively of physics and
philosophy. Both have served in executive capacities as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pinnacle of the Reward System is scientific glory,'' they
write. ``The goals of those in the Authority Structure are power
and influence.'' Those who leave science for adminstration seldom
are permitted to return. ``The university president is a kingpin of
the Authority Structure, but a dropout from the scientific Reward
System,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the AEA _ any association president _ becomes a
key figure in the Authority Structure in the act of organizing
meetings and deciding who will be on the program and who will not.
(``Even if you manage to finance and publish your work, it will be
little noticed unless you also manage to get invited to speak at
national meetings organized by your professional society,'' write
Goodstein and Woodward in American Scholar.) Jorgenson organized
his meetings in a relatively decentralized way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enlisted the eight officers, and named eight additional
people to the program committee. I asked each member to review
massive sets of proposals. I also asked each one to award _ to
arrange _ a section of their own. (Such seesions are automatically
published in the AEA proceedings.) Some people have had themes for
their meetings. My feeling was, let the voices speak.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Jorgenson's list of the most interesting sessions this year
consisted mainly of his lieutenants' efforts. These can fairly be
described as reporting work that is digging deeper into
well-established concerns: a session on new approaches to taxing
the rich, for instance (``everybody likes to tax the rich,'' says
Jorgenson;) another on inflation targeting, a fashionable new
approach to monetary policy; a third on the macroeconomics of
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other featured panels examined new issues in immigration; the
division of labor between men and women and welfare of children in
developing countries; the National Bureau of Economic
Research-Sloan Foundation project to visit various factories and
carefully examine the issues that they raise; the empirical testing
of trade theories; unresolved issues in personnel policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still other marquee sessions considered the quality of private
and public financial planning; the restructuriing the financial
system; the effects of welfare reform on family structure and
fertility; the political side of economic developoment; the crucial
relations among preferences, behavior and welfare; new
understandings of executive compensation; and what Jorgenson
described as ``Myron Scholes tells all'' _ a star-studded panel on
the near-crash of 1998, featuring one of the Nobel laureates who
was among the partners when the Long term Capital Management
trading firm went broke then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big surprise to me was how far interests in microeconomics
have moved toward health and environmental issues,'' Jorgenson
concluded. ``Both of these areas seem to bed thriving. On the macro
side, the big issuies are inflation targeting in monetary policy,
and the Long Term Capital debacle and its implications.''

ONE FINE DAY, DON MARTIN PICKED UP A PEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Don Martin Dept. is closed.
</P>
<P>
   That means a final ``fwak!'' for the long-faced, hinge-footed
buffoon who walked innocently into calamity for 30 years of
one-page comics in Mad magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who died Thursday at age 68, was crowned ``Mad's maddest
cartoonist'' for the strip he drew from 1956 until the mid-'80s.
The gags were just sick and cynical enough to set up a generation
of Baby Boomers for what was to come. In those primitive years
before cable, kids got their laughs from ``Spy vs. Spy,'' ``The
Lighter Side of ...'' and ``The Don Martin Dept.,'' a strip
scattered throughout each issue.
</P>
<P>
   The classic Don Martin episode carried an innocuous title such
as ``One Fine Day at ...'' There could be men, women, babies,
lovers, but they all had a variation on the same homely face, as if
there was an entire society of Don Martins somewhere. The
protagonist would be going about his business oblivious to the trap
he was about to enter. When he got there, a gruesome scene would
usually occur, punctuated by words like ``thort'' or ``spladap,''
which Martin made up.
</P>
<P>
   The characters were never named, but it was assumed that Don
Martin the artist was also Don Martin the hard-luck character.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and clumsy, Martin was the first cool adult geek of the
comics. His hair stuck out the side of his head. His attempts at
modern fashion failed. His jaw dropped to reveal horse teeth. His
feet bent at odd angles and always preceded the body around the
corner and into danger. Though he usually came to a bad end, he was
always optimistic. He could be mutilated four different ways in an
issue, and after each he'd rise with that foolish grin, less
worried than Mad's ``What Me Worry'' cover boy Alfred E. Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   In the early comic books, artists did not own their work, so
Martin quit ``Mad'' and in 1987 went to work for the imitator
``Cracked.'' His audience did not follow. The Don Martin Dept.
belonged in Mad then and forever after.

COACHES LOOK AT THE NFL PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Jim Fassel, head coach of the New York
Football Giants, and Dick Vermeil, head coach of the St. Louis
Rams, were talking on the phone (no, not about Bill Belichick)
about what they consider The Natural Order of Progession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed that it has disappeared,'' said Fassel, ``and what
we see is something new developing. In the old days, there was a
natural order. As a team moved, it moved slowly. One year you might
be 10-6. You make a few moves, and go up to 11-5. Or you you start
to slip, and go 9-7. But things moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it changes fast. The dissent is rapid. Last year, Denver,
Atlanta, and the Jets were in the final four. All of them were set
back by injury, or free agency, and had dramatic drops compared to
a year ago. This season, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Tennessee, none
of them playoff teams a year ago, come out of nowhere and to the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil said he studied what happened and it seems as though
three or four player moves changed the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that have had big years, (Fassel's) team, Indy,
others that moved up fast, picked up a few guys that made them
better and stayed away from injury,'' Vermeil said. ``The teams
that dropped down lost guys in free agency, didn't replace them,
got hit by injury, and couldn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing are the long-term affects of free agency,''
said Fassel. ``The talent is so thinned out that three or four
players, here or there, getting them or losing them, can change how
good a team is in a hurry. It didn't used to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   To follow his New Order theory a little closer, let's take an
informed look at the NFL's postseason tourney, which begins
Saturday with two wild-card games, with comments from coaches who
have played both teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo at Tennessee, Saturday at 12:30, analysis by Oakland
coach Jon Gruden: ``The big thing will be to see how Rob Johnson
taking over at quarterback is going to change things for Buffalo.
Tennessee is a very tough place to play. The noise factor in that
stadium is very important. It is loud. The Tennessee defense uses
that noise to its advantage. They really come after the passer
hard. They'll be after Johnson. They blitz a lot and keep the
pressure on. How he handles it will be important to the Buffalo
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo's defense should be a tough matchup for the Tennessee
offense. Eddie George is a terrific runner for Tennessee, and they
primarily are a running team. But Buffalo has a great front seven
on defense and is one of the best in the league against the run. If
they stop George, then it will fall on (QB Steve) McNair, and this
is when Bruce Smith can be a big factor in the game, getting off
the ball and getting a good pass rush on McNair. I think it's going
to be a fun game. I see both teams trying to spread out a little
bit and try to make some big plays downfield. I think it will be
the best game of the bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit at Washington, Saturday at 4 p.m., analysis by Chicago
coach Dick Jauron: ``Detroit beat them in Detroit during the
season, but I think Washington will have the edge at home in this
one. The Washington offense against the Detroit defense is a good
matchup. Washington has a lot of talent on that offense. (Redskins
quarterback) Brad Johnson had a big year throwing the ball, and
they can run it. Detroit is very good up front on defense, and
(defensive end) Robert Porcher is outstanding. Washington has to
block him in pass-rush situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Detroit's linebackers as well, they are very active.
But the Lions' defensive backs are not that big. Washington's wide
receivers, (Michael) Westbrook and (Albert) Connell, are a tough
matchup. (Quarterback Gus) Frerotte is getting the start for
Detroit. He played for Washington, so they know what he can do.
He's a guy that can get hot if you let him. He gets rid of the ball
fast and has a history of being a better quick thrower, a guy who
is more effective short than deep. On grass, at home, I think
Washington will be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas at Minnesota, Sunday at 12:30 p.m., analysis by Fassel:
``We played these teams the final two games of the season. The key
to the game is the way these two teams play in the red zone (inside
the opposing 20-yard line). This is where the Dallas defense is
really tough. I think they are second- or third-best in the league
in this area. You can move the ball on them, but then they make you
take a field goal instead of a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas strength is on defense. They are very fast in the
secondary and at linebacker. They use their good speed to cut down
on the number of big plays. Their linebackers, (Dexter) Coakley and
(Randall) Godfrey are very good in coverage. As a group they tackle
very well in the open field. Minnesota is big on the outside, with
(Randy) Moss, (Cris) Carter, and (Jake) Reed for receivers. I don't
think Dallas can match up with all of those guys. Dallas does not
have it going on offense. They don't have the ability to make the
big play. Minnesota will force them to drive the ball, and it's
difficult to score a lot of points when you are playing on a long
field all afternoon. Toward the end of the season Minnesota was
playing the better football, and I think they should have the edge
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami at Seattle, Sunday at 4 p.m., analysis by Jets linebacker
coach Al Groh: ``We played Seattle last week and they just seemed
to want to throw the ball. They are very hard to defend. They use a
lot of different formations and cause a lot of problems for
defenses. They ran the ball only 12 times against us. Ricky Watters
was supposed to be hurt, but he played. They went away from him.
Miami's difficulty will be handling (wide receiver) Joey Galloway
on the outside. He has blazing speed. Seattle will try to have
(quarterback) Jon Kitna get rid of the ball fast, to cut down on
Miami pressure on the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Seattle coach) Mike Holmgren likes those quick slants, and
they might be the best screen (pass) team in the league. Seattle
likes to get the ball to its receivers going up field, so if you
don't tackle well, they can be gone. Miami will have to tackle well
in the secondary. When we played Miami (in the penultimate game of
season), they changed what they had done in the past. They didn't
even put up the pretense of trying to run. They came out in passing
formations on first down and just went after it. Miami better not
get in many third-and-longs. Seattle has two guys coming off the
corner on the pass rush, Chad Brown and Michael Sinclair, that can
really bring it. And with Cortez Kennedy inside, Seattle can fold
the pocket. I think Seattle, playing at home, on the faster track,
has the edge. But to me, the team that wins the game is the one
going into the game with the better attitude. Both played poorly in
the second half of the season, compared to the first. The team that
thinks it still has a chance to do something in the playoffs, is
the one that will win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Quiz question of the day: The last time Miami played in Seattle,
the Seahawks won with their quarterback throwing three touchdown
passes of more than 50 yards. Who was the Seattle QB? Answer below.

   What happened to our Doug? Well, it seems the Buffalo coaching
staff thinks Flutie can't throw the ball deep with success, and the
opposing teams are jumping on the shorter Buffalo pass patterns,
making it difficult to generate any offense. The Bills replaced him
with Rob Johnson, who has a much stronger arm, but has another
problem: He's made of paper-mache. It's not that Johnson isn't
tough enough, he's just injury-prone. He's had just nine starts in
the NFL and has been injured four times. He started one game his
final year in Jacksonville, played a great game, and never returned
because of an ankle injury. His first start for Buffalo in San
Diego in 1998, he got a slight concussion and left the game. He
returned the next week to start again, but four weeks later,
suffered a rib injury, and Flutie took his job. This season, when
the Bills had a big lead in Philadelphia, they brought Johnson in
in the second half, and he got KO'd again with another concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Johnson has the better arm, and may be able to throw
the deep ball better, I think it's Russian roulette playing an
injury-prone guy against Tennessee, one of the league's best
pass-rushing teams. If Johnson holds onto the ball long enough to
throw deep, he might get decked again. When he can stay on his
feet, Johnson is good. In his last four starts, two in mopup games
the final week of the last two seasons, the team averaged 32 points
a game. But all of us around here know that something will happen
to get Flutie in the game to win it at the end for the Bills.
Flutie is 26-13 as a starter with the Bills, the best record in the
NFL the last two years.

   The Celtics are hurting just as much in attendance as they are
on the floor. This reporter went to the game vs. Cleveland at the
FleetCenter Monday night. It was announced that 18,624 tickets were
sold, 14,115 people in house, which adds up to 4,509 no-shows. No
way. The no-show number is bogus. The actual count was fewer than
12,000 in house, which is the lowest number since 1980, or since
Larry Bird came to town. It isn't good when some 6,000 people buy
tickets to a game and don't bother to show. And it doesn't help
Jerry Jacobs pay the mortgage on the FleetCenter. The per capita on
concessions and merchandise sales for a Celtic game runs around
$12, so multiplied by 6,000, and the building took a hit for more
than $70,000. The Celtics have been playing to more empty seats
this season than they have in the past 20 years.

   Heard that Harry Sinden went ballistic in the Bruins' locker
room after they handed over a game in Ottawa in overtime Dec. 30.
The Bruins had a 4-2 lead going into the third period and just kept
icing the puck, trying to sit on the lead, and it backfired. Sinden
ripped into the team and the coaches for such an inept performance.
Hopefully, the discussion will have the team trying to score goals,
even when it has the lead.

   Pete Carroll will not be the next defensive coordinator in
Seattle as reported. Ditto for Green Bay. From what I've seen of
some of the candidates the Patriots have brought in here, or talked
with, about being their next coach, Steve Sidwell would be the best
of the bunch. Why haven't they interviewed Patriots defensive line
coach Ray Hamilton, a hard-nosed, intelligent guy who would get the
players back to thinking more about what they were going to do on
Sunday afternoon rather than what they were going to do Monday and
Tuesday nights at the Foxy Lady?

   There is a misconception that commissioner Paul Tagliabue can
unilaterally decide on a settlement that would bring Bill Belichick
to Foxborough as the next coach and general manager of the
Patriots. The Jets are the only ones who can decide if what the
Patriots will offer is good enough to let Belichick move on. Not
Tagliabue. Three years ago, in the Bill Parcells move to the Jets,
both sides agreed to let Tagliabue decide the settlement. The Jets
don't plan to do that and won't name a new head coach until the
next owner is selected, which is expected to come next week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tell me how Belichick's agent, Neil Cornrich, is going to get
around this one when he meets Tagliabue Monday to argue that
Belichick never had a contract to coach the Jets. When Belichick
decided to resign Tuesday, he wrote his own resignation letter and
signed it, as the coach of the Jets. Not a very smart thing to do
when your agent is telling the world you were never coach of the
Jets. Somehow Belichick must have thought he was.

 &HT;    Daft molding his Coca-Cola team
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola President Douglas Daft continued to put his
stamp on the company Friday by naming a new marketing chief and
head of European operations.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Charlie Frenette, 47, to head Coke's business
in Europe and Minute Maid President Stephen Jones, 44, to replace
Frenette as chief marketing officer, was received well on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's stock rose 6 percent Friday in heavy trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Daft's moves also further upset a management restructuring
launched last October by Chairman M. Douglas Ivester, who plans to
retire in the spring after a tumultuous two years at the helm of
the world's largest soft drink company. Daft is slated to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the 49-nation Greater Europe Group, Frenette will
oversee operations in Coca-Cola's third-largest market after the
United States and Latin America. But it's also a region where the
company has faced obstacle after obstacle in reaching 866 million
potential consumers of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Those troubles last year included Coca-Cola's inability to seal
acquisitions because of government concerns of market dominance and
a summer health scare that involved contamination of its core soft
drink brands. The latter sent youths to hospitals and resulted in
the largest product recall in Coke's history.
</P>
<P>
   The health scare, and the perceived slow response by Coke
management to contain and explain it, cost the company millions in
lost sales and ignited a firestorm of government criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It was Frenette's job to oversee the intense marketing effort to
rebuild consumer confidence and to get the company's products back
on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's experience in directing our marketing efforts in
Europe during the past year make him the ideal leader for our
business there,'' Daft said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Dixon, a portfolio manager at Arnhold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder
Inc., said one of Frenette's objectives should be to ``change the
environment in Europe to one of cooperation rather than
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor at Beverage Digest, said Daft ``could not
have picked a better executive'' to head the company's European
operations. He cited Frenette's leadership in southern Africa,
where he once headed Coke's operations under the supervision of
Carl Ware, president of the Africa Group. Earlier this week, Daft
named Ware to head a new global public affairs division.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette replaces William Casey, 58, who has been with the
Coca-Cola system for 32 years. Casey, who has been president of the
Greater Europe Group since 1998, will become a consultant to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Robert Baskin said the troubles in Europe had
nothing to do with Casey's departure. ``This seemed like a good
time to do it, what with Doug Daft organizing for the future and
putting his own team in place,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst, however, Skip Carpenter of Donald, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, said it's ``somewhat surprising that Casey is retiring,
given his age and he was still directly reporting to the CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW MARKETING CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Frenette's reassignment comes days before Coca-Cola launches a
new ad and marketing effort for Coke Classic that replaces the
``Always'' campaign with a new ``Enjoy'' theme. The new campaign is
designed to pump more excitement into stagnant consumer demand for
the flagship brand.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola describes Stephen Jones, Frenette's replacement, as a
veteran marketing and operations executive with 13 years of
experience in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Jones' knowledge and skills in developing and managing a
large portfolio of brands to meet the range of local consumer needs
has global applications for our company,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ivester named him to head Minute Maid last November,
Jones was deputy division president for Coca-Cola in Japan, where
he was instrumental in managing a portfolio of about 200 products.
They included soft drinks, coffees, teas and water.
</P>
<P>
   EXCITEMENT ON WALL STREET
</P>
<P>
   Daft's quick management reshuffling this week came as a welcome
surprise on Wall Street. The stock closed up $3.62 1/2 Friday at
$60.62 1/2. It remains well off its 52-week high of $70.87 1/2,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daft wants to be seen as taking charge,'' said Dixon at
Arnhold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to move more senior executives away from Coke's
North Avenue headquarters and into the markets they oversee.
Frenette, for example, will be based in London, while Sandy Allan,
who now heads Middle East and Far East operations, will be based in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Daft himself has seen his career bolt at the company just in the
past several weeks. In a management restructuring in October,
Ivester named the native Australian to head the company's
operations in Asia, the Mideast and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Then in December, when Ivester announced his planned retirement,
Daft was promoted to president and chief operating officer, and the
company's board indicated he would be named chairman and chief
executive officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   Among other top appointments, Daft still must appoint someone to
head Minute Maid and Coca-Cola's operations in Africa. Daft is also
expected to name a new president and chief operating officer after
he himself is elevated. Wall Street expects Jack Stahl, head of the
company's North America and Latin America operations, to be named
to the posts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a bitter cold afternoon last fall, a handful of Russian
scientists gathered at a cemetery in Siberia for an impromptu
ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of what was
once the Soviet Union's largest laboratory for developing germ
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lev Sandakhchiev, the director of the lab, known as Vector,
situated in the town of Koltsovo, raised a plastic cup of vodka to
the memory of Dr. Nikolai Ustinov, a scientist who died in the
spring of 1988 after accidentally infecting himself with the
Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic killer that he and his colleagues were
trying to perfect as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Ustinov's widow, Yevgenia, at the foot of her
husband's still-contaminated grave, Sandakhchiev, toasted their
fallen colleague and friend, who documented the progress of the
disease as it ravaged him, in a diary stained in his own blood.
``Thank God it is over,'' Sandakhchiev said, as tears streamed down
his face.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly a decade since the fall of the Soviet Union,
Sandakhchiev, quietly aided by the United States, says he has been
steering Vector, or the State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, away from its past and toward peaceful research.
Rather than using germs to kill people, he says, Vector is now
trying to save people, and itself in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. intelligence analysts and congressional staff members
remain wary of Vector's research and fearful that Russia may still
be conducting secret germ warfare work at closed military sites and
institutes. But administration officials and scientists who have
toured the lab _ once the crown jewel of the Soviet germ warfare
empire _ say the administration's investment to transform Vector
seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the World Health Organization endorsed a proposal
backed by President Clinton to conduct research into smallpox
vaccines and anti-viral drugs at both the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta and at Vector, a decision that
helped cement Vector's status as a legitimate player in
international science.
</P>
<P>
   Given such developments, U.S. officials and germ warfare experts
say, Vector has quietly been removed from the administration's
``threat'' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mention of Vector used to send shivers down the spines of
intelligence analysts,'' said Amy Smithson, a germ and chemical
warfare specialist at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington,
and the author of a new study of the administration's programs to
reduce the threat of the former Soviet Union's germ warfare
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with all of Sandakhchiev's changes and the frequent
visitor traffic in and out of there, Vector hardly rates as a
concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once part of a closed Soviet city, Vector has
increasingly welcomed foreign scientists. In September, the center
played host to more than 50 American and foreign scientists at a
conference financed in part by the United States. It also gave a
reporter an unprecedented tour of laboratories where the most
sensitive germ research was once conducted and allowed Vector's
scientists to discuss their previous smallpox research and other
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and officials say Vector scientists are now joining
forces with American and European scientists in various commercial
and nonprofit research ventures: making diagnostic kits for markets
in the former Soviet Union, enriched milk for children, interferon
and antibodies, even cosmetics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one project, Vector scientists and two American biotech
companies are developing a powerful new anti-viral drug that was
tested last year at Vector and that they hope will help neutralize
Ebola and other hemorrhagic viruses, thus reducing the threat of
bioterrorism, or will augment other drugs to which bacteria and
viruses have grown increasing resistant.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of transformation has been neither smooth nor easy.
Enmeshed in Soviet-style secrecy and nationalism, hardliners in
Russia have resisted scientific exchanges and Vector's growing ties
to the West, U.S. officials and Russian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, skeptics in Congress and national security
circles also initially opposed the administration's attempts to
finance the center's transformation, warning that Russia might use
U.S. aid to continue offensive germ research at other, still-closed
labs.
</P>
<P>
   But several key critics of the program were surprised when the
administration quietly informed Congress earlier last year that
Vector had rebuffed potentially lucrative offers from Iran to buy
products, technology and scientific expertise. Detailed audits of
Vector's grants show that the millions of dollars invested by
Washington _ which now account for about half of Vector's annual
budget _ have been spent as Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress substantially increased the Pentagon's
request to finance programs to open Russia's germ labs, bringing
the total to $14 million. While the State Department has yet to
decide how to allocate the money, its biological programs could get
as much as $48 million, more than three times last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Daily life at the isolated installation remains difficult,
however. Vector, deprived of most Russian government funds, now
struggles to get by with about 2,200 scientists _ less than half
the number who worked at the lab during its heyday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Ken Alibek, a defector who was a top official
in Moscow's germ warfare program, smallpox had long been the Soviet
Union's strategic biological weapon of choice. ``Moscow,'' he wrote
in ``BioHazard,'' a book published last year by Random House, ``had
stored up to 20 tons of the virus at other facilities to ensure
that Moscow would never be caught short.'' Those stocks have since
been destroyed, say Alibek and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his country had promised to end its germ weapons
program, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, financed the
construction of dozens of installations at Vector for the smallpox
weapon project in the 1980s, soon after the World Health
Organization had unwittingly declared the ancient scourge
eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those installations are empty, unfinished or
deteriorating through neglect. A giant viral reactor built then has
been dismantled, and Vector has lacked money even to buy monkeys
for tests since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what was planned for this facility, we were lucky that
communism ended when it did,'' said an administration official who
follows biological issues closely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the administration's conversion strategy has
involved the World Health Organization, some of whose scientists
have been suspicious of Vector ever since they learned that the lab
once carried out secret germ research in violation of a 1972 treaty
banning germ weapons, which the Soviet Union had signed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Russia quietly moved to Vector its collection of
smallpox strains from the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in
Moscow, although the WHO had designated Ivanovsky as the only
official storage site in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO quickly visited Vector and designated it as the official
site, but the move raised suspicions. Sandakhchiev asserted in an
interview that the strains had been moved merely because Russia
faced a terrorist threat from war in Chechnya and Vector provided a
more secure site for Russia's 120 different smallpox isolates _ the
world's largest collection, twice the size of America's.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about smallpox intensified this year after Alibek and
others warned that strains of the deadly virus had found their way
to Iraq, North Korea and other countries and that therefore the
supposedly eradicated disease still posed a threat to a now
unvaccinated world.
</P>
<P>
   Based on such reports, Clinton reversed his earlier support for
the WHO's decision to destroy the virus at the two declared storage
sites in Atlanta and at Vector. In Geneva in May, Washington led a
successful campaign within the WHO to defer destroying the virus
and to endorse research on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Sergei Shchelkunov, a leading smallpox
expert at Vector, said more work was now needed to understand the
virulence and peculiarities of all the strains, which should help
to develop new vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1991, Dr. Alexander Guskev, a Vector scientist,
led a team more than 2,400 miles across Siberia to the tiny town of
Chersky, north of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   There the scientists unearthed in the deep permafrost the
still-frozen bodies of people wrapped in deer skin shrouds and
buried in pits who were thought to have died of smallpox nearly 145
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Guskev insisted that his goal was not to find more smallpox
strains, which were plentiful at Vector. The mission's goal, he
insisted, showing visitors videos of the expedition, was to
disinfect the cemetery of what might be a dangerous living virus.
</P>
<P>
   Initial biopsies of bone and skin fragments from the bodies
found no trace of the virus, he said. But the team returned the
following July and August and hit scientific pay-dirt _ frozen
bodies so well preserved that pox marks were still visible. ``But
when we returned to Vector, we found that we couldn't isolate or
revive the virus-like particles,'' Guskev said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to return to another permafrost area next summer to
further his studies, although he now lacks funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such research is a luxury that Vector cannot afford and whose
medical application is debatable,'' an American military scientist
said. ``Until the past is truly dead and buried, I doubt that
anyone will fund it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandakhchiev, whom even Alibek praised for his ``determination
to protect his employees,'' seems eager to bury the past. ``All
labs like ours have a responsibility to be open and to share
information,'' he said in an interview. ``To fight disease and
inspire mutual trust, we must communicate with each other. That is
our future. There is no alternative.''

EXONERATED BY SCIENCE, MAN FREE AFTER 17 YEARS IN PRISON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYLER, Texas _ Convicted by eyewitness testimony and exonerated
by science, A.B. Butler Jr. took his first steps as a free man
Friday after almost 17 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, 45, was released on a $100,000 personal recognizance
bond after DNA analysis showed he was not the man who kidnapped and
raped a 25-year-old woman in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As such, he became the third Texas convict to be freed as a
result of DNA findings.
</P>
<P>
   That status made little difference to Butler on Friday, however.
Only freedom did. Moments after state District Judge Cynthia Kent
granted bail and accepted an agreement between defense attorneys
and prosecutors to seek a pardon for Butler, he walked from the
courtroom grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, clad in a borrowed suitcoat that stretched over
his 6-foot-2 frame, he stepped tentatively from the Smith County
Jail, glanced at his waiting relatives and said, ``Thank God. I'm
just glad to be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's incarceration had begun in June 1983 after a Tyler
woman had identified him as a man who had abducted her at
knife-point from a hotel parking lot and raped her. Butler, who was
on 10 years probation at the time for a previous rape case, was
first picked from mug shots, then from a line-up.
</P>
<P>
   The woman later identified him in court and, despite three
witnesses who testified Butler was with them when the crime
occurred, a jury convicted him and he was sentenced to 99 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1987, he read of DNA analysis and filed the first of
numerous motions seeking to have his blood analyzed. Over the years
those motions repeatedly failed, but Butler persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I'd feel like giving up, but then I'd
start again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, those failures proved to benefit Butler. He eventually
contacted Houston attorney Randy Schaffer, who succeeded in
obtaining court orders to have Butler's DNA tested.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer had one test conducted and that proved inconclusive. At
that time, however, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office
developed a form of Y chromosome testing that isolates male from
female DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer then sought further testing in New York and those
results showed Butler was not the rapist. Further tests of hair
samples also excluded him, and Smith County District Attorney Jack
Skeen agreed to join Schaffer in requesting a pardon from Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.B. simply didn't understand the writ process, though his
basic contentions were clear that `I didn't do it and I want to be
tested,' '' said Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was lucky he failed. If his previous efforts to be
tested had been successful when they had the old testing methods,
the tests would have proved inconclusive, I probably wouldn't have
taken him on and he would have used up his chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he bore no bitterness toward the system, the
district attorney's office or the woman who had identified him as
her attacker. ``I'm just too happy,'' he said. ``I'm just so
thankful to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim, however, apparently did not join in Butler's
elation. The woman, recently widowed, declined interviews. She
supplied prosecutors with an affidavit, however, in which she
reiterated her conviction that Butler was her attacker, DNA
evidence notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My testimony today would be the very same as it was at the
trial in 1983,'' she wrote. ``There is still no doubt in my mind
that A.B. Butler Jr. committed these crimes against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she was positive that Butler attacked her, she said
that she and her family ``will support any decisions made by
Skeen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say to her,'' said Butler. ``There was
evidence at the trial that could have exonerated me if the jury had
chosen to consider it. ``This (the DNA analysis) simply confirms
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent did not immediately join Schaffer and Skeen in requesting a
pardon from Bush, but said she would review the file and either
join in that petition or order a new trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been slow to sign pardons in the past and could be
slowed by his presidential bid in this case, but Schaffer said he
believes the governor will grant one to Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer also represented Kevin Byrd of Houston, who spent 12
years in prison before DNA cleared him. Byrd was released in 1997,
but the tests were more than a year old at the time and Bush had
refused to sign a pardon until a state district judge ruled that
the DNA evidence proved Byrd was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Similar circumstances occurred with Ben Salazar, an Austin man
who was the second convict exonerated and freed by DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case Butler has the requests of the defense, the
prosecution and the finding of a court,'' said Schaffer. ``I'm
confident the governor will grant a pardon. I just don't know how
long it will take.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Butler said he plans to live with relatives in
Tyler and has a job promised as a truck driver. He will be eligible
for $25,000 from a state fund when the Legislature approves money
for such payments in 2001, said Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   Butler will receive the stipend ``for pain and suffering,'' the
lawyer added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In A.B.'s case it figures out to something like 4 cents per
day,'' said Schaffer. ``Not quite enough to make it worth all those
days in prison.''

 &HT;    BuildNet's infusion worth $104.7 million
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heavy-hitting investors appear confident in BuildNet's
strategy to streamline the way houses are built.
</P>
<P>
   The Durham, N.C.-based Internet firm, run by a former Home Depot
executive, landed one of the nation's largest venture capital deals
ever. BuildNet said it raised $104.7 million this week from
builders and suppliers such as Pulte Home Corp., Beazer Homes and
Owens Corning. Venture investors included BancBoston Ventures, J.W.
Seligman &AMP; Co. and others.
</P>
<P>
   BuildNet aims to revamp the supply chain of the home
construction industry by linking suppliers and builders through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a contractor is running behind schedule,
BuildNet would automatically contact suppliers and tell them to
hold off on deliveries. BuildNet would then take a commission from
each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to launch its Internet site in U.S. cities
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is mapping all the industry information to a
uniform, standard language,'' said Nathan Morton, chief executive
of BuildNet. Morton is the former senior vice president of
operations for Home Depot and former chairman and CEO of computer
retailer CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   This week's deal marks the second time that BuildNet made a
record venture capital deal. In May, the company secured $35.7
million in capital, which was then the largest single venture
capital round ever in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   BuildNet employs about 300 people in offices in Durham, Atlanta,
San Francisco, Redmond, Wash., and Austin, Texas.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Whirlpool Corp.'s Dayton Technology Center will
likely begin working on kitchen ovens and other cooking devices
that are linked to the Internet, a company official said.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool is teaming with Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems to
develop home appliances that have broadband Internet technologies.
Whirlpool displayed prototypes of an Internet-connected
refrigerator and oven at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
this week.

   Jim Fanning, Whirlpool's director of home solutions, said the
Dayton Technology Center will likely further develop the oven
prototype. The idea is to bring such products to appliance stores
and consumers' kitchens in the next 12 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning said Whirlpool, and many other big companies, are
focusing on kitchen technologies since families cook, eat and
gather in their kitchens. But who needs an oven or fridge linked to
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Fanning said home chefs could follow instructions from a cooking
show via the Internet or families could keep electronic shopping
lists on their fridge and someday order groceries electronically.
Using broadband technology, the Internet connection would be on
constantly, eliminating the need to boot up a computer and dial
into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And will this catch on with Americans who still have trouble
programming their VCRs?
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be as complicated as a computer operating system.
It can't be something you have to fish through 20 pages of
documentation. It's got to be very screen driven ... and easy to
walk through,'' Fanning said.

GEORGE AND TITANS ON THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of the previous three seasons, Eddie George and his
Tennessee Titans teammates would talk in the locker room about
plans for the off-season. Travel and families and social events
would be discussed. So would the reasons that George and the bunch
finished with an 8-8 record in each of those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago around this time, I was sitting at home watching
the playoffs on TV,'' George said, ``and couldn't wait for it all
to end so that I could get to Hawaii and to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to talk to some guys there and see what was the
difference with their teams. What could I do differently to get
into the playoffs? It was so frustrating being on the outside
looking in. Now, in our locker room, there is a totally different
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   A different atmosphere. A tingling buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tennessee is in the playoffs. The Titans finished with a
13-3 record and twice beat the Jacksonville Jaguars, the team that
owns the home-field advantage throughout the American Football
Conference playoffs. Tennessee was 8-0 at home in its brand-new
Adelphia Coliseum. It has won four straight games, and the offense
averaged 39.3 points in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the Titans tackle Buffalo (11-5) at Adelphia Coliseum
in a wild-card playoff game that features teams with the most
combined victories (24) ever in a wild-card matchup. Buffalo has
playoff experience, Tennessee does not. Buffalo's Rob Johnson will
make a surprise start at quarterback, replacing Doug Flutie, and
George will have his wish _ a chance to excel in the postseason and
for all the Titans to enjoy the playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from Houston and Memphis to Nashville and did not
have stability in the last three years,'' George said. ``We didn't
have the greatest facilities. We wondered how many fans would show
up to our games, and if they did how many would be cheering for us.
No matter how you try to put these kinds of things out of your
mind, they are distractions. Now we have stability plus some new
blood like Jevon Kearse that has helped our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done this year is make sure we were invited to the
party. In the AFC, it's like there are six teams in a room and
there is a prize. It does not matter how you come out of that room,
you want the prize. We don't care that we have a good record and
have to play in the wild-card game. We want the prize, no matter
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   George has produced his best season to help the Titans
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed 320 times for 1,304 yards, averaged 4.1 yards a carry
and scored nine rushing touchdowns. His teammates call him The
Beast, because he can speed around the end and also punish up the
middle with his strong 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   This season George added pass receiving as a strong component of
his game. He caught 47 passes. In his first pro season he caught
23, the next year seven and last year 37. This season George also
turned catches into big gains _ he averaged 9.7 yards a catch and
caught four passes for touchdowns, including a 54-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Barry Sanders, Eric Dickerson and Earl Campbell as the
only backs to gain at least 1,200 rushing yards in each of their
first four pro seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been my best season as far as what they have asked me
to do, especially coming out of the backfield as a receiver,''
George said. ``I study defenses more and understand what they are
trying to do. But my real breakout year _ I don't think that's
happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   George knows he will see a nasty defense from Buffalo, one that
attacks with speed and power and that is anchored by the venerable
end, Bruce Smith. George preaches patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may run and get 1, 2, 3 or 4 yards,'' he said. ``Our
longest run may be for 10 yards. But we have to stick with the run
and believe in it. We can't take for granted that what we've done
at home this season, with the great and loud fans we've had, will
all fall in place. We have to put ourselves in position to give the
fans something to be excited about and not let Buffalo jump on us
and take them out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that George and the Titans are finally in the playoffs, they
plan to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very realistic that we can go deep into the playoffs,''
George said. ``We're in it, first of all. We are among that small
elite. This is the time to take advantage, because we know from
experience how hard it is to get here and that next year is not
guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have not been shy about voicing their concerns this
week. Doug Flutie said he was unhappy about being benched in favor
of Rob Johnson at quarterback for the wild-card game. Now, Andre
Reed, the veteran wide receiver, has complained about his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I'm not in their future plans, and I can't
subject my family or myself to that anymore,'' Reed wrote on his
Internet site. ``It's time for me to move on. I'll be happier. I
was not a happy player this year; it was miserable going to work
every day.''

STUDENT ACCUSED IN ALLEGED COMPUTER HARASSMENT OF WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Web-Stalker)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Beng Ky asked a UMass-Boston classmate out on a
date last fall, the 20-year-old woman told him she just wasn't
interested.
</P>
<P>
   But Ky persisted, investigators say. He called her repeatedly at
home. He followed her around campus, from building to building,
class to class. When she signed out a video at the Language
Library, Ky was right behind her, allegedly stealing her student ID
number _ which also was her Social Security number _ in order to
harass her in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the 24-year-old computer science major stood in
Dorchester District Court, charged with using the woman's Social
Security number, taken from the lab sign-up sheet, to break into
her campus computer account, order credit cards in her name, and
open an Internet account in the name of her nephew.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a wave of new-age computer crimes, a
burgeoning criminal frontier that has sparked calls for tighter
controls and spawned a national commission on ``cyberstalking.''
Just Wednesday, a Swansea, Mass. man was charged with making
Internet death threats against Mayor Thomas M. Menino and two other
city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor charges of computer trespassing and identity
theft lodged against Ky were the first brought against a
UMass-Boston student _ and among the first local cases of alleged
cyber-harassment resulting in criminal charges. The case has forced
U-Mass to rethink its policy of using students' Social Security
numbers as their student ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this particular case will be the impetus to look at
some of our policies and procedures and how students should provide
information,'' said UMass-Boston spokeswoman Annemarie
Lewis-Kerwin. ``We have zero tolerance for Internet fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ky had no criminal record, Suffolk Assistant District
Attorney Nancy Hathaway asked District Court Judge Margaret A.
Zaleski to set bail at $5,000 cash. Zaleski agreed, ordering Ky not
to contact the victim.
</P>
<P>
   With the assent of Ky's court-appointed attorney, Daniel E.
Dilorati, Zaleski included additional conditions: Ky must stay off
the Internet and give his computer hard drive to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Dilorati told reporters that $5,000 cash was ``excessive'' and
stressed that Ky has not been charged with the felony of stalking.
He also said that Ky ended his attempts to contact the woman last
November after the school warned him his actions were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a harassing case,'' DiLorati insisted. ``This is
not a stalking case.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has suspended Ky, a sophomore, who was arrested
Friday by UMass-Boston police. They began investigating when the
woman, whom authorities declined to identify, first complained
about unwelcome attention from Ky last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was frightened,'' said Detective Kathleen Potter, who
investigated with Sergeant Detective Stanley Stewart. ``She just
wanted him to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter said Ky was not charged with stalking because he never
made any threats, as required for prosecution under the stalking
law. The woman continued to attend classes last semester as Ky
continued to shadow her and authorities looked into his activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement he allegedly gave police after his arrest, Ky
said he was upset that his advances had been rejected but that he
did not view his actions as harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at her,'' Ky wrote, according to the office of
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II. ``I didn't really
want to hurt'' her ``at all. It was just for the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Potter and Hathaway, Ky used the woman's Social
Security number, which doubled as her identification number, along
with a Personal Identification Number, to access her internal
UMass-Boston computer account.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was still unclear how Ky obtained the PIN,
which is randomly selected by a computer and then mailed to the
student at home. Without the PIN, Ky would not have been able to
swap the woman's address with his own, as he is charged with doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Ky also allegedly used the woman's Social Security
number and the name of her 3-year-old nephew to set up an Internet
account with Digital Broadband Communications of Waltham, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   He also allegedly used her Social Security number to apply for
credit cards, which he apparently never used. According to
Hathaway, the woman's father is a mail carrier in and a co-worker
alerted him to mail addressed to his daughter at Ky's home, which
turned out to contain the credit cards.

CLINTON PROPOSES A FEDERAL CYBER SERVICE TO PROTECT COMPUTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday proposed new measures
to combat unauthorized intrusions into the nation's key computer
networks, including a monitoring program for government computers
that was scaled back amid criticism and a subsidized training
program for cybersleuths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age when one person sitting at one computer can
come up with an idea, travel through cyberspace, and take humanity
to new heights,'' Clinton said. ``Yet someone can sit at the same
computer, hack into a computer system, and potentially paralyze a
company, a city or a government.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that, as part of the budget for the 2001
fiscal year that he will propose on Feb. 7, he would request $91
million to develop programs to protect computer security. That sum
would be part of a $2-billion package _ up from $1.7 billion in the
current fiscal year _ for existing computer security efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would create an institute that would gather
``the finest computer scientists and engineers'' from universities,
research organizations and private enterprise to advance computer
technology and security. College scholarships would be offered to
students who study computer security and agree to join a ``Federal
Cyber Service'' that would help the government combat computer
attacks, a model similar to the ROTC program used to train military
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would include a sophisticated software
system to monitor government computer activities in search of
intrusions and other illegal actions. The Federal Intrusion
Detection Network, or Fidnet, has raised concerns among civil
liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides reworked the proposal to address privacy concerns
by restricting monitoring to government computers, not those in key
private industries, and by making clear that the program would be
run by the General Services Administration, not the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   If the monitors picked up illegal activity, information would be
sent to the FBI, an administration official with knowledge of the
plan said. But the FBI would not have routine access to the
program, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his chief counter-terrorism adviser, Richard
A. Clarke, of the National Security Council, said threats to
government and private computer networks run the gamut from
teen-age hackers to industrial spies to international terrorists.
Several countries have embarked on computer-terrorism programs to
created havoc in rival states, said Clarke, who refused to name
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in American history that we in the
federal government, alone, cannot protect our infrastructure,''
Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters. ``We can't hire an
army or a police force that's large enough to protect all of
America's cell phones or pagers or computer networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that thousands of unauthorized computer invasions
are attempted across the country every day. The targets are
governments, utilities and businesses, and the invaders' intentions
range from playing pranks to stealing passwords to planting
damaging computer viruses. A study by the General Accounting Office
issued in October said that security shortcomings in government
computers could jeopardize national defense, law enforcement, air
traffic control and other key operations.
</P>
<P>
   Several government Web sites have fallen victim to hackers in
recent months, including those at the White House, the FBI and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the hackers will take a more coordinated government
response, a partnership with private companies and a corps of
trained specialists, the president said. The initiatives grew out
of a study that Clinton ordered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Thomas, an information security expert at AverStar Inc.
who previously oversaw the Pentagon's response to computer attacks,
said keeping up with hackers will require a spirited government
response together with the commitment of private industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hackers don't have the bureaucracy we have to deal with in the
corporate world or in government,'' Thomas said. ``They're much
quicker and some of them are geniuses. The good news is we're
arresting more and more people. The bad news is it's a smaller and
smaller percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said heightened computer security should not tread
on the privacy rights of businesses and citizens. ``It is essential
that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some computer activists remained concerned about a
government offensive in the unstructured world of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is making some appropriate and even laudable
proposals but the monitoring of government computer systems _ I
call it a surveillance program _ could still violate the privacy of
legitimate computer users,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel
for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties
group in Washington.

19 STATES PAID BILLIONS MORE IN FEDERAL TAXES THAN THEY GOT BACK IN
SERVICES 

</HEADLINE>
 SPENDING-HNS

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteen states paid billions more dollars in federal taxes in
fiscal 1998 than they got back in federal services, according to a
recent Harvard study, but Texans came pretty close to breaking
even.
</P>
<P>
   Texas collects less per capita than the national average in such
areas as Social Security and Medicare payments, but nearly makes up
the difference in federal defense spending in the state. Texans
collect about $250 per capita less in federal services annually
than they pay out in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Though defense spending is a much smaller percentage of the
federal budget than the social service and assistance programs, the
concentration of defense dollars in a smaller number of states,
where defense contractors and bases are located, is a big factor in
determining winners and losers in federal funds distribution.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from Harvard University's JFK School of
Government concludes that in general terms, the rich states give to
the poor. On average, states whose residents have higher per capita
incomes receive less per capita federal spending than lower income
states.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing elements of the federal budget _ Social
Security, Medicare, retirement and disability programs _ have
always been oriented toward lower income states, the report states.
And defense spending has declined significantly in a small number
of high income states, such as California, Colorado and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a large number of states find themselves paying
taxes toward defense facilities located in a small number of
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about defense is it tends to be highly
variable across states, very idiosyncratic,'' says report author
Herman B. ``Dutch'' Leonard, professor of public finance at the JFK
School. ``What does the success in this process have to do with how
long your congressional delegation has been in office? The answer
is probably a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard adds, however, that the states actually have a pretty
big hand in determining how much federal money they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state chooses to fund in a relatively low level in some
of these domains, like welfare, the federal government pays
relatively low as well,'' Leonard said. ``Therefore the total is
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, has a relatively high poverty rate but
chooses to fund many of its social service programs at a rate about
10 percent lower than the national average. That means the amount
of federal matching funds returned to the state are proportionately
lower, too.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, for example, is at the bottom of the list of states
in terms of federal funds received vs. taxes sent to Washington, a
deficit of $2,400 per resident. But Connecticut residents have the
highest per capita incomes in the nation, about 45 percent higher
than the national average, and therefore don't qualify for much
federal poverty assistance funding.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is at the top of the list, collecting $3,600 more in
federal funding per resident than what it sends to Washington in
tax dollars. But the key to New Mexico's success in the federal
dollars game is that the small state population is reaping the
benefits of expensive defense and energy facilities located in Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states tended to collect more than they paid out in
federal taxes, while states in the Northeast and around the Great
Lakes did not.
</P>
<P>
   The first analysis of federal dollars collected vs. federal
dollars spent in the states was commissioned by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan in 1977, mainly to counter criticism that New York was an
unfair recipient of federal largesse.
</P>
<P>
   The report eventually began to examine all 50 states, and
Harvard scholars took over the project in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the federal government's role were to be neutral, if they
were to give back exactly what their citizens pay in, I would raise
the question: Why would we need the federal government?'' asks Ray
Scheppach, executive director of the National Governor's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most economists would argue that at least for elderly and
disabled populations, to the extent that they are low-income
populations, there is a federal role to re-distribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The report ranked the states where the federal government
collected more tax dollars than it spent from highest to lowest.
Those states are New Mexico, Virginia, West Virginia, North Dakota,
Montana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Maryland, Kentucky, Hawaii,
Alabama, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Maine, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Rhode Island, Iowa,
Arizona, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Vermont, Florida, Nebraska,
North Carolina, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   These states had deficits in federal funds: Georgia, Texas,
Washington, Ohio, Indiana, Oregon, Colorado, California,
Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin, Delaware, Minnesota, Illinois,
New Hampshire, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey and Connecticut.

<P>
   Buy a technology stock. Close your eyes. And hold on for dear
life.
</P>
<P>
   That was the formula for success as a sizzling equity market,
fueled by a white-hot technology sector, propelled many stock-fund
managers to double-digit returns in the fourth quarter of 1999,
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Three managers whose funds were on the list of top performers
talked about their winning stock picks for the quarter and looked
to the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Funds from the Janus family have often been near the top of
performance lists in recent years, and the last quarter was no
exception. The Janus Venture fund, which leans toward smaller
technology stocks, returned 82.8 percent, earning it the No. 5
place on the overall list of diversified equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for small-cap growth companies with high return on
invested capital, strong market positions and open-ended growth
opportunities,'' said Jonathan D. Coleman, co-manager of the $2.7
billion fund with William H. Bales.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund's biggest winners was SDL, a semiconductor maker
in San Jose, Calif., whose stock rose 185.7 percent in the quarter.
The company's chips are used in dense wave division multiplexing,
or DWDM, which splits fiber optic cable into many wavelengths of
light, greatly increasing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a primary beneficiary in the surge of data traffic caused
by skyrocketing Internet usage,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also made money in Enzon, a biotechnology company in
Piscataway, N.J., that produces a second-generation version of
alpha interferon, a drug used for treating hepatitis C. Enzon,
whose shares rose 42.2 percent in the quarter, has a distribution
agreement with Schering-Plough for the drug, called peg-intron A,
and will get ``a high-single-digit royalty on every dollar's worth
of sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner was Commerce One, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company
whose software creates a vendor network that lets buyers bid for
goods online. ``Instead of purchasing managers calling distributors
around the country to track down the best prices,'' Bales said,
``they just bid on the Internet.'' The stock rose 503.3 percent in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, the two managers are cautious. ``We've been
fortunate to experience a tremendous period of returns that are not
sustainable long term,'' Bales said. Further, he added, ``we have
concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest
rates, because the economy is so strong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Internet companies were hot, one part of that sector was
especially so. ``The focus of investors this quarter was on
business-to-business opportunity,'' said Frank P. Slattery, who
runs the $228.6 million PBHG New Opportunities fund.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is concentrated, holding just 30 companies with
fast-growing earnings or sales. Technology stocks make up 80
percent of the fund, with 15 percent to 20 percent of the total in
business-to-business, or B2B, stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tax efficiency is not a strong point. The fund's turnover is
projected at 500 percent, because Slattery trades in and out of his
30 holdings as well as other stocks to capture short-term gains. In
the fourth quarter, the fund returned 166.1 percent, giving it the
No. 1 slot on the overall list.
</P>
<P>
   One big winner was InfoSpace.com, a company in Redmond, Wash.,
that syndicates Internet content like horoscopes, weather forecasts
and stock quotations to the likes of America Online and Microsoft.
Such information ``builds customer brand loyalty for the Web
page,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose stock rose 420.4 percent in the quarter, has
also signed up wireless providers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also made money in Rare Medium Group, a Web consulting
firm in New York that focuses on B2B e-commerce, linking suppliers
and buyers and putting their Internet strategies into practice.
``It's one of the best and most advanced implementation firms,''
Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Medium also functions as an incubator of online B2B
companies, owning stakes in 20 concerns, a number of which will go
public in 2000, he added. He expects the company, whose stock rose
223.1 percent in the quarter, to earn a profit in the first half of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The fund benefited, too, from its position in Certicom, a
Mississauga, Ontario, concern that produces encryption technology
used by companies to make their Internet communications secure.
Such technology is ``one of the fastest-growth areas in
business-to-business commerce,'' Slattery said. The stock rose
421.2 percent in the quarter, and he expects the company to become
profitable in the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter of a year, Slattery said, technology
stocks are traditionally strong. As for how the sector fares later
in 2000, he added, ``it depends on how investors perceive the
growth of the Internet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surge of hot initial offerings landed the $57.8 million IPO
Plus Aftermarket fund at No. 16 on the list of top performers, with
a return of 71.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the three co-managers _ Linda R. Killian and a
husband-and-wife team, William K. and Kathleen S. Smith _ sifted
through more than 500 offerings with market capitalizations of more
than $50 million, more than double last year's total. They ended
the year with 65 stocks in their portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   They posted strong profits from Genentech, the biopharmaceutical
giant, which finished the quarter with a 83.9 percent gain. The
managers bought the stock in its July offering, when it was spun
off from Roche.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very strong drug pipeline,'' Ms. Killian said,
``and a good mix of mature and early-stage drugs that could be
groundbreaking.'' She cited Herceptin, for treating breast cancer,
and Rituxan, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite was Invitrogen, a Carlsbad, Calif., company
that produces kits used for gene cloning and identification, and
for DNA sequencing. The company is a way to play gene research in
both the medical and agricultural fields, Ms. Killian said; since
its February offering, it has made several acquisitions, including
a gene library. The shares rose 78.4 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also made money in Sycamore Networks, in Chelmsford,
Mass. The stock, bought at its October offering, was up 710.5
percent by the end of the year. The company produces software that
lets companies transmit data directly over a fiber optic network
without using an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, is cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the valuation of companies defies logic, we look
at the coming IPO pipeline and still see a lot of good companies,''
Ms. Killian said. ``We don't expect this year's enormous demand to
repeat, but there's still a huge supply-and-demand imbalance.''

PATRIOTS _ WITH AN EYE ON BELICHICK _ CONTINUE INTERVIEWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If life was fair, the new coach of Patriots
would be a man who has earned his stripes through years of loyalty
and excellence, one who has seen and dealt with every situation,
one who has been successful with different teams and adapted his
philosophy of the game to the talent he has on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be someone who tells it like it is, no lip service.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities define Patriots defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell, 55, who formally interviewed with the team Friday and will
interview in Green Bay unless the Packers make a quick decision on
Butch Davis or are able to extract Jon Gruden from Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots feel Bill Belichick is a bigger fish, and the
one they want swimming in their humble Foxborough pond. It appears
only a matter of days before Belichick will be announced as the
team's head coach and general manager and the team reassigns vice
president of player personnel Bobby Grier, who will be a
transitional consultant, if he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what will Belichick's coaching staff look
like if he can't take the Jets' assistants with him? One
possibility might be to elevate Jets running back coach Maurice
Carthon to offensive coordinator or hire Chicago offensive
coordinator Gary Crowton and give him an assistant head coach tag.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell met with Grier and Andy Wasynczuk Friday. Robert Kraft
was present for Sidwell's interview and available when Baltimore
Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis, 41, met with the
hierarchy in Boston and Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the process,'' said Sidwell. ``I'm happy that I was
able to talk to them about my football philosophy. I hope I made a
good impression. I would love to be the head coach of the New
England Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell is also a potential candidate in New Orleans, where
owner Tom Benson is a big supporter of his. But the Saints will
hire a GM first and he'll hire the coach. New Orleans GM candidate
Charley Casserly was in Houston Friday meeting with owner Bob
McNair about taking over that expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have now interviewed Oakland Raiders defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw, Crowton, Sidwell, and Lewis. There are
more to come, but the information in Foxborough is not being
released in great doses in what is a very private process.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will take the weekend to review the candidates they
have interviewed. St. Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz, who
is now being considered for a position in New Orleans, may be a
future candidate. There appears a slight chance Marty
Schottenheimer could be talked out of retirement, but that is still
a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   But all of it appears to be window dressing _ killing time until
Belichick arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Until commissioner Paul Tagliabue actually rules on the
grievance Belichick filed Thursday, there will be other issues to
speak about.
</P>
<P>
   One of the charges you always hear during these contractual
squabbles between rival teams is tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Newsday reported that Jets officials feel
there was evidence of tampering by the Patriots with Belichick. The
charge was that the Patriots made it clear to Belichick they wanted
him long before Bill Parcells resigned (while Belichick was still
an assistant coach), which the Jets would have had to honor. But
the Jets have claimed Belichick's head coaching deal kicked in the
moment Parcells tendered his resignation last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tampering was brought up three years ago when the Patriots felt
the Jets had pre-arranged a deal with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Though the league has specific tampering rules, they are rarely
enforced or proven because there are so many ways for Team A to
communicate with a player or a coach on another team.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, for example, Belichick's agent is Neil Cornrich,
who represents several Patriots (Andy Katzenmoyer, Adam Vinatieri,
and Tony Simmons) and Jets (former Patriots punter Tom Tupa,
defensive end Anthony Pleasant). The NFL has not cracked down on
agents representing both players and coaches like Major League
Baseball has in recent years. It leaves the door wide open for
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a similar situation with Pete Carroll, who was
represented by Gary Uberstine's California firm, which also
represents Troy Brown, Shawn Jefferson, Chad Eaton, Steve Israel
and Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is represented by Ray Anderson, who also represented
Willie Shaw, the Oakland Raiders' defensive coordinator who
interviewed Wednesday. Anderson also represents Patriots strong
safety Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said on Wednesday that he didn't know of any evidence
that the Patriots had tampered.
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots GM Patrick Sullivan recalls when owner Victor
Kiam tried to press tampering charges against the Jets when the
late Dick Steinberg left the Patriots to go head the Jets. Kiam
tried to get compensation, but Sullivan informed Kiam that he
likely didn't have a case because he told Steinberg he was free to
go. When Kiam brought the case to Tagliabue, very early in his job
as commissioner, Tagliabue threw the case out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember Leon Hess sitting there, shaking his head,''
said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is certainly intrigued by the current Patriots-Jets
drama. He's been on an ownership team about to sell a franchise,
and he understands what the Jets are going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There a lot of conversations going on in an effort to get
stability,'' said Sullivan. ``You go through the entire process and
due diligence concerning the value of the franchise on a set of
circumstances that now do not exist. The value of the Jets is
pretty much fixed. They know what their stadium deal is, their
merchandising deals, the local rights deals. The variables, what
are the players worth and who's your coach? It puts a real monkey
wrench into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally wouldn't be surprised to see Parcells back in
there. The new owners have to take a crack at enticing him back. If
I were in their shoes, that's what I would want to do. If he's not
the best coach, he's in the top two or three in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said that for the most part, the Jets' sale in fairly
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Until now) there's not been an enormous amount of publicity
about it,'' he said. ``It's been quiet. It's not like the Redskins,
where John Cooke wanted to keep the team. John Hess doesn't want to
keep the team. I think it's been a stable sale situation. (Jets
president) Steve Gutman is a very sharp guy. Very capable guy. He
said he'll run that thing until there is an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said whether there are tampering issues or simply an
issue of the validity of Belichick's contract, ``It's ultimately
going to be decided by compensation.'' While the Jets will pursue a
similar package to the one the Patriots received for Parcells,
Sullivan doesn't believe the package will be comparable. ``It's
tough to get that because you're not dealing with a coach in this
case with the same track record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan believes that the Patriots have handled everything the
right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``They asked permission to speak to
Belichick and did that on the up and up. There's no mistaking this
guy is a good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan doesn't buy a scenario in which Belichick doesn't
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not gonig to walk away from that type of contract,'' said
Sullivan. ``He's either going to another team or he's going back to
the Jets. He's not going to sit out the prime three years of his
coaching career. Coaches are very practical people.''

 &HT;    Gay coalition working for unity
 &HT;    By Kavita Kumar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They spent almost half an hour deliberating over
verbs and prepositions. They knew one word could mean the
difference between solidarity and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Should their banner read ``Sharing in his dream'' or ``Working
for his dream''?
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights activists wanted to make sure they appeared to be
supporting and not appropriating Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether they should include the coalition's name on the
banner or just carry rainbow flags, well, that was a whole other
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they unanimously agreed on ``Working for his dream''
in large letters with the group's full name _ The Miami Valley Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Supportive Community Coalition _
in smaller letters at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The recently formed umbrella organization will carry this banner
at Dayton's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day march and rally Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The group voted on the banner and the action Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Its decision came weeks after several area ministers, many of
them black, lobbied members of the Dayton City Commission to block
Commissioner Mary Wiseman's proposal to add homosexuals, the poor
and Appalachians to the city's anti-discrimination ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The activists saw the King parade as an opportunity for members
of the gay community to express their solidarity with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're realizing that while we're not anywhere close to being
the same, that the struggle for GLBT people for civil rights has
many parallels with the black community,'' said Lee Strausberg,
founder and director of the coalition. ``And while we do not want
to steal from them, we do want to stand up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   March organizers say the coalition is welcome to march _ as is
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not about to be discriminating against any person who
is marching for the dream and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.,'' said Raleigh Trammell, president of the Dayton chapter of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King's dream and
legacy ``is that we ought to love one another and come together in
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GLBT Community Coalition, formed early last fall, now has an
e-mail list of more than 120 members.
</P>
<P>
   The recent dispute over changes to the city ordinance has
galvanized the group and brought more people to its meetings.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization has a specific focus, coalition members
emphasize that, like its banner says, they are working towards
equality for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus on getting rights for everyone because we
understand we can't do it alone,'' Strausberg said. ``If we want
the community to support us, then we want to support the community.
After all, we are a community made up of all the other
communities.''

 &HT;    Who speaks for Jesus?
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a gay man, it is no surprise that the Rev.
Mike Castle supported a recent failed effort to extend Dayton's
anti-discrimination ordinance to include homosexuals and poor
people.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, he invited the author of that proposal, City
Commissioner Mary Wiseman, to speak to his congregation at Cross
Creek Community Church. The congregation, about half of whom are
gay, gave Wiseman a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus showed up at city hall, and all hell broke loose!''
proclaimed Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Those who successfully opposed the amendment would agree that,
indeed, Jesus showed up at city hall. But he was on their side.
It's difficult to deny that both the Old and New Testaments speak
with a strong voice that homosexuality is a sin. Wiseman's
opponents would argue that sinful behavior should not be protected
by law.
</P>
<P>
   In a Christian-based society, it's a question that comes up in
any attempt to legislate morality: Who gets to speak for Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   Don McMurry believes the truth can be found in 1 Corinthians
6.9: ``Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit
the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor
idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor
thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurry, associational missionary for the Greater Dayton
Association of Baptists, helped lead the charge that defeated
Wiseman's amendment. The organization sent out faxes and e-mail to
its 30,000 members, and many of them, both lay and clergy, showed
up at two City Commission meetings to speak against the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that they spoke for the Christian
community,'' he says, pointing out that they came from Assembly of
God, Pentecostal and other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't speak for the Rev. John Paddock. Paddock, rector
at Christ Episcopal Church, was one of a dozen clergy who signed a
letter of support for the ordinance that was sent to the Dayton
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Paddock acknowledges that there are several biblical passages
that condemn homosexuality. ``But every one of them is
problematic.'' Two thousand years ago, he says, people did not
understand that homosexuality is an orientation, not a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, ``Jesus never said anything against
homosexuality. He was constantly welcoming (outcast) people _
prostitutes and tax collectors _ and was constantly criticized by
church leaders for hanging out with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that Jesus condoned a sinful lifestyle,
according to the Rev. Randy Chesnut. Chesnut, of North Dayton
Baptist Church, is troubled by the notion that ``love is
permissive. That if you really love someone, you don't speak
against their sin.'' It was Christ, he points out, who said, ``Go
and sin no more.'' He emphasizes that he opposes any form of
violence, persecution or harassment. ``Homosexuality doesn't
deserve greater condemnation than any other sin.'' But forgiveness
is only part of the package that is Christian salvation, he
explains. The other part is transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Castle admits that the Bible doesn't mince words about
homosexuality. Leviticus 18:22 says, ``You shall not lie with a
male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.'' But Castle
observes it isn't fair to pick and choose with Leviticus, which
also condemns the eating of pork and the wearing of clothing woven
from different types of fibers. ``I don't know many Southern
Baptists who want to give up their barbecued pork,'' laughs Castle,
who was himself an ordained Southern Baptist minister until he
could no longer reconcile his homosexuality with his denomination's
position on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Castle, who is now ordained with the United Church of Christ,
approaches Scriptural interpretation using the criteria set forth
by John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church. Scripture, Wesley
said, should be informed by reason, church tradition, experience
and discipleship.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman, who was raised United Methodist, wasn't surprised that
biblical Scripture was used to oppose the amendment. That's what
has happened in cities across the country, where there have been
attempts to pass such an ordinance. ``But I was surprised that it
got such a strong foothold here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the voices of the opponents were louder than those
who supported the anti-discrimination amendment. Did they speak for
the majority of Dayton's Christian community? The Rev. Karen
MacDonald of Northminster Presbyterian Church isn't sure. ``I still
think a fair number of folks aren't sure about it. They'll still
trying to sort it out. They're the ones who are not speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are the ones whose voices will need to be heard, as
mainline churches enter the 21st century. Methodists, Presbyterians
and Episcopalians have grappled with issues of the ordination of
gay clergy and the blessing of gay unions in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainline church has to open its doors wider than ever
before,'' says the Rev. Steven Camp of Faith United Church of
Christ. His church took out an ad in Impact Weekly in support of
the amendment. If churches don't become more welcoming, he says,
``a lot of gifts that people bring will not be present. A lot of
churches will close.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman describes herself as ``a perpetual church-hopper,'' in
search of a spiritual home. She believes that faith and politics
can _ and should _ mix. ``To be a good public servant, you have to
remain true to your own core values. For many of us, that is
remaining true to our religion. The line you draw is when you say,
'This is my personal faith, and this is the way the rest of the
world ought to be.'''

BUSH BOOK CHALLENGES IMAGE; OBFUSCATING ON OBFUSCATE; GETTING THE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Voters who attended speeches by Gov. George
W. Bush this week in New Hampshire and Iowa got more than just a
handshake, a promise and a heady brush with political celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   They got a bound, paperback copy of his collected works.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fresh Start for America: Policy Addresses of George W.
Bush'' brings together Bush's entire canon: his November
reflections on foreign policy (``A Distinctly American
Internationalism''), his October musings on education (``A Culture
of Achievement''), his July comments on the role of religious
organizations in social work (``The Duty of Hope'').
</P>
<P>
   The latter was particularly compelling, at least according to
the journalist Clarence Page, who wrote a column in The Chicago
Tribune that raved, ``If it were a movie, it would deserve an
Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader of ``A Fresh Start for America'' knows this because
the book is rife with blurbs, and not only on the matte back cover
of the 208-page book, but also in between every chapter, one per
big speech.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that some of them were carefully selected from longer
articles or television commentaries that included less flattering
observations. The Bush campaign has learned how to use ellipses and
learned how to use them well.
</P>
<P>
   None of these addresses was previously kept under wraps. Each
time Bush gave one, his aides provided journalists with a title, a
transcript, a synopsis, short biographies of the academic and
political luminaries who influenced it and even their telephone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Fresh Start for America,'' which came out this week,
revisits the hits, in a portable volume that allows the more
discerning, attentive types of people who vote in state primaries
to take measure of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The book accurately conveys what the Bush campaign intends it
to: that despite his opponents' characterizations of him as vague
and weightless, he has clearly stated his views on an array of
issues and has put forward several concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Fresh Start for America'' is also a near-perfect emblem
of the style, methods and gestalt of the Bush campaign, which is
amazingly thorough, astonishingly organized, opulently packaged and
a bit overemphatic in its response to any insinuation that Bush
lacks the gravitas to govern a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had already produced an election-season autobiography, ``A
Charge to Keep,'' written primarily by his communications director,
Karen P. Hughes, and financed and distributed by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   So ``A Fresh Start for America'' is a bonus, published by the
campaign itself, at a cost of nearly $1 per copy. Aides said that
50,000 copies have already been printed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held one aloft at an appearance in Salem, N.H., on Thursday
morning. ``For people having trouble sleeping at night,'' he said,
``I suggest Chapter Three.''
</P>
<P>
   A Trip of the Tongue and Memories of His Father
</P>
<P>
   Away from the printed page, Bush was having a little trouble
with eloquence _ or at least pronunciation _ this week.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers who watched the Republican debate on Thursday
night probably noticed this when Bush, wearing an expression of
apparent satisfaction with the big word he was about to unleash,
promised that he would never ``obsfucate'' as president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good thing, because the verb is ``obfuscate,'' and
this was the third time in two days that Bush seemed to mangle it.
</P>
<P>
   On each occasion, he paused slightly either before or after, the
oratorical equivalent of a drum roll or cymbal crash. And on each
occasion, it never sounded quite right.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, it was clear why. He had the consonants mixed
up, the letter ``s'' in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, at an appearance in Rochester, N.H., he was
neither obsfucating or obfuscating, but he was conflating the words
tariff and barriers into terriers, which he promised to knock down
in the name of trade. Would retrievers and spaniels be next?
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly caught himself, which he did not do when, during
two previous appearances in New Hampshire this week, he referred
twice to ``a post-cold world,'' strangely bypassing the war. Or
maybe he was just referring to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   And Speaking of Father: Let Him Speak for Himself
</P>
<P>
   These verbal tics _ the exception with Bush, not the norm _
brought to mind his father, who was renowned for the grammatical
and syntactical chaos he made of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   But former President Bush was hovering over the week's events in
other _ and sometimes stranger _ ways.
</P>
<P>
   His son was reminded repeatedly of his father's famous broken
pledge not to raise taxes (``Read my lips'').
</P>
<P>
   And it put Bush in an odd bind. He could not say his father's
actions were laudable because that would make his own stated
passion for tax cutting seem suspect. But he could not say his
father's actions were deplorable because that would make him seem
like a cad.
</P>
<P>
   So he bunted, saying his father and his father's record could
speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But what was being said by another record: a rendition of the
song ``Cat's in the Cradle,'' which describes a son who vows to
grow up to be just like his father?
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a soundtrack that was put together by the Bush
advance team in New Hampshire and blared over speakers at several
events. And it seemed to represent the rare occasion when the
campaign's attention to detail flagged.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the song is that the father, too busy with his own
ambitions to pay any attention to his son, makes a similarly
insensitive man out of him.

REINVENTING THE VARIABLE ANNUITY, WITH MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (af) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Jones is holding forth in a small conference room in the
John Hancock tower in downtown Boston, talking about new features
of a product that receives a lot of negative comment from experts _
variable annuities. Among other benefits, the annuities may now
offer guaranteed returns, even in market downturns, and money for
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked at answering objections to the product,'' said
Jones, who is in charge of variable annuities, a combination of
mutual funds and insurance, at the John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., ``and we've added features to address things that
consumers worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But the things that many financial planners worry about most are
fees, which for variable annuities are averaging 50 percent more
than those for comparable mutual funds. And there is only so much
that John Hancock and the other big variable-annuity companies say
they can do to pare those costs. Adding more features generally
adds more in fees, which can be a big drag on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to buy one of these things you ought to buy
the simplest version at the lowest cost,'' said Judith Martindale,
a fee-only financial planner in San Luis Obispo, Calif., who rarely
recommends variable annuities. ``Some of these features may not
actually be worth much. And for things like nursing home needs,
you'd probably be better off shopping for the coverage separately.
You usually can't get everything at the best price at one stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, big variable-annuity companies like Nationwide and
American Skandia are convinced that customers want more, not less,
in their annuities. So they are offering a cafeteria of choices,
letting customers pick what they like and pay accordingly. That can
make a complicated investment even more so.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Eisenbach, in charge of variable annuities at Nationwide,
calls the new approach ``customization or modularization _ as
opposed to one size fits all.''
</P>
<P>
   With competition heating up, the companies are also offering
cash bonuses to attract business, the way banks once offered
toasters and blenders. Many companies are adding at least 3 percent
to the value of the initial investments _ meaning that a new
$100,000 account, for example, is credited as $103,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of bonus helps customers use the strategy of
dollar-cost averaging _ the investing of fixed amounts at fixed
intervals. A company puts an investor's cash into a sort of holding
area, paying interest of 10 percent or 12 percent, significantly
above money market rates, as it is disbursed into mutual funds over
six months. (The company may offer lower, but still above-market,
rates for six additional months.)
</P>
<P>
   Such bonuses reduce the companies' profit but are a calculated
trade-off. ``It may be a long-term solution to get customers in and
collect insurance and management fees for 15 or 20 years and maybe
get some other business out of the same customer,'' said Patrick
Reinkemeyer, who monitors variable annuities for Morningstar, the
financial researcher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The variable annuity has long been a way to take a run at the
stock market with the assurance that if the investor dies, the
heirs will receive at least the original amount invested. Now
companies will increase the amount that an investor's heirs receive
so that it equals at least 5 percent compounded annually, or the
high-water mark reached by the investment, whichever is higher. The
cost for this guarantee is often one-quarter of a percentage point
of the account's value annually.
</P>
<P>
   American Skandia offers the highest guaranteed return of this
type _ 7.2 percent compounded annually, which means that a $100,000
investment will at least double in 10 years. The cost is half a
percentage point a year, or $500 on a $100,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are offering an even better guarantee _ a promise
that the money available to the investor, rather than his or her
heirs, will increase at a steady rate. That guarantee gives a
variable annuity, which fluctuates with the market, some of the
safety of a fixed annuity.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the market does, the investment will grow by a
guaranteed percentage _ often 5 percent. But you have to pay for
that guarantee, typically 0.3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial experts say such guarantees are usually a waste
of money, because stock investments have historically enjoyed
average annual returns of more than 10 percent _ and there have
been few periods of even five years in which stock investors have
lost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``These benefits are much more psychologically valuable than
economically valuable,'' Reinkemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   To provide for nursing home care, Nationwide intertwines nursing
home coverage with a variable annuity, while John Hancock promises
to pay a set amount for three years to cover any expenses that may
arise from infirmities of age.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Nationwide package, to be introduced in most states later
this year, a 55-year-old woman, for example, would make a single,
up-front payment of, say, about $60,000. Of that total, 40 percent,
or $24,000, would go into mutual funds. The balance would pay for
nursing care indefinitely at a rate of $100 a day. The amount would
rise 5 percent annually so that in 30 years the daily benefit would
be $432.
</P>
<P>
   Because women tend to live longer than men, a 55-year-old man
could get the same minimum daily benefit for a single payment of
$33,500, with 60 percent of the money, or $20,100, going into the
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The annual cost for the mutual funds in this package is 1.40
percent of assets, or about the same as for many variable annuities
without the nursing care, plus the usual average of about
0.9percent charged to manage the funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nationwide package, the benefit of the health care
allocation can be claimed only if the investor qualifies for
nursing home services or their equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan addresses customers' concerns about their ability to
pay for such care _ and offers a convenient way to get coverage.
Although financial planners and consumer advocates say a consumer
might find a better deal by shopping for nursing home coverage
separately, Tom Houle, who is in charge of new products at
Nationwide, said customers could generally expect premiums on
separate nursing home care to rise over the years.
</P>
<P>
   For the Nationwide nursing home care, there are no charges after
the initial payment. Moreover, he said, the customer's heirs would
receive at least the amounts originally invested into the funds and
the health care component.
</P>
<P>
   The John Hancock plan pays 1 percent of an initial investment _
say, $1,000 on $100,000 _ every month for three years from the time
an investor can no longer take care of himself. It costs
35-hundredths of a percentage point. The benefit is paid directly
to the investor rather than to a nursing home and can be used for
any purpose.
</P>
<P>
   One big caveat, however, is that the benefit cannot be received
until the eighth year of the investment. That is just past the
seven-year period in which Hancock, like most other companies, is
recouping the up-front commissions it pays to sales
representatives. During that time, companies impose big cash
penalties on withdrawals, known as surrender charges _ as high as
8.5 percent of the initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   Surrender charges have prompted many investor complaints; they
apply even if the account holder goes into a nursing home or
becomes disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some companies will waive the surrender charges under such
circumstances _ but again, at a cost. Scudder Kemper Investments, a
unit of the Zurich Financial Services Group, lets investors
eliminate the penalty should they go into a nursing home by paying
an additional five-hundredths of a percentage point annually.
</P>
<P>
   The exception for other disabilities costs another
five-hundredths of a point. While a customer younger than 59{ would
still have to pay a 10 percent penalty to the Internal Revenue
Service, the company's penalty would at least be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some companies have been permitting withdrawals
of up to 10 percent of the amount invested in the annuity without
penalty. Now, at no extra charge, some companies are increasing
that ceiling to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All these features are meant to encourage the timid investor to
forswear certificates of deposit and venture into the often more
rewarding, but riskier, world of stock investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, variable annuities may be more expensive than mutual
funds,'' said Jones of John Hancock. ``But many people would not be
in the equities market if we did not have these features.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a price to pay for them.

 &HT;    Who's in the money? Everybody, if the latest slate of big-cash
game shows is any sign
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as TV personality Fred Allen said nearly 50 years ago,
``Imitation is the sincerest form of television,'' then this
weekend will find TV at its most sincere. ABC juggernaut ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' returns; NBC and CBS debut their own
game shows, trying to jump-start the same kind of pop-culture
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who isn't admitting to being a copycat is a liar,''
admits Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, with unusual
candor for a TV exec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's running to copy (`Millionaire'), and we are,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television and the game show are made for each other,'' says
Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television. ``The miracle is it didn't happen a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit _ or blame _ ``Millionaire,'' the fuse that set off the
explosion. When it debuted in August, it was seen as a cheap summer
substitute program. By its second run in November sweeps, it was a
national obsession, seen by more than half the country at least
once, averaging 24 million viewers and knocking off Top 10
stalwarts such as ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America didn't fall in love with the game show,'' says
Thompson. ``It fell in love with this particular game show.''
</P>
<P>
   Four game shows in prime time will be the most since the early
'60s. Although the quiz show scandals of 1958-'59 wiped out most of
them, panel shows such as ``What's My Line?'' and ``I've Got a
Secret'' remained popular.
</P>
<P>
   Now, networks see game shows as quick fixes for their scheduling
problems. And like newsmagazines, which proliferated in recent
years (and now are mostly seeing their audience drop away), game
shows are much cheaper to produce than sitcoms or dramas, even with
the money they give away.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's convergence is just part of the story, though.
This summer, CBS will run ``Survivor,'' in which 16 regular folks
will be stranded on a desert island in the South Pacific, then vote
to eliminate each other one by one, with the winner at the end
getting $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardy!'' and ``Wheel of Fortune'' continue to rank as the
most popular syndicated shows, and ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' on
Comedy Central has the best categories (``Keep Your Hands Off My
Falkland Islands,'' ``50 Ways to Leave Your Louvre'').
</P>
<P>
   Even Game Show Network, a small cable channel with limited
distribution in metro Atlanta, is building a cult following with
its ``Inquizition,'' a laughably cheap ($500 for first place) but
fast-moving and addictive show in which a mysterious host, whose
face is never seen, fires rapid questions at a panel of citizens
and mocks them as they are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone loves the trend. ``Game shows are just white noise
in life,'' says Harry Knowles, Web master of the entertainment site
Ain't It Cool News. ``They create the desire to get rich quick. By
making the game easy and the prize value high, (they) create a
feeling of success and self-esteem in the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, audiences and advertisers love them, says Allen
Ginsberg, executive vice president of media for the Atlanta-based
ad agency BBDO South. Even though he predicts that ``the majority,
if not all, of the imitators will stumble or fail,'' he admits he
could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had put Regis (Philbin) in front of me six months
ago,'' Ginsberg says, ``I wouldn't have thought that was going to
be a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, of the Center for the Study of Popular Television,
agrees that the mania may quickly fizzle, including, possibly,
``Millionaire.'' ABC executives have agonized over how to best use
their unexpected hit, fearing that audiences would burn out on it
quickly as a regular series. But that's what ``Millionaire''
becomes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of game shows is that once you're tired of them,
there's nothing the network can do to bring you back,'' says
Thompson. ``With a drama like `ER,' it can be fixed or beefed up if
it starts to lag. With a game show, it is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC may have won the November sweeps with ``Millionaire,'' but
it didn't use the show to launch a single new series, and in fact
pre-empted shows such as ``Sports Night'' that are having trouble
building an audience. Such herky-jerky scheduling angers viewers _
why should they commit to a show if the network won't? _ even if
those viewers are flocking temporarily to game shows.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the big networks _ their reason for being _ is
still entertainment series, the dramas and comedies that run for
years. Viewers are amazingly loyal to these TV families. In the
long run, the craze for game shows may hurt the very networks that
are rushing them on.
</P>
<P>
   A quick scorecard of the new wave of game-shows:
</P>
<P>
   'TWENTY ONE'
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Maury Povich
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NBC's ``Twenty One,'' a remake of the '50s show that was at
the center of the quiz show scandals (and the 1994 movie ``Quiz
Show''), debuts at 8 p.m. Sunday and has three more one-hour
specials (Jan. 16, 19 and 26). Maury Povich hosts the show, which
will once again stick competitors in soundproof isolation booths so
they don't know the score as they try to reach 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   'WINNING LINES'
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Dick Clark
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CBS' ``Winning Lines'' premieres at 8 p.m. Saturday for a
six-episode run. Hosted by Dick Clark, ``Lines'' is a knockoff of a
British show (as is ``Millionaire'') that starts with 49
competitors but quickly narrows it down to two people vying for $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   '. . .MILLIONAIRE'
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Regis Philbin
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the show that started
it all, returns at 8 p.m. Sunday for a run of eight straight
nights, then settles into a thrice-weekly schedule on Sundays,
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   'GREED'
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Chuck Woolery
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fox's ``Greed,'' the first of the ``Millionaire'' rip-offs,
</P>
<P>
   settles into a permanent (for now) time at 9 Friday. It has yet
to award its $2 million top prize.

GORE AND BRADLEY VIE FOR GAY VOTE IN NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley are fighting tooth and nail for votes in New Hampshire and
Iowa, but they are also looking ahead to the two biggest prizes in
the Democratic primary, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   This goes a long way toward explaining Gore's statement
Wednesday night that he would apply a litmus test to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, appointing only those who would agree to implement
his proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military. While
Bradley was not so explicit, he said he would expect the military
to follow his orders as commander in chief to allow gays to serve
openly.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York are home to significant numbers of gay
voters, and for the first time in presidential politics, those
voters are now part of a calculated strategy to win the Democratic
nomination. Homosexuals figure as prominently in Gore's plans to
stop Bradley as do African-Americans and organized labor, while
Bradley is counting on them to help transform his insurgent
candidacy into the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time there's been a competition in any
presidential primary for the gay and lesbian vote,'' said Jeff
Trammell, Gore's adviser on gay issues. ``It's part of the coming
of age politically for gay and lesbian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different in this election is not only the competition
for the gay vote but that the gay vote is now perceived to be
significant enough to form part of Gore's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking inside the Gore camp goes like this: Gore is poised
to win the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24 but is neck and neck with Bradley
in New Hampshire, whose primary is Feb. 1. If New Hampshire
legitimizes Bradley, New York, which votes March 7 and is already
extremely receptive to Bradley, could follow suit. In that case,
California, which also votes March 7, becomes all the more critical
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is counting on organized labor and minorities to help
him in New York, he is also relying on voters who are gay to stop
any Bradley momentum in California, advisers said. Turnout among
gays could be higher than usual in California this year because of
a state initiative on the ballot to ban same-sex marriage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Homosexuals have increasingly found strength at the ballot box.
People who identify themselves as gay make up between 8 percent and
9 percent of the primary electorate nationwide and a bit more in
New York and California, according to surveys of voters in previous
elections. In general elections, they account for about 5 percent
of the national total.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have openly gay delegates to the Democratic
National Convention. Both candidates have conducted numerous events
with gay leaders, and both have given lengthy interviews to The
Advocate, the gay magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers believe that Bradley has gained ground among
gays for two reasons. One is that Gore suffers by association with
President Clinton. Although Clinton was the first presidential
candidate to openly seek support from gays, many were disenchanted
with his compromise on gays in the military, settling for a ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy that now even Clinton has called
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that some Gore supporters think Bradley has
out-foxed Gore in the race for gay votes. ``Gore has a stronger
record over a longer period of time of being a leader on these
issues,'' said Richard Socarides, until recently the Clinton
administration official who oversaw gay and lesbian issues. ``But
it's frustrating because he's been out-maneuvered on tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Gore has long argued privately within the
administration to allow gays to serve openly in the military, it
was Bradley who first said in this campaign that he favored such a
policy. Gore did not publicly declare his position until after
Hillary Clinton and then the president both criticized the current
policy. This played into the damaging perception that Gore is a
politician who waits for political cover before taking a bold
position.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore has been looking for ways to distinguish
himself on matters of interest to homosexuals. In a first for a
presidential aspirant and a sitting vice president, Gore is
planning to answer questions online at a gay Web site
(www.gay.com), which has more than 2.3 million visitors per month.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he met with 300 gay and lesbian leaders here. On
Monday, after a speech at the United Nations in which he will
highlight global problems like AIDS, Gore plans to meet with a
number of gay and lesbian leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers said that the sharper comments at Wednesday night's
debate stemmed from Gore's long-held belief that gays should serve
openly but also from his need to reassert himself over Bradley with
gay voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff that that individual support my policy, and yes, I would
make that a requirement,'' Gore said in response to a question at
the debate. Bradley stopped short of saying he would apply a litmus
test.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore's comments have raised the ire of many in the
military, they were defended here Friday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
, D-Mass., who is campaigning for Gore. He noted that military
commanders never made an issue of a soldier's sexuality when they
needed people to fight a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the fewest kinds of court martials on this issue during
the Tet offensive and during the heaviest fighting,'' Kennedy told
reporters in Dubuque, Iowa. ``This was never an issue when the
bullets were flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said that the vice president's comments reflected
a growing consensus that supporting gay rights is not as
politically perilous as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll in December found that 70 percent of Americans
support allowing gays in the military (although 76 percent of those
in senior military ranks are opposed).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Bradley are sensing a change in public opinion,''
said Aaron Belkin, an assistant professor of political science at
the University of California at Santa Barbara and a director of a
center that studies gays in the military. ``The issue has become
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, they really want the gay votes in California,'' Belkin
said. ``Both are coming from exactly the same position, they're
just trying to outflank each other.''

JOB GROWTH CONTINUED AT A ROBUST PACE IN DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers added jobs at a surprisingly robust rate
in December, propelling the economy into the new year with
considerable momentum, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The economy created 315,000 new nonfarm jobs last month, 75,000
more than economists had predicted and the biggest one-month gain
since July. With more people entering the work force, the
unemployment rate remained at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, where
it has been for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.4 percent,
slightly more than expected. But because workers are producing more
for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far shows few signs of
setting off a surge in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While good news across the board, the figures substantially
increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will act to keep
the economy from overheating by raising interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investors acknowledged that a rate increase is
now all but certain, but concluded that inflationary pressures are
so muted that the Fed would limit the increase to a quarter of a
percentage point rather than the half point increase that the
markets had come to fear in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Both blue chip and technology stocks surged. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 269.30 points, to 11,522.56, a record.
The Nasdaq composite index reversed three days of sharp declines,
rising 155.49 points, to 3,882.62. Bond prices also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Job gains were particularly strong in retailing and construction
last month, while a prolonged decline in manufacturing jobs slowed
as exports showed signs of picking up.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that unemployment for all of 1999 averaged 4.2
percent, down from 4.5 percent in 1998 and the lowest rate since
1969, when it was 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also left little doubt that the economy would
continue growing for another month, all but assuring that the
current business expansion will become the nation's longest in
February at 8 years and 11 months, breaking a record set in the
1960s.

 &HT;    Director Jewison storms back with `Hurricane'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 9.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Norman Jewison flings open the curtains of his Four
Seasons Hotel suite, stands in the glorious light of a fiery
setting sun and does what he likes to do best: marvel at the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that!'' the celebrated movie director says, Atlanta's
downtown skyline arching before him, golden sunlight streaking
across the rising buildings. ``It's such a stunning city and very
famous with the Olympics and, you know, the engine of Ted Turner,
the engine of CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, he's heading for the phone. He's got to locate
Denzel Washington, who on this day is still in metro Atlanta,
filming Disney's high school football film ``Remember the Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to find out where he's staying,'' Jewison, 73, says
by phone to an assistant in Los Angeles. He'd like to catch up with
Washington, whom Jewison first directed in 1984 in the actor's
breakout film, ``A Soldier's Story,'' and chat about their latest
movie, ``The Hurricane.'' It's Jewison's 24th film and the one that
could land Washington, an Oscar winner for ``Glory,'' another
Academy Award nomination. ``Hurricane,'' the film biography of
boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20
years for murders he did not commit, opened Friday in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jewison's critically acclaimed film is up for three Golden Globe
awards, including best drama, actor (Washington) and director
(Jewison).
</P>
<P>
   While not exactly a household name, Jewison has been a fixture
in movies for roughly 40 years. Moviegoers who don't exactly know
of him likely have seen several of his films from the '60s to the
'80s, including ``The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are
Coming!,'' ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ``... And Justice for All,'' ``A
Soldier's Story,'' ``Agnes of God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and ``In
Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Oscars honored him with the Irving Thalberg
Award, and his most honored film _ ``In the Heat of the Night''
(1967) with Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier _ won best picture.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Heat,'' Jewison's ``Hurricane'' reflects the director's
longtime interest in racial issues. A half-century ago, he left his
native Canada and hitchhiked across the South. ``I couldn't believe
what I saw,'' he says. ``It was apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on two books, Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton's ``Lazarus
and the Hurricane'' and the boxer's own, ``The 16th Round,'' the
movie details how Carter was wrongly convicted in 1967 along with
fan John Artis in the murder of three people at a New Jersey bar.
It includes Bob Dylan's spirited 1975 anthem ``Hurricane,'' based
on the boxer's plight, and the efforts of a young African-American
and his trio of social worker friends who banded together and
sparked a campaign to free Carter from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jewison, visiting Atlanta recently to promote ``Hurricane'' and
film some spots for Turner Classic Movies, talked about making the
movie, working with Washington and his disdain for corporate
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get involved in this project?
</P>
<P>
   A: About eight or 10 years ago, (producer) David Picker came to
Toronto to meet with Rubin Carter, who lives there. He brought with
him the Sports Illustrated article that told the whole story of him
and this kid reading a book _ ``The 16th Round.'' That whole thing.
I was absolutely fascinated. I had remembered the incident when I
was shooting ``In the Heat of the Night.'' I remembered a little
bit of the press and I remembered the Bob Dylan song, but I had no
idea Rubin Carter was living in Toronto. I had no idea what had
happened and the connection with the Canadians and the kid. That's
what the picture is about _ him and the kid. But anyway, so what
happened is I read the book and was just totally mesmerized. I just
thought it was eloquent and passionate and moving. It was just a
plea for help. It was kind of biblical.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And did you have trouble getting Hollywood interested?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nobody wanted to make it. It's a black story. The studios are
very reluctant to get involved with a story like that. They think
the public doesn't want to see them. I went through it with ``A
Soldier's Story.'' I went through it with ``In the Heat of the
Night.'' So it wasn't commercial enough, I guess. And I don't think
it ever would have been made by a studio. Even now it's been made
by Beacon (Communications), which went out and raised the money.
All that's been done by Universal is getting the prints and ads and
releasing it. They weren't dying to make this film. But no, of
course, they'll try to take all the credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Denzel Washington's performance is intense. What did you do
to help spur him on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think it was through fear. I said, ``Denzel, you are
over 40, you've got to play a 28-, 29-year old fighter. I can't
help you. You're going to be alone in the center of the ring in a
pair of shorts and boxing shoes and gloves. You're naked. And
you've got to think about that. Are you right for this role? Do you
have the rage?'' I challenged him a little bit. He lost 44 pounds.
He went into training for six months. He boxed two hours every day,
five days a week, sometimes six. By the time we started that
picture he was unbelievable. And I got him together with Rubin. And
then things started to happen. It was just exciting stuff. He had
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All the boxing sequences are in black and white. And the
extras surrounding the ring had such classic '60s faces. How did
you manage such detail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ohhh, yeah. That was all shot in, believe it or not, Toronto.
I got all these actors. Talked to a lot of actors and got them to
play the people around the ring right where you can really see all
their faces. I tried to get some really interesting actors to play
roles and then I'd say, ``All right, you're the radio announcer.''
And then I thank Roger Deakins (the cinematographer for ``Fargo''
and ``Kundun''). He's just brilliant. This guy operates every shot.
So he's not only lighting, he's operating, which is really
difficult. But he gets it. You feel like you're joined at the hip.
It was great. I hope he gets a nomination. He deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The scene where Denzel spends 90 days in solitary confinement
should have been pretty challenging. He's hallucinating and seeing
and talking with several parts of himself.
</P>
<P>
   A: That was the most difficult and challenging artistic thing.
We were trying to literally conceive it where you've got a guy
talking to himself and then you see the person he's talking about.
You have to see the alter ego. And then he sees himself as a child.
And these obviously are voices in his head. I didn't want to do
``The Snake Pit,'' which is just voices. That's kind of boring. I
was trying to use the camera to establish that he thought someone
else was there and then the next time you cut he's that other
character talking and now he's talking back here. I think we caught
that kind of mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
   I went and sat in a cell in solitary and I'll tell you
something. I wouldn't last one night. I don't know how anyone could
do 90 days without totally freaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Years ago you left North America and went to live in Europe
for a while. What went wrong here?
</P>
<P>
   A: I remember marching and getting my head beat up and those
things in the '60s. I left the country in 1970 totally
disillusioned about America. I had been here 10 years making movies
in Hollywood and television in New York. And I left. God, Nixon was
president, Reagan was governor, the war in Vietnam. Forget it. You
know, Martin Luther King's funeral. I was working on Bobby
Kennedy's campaign. I was working with Melina Mercouri, and we were
supposed to meet him. ... I was so disillusioned, I was so empty
and I was so defeated. I had lost my faith in the American dream, I
guess. So I went to Europe for the next 10 years. I made
``Fiddler,'' ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ``Rollerball,'' all those
pictures I made in Europe and lived in Europe and took my family.
And then I got over it. Because when you start to lose your sense
of humor you're in big trouble. It wasn't the American people I was
angry at, it was the times and the leadership.

 &HT;    King legacy resonates with musical tribute
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 9.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's annual concert in
honor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday is ``the
biggest thing we do every year,'' said Mark Mobley, producer for
National Public Radio's ``Performance Today.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth year that the King tribute concert has been
broadcast live by NPR, according to the ASO. With the support of
the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, the ASO and regular guests such
as the Morehouse College Glee Club and Wendell P. Whalum Community
Chorus are heard across the country.
</P>
<P>
   NPR's participation also helps draw notable guest artists. This
year, actress S. Epatha Merkerson (``Law &AMP; Order'') will narrate
Aaron Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   All the works on the program, which will be conducted by Andre
Raphel Smith of the Philadelphia Orchestra, ``have a resonance and
a meaning to the legacy'' of King, Mobley said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Lincoln Portrait,'' for instance, has multiple
significance. The year 2000 is the centennial of the birth of
composer Copland, to whom tributes are being paid by musical
organizations across the country. A passionate advocate of civil
rights, Copland conducted a performance of the ``Lincoln Portrait''
with Coretta Scott King as narrator. Mrs. King plans to attend
Friday's concert in the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel
at Morehouse College.
</P>
<P>
   Because the concert coincides with the first anniversary of
Robert Shaw's death, it will open with Brahms' ``Tragic Overture,''
which Shaw led at one of the first King tribute concerts. And the
program includes several of Shaw and Alice Parker's arrangements of
spirituals, including ``I Got Shoes'' and ``My God Is a Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the Morehouse College Glee Club goes back to
Shaw's first years in Atlanta, when he heard this group led by
Whalum. The glee club and the Wendell P. Whalum Community Chorus
are now led by David Morrow, while Spelman's glee club is directed
by Kevin Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes the ``Negro Folk Symphony'' of the
African-American composer William Dawson, who was born in Atlanta,
and two spirituals, ``Ain't That Good News?'' and ``I Want to Be
Ready,'' arranged by Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   African-American composer James P. Johnson, whose work was
spotlighted by the ASO under guest conductor Marin Alsop last
summer, also appears on the program: ``Drums,'' which begins with a
timpani solo for the ASO's Mark Yancich.
</P>
<P>
   The concert ends with the traditional singing of the ``Negro
national anthem,'' ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing,'' also by Johnson
and arranged by Nathan Carter of Morgan State University in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A King Celebration Concert

 &HT;    Arthur Miller: A dramatist for the ages
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 9.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many pleasures in tonight's Showtime presentation of
``Death of a Salesman,'' there is an unexpected one. It's simply a
glimpse of the playwright, Arthur Miller, sitting in the audience
of Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theatre. He looks as sturdy and
craggy-handsome as ever at 84, gazing toward the stage as the house
lights dim and the hubbub is hushed, waiting for his masterpiece to
once again hold 1,000 breathing witnesses in its thrall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's a presence, all right, this greatest of living
playwrights. Unlike O'Neill, who died when appreciation for his
work was at low ebb, or Tennessee Williams, whose struggle to
retrieve past glories were as sad as his own characters, Miller
weathered shifting winds of fashion. He emerged on the other side
as a dramatist for the ages. The 1990s have seen a fine film of
``The Crucible,'' his 1953 classic about the Salem, Mass., witch
trials; a powerful New York revival of ``A View From the Bridge'';
and successful London productions of newer plays not well-received
in his home country. Miller's ``The Price,'' one of the better
American dramas of the 1960s, is being revived on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 50th anniversary Broadway production of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Salesman'' was doubly joyous (if that term can
apply to a tale so shatteringly sad) because the playwright was
interviewed, honored, so thoroughly there.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hoffman, who played Willy Loman on Broadway in 1984, once
said that Miller ``looks like a California redwood and talks like a
New York taxi driver.'' Miller talked from his Connecticut home
recently, with that image and sound in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the Broadway revival, I heard people sobbing. There's no
question that ``Salesman'' has lost none of its power. But do
people react to it differently today than they did 50 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: I keep hearing how people are surprised at how contemporary
the play is. I'm very pleased about that. Now, the Robert Falls
production stays true to the original period of the '40s, so there
must be something inside these relationships, between the lines,
that speaks to today. Shakespeare, when he's done well, is the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1949, communism was the hot-button topic, so ``Salesman''
was seen as a critique of capitalism gone wrong. Perhaps today
those issues are more in the background, and it's the family
relationships _ father and sons, wife and husband _ that grab
people by the throat?
</P>
<P>
   A: My plays are always involved with society, but I'm writing
about people, too, and it's clear over the years that audiences
understand them and care about them. The political landscape
changes, the issues change, but the people are still there. People
don't really change that much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We see Willy Loman being crushed under a system, or his
delusions about it. And yet I talked to the daughter of a
successful developer who was shattered by the play because, she
said, ``That's my father up there.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I get that all the time _ it's amazing to me. Or maybe I
shouldn't be amazed because as I said, there are qualities and
dreams that all people share. It hardly matters what level of
society you're at to find some part of yourself in the Loman
family.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote once about how your Uncle Manny walked up to you,
during the original run of ``Salesman,'' and picked up exactly
where he left off bragging about his son, years before, just like
Willy does to the neighbor boy, Bernard. Do you think he knew he
was the model for Willy?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughing.) No, not for a minute. But then, Willy came from
so many places, I don't think people in my family recognized him as
my uncle, either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've had an incredible range of great actors play Willy,
haven't you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's not a question of who's better but how each gave
his distinctive stamp. George Scott is so different from Hoffman,
for example. (Brian) Dennehy has a heroic quality that I like,
similar to Lee Cobb. When those guys go down, it's a very big tree.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And for once the praise for the Linda Loman _ Elizabeth Franz
_ is as high as it is for the Willy.
</P>
<P>
   A: Elizabeth attacked the role quite differently _ with a
wonderful outrage _ than other Lindas, some of whom were seen as
timid. I never intended that. Linda is the only thing holding the
family together. She must have great strength.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could see any of your other plays have a first-class
revival in New York, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it was done beautifully in London not long ago, but I'd
have to say, ``After the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think some of the harsh reviews it got when it opened
had to do with the recent death of Marilyn Monroe (Miller's second
wife, 1956-61), so clearly the model for Maggie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think everyone would have a clearer view of what the play's
really about, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote in your 1987 autobiography, ``Timebends,'' that ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' gave playwrights ``the courage to cry at
full throat.'' You began ``Salesman'' soon after. Here we are 17
years after Tennessee Williams' death, and you're still writing.
What's the secret to your stability?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it helps to have a great wife! (Inge Morath, his third,
since 1965). There's a lot of land out here for me to take care of,
so I can't afford to sit around. But you know, I've had dry spells
of three or five years when no good writing would come. Luckily,
I'm not a big drinker. Alcohol has done terrible damage, especially
to some of our greatest writers.

   The Showtime presentation of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman'' is as close as you can get to the real-time thrill of
sitting in a Broadway theater, watching the 1999 production that
plunged into the drama's molten, fiery core.
</P>
<P>
   Know, too, that even the best tape of a live stage performance
may sabotage itself: For instance, when the camera zooms in to
capture ``innermost feelings'' that the actor is trying to project
to the back row. For seamless television, see the 1985 Dustin
Hoffman production that was rethought in a studio for CBS. But for
the unique excitement of being there at the creation, as it were,
see this Showtime thunderbolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salesman'' unfolds in the life and splintered mind of Willy
Loman (Tony winner Brian Dennehy), a pusher of some unnamed gadget
but really a man who sells himself. No one's buying anymore. At 63,
his brag and bluster and gags worn thin, he's a used-up cog.
Crumbling around him is the Brooklyn household ``where we never
told the truth for 10 minutes,'' in the words of grown, raging son
Biff (Ron Eldard, replacing Broadway's superbly seething Kevin
Anderson). Biff is waking up, too, from useless training as a
braggart jock.
</P>
<P>
   We're riveted by Willy's preordained doom, if for no other
reason than to discover the terrible secret that came between
father and son years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamlike sweep of director Robert Falls' turntable staging
_ dizzily gliding us in and out of the past, in and out of Willy's
head _ doesn't always translate through Kirk Browning's TV
production, and we miss the real, rafter-rattling presence of
Dennehy. Thanks to close-ups, though, we follow the story in his
eyes: darting and trembling like a child's, then opaque with
terror. When he shouts, ``The woods are burning, boys!'' you expect
to see the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even stronger than she was onstage, if possible, is Elizabeth
Franz, in her portrayal of Willy's wife, Linda. (She, Falls and the
show also won Tonys.)
</P>
<P>
   For all its fireworks, what sets the Falls production above all
others (even the 1949 Lee J. Cobb/Mildred Dunnock original, judging
from a videotape) is the humor and immense thwarted tenderness
beneath the despair. The protective tenderness of Linda for Willy,
Willy for Biff _ indeed everyone in the family, including clueless
son Happy (Ted Koch), for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's genius is elevating these characters to American
archetypes while keeping them so plainly, movingly human.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is also splendid. It may be no coincidence
that Richard Thompson as Bernard, the nerdy neighbor boy, looks
startlingly like the young Miller. In the real-life story behind
``Salesman,'' Miller was indeed the gawky visitor who studied hard,
mocked by his Uncle Manny and his two like-minded sons for lacking
the muscle and charm to capture the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   When the astonished Willy meets the grown Bernard, now handsome
and successful, those false tickets to the dream turn to ashes in
his hands.

 &HT;    Auburn getting its act together
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Ah, how expectations have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, which opens its Southeastern Conference season against
Georgia at 1 p.m. today, comes in with a 12-1 record and No. 4
national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the most commonly heard question on the Plains is, ``What's
wrong with the Tigers?''
</P>
<P>
   After Auburn's amazing run last season, nothing but winning _
and winning big _ is going to do this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers lost one starter from last year's 29-4 team that lost
in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Final Four
participant Ohio State. And while Auburn has been winning this
season, it hasn't done so in the dominating fashion of a season
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's average margin of victory during the early, mostly
nonconference slate last year was nearly 30 points a game, with its
closest game being a 12-point victory over Florida. This season,
the Tigers already have struggled in four games, losing to Stanford
67-58 in the John Wooden Classic and squeaking by Florida State
(55-54), Penn (77-70), Southern Miss (56-50) and Virginia Tech
(73-63).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' coach Cliff Ellis said, referring to
the Tigers' victory margin. ``I guess everybody has different
opinions about it; I can't get caught up in all that. I don't even
know how many points we're averaging. I don't know how much we
averaged last year. That's for (the media) to keep up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have been indicating, however, that they are about to
get it going again. Several factors contributed to their
less-than-stellar performance in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   First has been the play of senior forward Chris Porter. A
preseason national player-of-the-year selection, Porter spent the
early part of the season trying to develop his outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   Many predicted the 6-7 forward would make the jump to the NBA
after last year's All-America season. But the knock on him was his
lack of range. Porter evidently set out to prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Porter came out of the gate shooting 3-pointers, and he wasn't
making many of them. He came out of December with a .153 3-point
percentage (2 of 13). Included during that early stretch were some
un-Porter-like line scores: four points and four rebounds against
Penn, nine points and five rebounds against FSU and nine points and
seven rebounds against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early going, Chris probably stepped out there too
much,'' Ellis said. ``His game is from 12 to 15 feet, and he's done
better since he's come back in there. I'm sure he'd like to be a
great outside shooter, and it might make him a lottery pick. But
having him 18 to 25 feet from the basic is not the answer for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since persuading Porter to come back into the lane, Porter's
average has risen from 12.2 to 13.5 and he's been the Tigers' top
scorer the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's perimeter experimentation briefly caused tension within
the team. Sophomore David Hamilton, who backs up Porter at power
forward, said after the Penn game, ``We don't need any more
7-for-20 shooting performances. Our inside guys need to play
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's return to the court has proved to be a settling
force. The 6-9 sophomore missed the first five games because of
academic suspension. Since returning, the Tigers are undefeated,
raised their shooting percentage from .369 to .470 and are
averaging 80.4 points per game, as opposed to 68.6. Most notably,
Porter's minutes dropped from 32 to 25 a game. Hamilton has
averaged 7.1 points and 4.6 rebounds during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn also has played a more challenging schedule this year,
although it lags well behind the ones played by Kentucky or even
Georgia. And opponents are much more focused on beating the Tigers,
given their lofty ranking and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in as good of shape as we could be right now,''
said guard Scott Pohlman, a junior from Roswell. ``Teams are coming
in a lot more focused on us. We're not coming out and surprising
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia would be challenged enough against Auburn without its
depth problems. The Bulldogs found out Thursday they will be
without freshman guard Ezra Willliams, who was ruled ineligible.
Reserve forward Badi Oliver remains sidelined with a stress
fracture in his left foot, and junior center Robb Dryden, while
available, is limited by his injured left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tigers will counter with a balanced group. No
Auburn player averages more than 28 minutes, 10 players average at
least 5.2 points a game, and its top five scorers are separated by
four points, with Porter high at 13.0 and Pohlman low at 9.0
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the best teams in our league,'' Georgia coach
Jim Harrick said. ``I'm interested in playing them and seeing how
we play. They've had back-to-back great years, and it could mean a
lot to our team to know we can play with them.''

 &HT;    `Caveman' a funny look at differences in genders
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You should see ``Defending the Caveman'' with someone you love.
After you get home, you can lock yourself in the bathroom to escape
that very person and get a little peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Becker's ``Caveman'' was the longest-running solo show in
Broadway history (more than 700 performances) when it closed in
1998 and went on the road. Becker's genial comparison of the
genders, besides being very, very funny, is so acutely observed
that he has performed for national conventions of marriage and
family therapists. He's a lot easier to take than ``Men Are From
Mars, Women Are From Venus'' and all the rest of those
war-between-the-sexes self-help tomes.
</P>
<P>
   Becker's thesis is that our dominant traits go back to
prehistoric times: Men are hunters, women are gatherers. ``We have
different customs,'' he explains, and goes through a long list of
behaviors to prove it. For instance: Man, the hunter, focuses on
one object, to the exclusion of all else, until he hunts it down
and kills it. Woman, by contrast, accumulates information, enjoying
multiple sensations, colors, tastes, smells, as she gathers up
diverse materials and puts them in her basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words: shopping!'' Becker says, beaming. Man, by
contrast, shops by zeroing in on the one thing he needs (in this
case, a shirt), symbolically kills it and takes it home in a bag,
relieved to get the whole shopping thing out of the way until the
next time he needs a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with conversation. Women gather information and
dispense it with equal delight; men keep their interchanges simple
and direct. Where a woman might greet a friend she hasn't seen for
a long time by hugging her and telling her how good she looks and
describe from top to toe what things are the same and what are
different about her and wonder why it's been so long since they've
gotten together, a man will accomplish the same thing by eyeing his
buddy's car and saying: ``Still driving that piece of junk?''
</P>
<P>
   Since going on the road, Becker has gussied up the show with a
video prologue: unnecessary but inoffensive. He's also performed it
enough that his diction has gotten sludgy and his timing
perfunctory. Some of the lines are frankly unintelligible. Of
course, the venue is no help. This small-scale show was not
designed for the cavernous Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But his large, galumphing persona is still endearing and his
insights right on the money. Across the aisle from me were a
typical couple. The man guffawed and slapped his knees when Becker
described men and hugged his significant other at the descriptions
of women. So did she, except vice versa. That's how ``Defending the
Caveman'' strikes all us Fred and Wilma Flintstones.

 &HT;    A savvy corporate partnership has the North Carolina city
banking on cultural investment to bring even more vitality to an
urban core on the mend
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 9.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte _ Less than 10 years ago, North Tryon Street, a
stretch of the main downtown artery in North Carolina's largest
city, was a drag. Vacant buildings and parking lots testified to
the sorry state of America's center cities. It was, recalls
Asheville gallery owner John Cram, ``the perfect example of
sterility.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, North Tryon is home to monumental new office towers.
Fancy lobbies and chic restaurants beckon from wide promenades.
There's little retail yet, but with almost 8,000 people living in
the vicinity, the stage is set.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the nationwide resurgence of downtowns? Yes, but
with a twist. Through the leadership of Charlotte's corporate
community, art is blooming on this 11-block stretch, right along
with commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of eight months, two new major arts institutions
have taken root ``Uptown'' (as Charlotte calls it) and preserved
some of the city's architectural history in the process.
</P>
<P>
   An old department store now houses the Mint Museum of Craft +
Design, one of a select few institutions in the country devoted to
those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks down the street is the Tryon Center for Visual Art,
a fire-damaged Gothic Revival stone church transformed into an
artists' community. It provides studios for visiting and local
artists as well as a public gallery.
</P>
<P>
   While these unusual facilities give Charlotte a higher profile
on the national scene, their contribution to their neighborhood is,
in a way, more far-reaching. The pair adds critical mass to
Charlotte's designated arts and culture district. It draws
visitors, making the area more attractive to commercial and
residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more arts development as well: The Mint Museum
proper, now located in a residential suburb, and the Light Factory,
a nonprofit exhibition space for photography, film and video, are
considering moving intown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so turned around, it's flabbergasting,'' says Cram, who
owns three galleries in Asheville. ``And it's thanks to Hugh McColl
(chief executive officer of Bank of America). He single-handedly
had a vision and backed it up with the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl has been involved in Charlotte's urban planning team
efforts since the '60s. His personal interest in art, his
understanding of the role art can play in community development and
his company's stake in the health of its home base has shaped
Charlotte's city center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the company headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli with
a monumental lobby fresco by local arist Ben Long, opened at North
Tryon and Trade streets. When, in 1998, the bank built a parking
deck a few blocks away, it made it a destination by putting retail
on the ground floor and turning the building into an interactive
sound and light artwork.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McColl offered the old Montaldo's department store,
which his bank owned, to the Mint Museum to persuade them to come
downtown. The bank funded the renovation of the store to house the
Mint Museum of Craft + Design, the Bank of America gallery and
space for expansion, which is now leased. McColl and a business
associate raised $11 million to endow both downtown institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his efforts, the American Craft Council gave
McColl its Aileen Osborn Webb Award in November. (Webb founded and
underwrote the council.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood out in the field for doing something for crafts,''
says ACC director Jeffrey Larris.
</P>
<P>
   It was McColl's idea to turn the 1.1-acre Associate Reformed
Presbyterian Church property, which the bank had purchased in 1995,
into an artists' colony. The bank underwrote the $7 million
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists' colony will be a unique addition to our growing
arts community,'' McColl said when the Tryon Center plan was
announced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte will position itself as a leader of arts in the
Southeast. It will raise the quality of art we have access to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America employees are actively involved in the workings
of these and other arts institutions. Jim Palermo, executive vice
president, management services, chairs the Arts and Science
Council, which funnels city, county and corporate money to
Charlotte's nonprofit institutions. Senior vice president Barbara
Spradling is Tryon Center's board chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the arts organizations and the bank are pretty tight.
Some find the relationship a little close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about centralized power and decision-making,'' says
Paul Sires, an artist who opened a pioneer gallery on North
Davidson Street, what he calls the ``unfunded'' part of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would a board member stand up to his corporation if there was
a disagreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Gallery owner Dot Hodges raises the issue of corporate
propriety, which tends to smooth the healthily rough edges of art
into a safe blandness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that, in trying to please everyone, you don't
necessarily get the strongest art,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if corporate patrons exert no pressure, there is the
potential for self-censorship to avoid offense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the active corporate support has served the arts, and
downtown Charlotte, extraordinarily well. When it comes to
assessing the impact of McColl and the Bank of America, Hodges
says, ``Basically, most people are grateful.''
</P>

 &HT;    'Serving others is essence of King Holiday'
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dante Hudson's life was changed by a service project.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Hudson was a senior at Morehouse College, trying
to decide whether he should go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted to do was work with inner-city
children,'' says Hudson, 23, a resident of Austell.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, Hudson received a pamphlet in the mail, addressed to
someone else, advertising the Martin Luther King Jr. Service
Summit, an annual day of service sponsored by Hands on Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, he attended a program held in conjunction with the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   At the workshop, Hudson recalls a principal in the Atlanta
Public Schools system saying that many of her students were
ill-equipped to enter the work force, that they wouldn't even have
the skills to work at a fast-food restaurant. ``That threw me for a
loop and fueled my passion for service,'' Hudson says.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next day _ the King Holiday _ working on a service
project and found the experience so rewarding that he joined Hands
on Atlanta's Americorps program. He spent the next nine months as a
volunteer at Thomasville Heights Elementary School, working with
tutoring and enrichment programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what I wanted to do,'' Hudson says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he later joined the professional staff of Hands on
Atlanta as a community projects coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's annual MLK Service Summit _ it's called
``Remember! Celebrate! Act!'' _ Hudson will coordinate a drive to
collect blankets for homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving others is the essence of the King Holiday,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, the seventh annual summit spans two days, with
a day of lectures and workshops followed by a day of service. The
event is co-sponsored by the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   The workshops, held Jan. 16 from 1 to 8:30 p.m. at the Georgia
State University Student Center (Gilmer Street and Piedmont
Avenue), will explore King's teachings of nonviolent social change
and how they can enable citizens to strengthen their communities.
Topics include reflections on King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech from
firsthand observers, women in the civil rights movement, and
volunteerism as a bridge toward diversity. Coretta Scott King is
expected to give a brief address at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 17 day of service will include about 30 projects across
metro Atlanta, such as feeding the homeless, tutoring kids, working
with refugee children, renovating homes and maintaining the grounds
at the MLK Jr. National Historic Site. About 1,000 volunteers are
expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, Regina Dobson of Stone Mountain will
coordinate a project painting and repairing houses of senior
citizens in Atlanta's Dixie Homes community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. King stood for bringing people of all races and
backgrounds together for the common good, and on this project
people of all backgrounds will work together shoulder to
shoulder,'' says Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   She adds that the project is in answer to a question once asked
by King _ ``a persistent and urgent question,'' King said. ``What
are you doing for others?''
</P>
<P>
   KING SERVICE SUMMIT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cost: Admission to the King Service Summit is $15 plus a
canned good. The cash helps defray costs of presenting the summit,
while the canned goods benefit the Atlanta Community Food Bank's
efforts to feed the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Registration: Begins Jan. 16 at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Volunteers revive the ancient ritual of foot washing at a
shelter for the homeless _ providing both spiritual and practical

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a typically chaotic Wednesday evening at Central
Presbyterian Church's downtown night shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The pungent odor of VapoRub and Clorox hangs in the air as
volunteers fill basins with warm water, detergent and disinfectant.
They lay out white towels and washcloths, toenail clippers and
rubber latex gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to wash the feet of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Eight pairs of folding chairs are crammed into a makeshift
clinic _ a series of several rooms, the biggest 7-by-20 feet _
between the church's fourth floor elevator and a gymnasium where
the homeless men sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Howard is one of the first to find a seat. He's
welcomed by volunteer Ike Lee and asked to soak his feet in one of
the basins of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feels real nice,'' says Howard, 30ish, wearing gray
pants, a purple sweatshirt, black ski cap and beat-up tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He relaxes as the evening ritual begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, volunteer Eckhart Richter greets James Franklin, washes
and drys his feet and starts a careful inspection, looking for the
types of problems afflicting someone who spends all day on his
feet: Blisters and bunions. Corns and calluses. Warts and fungus.
Athlete's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Richter trims Franklin's nails, sands away calluses with a Dr.
Scholl's grater, applies fungicide between his toes and massages in
some VapoRub. Then he offers Franklin a new pair of white cotton
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Some men have holes in their socks and blood on their feet.
Franklin has an ingrown toenail that Richter says will require
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The process is repeated throughout the night _ and every
Wednesday between November and March, the five months Central Night
Shelter operates.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, founded in 1980, is like no other, a shelter too
big for one church to handle. Part of an all-volunteer ecumenical
project that enlists volunteers from 35 churches plus civic and
business organizations, it is housed at Central Presbyterian and
the Catholic Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.
</P>
<P>
   These two churches, both downtown near the state Capitol,
predate the Civil War and were built side by side, their back doors
facing each other.
</P>
<P>
   The foot washing program was begun in the mid-1980s by a family
practitioner, Dr. Robin Line, who was inspired by the biblical
Gospel of John, which describes Jesus washing the feet of his
disciples before the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerful example of Christ saying this is what a life
of love is about _ about serving and caring for one another, not
being more powerful or important than someone else,'' says Mark
Bashor, who has served as a shelter volunteer for nearly two
decades and since 1988 as its director.
</P>
<P>
   He characterizes the shelter as a ministry of hospitality for
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the foot clinic,'' he says, ``by adding the dimension of
healing, makes it complete.''
</P>
<P>
   For the homeless, especially, bad feet can be bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the feet hurt, the whole body hurts,'' says Martha
Crenshaw, a family physician. ``And if the feet don't work right,
then the person can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, 47, runs a medical clinic affiliated with the foot
program, which, conveniently, is coordinated by her husband, Ike
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who live in Stone Mountain, have volunteered at
Central Presbyterian since 1988 and headed their respective clinics
since 1991. ``It's our Wednesday night date,'' Crenshaw says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washing feet is not going to solve a lot of problems in the
men's lives,'' says Lee, also 47. ``But if their feet feel a little
better, it helps the rest of them feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Harris agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great service; it shows me love and caring,'' says
Harris, a native of Buffalo, N.Y., who has been living at the
shelter for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would say, `I'm not going to touch a homeless
person's feet.' People don't understand that the homeless walk and
walk and walk all day, and our feet hurt,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Crenshaw's 7-year-old son, Hal, who visited the clinic
for the first time late last year, quickly reached his own
conclusion about the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are just like the rest of us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perspective that many volunteers like Richter, who's been
working at the clinic since 1995, come to share through their
labors.
</P>
<P>
   A retired professor of music, Richter, 72, takes his foot care
seriously. He's a student of reflexology, a type of massage therapy
that focuses on the feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is that the foot holds 7,000 reflex areas and that
the whole body can be treated by applying pressure to these reflex
points,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Richter treats Franklin with gentle pampering, rolling his
knuckles over the homeless man's feet, then quickly vibrating his
fingers across his soles.
</P>
<P>
   A contented Franklin, dressed in a gray sweat shirt and baggy
bluejeans, watches for a while, eventually finding the treatment so
soothing that he falls asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the harshness that the homeless must experience all
day long,'' says Richter. ``Here is a moment where by giving a
touch of kindness and comfort you are showing basic humanity. You
affirm that person's dignity as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   There are additional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to get to know a guy when his feet are in your
lap,'' says Neil Satterfield of Duluth, a seven-year veteran of the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Satterfield, 67, remembers chatting with one man who began
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so grateful to have someone to talk to,'' Satterfield
recalls the man saying.
</P>
<P>
   Such healing, Lee has learned, flows both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the clinic director found himself washing the
feet of the same man for several months.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Lee was having difficulty coping with the failing
health of his father, and he learned that the homeless man had
recently lost his own father.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sharing what he went through, it helped me come to grips
with my situation,'' says Lee.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the clinic helps the homeless forget for a few
moments the pain and challenges they face each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a luxury,'' volunteer Ann Hunter says. ``And these men
don't have many luxuries in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a luxury they don't take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men seem grateful and amazed,'' Lee says. ``They can't
believe someone would do this for them.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALABINO, Russia _ The prince was at the kitchen table, teaching
his daughter Katya, 13, how to roll out dough for a Christmas pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it round,'' Prince Yevgeny Meshchersky barked as he
swiveled over to the wood-burning stove to check potatoes on boil.
``Press hard, harder.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Lyudmila, away at work on Russia's Christmas
holiday, Meshchersky, 49, was in charge of preparing the
traditional meal at his ancestral home _ a badly battered
18th-century gatehouse that stands by the ruins of a palace, on the
edge of an overgrown park. All are part of a 64-acre estate where,
for three years now, he has been squatting in a campaign to reclaim
it as his own.
</P>
<P>
   The inside of his house looks much like the outside, battered by
a century that has been exceptionally cruel to the Meshcherskys,
like so many other aristocratic families that remained in Russia
after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The floorboards tilt
dangerously; the ceiling is full of holes. The windows are covered
in plastic to keep in warmth provided by the stove and a fireplace
that the prince himself pried loose from a wall of Soviet-era
bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, on the Christmas holiday celebrated by the Russian
Orthodox Church according to the Julian calendar, the family was
getting ready to receive guests with family names and titles like
theirs, which go far back in Russian history but which, until
recently, were hushed up and played down in a proletarian state.
</P>
<P>
   For the occasion, the shabby kitchen-living room had acquired a
faint holiday glow: a scrawny tree propped on the grand piano,
cheap gold-colored garlands hanging from the gaps in the ceiling,
and a cardboard Father Frost, made by one of Meshchersky's four
children, propped up against a windowpane.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the stuff of a 19th-century Russian novel. But in some
ways, the story of Meshchersky and his Sisyphus-like attempt to
reclaim his heritage is a tale that fits this turn-of-the-century
Russia, where many people are wondering now _ as others did 100
years ago _ which way the country is heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to make the Russian state live according to the
law,'' said Meshchersky, an unassuming man with wire-rim glasses
and a graying goatee. ``Maybe it is a small step, but I want it to
be a precedent, because once Russia, as a state, starts abiding by
its laws, then it will no longer be a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky, an engineer, returned to Russia from Ukraine in
1996, looking to settle on his family's former estate in this
village, 35 miles south of Moscow. The family palace, built in
1775, had been blown up by the Communists to provide rubble for a
nearby road and was a hollow shell, a gigantic folly of broken
columns and crumbling bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the revolution, the Meshchersky palace was looted of
a priceless art collection, which included paintings by Botticelli
and Velazquez. In the 1930s, it was turned into a holding camp for
political prisoners arrested by Stalin's secret police. After World
War II, the estate was abandoned. The ruins were declared a
national monument in 1964, but nothing was done to stop the
continuing decay or looting of the buildings that remained.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the returning prince, emboldened by Russia's democratic
changes and by a new constitution that for the first time
guaranteed the right to own and inherit property. Although his
wife, according to several reports, was less than enthusiastic, he
moved his family into one of four gatehouses that stand at the
corners of the ruined palace, with no water, no plumbing, no
electricity and no heat.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has hooked up the electricity and installed a
plumbing system. For water, he still goes to a nearby spring, and
heat still comes from firewood culled from the forest at the back
of the house. But Meshchersky has a dream, for which he is willing,
as some Russian commentators have noted, to make his family live
like refugees.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the authorities have made no effort to evict the
Meshcherskys. But they have also done nothing to give the prince
the estate or a mansion in St. Petersburg that he also claims.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, unlike post-communist countries in Central Europe, has
no law providing for the restitution of property seized by the
state, but that has not deterred Meshchersky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a law on restitution,'' he said. ``I have Article
35 of the Russian Constitution, which guarantees my right to own
and inherit property.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russian courts have turned a deaf ear to Meshchersky's
quest, and he is now pursuing his case in the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. At stake, he says, are two
principles: property and law. ``Why should I give up the property
of my ancestors?'' he asked. ``Why should I give everything up to
bandits and thieves, which is what Russia's new rich are, people
who stole everything they have? This was my family's property; we
didn't steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meshchersky family's return to Alabino _ now formally
controlled by the state Committee of Culture _ has been tolerated
by the Russian government and local authorities. Meshchersky said
the administration of former President Boris Yeltsin had given de
facto recognition of his right to ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But without judicial recognition, the Meshcherskys are not
owners but squatters. And although his neighbors say they have good
relations with the prince, Meshchersky says he feels hostility from
local Communist officials and from neighbors who resent him for
stopping a thriving business: the looting of materials from the
ruins on the estate.
</P>
<P>
   His story has been told in the Russian news media, and was
recently made into a documentary film, ``Prince,'' by the noted
filmmaker Marina Goldovskaya. But so far, the publicity has not
given him the legal recognition he seeks nor the money he needs to
turn his estate into what he calls a historical preserve, where
tourists would be able to see for themselves the ravages that
communism brought upon Russia.

FOLLOWING NBC'S LEAD, ABC OUTLINES MINORITY HIRING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after NBC announced an agreement with the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People intended
to increase minority hiring, ABC Friday announced its own
``statement of understanding'' with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But while NAACP president Kweisi Mfume appeared to be making
progress with the networks, he was also moving to assuage a
coalition of minorities that said he was not fulfilling his promise
to represent their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume and ABC president Pat Fili-Krushel released a statement
that outlined steps similar to those NBC announced Wednesday. NBC
said it would provide internships and scholarship programs and
promised to increase its purchases from minority-owned suppliers
and to pay for a minority writer to be added to the staff of every
new network show that went into a second year of production.
</P>
<P>
   ABC said it intended ``to increase opportunities for qualified
people of color in the network television industry'' both in front
of and behind the camera, and underscored its existing diversity
plans, including mentoring programs and programs to encourage
minority writers. Each division of the network will be required to
interview minority candidates for open jobs and to offer at least
one for-credit minority internship per year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all ABC employees will be required to take part in
a diversity training program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fili-Krushel said at a news conference Friday that the
statement represented ``ABC's diversity objectives and the NAACP's
endorsement of those objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   An ABC executive said Ms. Fili-Krushel was careful not to imply
that the other members of the coalition had endorsed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of those other groups criticized Mfume on Friday,
saying he had neglected their specific concerns in negotiating the
agreement with NBC. Esteban Torres, the spokesman for the National
Hispanic Media Coalition and a former Democratic congressman from
California, said that agreement did not address issues specific to
Hispanics. Torres said he had not yet seen the ABC statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the points didn't exactly speak to the West Coast
initiative that we and Japanese-American groups had been seeking,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres pointed out that the agreement with NBC did not provide
for the appointment of a vice president for diversity who would
report directly to Bob Wright, the network's president, although
``that was one of our specific demands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbeknownst to us,'' Torres said, `` Mfume went to a press
conference with NBC to address the issues, and we were not invited.
We thought we were working as a coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Skyhawk, the president of American Indians in Film and
Television, and Norman Mineta, the director of the Asian Pacific
American Coalition, also criticized Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume tried to soothe feelings Friday evening by speaking with
the members of the coalition in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements are first steps in a very long and sometimes
difficult process to create real and meaningful opportunities for
men and women of color in network television,'' he said. ``But they
should only be seen as first steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said the leaders of the coalition had set up guidelines to
prevent future misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that each quarter of the coalition is
working toward the same goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Wright of NBC will fly to California to meet with
the coalition's leaders. At that time, Mfume said, the coalition
will make a joint statement ``to underscore our solidarity and our
commitment to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreements come six months after Mfume criticized the
networks, calling their programming ``a virtual whitewash.''

 &HT;    Dysfunctional family at home in `Malcolm'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's something you haven't seen lately: a Fox comedy good
enough not to be animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle'' is a sweetly outrageous sitcom that
plays like a live-action mutation of ``The Simpsons,'' which it
follows at 8:30 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowed (loosely, we hope) from the childhood of creator
Linwood Boomer, it centers on a middle-class family with four boys,
including third son Malcolm (Frankie Muniz), a boy genius who just
wants to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's wide, young-man's head, balancing like a candy apple
atop his narrow, 11-year-old shoulders, suggests a wry wisdom
beyond his years. It's through his eyes and raspy asides (which
sound a lot like young Kevin's in ``The Wonder Years'') that we
observe the rest of this perfectly functioning dysfunctional
family.
</P>
<P>
   There's oldest brother Francis (Christopher Kennedy), who's teen
antics have landed him in military school; next oldest brother
Reese (Justin Berfield), who loves to pick on the picked-upon; and
youngest brother Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), a sour-smelling
first-grader who sometimes finds himself tied up by his brothers
and hung from a bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   The brood is shepherded as best it can be by a pair of
pre-self-esteem parents: bawdy, no-nonsense Lois (Jane Kaczmarek)
and yeah-whatever Hal (Bryan Cranston), whose self-involved
befuddlement is an echo of the late Phil Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Each family member seems so wrong for the other that it all adds
up to ... family. On the surface, life unfolds like outtakes of
what couldn't be shown on ``Leave It to Beaver.'' It's a dead-on
caricature of the chaos that lurks inside every full house: No room
is ever picked up, the front lawn is never tended. And there is
never time to take anything too personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make me so mad sometimes I just want to break your neck!''
Lois shouts over the phone to Francis, who's up to no good at
school, a thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Two beats later, Lois adds before hanging up, ``Did you get the
cookies I sent you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Francis says, warming at the memory. ``They were
great.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how unbundled family life gets, it's always saved by
the warmth the show captures of a clan that loves as hard as it
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's pilot might be an unfortunate introduction for some. It
overdoes the Fox tendency to shock viewers to attention: It opens
with Lois in the kitchen shaving the body of a naked,
newspaper-reading Hal, and later signals its anything's-game
approach with a series of ``cripple'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   It overplays a hand it doesn't have to. But stick with it. By
the next two episodes, without being one inch less outrageous,
``Malcolm in the Middle'' becomes this midseason's one real delight
_ a welcome, even welcoming, winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle''

INSTANT `ALI' ON ABC

By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young Muhammad Ali occasionally threw such lightning-fast
punches that the moves were barely visible in real time, only in
slow-motion replays.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of speed John Sacret Young has been putting on
the post-production of his ABC movie about the heavyweight champ,
``Muhammad Ali: King of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   It airs tonight, less than 24 hours after Young declared it
finished and delivered it to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Why the big rush? Until about two weeks ago, the ABC movie was
coincidentally competing with a similar project, ``Ali: An American
Hero,'' on Fox. The Fox film had been planned to air Jan. 15, but
Fox pulled it from the lineup after ABC committed to its air date
with on-air promos.
</P>
<P>
   So there's Young, the project's writer, director and executive
producer, scrambling to get his two-hour movie in the can. He
started filming just before Thanksgiving and wrapped Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the editing room Christmas Day,'' he said. ``(The
following week) I fell asleep while we were looking at a cut, and
they woke me to say, `Guess what? The millennium is here.' I was
not alone; there were a couple of editors and some assistants and
some others who were hanging in for amazing hours. While other
people were on the ski slopes, we were huddled around (editing)
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, one of Hollywood's busiest TV writers and directors and
known for creating the series ``China Beach,'' spent Thursday
through Sunday bunkered in a Burbank sound studio dubbing some
dialogue and putting on other audio finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally won't be able to deliver it to the network until
midnight Sunday night, and that's the last possible time they have
to format it and do whatever they do to get it on the air,'' he
said late last week. ``I don't know if a film has ever gone so
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on ``King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the
Rise of an American Hero,'' the 1998 non-fiction best seller by New
Yorker editor David Remnick. While the book looks at the young
up-and-comer Cassius Clay in the detailed context of the earlier
Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston fights, the TV movie focuses on
Clay himself, with the other players secondary. Terrence Howard of
``The Best Man'' plays Clay, and Steve Harris of ``The Practice''
is Liston. Other figures portrayed in the movie include Malcolm X
(Gary Dourdan), trainer Angelo Dundee (John Ventimiglia) and New
York Times writer Robert Lipsyte (Jason Winer).
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer-winning author Remnick, speaking from his New York
office, said he didn't plan to write a boxing book, despite his
experience as a sportswriter covering that beat for the Washington
Post in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do. I didn't want
to do a full-scale biography of Muhammad Ali,'' Remnick said. ``I
wanted to tell a story that had conflict, race and a sense of time
and American-ness all involved with it, and that's how Muhammad Ali
came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the making of a few things all in one person:
the making of a heavyweight champion, obviously, but also the
making of an American original character, which he created
himself,'' Remnick said. ``In a way, he's always struck me as an
American original, like Mark Twain or Walt Whitman or Babe Ruth or
Lillian Gish. He's just one of those American originals who plucks
things out of the air of the culture and creates an utterly new
being that helps shape and create the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is brought to life with Remnick's vivid accounts of the
landmark fights, as well as stories by Norman Mailer, Gay Talese,
George Plimpton and the cigar-chomping sports columnists and
pugilism pundits of the day: Jimmy Cannon of the New York Post and
Red Smith of the Herald Tribune, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so much a what-happened-when biography as much as an
attempt to answer several whys, concerning Clay's effectiveness in
the ring, his self-promoted rise to celebrity status, the early
days of his affiliation with the Nation of Islam, especially the
way his persona defied the easy classifications of the humble
``Yassuh''-ing of Patterson or the brutish, dark beast stereotype
painted on Liston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, of course, went into the book thinking I knew all there was
to know about Cassius Clay ... and guess what? There was so much
more to know and so much more in his book,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The book goes into his conversion to Islam and his name change
as well as Ali's Vietnam draft evasion that, for a time, cost him
the heavyweight title. But the ABC movie concludes with the 1964
Miami fight in which 22-year-old Clay beat Liston for his first
championship belt. Young said he has written additional scenes that
may be used in a sequel if tonight's ratings are favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he and Howard talked a lot about how the actor should
play Clay, the brash young man who, after his first bout at age 12
in a Louisville gym, proclaimed that he soon would be ``the
greatest of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about mimicry, it's not about impersonation,'' Young
said of Howard's performance. ``He has to try to capture Cassius
Clay's spirit, his energy, his athleticism, his outrageousness. But
that isn't to say he should be mimicking him. That would be a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own research, Young turned to many of the surviving
sportswriters and found them still excited to talk about the era
nearly 40 years later. Dundee came to the set the day they filmed
the Liston-Clay fight, and Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, the boxer's corner
man, served as a consultant and plays a cameo as the boxing
commissioner at the notorious weigh-in for that match.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, now severely weakened by Parkinson's disease, gave
interviews to Remnick and praised the finished book. But Young said
the champ has not officially sanctioned his movie, in large part
because Ali sold his life-story rights to Sony for a feature that
may star Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I think that's good, because I'm always leary of
having to be the `official document,''' Young said. ``There is a
certain leeway you need. If (a subject) likes everything you do
(about him), it may mean that you're not being hard-hitting enough
or investigative enough, or getting under the fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be loyal and faithful to history, and at the same
time this is a dramatization,'' he added. ``In the case of this
guy, writing it was almost turning sideways and letting people
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like, `Let me manipulate this scene.' These
characters are so alive and so jumping that it's almost like
reporting, trying to take it down accurately.'' &QL;

EXPERIENCING ELEANOR ROOSEVELT ON PBS

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt left upon the 20th century an imprint as
indelible as that of her husband's, President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt. How disappointing, then, that she receive such
perfunctory documentary treatment from PBS' ``The American
Experience'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt grew up in a profoundly troubled, unhappy family,
bedeviled by alcoholism and illnesses both physical and mental. She
married a charismatic womanizer who, in the ultimate position of
power, essentially hid a crippling illness from the entire country.
They lived lives that were essentially separate yet intractably
linked, mutually beneficial to one another.
</P>
<P>
   She initiated programs aiding the Depression-hammered poor; her
husband presided over America's involvement in World War II. She
befriended women and significantly younger men in relationships
that raised eyebrows, if not the enmity of her detractors. After
the death of her husband, she helped painstakingly charter the
United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
championed civil rights in the South. Yet her children seemed to be
unhappy underachievers, resentful of their parents' perceived lack
of attention toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Given such a cast of characters and series of events, it's
curious that ``The American Experience: Eleanor Roosevelt'' is such
a bloodless exercise, an ``educational tool'' that tidily,
meticulously separates its subjects' humanity from their history.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor's celebrated, oft-recounted history is delivered by
writer-director Sue Williams at an overly protracted length
spanning more than 2 1/2 hours. But the fascinating glimpses it
does offer into the Roosevelts' lives _ rare home movies, personal
letters and notes from J. Edgar Hoover's FBI files _ are offset by
dispassionate interviews and a reluctance to too deeply explore
their emotional landscapes. The telling detail that would humanize
Eleanor seems just out of reach: We're not shown what prompted
Hoover to disgustedly scribble ``This is nauseating'' on a precis
about her _ was it a questionable dalliance or her righteous
civil-rights views?
</P>
<P>
   For another example, Eleanor, who had already discovered one of
her husband's affairs, left him in Georgia with another secretary
to rehabilitate from the effects of polio. She remained with
friends from the women's division of New York's Democratic Party,
in a home Franklin had had built just for her. This documentary
merely allows, ``It was an unusual arrangement.'' Sure, one that
today would make the Clintons look like mere pikers.
</P>
<P>
   Later she had a close relationship with a lesbian reporter,
Lorena Hickok. The documentary is content to dismiss speculation
over whether the relationship was sexual in nature by having a
granddaughter say, ``My feeling about that is, who cares?'' Well,
for starters, the gay community might enjoy less prejudice and
greater acceptance if it were well known that the most respected
woman of the 20th century had sympathies for, or even numbered
herself among, homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   And when a daughter arranged for a mistress, and not Eleanor, to
be by FDR's side at his death, the motivation for such a betrayal
goes unexplained here. Certainly there's been enough, and
well-deserved, writing about Eleanor Roosevelt. Why not provide a
more well-rounded portrait? Sorting out the human amid the towering
achievements would no doubt make her all the more impressive. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``The American Experience: Eleanor Roosevelt'' &QL; 
What: Documentary on the legendary first lady. &QL; 
Who: Narrated by Alfre Woodard. &QL;

JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF TEXAS PUBLIC SCHOOL TEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a victory for state education leaders, a
federal judge in San Antonio ruled Friday that the test all Texas
public school students must take to graduate ``is not perfect,''
but also does not violate the rights of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward Prado's ruling in favor of the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills acknowledged the high numbers of
minority students who have failed to pass the test. But the judge
said the state had demonstrated the need for such a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Prado has given this state and its children a great
victory today,'' said Texas Education Commissioner Jim Nelson in
Austin. ``This ruling vindicates the Texas testing program, which
is considered to be one of the model testing programs in the
nation.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The case is considered to be the most significant challenge to
high-stakes standardized testing to reach the federal courts in the
past two decades. The outcome was being watched by education
leaders in 20 other states with high school exit exams.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also has particular significance for Gov. George W.
Bush, who has made education reform a cornerstone of his
administration and, in his GOP presidential bid, has promised to
link federal education funding to student testing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I'm very pleased,'' Bush said while campaigning in South
Carolina. ``The federal court made the right decision in confirming
our strong accountability system. I've always advocated that strong
accountability is good for all children, and the court ruled that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The case _ presented in five weeks of testimony last fall _ also
bolsters a Bush initiative to crack down on social promotion,
Nelson said. Last year, the Legislature approved a plan that
requires TAAS scores in lower grades to be a major factor in
determining whether students are promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The political implications of the ruling apparently were not
lost on Prado, who said on the closing day of testimony last fall
that the case is ``probably the most challenging decision I've had
to make'' in 15 years on the bench. Prado, a Republican and a
Hispanic, was appointed to the bench in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the TAAS test was filed in 1997 by the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund on behalf of two
Hispanic rights groups and several minority students who were
denied diplomas after failing repeated attempts to pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF claimed that civil rights and due process rights of
African-American, Hispanic and other minority students were
violated because they fail the test in disproportionately high
numbers. The organization sought to bar the test as a graduation
requirement and to retroactively award diplomas to an estimated
45,000 students denied diplomas only because they failed to pass
the exam.
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF lawyer Al Kauffman said the organization is ``profoundly
disappointed'' with Prado's decision and will consider whether to
appeal to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority students are the ones left holding the bag after this
opinion,'' Kauffman said. ``The judge agreed with the plaintiffs
that the test has a significant adverse impact on minority
students, yet he accepted the state's assurances that the test is
for the good of the educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Prado ruled that the remedial programs offered to
students who fail the exit test and the eight chances they are
given to pass the test during high school were the saving grace for
the testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that one of the goals of the test is to help
identify and eradicate educational disparities,'' Prado wrote in
his 33-page opinion. Getting an education that does not meet some
minimal standards, he added, is ``an adverse impact just as surely
as failure to receive a diploma.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that while there is a significant gap in the
passing rates of minorities and whites, that gap is shrinking, and
``the lot of Texas' minority students, at least as demonstrated by
academic achievement, while far from perfect, is better than that
of minority students in other parts of the country and appears to
be getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, the judge wrote, ``It is not for this court to
determine whether Texas has chosen the best of all possible means
for achieving these goals. The system is not perfect, but the court
cannot say that it is unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston schools Superintendent Rod Paige, who testified during
the trial on behalf of the state, called it ``a great day for young
people in Texas. Our students can pass this examination, they are
passing this examination, and this is something that is going to
stabilize that and move us forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also was praised by Madison High School Principal
Walter Ervin. Last year at Madison, a Houston school that is 68
percent black and 30 percent Hispanic, not one senior was denied a
diploma for failing the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are going to try to prepare our youngsters to be able
to go out and do the things they are supposed to do in society,''
Ervin said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas began administering the TAAS exit exam as a high school
graduation requirement in 1990. Students must score 70 or higher on
each of three sections _ math, reading and writing _ to pass the
exit exam. Beginning in their sophomore years, they are given eight
chances to pass the test. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ In a parade of patriarchs and presidents,
of mitered metropolitans and gray-suited prime ministers, religious
and civil leaders from throughout the Eastern Orthodox world filled
the fourth-century Church of the Nativity Friday for a Christmas
service that may have been the most inclusive Orthodox Christian
gathering of modern times.
</P>
<P>
   The service, in a church built over the cavern where Christian
tradition holds that Jesus was born, was the centerpiece of Eastern
Orthodox celebrations marking the 2,000th anniversary of Jesus'
birth. Orthodox Christians here observe Christmas on Jan. 7,
following the old Julian calendar also used by the churches of
Russia, Georgia and Serbia; most other Orthodox branches now
celebrate on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The service was as striking for its Byzantine glitter as for the
fact that it would have been impossible only 10 years ago. The
guests included political and church leaders from Russia and
Eastern European countries whose former Communist regimes were
ardent foes of religion.
</P>
<P>
   They included Boris Yeltsin, who came as the representative of
Russia despite his abrupt resignation one week ago. After cheerily
blowing kisses to the crowds outside as he entered the church,
Yeltsin left early, looking pale and perspiring. Persevering for
the three-hour service were leaders of Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine,
Georgia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant for the Orthodox faithful was the presence
in one church _ for the first time in centuries _ of the hierarchs
who head 15 major Eastern Christian churches. ``This is a rare,
historic event,'' said Archbishop Christodoulos of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 200 million followers worldwide, the Orthodox
churches have been divided along national, ethnic and sometimes
even liturgical lines. Two of the major powers of the Orthodox
Christian world _ Bartholomew I, the ecumenical patriarch of
Constantinople, and Aleksy II, the patriarch of Russia _ had never
both participated in a formal Orthodox assembly until a closed-door
synod of the 15 churches on Wednesday in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat unlikely host for the historic celebration was
Yasser Arafat, the Muslim head of the Palestinian Authority, which
governs Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, who has assiduously courted European Catholic
leaders, Friday's Orthodox service was yet another Christmas coup.
On Dec. 24, flanked by the prime ministers of Italy and Spain, the
Palestinian leader attended an internationally televised Roman
Catholic midnight mass here, furthering his efforts to present the
Palestinian Authority as a tolerant and responsible caretaker of
the many Christian holy sites in its domain. He is also ever
mindful of the small but affluent Palestinian Christian exile
communities in Europe and the Americas, which are potentially
important sources of investment and international political
support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There has been some Islamic grumbling about Arafat's tactical
embrace of Christianity, a faith practiced by barely 2 percent of
the local Palestinian population. Some of the European leaders at
Friday's service are associated with what Muslims perceive as the
persecution of their co-religionists in Chechnya, Kosovo and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. But any such misgivings were deftly submerged
Thursday, when Arafat treated the visiting clerics and politicians
to the traditional ``iftar'' sundown meal of Ramadan, when
practicing Muslims break the daylight fast maintained during the
holy month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased that Arafat is our host,'' said Milorad
Dodik, the prime minister of the Serbian enclave in Bosnia. ``This
is part of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox conclaves here and in Jerusalem this week were an
equally significant diplomatic achievement for the Greek patriarch
of Jerusalem, Diodoros I, who is accused by local churchgoers of
maintaining a deliberate distance from his Palestinian flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is profound anxiety and unhappiness about the lack of
attention of the patriarchate to their pastoral, religious and
human needs,'' said the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky of the Orthodox
Church in America, an authority on inter-Orthodox matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, by contrast, with its centralized structure and
well-financed religious orders, is viewed by the local Orthodox
laity ``with admiration and frustration,'' he said. ``Rome is
organized, whereas the Orthodox world is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, about half of the Palestinian Christian
community belongs to the Greek Orthodox church, down from perhaps
two-thirds a century ago. Roman Catholics remain the second-largest
local Christian group, now numbering about 30 percent, but have a
much larger relative presence in schools, hospitals and social
welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is still a strong historical attachment among Orthodox
Arabs to the patriarchate of Jerusalem, which has been a fixture of
the local religious landscape since the very beginning of organized
Christianity. ``It is the remaining presence on the ground of
Byzantium,'' Kishkovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   That ancient connection was proudly reinforced in Friday's
service, as local Greek clerics escorted the visiting patriarchs
past their church's surviving patches of Byzantine mosaics and the
subterranean chamber said to be the cave where Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in history that all the denominations are
together, respecting each others' traditions, and celebrating
Christmas together,'' said Torkom Manoogian, the Armenian Orthodox
Patriarch of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian Christians, few in number but deeply rooted here,
have for theological and ethnic reasons never been part of the
wider Eastern Orthodox community. Yet their participation in
Friday's services _ and their welcoming embrace of the visiting
Orthodox bishops _ was seen as evidence of a new ecumenical spirit.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York
Times who extended the possibilities of the conventional obituary
form, shaking the dust from one of the most neglected areas of
daily journalism, died on Thursday at his family's summer home in
Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 60 and also had a home in Manhattan.
The cause was abdominal cancer, said his wife, Joan.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas began writing obituaries full time in 1995 after serving
as a police reporter, a rewrite man, a society news reporter and a
sports writer. He developed a fresh approach to the genre, looking
for telling details to illuminate lives that might otherwise have
been overlooked or underreported.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas saw himself as the sympathetic stranger at the wake
listening to the friends and survivors of the deceased, alert for
the moment when one of them would tell a memorable tale that could
never have made its way into Who's Who or a resume but that just
happened to define a life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when The New York Times proposed him for a Pulitzer
Prize in the category of spot news, the nomination began: ``Every
week, readers write to The New York Times to say they were moved to
tears or laughter by an obituary of someone they hadn't known until
that morning's paper. Invariably, the obituary is the work of
Robert McG. Thomas Jr., who hadn't known the subject, either, until
the assignment landed on his desk a few hours before deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery of portraits that Thomas compiled covered an
impressive range. Among them were Howard C. Fox, ``the Chicago
clothier and sometime big-band trumpeter who claimed credit for
creating and naming the zoot suit with the reet pleat, the reave
sleeve, the ripe stripe, the stuff cuff and the drape shape that
was the stage rage during the boogie-woogie rhyme time of the early
1940s,'' and Russell Colley, a mechanical engineer who became ``the
Calvin Klein of space'' and was known to a generation of astronauts
as the ``father of the space suit.''
</P>
<P>
   There were Rose Hamburger, a 105-year-old racing handicapper;
Marion Tinsley, a checker champion unbeaten by man or machine, and
a vivacious woman who started out as a showgirl and ended up a
princess (Honeychile Wilder is dead, and if the `21' Club is not in
actual mourning, the venerable former speakeasy on West 52nd Street
was closed for vacation last week when word got around that one of
its most memorable former patrons had died on Aug. 11 at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center'').
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a tall man with wavy hair who spoke in a voice soft with
traces of his native Tennessee, was an extremely gregarious and
social man. Last week he officiated at the annual New Year's Eve
party he first started giving at the family home in Shelbyville 32
years ago. About 5 percent of the town's 12,000 people attended,
and Thomas, wearing a blue silk shirt with embroidered sun and moon
that he bought for the occasion, cheered his guests and the new
century. As in past years, he expressed hopes that the fireworks he
had ordered would not set fire to the Presbyterian church across
the road.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   He was fond of writing about people who became legendary as a
result of a single exploit, like Douglas Corrigan, who took off
from New York in a tiny overloaded plane bound for California (he
said) in 1938 and landed in Dublin some 28 hours later. He became
an instant hero, forever to be known as Wrong Way Corrigan, but in
his obituary, Thomas went beyond recapitulation to suggest that
Corrigan was more cunning than befuddled. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he continued to claim with a more or less straight
face that he had simply made a wrong turn and been led astray by a
faulty compass, the story was far from convincing, especially to
the American aviation authorities who had rejected his repeated
requests to make just such a flight because his modified 1929
Curtiss-Robin monoplane was judged unworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, he wrote of Johnny Sylvester, who died in
1990, 64 years after he came to fame as a bedridden boy who
inspired Babe Ruth. Here is how Thomas began his obituary, which
was included in ``The Last Word: The New York Times Book of
Obituaries and Farewells'' (William Morrow): ``There are those who
will tell you that little Johnny Sylvester was never that sick and
certainly not dying. They will tell you that Babe Ruth never
promised to hit a home run for him in Game 4 of the 1926 World
Series, and that the three home runs that the Babe did hit in that
game in no way saved the 11-year-old youngster's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any representations to the contrary, these people will tell
you, were simply embellishments of a trivial incident by an
oversentimental press in a hypersentimental age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such people are known as cynics.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something mythic, too, about Sylvia Weinberger, Thomas
wrote, ``who used a sprinkling of matzoh meal, a pinch of salt and
a dollop of schmaltzmanship to turn chopped liver into a commercial
success.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert McGill Thomas Jr. was born and grew up in Shelbyville,
Tenn., where chopped liver is rare and schmaltz is not part of the
vernacular. He spent his 15th year cheering for a distant relative,
Sen. Estes Kefauver, as Kefauver ran for vice president on the
Democratic ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson. Three years later,
Thomas went to Yale, where he worked on the student newspaper and
flunked out as a result of a decision, he said, ``to major in New
York rather than anything academic.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining The Times as a copyboy in 1959, Thomas spent the
next four decades in a variety of reporting assignments, often
prowling police stations and working the phones in the late hours
to produce fast-breaking stories. With his fondness for anomalies,
Thomas might have described his own journalistic career as more
circuitous than meteoric.
</P>
<P>
   Always regarded as a stylish writer by his colleagues, he
sometimes ran into career turbulence because of an acknowledged
tendency to carry things like sentences, paragraphs, ideas and
enthusiasms further than at least some editors preferred. He went
beyond acknowledging this trait to defending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I go too far,'' he used to say. ``But unless you go
too far, how are you ever going to find out how far you can go?''
</P>
<P>
   All of this may explain the sympathy he showed in his obituaries
of underachievers and late bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly no sense of superiority in his account of
the life choice made by Steven Slepack, a man who gave up a
promising career in marine biology to become Professor Bendeasy,
``the man in the beribboned tuxedo jacket who delighted a
generation of schoolchildren by twisting balloons into animals in
Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a character actor named Jack Weston as ``the
quintessential New Yorker, which is to say he was born in Cleveland
and lived in Los Angeles for 18 years, hating every minute of it he
wasn't actually in front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing about Anton Rosenberg, a painter and jazz musician,
Thomas said he ``embodied the Greenwich Village hipster ideal of
1950s cool to such a laid-back degree and with such determined
detachment that he never amounted to much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For some admirers, for whom Thomas' work came to be known as
``McG's,'' a favorite was his obituary of Edward Lowe, which
revealed how Lowe, a sawdust merchant from Cassopolis, Mich., found
a new use for some kiln-dried granulated clay he had been selling
as a sop for grease spills in industrial plants and created a
million-dollar market for the product he named and marketed as
Kitty Litter.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas provided the antecedent action to the tale in a second
paragraph that established the historical significance of Lowe's
achievement: ``Cats have been domesticated since ancient Egypt, but
until a fateful January day in 1947, those who kept them indoors
full time paid a heavy price. For all their vaunted obsession with
paw-licking cleanliness, cats, whose constitutions were adapted for
arid desert climes, make such an efficient use of water that they
produce a highly concentrated urine that is one of the most noxious
effluences of the animal kingdom. Boxes filled with sand, sawdust
or wood shavings provided a measure of relief from the resulting
stench, but not enough to make cats particularly welcome in
discriminating homes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his admirers was Joseph Epstein, the literary essayist.
``I have noted an interesting general-assignment obituary writer
with the somewhat overloaded name of Robert McG. Thomas Jr., who
occasionally gets beyond the facts and the rigid formula of the
obit to touch on _ of all things to find in The New York Times _ a
deeper truth,'' Epstein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus Thomas on one Fred Rosenstiel, `who spent his life
planting gardens to brighten the lives of his fellow New Yorkers,
and to alleviate an abiding sadness in his heart. ... .' The
sadness, we learn later in the obituary, derived from Rosenstiel's
inability to `forgive himself for surviving the Holocaust.' A fine
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Thomas is survived by their twin sons,
Andrew, of Lewes, Del., and David, of Manhattan; a sister, Carey
Gates Thomas Hines, of Birmingham, Ala.; and two grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Bob Kerrey, an influential Nebraska Democrat
and one of the party's brightest stars, is considering leaving the
Senate to become president of the New School University in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, 56, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1992, decided just over a year ago not
to run for president this fall so he could focus on winning a third
six-year term in November. But the possibility of replacing
Jonathan F. Fanton, who headed the university in Greenwich Village
for 17 years before stepping down last fall, has captured the
senator's fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy doing what I'm doing, but this offer
unexpectedly came my way,'' Kerrey told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A university spokeswoman, Carmen Ashhurst, said: ``We have
several candidates. We have not discussed who the candidates are.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Kerrey would decide before Nebraska's Feb.
18 deadline for incumbents to file for re-election.

FLORIDA PASSES BILL TO SPEED PACE OF EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARA RIMER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida lawmakers made sweeping changes in
the way the death penalty is carried out, approving a bill on
Friday that they say will speed the appeals process so that death
row inmates can be executed more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The law parallels steps Congress took in 1996 to limit the
ability of state inmates to seek review in federal court, and is
patterned after a 1995 Texas law that greatly speeded the pace of
executions in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, who proposed and aggressively pushed for the
Florida bill, as his brother George W. Bush did in Texas as
governor of that state, said revising the appeals process is
intended to shorten the length between sentencing and execution to
five years, from an average of 14 years. His goals would be
achieved by tightening filing deadlines and limiting the number of
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic piece of legislation that will be much
more respectful of family members and victims of these heinous
crimes,'' the Florida governor said after the vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The law, he said, ``brings a semblance of justice to this very
complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the death penalty said the Florida law,
combined with the federal action, would greatly impair the ability
of Florida's 366 death row inmates to assert their constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made one of the most precious rights in our system
habeas corpus, the ability to come back into court and say, `My
constitutional rights have been violated,''' said Elizabeth Semel,
director of the American Bar Association's Death Penalty
Representation Project in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action in Tallahassee, she said, deepens concerns that
when it comes to habeas corpus for the state's death row inmates,
``We have made it so inaccessible that we risk losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said of Florida's death row inmates, ``No one's rights are
being taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents complained that lawmakers were pressured into hastily
overhauling one of the most complicated and important pieces of the
criminal justice system in a two-and-a-half-day special legislative
session. Les Miller, the House Democratic leader, called the change
in the appeals process ``a reckless, rushed and risky piece of
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts around the country predicted that the changes
would be challenged on constitutional grounds, and that they could
ultimately result in more delays and a slower pace of executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system has been tried out in Texas and has been shown to
be a colossal failure,'' said George Kendall, a staff lawyer with
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York. ``in Texas, they haven't
been able to provide adequate legal representation. There isn't
serious review in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Spalding, legislative staff counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union of Florida, said the lawmakers' action Friday
represented a sort of victory for Bush as well as for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get to say they're tough on crime,'' Spalding said,
referring to Bush and the Legislature, ''and capital defense
lawyers have just been given lots of ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an in-your-face challenge to the court,'' Spalding
added, referring to the Florida Supreme Court, which reviews all
capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would pattern the appeals process in Florida after
the one in Texas, where more people have been executed than in any
other state since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to
resume in 1976. As governor, George W. Bush has presided over the
executions of 111 men and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jeb Bush took office last January, one inmate has been
executed. The inmate, Allen Lee Davis, bled profusely when he was
electrocuted in July.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of his corpse posted on the Internet by the Florida
Supreme Court, showing Davis with a contorted face and a
blood-soaked shirt, contributed to a public outcry over Florida's
use of the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' was the latest in a series of botched executions that led
the U.S. Supreme Court to announce that it would review Florida's
use of the electric chair. Advised by legal experts that Florida's
death penalty was in jeopardy, Bush convened the special
legislative session. But he linked it to his plan to restrict
appeals, and that proposal was the dominating theme of the session.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Legislature voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to
make lethal injection the state's primary method of execution.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill imposes what is known as a ``dual track''
system, which requires inmates to file their post-conviction
motions _ or habeas corpus review _ within six months of the day
they file their direct appeal. In many states, these motions are
not filed until the direct appeal is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The post-conviction motion is the only legal means by which
evidence that was not presented at trial can be introduced in a
court. Legal experts who oppose the dual track system say that
having both reviews proceed simultaneously and quickly makes it
less likely that crucial evidence will be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Florida Supreme Court accepts this, this is not a great
day for fairness and justice,'' said Kendall of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund. ``This is going to guarantee the execution of the
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters his proposal was fair. ``I want justice not
to be delayed unnecessarily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth, a Democrat, supported
the proposal. ``Working together we have struck a balance to carry
Florida's criminal justice system boldly into the next century,''
he told reporters after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, 87 people on death row in America have been found to
be wrongly convicted, and released. The average time those inmates
spent on death row was seven-and-a-half years, Ms. Semel said.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case in Florida, Freddie Pitts and Wilbert Lee,
who were sentenced to death for the 1963 murder of two gas station
attendants in Florida's Panhandle, spent 12 years in prison _ more
than nine of them on death row _ before they were released and
given full, unconditional pardons by Gov. Reubin Askew after
another man confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, 55, who is now a contractor living in Miami, took the
floor here on the first day of the session to tell lawmakers he
would have been dead if the shortening of the appeals process had
been in effect years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida just voted themselves out of the twentieth century,''
he said Friday.

JUDGE SAYS TEXAS EXAM DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MINORITY
STUDENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge in San Antonio Friday rejected a
lawsuit that claimed an exam that Texas students must pass to
graduate from high school discriminated against minority students.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a blow to opponents of so-called high-stakes
standardized tests and a victory for Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential front-runner, who has hailed the improved
scores on the test during his tenure as evidence of his commitment
to education.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Judge Edward C. Prado of U.S. District Court
ruled that while minority students had failed the exam at
disproportionately higher rates than whites, the test still met
constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Prado said that the test, the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills, known as TAAS, did not single out minority students, and
that the state administered it fairly, allowing students to take it
eight times, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Prado agreed with the plaintiffs that ``Texas minority students
have been, and to some extent continue to be, the victims of
educational inequality.'' But he said the plaintiffs could not
prove that minority students ``do not have a reasonable opportunity
to learn the material covered on the TAAS.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the plaintiffs did not prove that the negative
aspects of the test outweighed the positive, or suggest a better
alternative. ``The system is not perfect, but the court cannot say
that it is unconstitutional,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called the decision ``a victory for high standards and
strong accountability.'' He also noted that scores by minority
students, while lagging behind, had improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, which argued that test was discriminatory and
placed minority students at a disadvantage because they were more
likely to attend schools with fewer resources and where learning
was more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said that since the tests began, minority dropout
rates had risen to 50 percent from 40 percent. The state has
challenged those figures and noted that the passing rate for
minority students on the exam had improved to 65 percent in 1999
from 40 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was any sort of endorsement of the test or
the way they use the test,'' the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Al
Kauffman, said of the decision. ``He said there were problems with
the test but that they were not so great as to make it
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of standardized graduation exams, often called
high-stakes tests, expressed disappointment with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNeil, a Rice University education professor and a critic
of the test, called the ruling ``a very sad blow for equity and
civil rights in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Neill, executive director of FairTest, a testing reform
advocacy organization in Cambridge, Mass., contended that students
in states that did not use such tests actually performed better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's bad news for advocates against the use of
high-stakes tests for individuals,'' Neill said of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   One of 19 states that requires a graduation test, Texas
initiated the test in 1990. Students begin taking the TAAS test in
the third grade. In the 10th grade, students are offered the ``exit
level'' TAAS test, which is divided into sections on reading, math
and writing. If a student fails the test, he or she may take it
seven more times to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the passing rate for
all grade levels of the test had improved to 78 percent in 1999
from 53 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Susana Navarro, executive director of the El Paso Cooperative
for Academic Excellence, a group that works with many poor,
Hispanic students, said her students had shown great improvement in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about holding everyone in the system accountable for
achievement on the part of all students,'' Ms. Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nelson, Texas' commissioner of education, said in a
statement that the ruling had ``given this state and its children a
great victory today.'' Nelson credited the standards established by
the test for the recent improvements made by students in national
assessment exams.

 &HT;    Georgia governor supports raising driving age to 17
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sixteen-year-olds looking to keep their driving
privileges won't get much comfort from Gov. Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators hoping to boost the driving age in Georgia to 17
may have found an ally.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the number of serious driving accidents involving
teen-agers, Barnes this week said he favors raising Georgia's
minimum driving age by one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic has increased so much and the dangers have increased
so much, there should be, in my view, some increase in the age of
driving,'' Barnes said. ``Seventeen is a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor also says he's ``very open'' to the
possibility of raising the driving age.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to do just that is awaiting Georgia lawmakers.
Lawmakers convene Monday, but Sen. Phil Gingrey (R-Marietta) has
prefiled a bill to raise the driving age to 17. It also would
require parents to sign sworn statements that they've given their
child 50 hours of driving instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is delivering babies,'' said Gingrey, an obstetrician.
``I don't want to see them die so young.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen driving restrictions adopted in Georgia have cut the number
of crashes since 1997, but national and state statistics show that
auto accidents are the leading cause of death among 15- to
20-year-olds and that one in five teen drivers in the metro area
had an accident in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If supporters of a higher driving age prevail, Georgia would
become the only state besides New Jersey to make 17 the minimum
driving age, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety. Teen restrictions approved in 1997 that prohibit late-night
driving, raise penalties for excessive speeding and limit the
number of passengers would kick in at 17 rather than 16, under
Gingrey's proposal. Full driving privileges would still be granted
at 18, and learner's permits would still be available at 15.
</P>
<P>
   But major changes are not a forgone conclusion. Some House
Democratic leaders have resisted efforts to restrict teen driving.
And if Barnes uses his office to push the issue _ something he's
not yet agreed to do _ he could be on an ideological collision
course with some of his staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people look forward to getting their license at 16,''
said House Majority Leader Larry Walker (D-Perry). ``It's been 16 a
long time. There are already restrictions on it. I wouldn't favor
that (age increase).''
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't expected to be a major flashpoint between Barnes
and other legislators this year. Barnes' already-packed agenda
gives little time for him to take on another issue, said Michael
Binford, a Georgia State University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But a popular governor such as Barnes voicing even general
support for a higher driving age is enough to significantly
increase its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would give other legislators a little bit of cover,''
Binford said. ``If he's out front, they wouldn't have to take as
much flak.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia voters may be receptive to the idea. A recent survey by
Democratic pollsters Cooper &AMP; Secrest found that 67 percent of
Georgia voters favor raising the driving age to 17. But those
findings probably underestimate the strength of opposition from
parents and teens who've waited a lifetime for the independence of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents talk about driver safety, but a lot of these parents
will be very grateful that these children get to a point where
(parents) ... don't have to be soccer moms anymore,'' said Rep.
Alan Powell (D-Hartwell).
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the driving age only means that it will be
inexperienced 17-year-olds instead of inexperienced 16-year-olds
behind the wheel, Powell and others say. More driver training is a
better solution, critics argue. Republicans are pushing for
mandatory driver's education in high school.

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS' DEBACLE IS NOT ABOVE SUSPICION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are some in the National Football League who
stare at the Jets' coaching debacle and see nothing but
conspiracies. They are educated people, with advanced degrees, who
do not believe in little green men or the grassy knoll theory. But
when it comes to Bill Parcells, who is about as trusted by the
league office as a shark in a pool of bluefish, or even Bill
Belichick trying to escape his ironclad contract as if he's Harry
Houdini, all logic goes flying out the window.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase one official, something about this Jets situation
stinks like week-old Muenster cheese on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest theory bouncing off the walls and burning up
the telephone lines, according to team and league officials who
have been part of the bouncing process. When Parcells left the New
England Patriots in 1997 to join the Jets as a ``consultant,'' it
was Belichick who was named head coach of the Jets for just short
of a week. Then Parcells and the Patriots, with the help of the
league office, brokered an agreement allowing Parcells to get out
of his contract with New England in exchange for the Jets sending
draft picks to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The belief among some executives is that Parcells is repaying
Belichick for playing the role of puppet three years ago. How? All
along, the conspirators think, Parcells intended to retire, then
change his mind and coach again for one more year. He would then
hire Belichick back as defensive coordinator, but without the
contractual provision that Belichick must replace Parcells as
coach. That way, there would be no hindrances to prevent Belichick
from taking a head coaching position elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two men can help each other. The new owner of the Jets would
talk Parcells back into coaching and give him a large bump in
salary. This is what the conspirator theorists feel Parcells has
wanted out of this situation all along _ more money. Belichick is
helped because he can become free to join the Patriots as general
manager and coach, which is what he really wants.
</P>
<P>
   Before laughing this theory off as Oliver Stone's latest movie _
call it ``Any Given Contract'' _ the point needs to be made that
Parcells has a questionable track record with the league. That is
where the suspicion is rooted.
</P>
<P>
   So when Belichick did an about-face this week and resigned as
head coach of the Jets, this actually should not have come as a
surprise, because when it comes to pulling a fast one, Belichick
learned from the master.
</P>
<P>
   Item: Post-1986 season. Parcells had his agent, Robert Fraley,
contact the Atlanta Falcons about Parcells' becoming director of
operations and head coach, despite the fact that Parcells had one
more year left on his Giants contract. Commissioner Pete Rozelle
ruled that Parcells could take only the director of operations
portion of the job, not the coaching part, because he was already
coach of the Giants. Parcells stayed with New York.
</P>
<P>
   Item: Dec. 29, 1991. Hugh Culverhouse, then the Tampa Bay owner,
accused Parcells of backing out of a contract he had agreed to for
five years worth $6.5 million. ``He said we were all set; we will
execute the contract,'' Culverhouse said at the time. ``It was
executed by Tampa Bay. We now feel like we have been jilted at the
altar.''
</P>
<P>
   Only several days before Culverhouse basically called Parcells a
liar, Frank Litsky of The New York Times asked Parcells if there
was any truth to the Tampa Bay rumors. Said Parcells: ``There's no
truth to anything you've heard. Write it.''
</P>
<P>
   Item: January 1997. In the days before Super Bowl XXXI, there
was a report in The Boston Globe that said Parcells would leave the
Patriots for the Jets. Parcells responded: ``Nothing has changed.
Just because there's another report out doesn't make it
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But something was different. After Parcells' Patriots reached
the title game, Dave Anderson, the Times columnist, quoted a friend
of Parcells' who maintained that Parcells, referring to his
nickname, had said, ``The price of Tuna has just gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Parcells resigned as coach of the
Patriots, despite days of denials that he would do so. Soon after
that, he was general manager and coach of the Jets, but only after
a lengthy and painful process that involved Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue playing the role of Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive some in the NFL if they see a few dark shadows when
it comes to Parcells, and now Belichick. They've been down this
road before.
</P>
<P>
   If the league really wants to know what is going on inside the
head of the two men, it should hire a mind reader.

TEXAS RANGER SAYS DRIFTER HAS ADMITTED TO 10 HOMICIDES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A violent, rail-riding drifter charged with capital murder in a
New Year's Eve knife attack on two girls in Del Rio, Texas, has
admitted to 10 homicides in at least five states, according to a
Texas Ranger involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lynn Sells, 35, has provided Val Verde County sheriff's
officials and Texas Rangers with details of the slayings of men and
women around the country, Texas Ranger John Allen said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just admitted to lots of homicides throughout the country
_ in Arkansas, several homicides in California, Arizona and the one
in Kentucky,'' Allen said, referring to the rape and knife slaying
of a 13-year-old girl last May in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're in the process of trying to get some (of the
slayings) verified right now.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the information Sells has given has proved reliable, the
Ranger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've yet to prove that he's lied to us about anything. It may
take us a while to get police agencies to verify the homicides.
Some of the homicides appear to go back as far as 20 years,'' Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger said Sells, a bearded man with a shock of thick hair,
has shown ``only a tiny bit of remorse. It doesn't seem to bother
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sells can't explain why he kills, the Ranger added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's asked me that several times. He hasn't asked why he
killed, but he's asked me `Where do you think I went wrong?' ''
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sells was arrested in Del Rio on New Year's Day after the murder
of Kaylene Harris, 13, and the attempted murder of her friend,
Krystal Surles, 10, in the Harris family mobile home outside Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   By pretending to be dead, Krystal survived a throat-slashing
that severed her vocal cords. She climbed through a window and
walked a quarter mile to a neighbor's home to seek help. Unable to
talk, Krystal was able to write down a description of her attacker
that a Texas Department of Public Safety sketch artist used to make
a composite drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified Sells using the sketch and a description of a
man seen walking in downtown Del Rio provided by the boyfriend of
Krystal's mother. Sells was arrested at his mobile home in the
Amistad Campgrounds on New Year's Day, and has been charged with
capital murder in Kaylene's death and attempted capital murder in
the attack on Krystal.
</P>
<P>
   He remains in the Val Verde County jail in lieu of $800,000
bond, and has been cooperating with the investigation into the New
Year's Eve attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically a transient,'' the Ranger said of the suspect.
``He came to Del Rio approximately two years ago with a carnival
and ended up marrying a local girl in Del Rio.''
</P>
<P>
   Sells married the woman 14 months ago. She was ``a teeny bit
upset'' when she learned of his activities, Allen said. ``It does
not appear she was aware of his lifestyle, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder suspect has no family in Texas, the Ranger said, and
was working in Del Rio as a used car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born in Oakland, Calif., raised in St. Louis and went
to school through the 8th grade. He left home when he was 13 and
has been on the streets ever since,'' the Ranger said, adding that
he has an extensive criminal record and has done time in prisons in
Wyoming and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said Sells has a history of alcohol abuse, and has spent
much of his life riding freight trains. ``That's how he did most of
his traveling _ that and in stolen cars and hitch-hiking,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sells has provided details of killing people who picked him up
as he hitch-hiked around the country. Other victims were fellow
transients with whom he had argued, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like some of the homicides may be sexually related,
coming after a sexual attack or rape,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the homicides were planned, and others were random,
Allen said. ``He used everything from pistols, strangulation,
knives. He had no particular weapon of choice,'' the Ranger added.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky police officials have been to Del Rio and interviewed
Sells about the May slaying of 13-year-old Haley McHone, whose body
_ with her throat slashed _ was found along the railroad tracks in
Lexington. He faces rape, kidnapping and capital murder charges in
that case, Kentucky officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kentucky police believed that another suspected
multiple murderer, Angel Maturino Resendiz, was involved in
McHone's slaying. The body of a Lexington college student whom
Resendiz is charged with killing was found on the same tracks, only
yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Allen described Sells as soft-spoken and polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``As weird as it may sound, he's polite, he's well-mannered, but
everything we can gather so far is he can become extremely
agitated.''

 &HT;    Marino faces age-old question and every QB's toughest call
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ And so after nearly 17 seasons, it has
come to this: Dan Marino, the most productive passer in NFL
history, being mentioned in the same breath as Johnny Unitas, Joe
Namath, Y.A. Tittle.
</P>
<P>
   Only these days, the 38-year-old Marino is conjuring up images
of a sorry sort: A 40-year-old Unitas getting sacked on his final
play. A battered Broadway Joe hobbling off the field in a Rams
uniform. Tittle, on his knees, blood dripping from his face.
</P>
<P>
   They are Hall of Fame players who stuck around too long. Is
Marino doing the same? He has struggled this season with injuries,
inconsistent performances and clashes with coach Jimmy Johnson. But
will he retire? Can he just walk away? Should he walk away? ``Oh,
it's hard to walk away from it,'' said Phil Simms, who won two
Super Bowls with the New York Giants before retiring against his
wishes after the 1993 season, his 15th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me three years to get it out of my system. I didn't
miss it because of the money. I just missed it because I liked my
lifestyle. I liked the work and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   And he liked to win. Simms left football at age 39 with a couple
of championship rings. He had just finished his best season in five
years, after recovering from shoulder surgery, when the Giants let
him go. ``They made it clear it wasn't about my play,'' Simms says.
``I was getting ready to go in and ask for a pay increase. They
said, 'No, you just had surgery, you're getting old. It's time for
someone new.'''
</P>
<P>
   Simms pondered playing for the Browns before deciding to spend
more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   For Marino, the emotional stakes are higher. He reached the
Super Bowl early in his career, when the Dolphins lost to the 49ers
in 1985. Fourteen years later, he desperately wants to return one
last time, even though a bulging disk and cervical bone spur have
sapped the power from his arm.
</P>
<P>
   His demise has been painful to watch. Dolphins fans can blame
Marino's pursuit of a title on at least one man _ John Elway, who
entered the league with Marino in 1983 and retired last spring
after winning his second straight Super Bowl with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that that is an issue,'' sports
psychologist Jim Loehr said. ``(Marino) saw John, and he wanted to
make a final run and go out just like (Elway) did, and it's
backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterbacks, to be good, have to have an unbelievable level
of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And when their skills diminish, Loehr said, ``it's very
difficult to look at themselves and say it can't be done anymore.
You still have this tremendous feeling of confidence, and it's hard
to switch that off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hebert, another product of the storied quarterback Class
of '83, never achieved greatness in his 11 seasons but led the
Saints and Falcons to playoff appearances. He did recognize the
end, when his passes no longer packed a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm wasn't the same,'' said Hebert, a USFL refugee who
retired after the 1996 season. ``Mentally, I was as sharp as ever,
but it was really frustrating (to realize) you are not able to make
the plays you made when you were younger.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine concussions and a career played mostly on artificial
turf, Hebert hung it up _ and with few regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still thought at the end of my career, `If I could play once
or twice more ... ' Then I remember the last year I played. You
wake up every (Monday) morning and you feel like you've been in a
bad car wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hebert knows it can't be easy for Marino to come to terms
with the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he doesn't move around as well,'' he said. ``But
that's just wear and tear on the joints. He's never been the most
mobile guy, but he's always had that quick release and could avoid
sacks. He's always had that confidence in his arm. Maybe as you get
older you have to face the music that you can't do the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe age doesn't mean a thing when it comes to an athlete's
ability to perform at the top of his game. Elway showed that,
though he did admit upon his retirement that physically he no
longer could perform to his standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a different physiology,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Minkoff, an assistant orthopedist for the Namath-era Jets who now
is team physician for the NHL's Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``30 years is considered old in the professional
athletic world,'' Minkoff said that doesn't mean the 30-year-old
athlete's body automatically starts to break down. Look at George
Blanda, who played 26 seasons before retiring with the Oakland
Raiders in 1976, one month shy of his 49th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Says Minkoff, ``There's nothing that takes the place of good
genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a talented team. In Elway's last two, Super Bowl title
seasons, he wasn't asked to carry the team because Denver had a
strong runner in Terrell Davis and a tough defense. The Dolphins
still are trying to develop a running game and even their reliable
defense has faltered late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Elway ``was a big part of it maybe half the time,'' says Simms,
a CBS analyst. ``He didn't have to go out there every week and
physically carry the team. Dan Marino? Dan is not getting a free
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he will not ride off with a championship, as Elway
did at Pro Player Stadium last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 31 teams, not even 50 percent (of quarterbacks) are
legitimate starters,'' Hebert says. ``There are maybe 12 or 13 guys
who can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Marino among them? ``Marino might be,'' Hebert says. ``If he
is willing to move, he would have the opportunity to play somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be a bad option, Simms says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about playing quarterback is that knowledge is
a great thing,'' Simms said. ``As long as you don't have the
physical liabilities, you can still take that knowledge and be a
very capable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen both sides of Dan Marino this year, the best and
some of the worst. The question I have is, can he go out there
every week and physically have the chance to be at the top of his
game? It doesn't look like he can.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Simms thinks Marino should retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those (who say), `Oh, he should retire. His
skills have faded.' You quit when you want to quit. If your skills
erode and you're the worst damn thing in the world and some (team)
wants you, you play. You dreamed about it your whole life.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9)

<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years in the shadow of the U.S. bull market,
international stock funds have outperformed diversified domestic
funds in back-to-back quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of 1999, the average stock mutual fund
that invests primarily abroad rose 25.97 percent, compared with
18.94 percent for domestic funds. All the major overseas markets
participated in the climb, including European exchanges that were
sluggish earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   (The foreign funds' average would have been even higher if not
for the drag of precious-metals funds, which fell 11.41 percent in
the period.)
</P>
<P>
   But the real action overseas was in emerging markets. General
emerging-markets funds climbed 34.69 percent, on average, in the
quarter; those focusing on Latin America were up 38.38 percent.
And, just as they did in the United States, technology and
telecommunications stocks led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Within the broad trends, of course, was a wide range of
performances among individual markets and funds. And perhaps more
today than usual, money managers and investors are asking
themselves if the recent pattern offers any reliable guide to the
next few quarters. The managers of three top-performing
aggressive-growth funds that invest abroad discussed their
strategies and where they were putting new money.
</P>
<P>
   William R. Andersen, manager of Driehaus International Growth, a
$440 million institutional fund, said a surge in Japanese
technology was one factor in its recent success.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had a return of 66.46 percent in the fourth quarter,
placing it seventh out of 775 international stock funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc. (Although it has a minimum initial purchase of
$100,000, smaller investors can take a position indirectly through
financial advisers.)
</P>
<P>
   The fund has a 30-percent weighting in Japanese stocks. Most are
in technology, but some are in other sectors, like the Goodwill
Group, a temporary-employment pioneer that provides workers for a
variety of industries. ``This whole service sector is so nascent,''
Andersen said. Goodwill's shares gained 48 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, who is 40, also credits a timely move into European
growth stocks for his fund's success. In his view, European
technology and Internet companies, the prime movers, still have
room to climb. ``They have tremendous potential to apply proven
business models that worked in the U.S.,'' he said. Such adaptation
used to take years, he said, but ``now it happens overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited QXL.com, a London-based online auctioneer much like
eBay. Though QXL.com's stock has already more than tripled since he
bought it, he remains bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Among emerging markets, he sees promise in Israel, and has
already won big there with Check Point Software Technologies, an
Internet security services company. Unlike many other Internet
companies, Check Point is profitable, and Andersen expects earnings
per share to rise by one-third in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He is now looking at Eastern Europe. Though he has not yet
committed any capital to the region, he said, ``this area could be
the real sleeper success story of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology figured even more prominently in the 64.14 percent
fourth-quarter return of Merrill Lynch Global Small Cap, an $85
million fund managed by Ken Chiang. It returned 104.84 percent for
the 12 months and 16.75 percent, annualized, over the last five
years
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance came as sweet relief. When he was brought
in to refocus the fund in April 1998, ``the portfolio consisted of
a hodgepodge of stocks with no unifying strategy,'' said Chiang,
38. Now, almost 60 percent of the fund's assets are in technology
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Chiang looks for companies in high-growth industries that have
strong incentives _ usually stock options _ to motivate managers.
He prefers companies whose ``franchise value'' or strong brand
identity deters would-be competitors. The fund invests globally,
weighted 31 percent in Europe, 25 percent in Asia and 38 percent in
the United States and Canada, with the remaining 6 percent in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for European Internet stocks, Chiang said, was
a November conference in London sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ``The
effect of all the positive buzz was immediate,'' he said, for
stocks like Tiscali SpA, an Italian Internet service provider,
whose management has shown that it is willing to spend heavily _
and initially, lose _ to build market share.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, common in the United States, is rare overseas.
``European firms stress profitability because they need it to
secure venture capital financing,'' Chiang said. Tiscali, he added,
``is among the few companies that understands content and the need
for market penetration.'' The shares rocketed more than 400 percent
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy advertising spending by Internet companies made the
quarter a strong one for European ad agencies and media companies
that reach young adults. Chiang rode that trend by holding winners
like Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, Havas Advertising and M6 Metropole, a
French television broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Chiang predicts that technology and telecommunications stocks
will rise further, because investor concerns over high valuations
will be more than countered by immense amounts of cash waiting to
pour in to the sector after any selloff.
</P>
<P>
   But he will not be part of any selloff. ``The appetite for these
companies is tremendous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Viegas, co-manager of the Lexington Worldwide Emerging
Markets fund, was only half-joking when he said, ``I figure I have
two years of job protection.'' Quick adoption of advanced
technology and a more hospitable investing climate in these markets
may soon entice many Americans to invest directly rather than
through a fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Successful bets, meanwhile, on hot markets like Turkey, South
Korea and India contributed to the fund's return of 78.49 percent
for the quarter, the best among 70 emerging-markets funds and
third-highest among all international stock funds tracked by
Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the quarter, the fund had about half its assets in
Asia, one-third in the Middle East and Africa and one-tenth in
Latin America. Technology and telecommunications issues account for
60 percent of assets; consumer services, financial services and
basic industries make up the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's managers say they keep a closer watch on politics
than on economic trends. ``In emerging markets, politics is the
better leading indicator,'' Viegas said. ``Politics determine the
direction of the market.'' The fund got into Turkey with 15 percent
of its assets in the second half of 1999 after elections there
broke a stalemate and produced a governing majority.
</P>
<P>
   One of his strongest performers in Turkey was Netas
Telecommunications, an equipment maker. The company is controlled
by Nortel Networks of Canada; the Turkish military is a part-owner.
Netas' stock soared 350 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner was Vestel, originally a video and computer
monitor maker but now on its way to becoming Turkey's largest
Internet service provider, Viegas said. The stock now trades at
just eight times earnings, but Viegas predicted that it would ``go
through the roof'' if the company gained a NASDAQ listing, as it
hopes to do later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong run, Viegas said, emerging markets still have
plenty of catching up to do. They now trade at much lower multiples
than their American counterparts, but he expects them to start
closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has leveled the playing field,'' he said. ``The
technology is fungible, and emerging markets have the same
U.S-educated brain trust, along with the added advantage of lower
cost structures. So many emerging-market technology firms, unlike
their United States counterparts, are profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects that investors in emerging markets will increasingly
shift from energy, mining and industrial stocks to technology and
service companies _ as he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Satyam Computer Services of India, a big winner in the quarter,
ought to be valued like a Western technology stock, Viegas said.
Satyam, which is growing rapidly, started by solving Year 2000
technology problems and has since moved into other areas, like
providing enterprise software for large corporations and enabling
companies to conduct e-commerce.

SAY IT ISN'T SO, ST. FRANCIS: ASSISI BANS PIGEON FEEDING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ The gentleman from Verona reared back guiltily
when asked why a horde of pigeons was pecking around his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it on purpose; the crumbs just accidentally fell
off,'' Paul Castio, a tourist from Verona, protested, holding up
the remains of a cream pastry. But he expressed dismay over a new
city ordinance that bans the feeding of pigeons in Assisi, the
medieval hill town where St. Francis lived and preached. ``I think
it is unfair,'' he said. ``Even pigeons have to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle between man and pigeon is waged daily in almost every
European city, but it has reached a whole new dimension in Assisi,
where the age-old debate over animal rights and the protection of
historic monuments _ and human health _ is colored by the moral
teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, the humble friar (born in 1182
and died in 1226) who loved animals and preached to the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Assisi, which is still recovering from the 1997 earthquake that
damaged its famous basilica and killed 11 people, is now
traumatized by the crackdown on pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Some, and especially the mayor, say it is a badly needed measure
to control a growing pigeon population. Others view it as a form of
anthrocentricity that clashes with the town's animal-loving ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the mayor's decision, but we do not agree with
it,'' said the Rev. Vincenzo Fortunato, the spokesman for the
Franciscan order of Assisi. ``We believe there are alternatives
that respect animals and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most custodians of churches and historic buildings in
Italy, however, the Franciscan friars have put up thin wiring that
emits an electrical impulse that repels birds along key spots of
their restored basilica to protect the 13th-century building from
pigeon excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists are even more upset. ``St. Francis
called everyone brother and sister, even animals,'' said Silvia
Rapicetta, a director of the Assisi Natural Council, an
environmental and animal rights association. ``This order doesn't
take into consideration the whole problem, it just gives out
prohibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   But even animal rights groups concede that there is no easy
solution to limiting the country's rapidly multiplying urban pigeon
population. Reducing the amount of food available and limiting
nesting sites is a partial solution.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Dinetti, a national coordinator of the Italian League for
the Protection of Birds, said that introducing natural predators
like the falcon or the tawny owl to cities would be ``ecologically
sound and not cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned, ``You have to do food reduction ethically _ you
cannot just take away food overnight and stop people from feeding
the pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Venice, a city where there are almost twice as many pigeons
as people, and where signs ordering tourists not to feed pigeons
are cheerfully ignored, has taken a harsher route. There, since the
end of 1998, about 20,000 pigeons have been captured and gassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find a falcon that could eat 50,000 pigeons
everyone would applaud, but it doesn't exist,'' said Mario
Scattolin, director of Venice's Environmental Office. ``Nature is
what it is, not what Walt Disney shows us.''
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Bartolini, the mayor of Assisi, said he would not dream
of introducing extermination measures to his town, and merely
wanted to reduce the pigeon population by cutting back feedings and
closing up windows and holes in abandoned buildings where pigeons
congregate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assisi cannot serve as a welcome center for pigeons,''
Bartolini, warned. ``I am not saying that we have an epidemic on
hand, but their growth rate is alarming, and they damage buildings
and pose a health risk to people.'' Experts disagree on the degree
of risk, but pigeons have been linked to the spread of salmonella,
ticks, and allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor conceded that his order, given just before Christmas
and on the eve of a Holy Year that is expected to bring millions of
additional pilgrims to Assisi, was not widely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis was a saint; I'm just a humble mayor,'' he said.
``I have no interest in becoming a saint. I am trying to apply
common sense and pragmatism.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Assisi, he has some supporters. ``When St. Francis spoke to
the birds, it was before they installed drains,'' grumbled Piero
Coenda, the manager of Cafe Minerva, a cafe across from Santa Maria
Sopra Minerva, a medieval church built over a Roman temple in
Assisi's main piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, locals used to feed pigeons corn on the
piazza when the church bells rang at noon. ``We were infested with
droppings,'' Coenda said. ``We had to change the outdoor
tablecloths every 10 minutes.'' The church now has anti-pigeon
wiring along its roof, and the ritual noon feedings have stopped.
</P>
<P>
   There are other pigeon experts who say people have taken St.
Francis' teachings too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis probably never met a pigeon in his entire life,''
said Bernardino Ragni, a zoologist at the University of Perugia who
conducted an experimental pigeon-reduction program in Perugia.
</P>
<P>
   Ragni said he believed that pigeons were introduced a century
after St. Francis' death, brought back from the Holy Land as
dinner. ``They fed pigeons in order to eat them,'' he said. ``Man
is the pigeon's natural predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But other aviary historians disagree. Richard F. Johnston, a
scholar at the Natural History Museum of the University of Kansas,
said pigeons could be found around coastal Europe in 10,000 B.C.
and were domesticated and cooked by Egyptians, and later the
Etruscans and Romans. According to F.R. Cowell's ``Life in Ancient
Rome,'' pigeons were a delicacy served up at the kind of Roman
bacchanals that enrich ``The Satyricon'' of Petronius.
</P>
<P>
   Art in Assisi, moreover, suggests St. Francis not only met
pigeons, but also talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main art treasures inside the Basilica of St. Francis,
there is a 13th-century fresco attributed to Giotto, which was
covered in dust by the earthquake, and was recently restored. It
shows St. Francis preaching to birds, and some art historians
identify them as sparrows, quails, and also pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Ragni said he had been unable to persuade Perugia's officials to
adopt an effective anti-pigeon campaign, one that includes
extermination, and doubted whether Assisi's elected officials would
summon the political will to sponsor so unpopular a move.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they did, he said, he feared it would spark
widespread civil disobedience. ``Italians are undisciplined,'' he
said wearily, ``and they are also sentimental about very stupid
things.''

FLU VICTIMS OVERWHELM EMERGENCY ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Mont., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's wave of influenza has become widespread across the
nation, overwhelming emergency rooms in cities from Boston to Los
Angeles, filling hospital beds and forcing postponements of
operations as staff members turn to treating the rising number of
flu patients. And many patients are simply forgoing treatment
rather than face the increasingly long waits in overcrowded
emergency rooms, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said this year's
outbreak has arrived much earlier than usual and has increased
death rates from pneumonia and flu-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third bad year in a row for the flu,'' said
Lynnette Brammer, flu-surveillance coordinator at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brammer said the disease had ``exceeded the epidemic
threshold'' _ meaning the deaths it has caused have somewhat
exceeded the normal number of deaths during a flu season. But, she
said, this occurs frequently during heavy flu seasons, and, though
the attacks are severe and widespread, the 1999-2000 season is
still far from the the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brammer added that it was impossible at this stage to
predict how long the increase in cases would last.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Vacanti, an anesthesiologist at the University of
Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, said that
almost all hospital beds in central Massachusetts were filled with
flu patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elective surgery is being postponed and hospitals are trying
to transfer other surgical patients elsewhere because hospital beds
and services are taken up by patients with the flu,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Pearlmutter, the chief of emergency medicine for St.
Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Mass., said that ``the
intensity seems to be more acute than it has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just sicker,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Staci Freeman, 32, of Brighton, seeking treatment for the flu
Friday at St. Elizabeth's, said she had not felt so sick ``since
the time I had pneumonia when I was 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Flomenbaum, emergency physician in chief at New York
Presbyterian Hospital's Weill Cornell Center, said doctors were
overworked over the New Year's weekend, and then came in Monday to
find rooms filled with patients with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used two to three times the normal complement of doctors
and nurses over the New Year's weekend only to come in Monday
morning and face a true flu epidemic,'' Flomenbaum said. ``And
people have been working nonstop ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   At many overcrowded emergency rooms, people simply are leaving
without being treated, he said. That is especially dangerous for
elderly patients or those with other medical conditions, Flomenbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, health officials said, was that the strain of
virus circulating in the country, called Sydney influenza A, was
not an unusual one, and the vaccines recommended for use this year
were effective against it. These officials also said that the new
medications Relenza, made by Glaxo Wellcome, and Tamiflu, made by
Roche Laboratories, both of which were made available last fall,
were found to be highly effective if taken promptly after symptoms
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts said these new prescription drugs, for people who
have been tested and found to have the flu virus, must be taken
within 48 hours after symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   But people were said to be generally slow to react to coughing
or other signs of the flu like an aching body, fever and nausea,
trying to tough it out and get through the illness with
over-the-counter medicines. By the time these flu victims become
thoroughly miserable and need help, it is too late for the
prescription medications to work, the health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   IMS Health, a market research company, said 50,000 Relenza
prescriptions were written the week before Christmas, four times
the previous week. Nearly 45,000 prescriptions were written for
Tamiflu.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Ossi, vice president and director of
infectious-disease clinical research at Glaxo Wellcome Corp., said
drugs work ``by inhibiting a protein on the surface of the flu
virus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That enzyme is necessary for the virus to spread through the
respiratory system,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Medical Center in Missoula, Mont., was another
place with more flu patients than beds to put them or places to
keep them from infecting other patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw over 60 people in seven hours, almost all with flu
symptoms,'' said Jennifer Krueger, a physician's assistant at the
center. ``We've had people in here who will usually ride out a
cold, and they want help. People weren't expecting this, and it's
hitting like a ton of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, emergency room physicians at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center have seen twice the number of patients they saw last
year, said Dee Dee Klute, the administrative director of the
emergency department.
</P>
<P>
   One 77-year-old man's lungs were so impaired by his flu symptoms
Thursday that doctors had to give respiratory assistance at once,
Ms. Klute said. And a 31-year-old woman was so dehydrated that it
took five liters of saline solution to bring her back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of it, that's for sure,'' Ms. Klute said.

TOM FEARS, NFL RECEIVER AND COACH, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Calif., Colo., Ohio, Mexico)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Fears, a Pro Football and College Football Hall of Fame
receiver and later a National Football League coach, died Tuesday
in a convalescent home in Palm Desert, Calif., near his home in
Palm Springs. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   His son Dan said his father died of complications of Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 through 1956, Fears played wide receiver and tight end
for the Los Angeles Rams. At 6 feet 2 inches and 215 pounds, he was
a fast, sure-handed receiver and a solid blocker.
</P>
<P>
   As a former teammate, Don Paul, told The Los Angeles Times: ``He
was never a guy to get by on ability. He intimidated defensive
backs because he was a great blocker. The defensive guy knew if Tom
didn't like the way he was tackled, he'd take his head off on the
next play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Super Bowl era, with an aging Bob Waterfield and the
newcomer Norm Van Brocklin at quarterback and Fears and Elroy
(Crazylegs) Hirsch as the receivers, the Rams reached the NFL title
game in 1949, 1950 and 1951. They won in 1951 when Fears' 73-yard
touchdown reception from Van Brocklin in the fourth quarter
provided a 24-17 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine NFL seasons, Fears caught 400 passes for 5,397 yards
and 38 touchdowns. He led the league in receptions each of his
first three seasons. In a 1950 game against the Green Bay Packers,
he caught 18 passes, still the NFL record for one game. In 1950, he
caught 84 passes, an NFL single-season record that lasted 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jesse Fears was born on Dec. 3, 1922, in Guadalajara,
Mexico, to an American mining engineer and his Mexican wife. When
the youngster was 6, the family moved to Los Angeles. As a boy,
Fears earned 25 cents an hour unloading truckloads of flowers at a
wholesale market. Later, he made 50 cents an hour as an usher at
football games.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, his father was a prisoner of the Japanese,
and the son wanted to become a fighter pilot and fight the
Japanese. He did become a pilot, but Fears was shipped to Colorado
Springs to play for an armed services football team.
</P>
<P>
   He had started college at Santa Clara and after the war
transferred to UCLA for his last two years. Meanwhile, the Rams,
then based in Cleveland, drafted him in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams wanted me to sign when I got out of the Army,'' he
said, ``but I'd already made a commitment to UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, UCLA supporters provided cushy campus jobs and bit
parts in movies. For Fears, that included six seconds as a fighter
pilot in a Humphrey Bogart film, ``Action in the North Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears said later that when he signed with the Rams in 1947 for a
$6,000 salary and a $500 bonus, ``I took a cut in pay.'' He retired
as a pro player after two games in 1956, when his football salary
had reached its peak, $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   He became an assistant coach of the Rams (1960-61) under
Waterfield and an assistant of the Packers (1962-65) under Vince
Lombardi. He was the New Orleans Saints' first head coach from 1967
to 1970 and was coach of the Southern California Sun of the World
Football League in 1974 and 1975 until the league collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fears owned restaurants and avocado fields and rented out
condominiums. In 1994, he was told he had Alzheimer's disease.
</P>

   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Luella
Wintheiser; three sons, Pat, Jonathan and Dan; three daughters,
Kathleen Cook, Katie Prather and Joanna Fears; six grandchildren;
and an older brother, Charles Fears Jr.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned he had Alzheimer's, Fears addressed it squarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the last six months my memory has been slipping,'' he
said. ``Your neighbors, unless you see them regularly, you forget
their names. It's embarrassing. That's the worst part. People think
that you don't give a damn about them, but that's not the way it
is.''

<P>
   When Elf Aquitaine, France's largest oil company, surrendered
last summer to a hostile takeover from a domestic rival, Elf's
departing chief was rewarded with stock options worth $38 million.
Not long thereafter, Michelin, the highly profitable French tire
maker, announced that it would eliminate 7,500 jobs across Europe.
And earlier in the year, the government's support for a three-way
merger of big banks was thwarted when investors balked.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, that kind of corporate news might be seen
as routine. But in France and across Europe, it is providing grist
for a volatile debate about the role of big foreign investors,
including American pension funds, in European business. The pension
funds are portrayed as demanding unreasonably high profits at the
expense of jobs, as promoting outlandish rewards for executives and
as a general threat to established ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   In October, when William D. Crist, board president of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest
American public pension fund, arrived in Paris for a routine visit,
Le Monde, the Paris daily, published an article titled ``The
Pension Funds That Drive Fear Into the French.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called Calpers, Templeton and TIAA-CREF,'' the article
said, ``and for the French, who are discovering with a certain
anguish the globalization of their economy, these pension funds
from abroad are the masters of this new world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, pension funds have been long-term
investors in business for decades. They are an accepted, even
welcomed, part of the financial landscape, seen as protectors of
the savings of millions of working individuals and as more
conservative and reliable than many other investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   But in Europe, where retirees have long relied on pay-as-you-go
public pension systems and many industries have been financed by
government or through cozy relationships with local banks, the
mounting influence of such outside and outsized institutional
investors is creating serious tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the government recently assailed a hostile takeover
bid by Vodafone AirTouch of Britain for Mannesmann, the German
telecommunications conglomerate, as tantamount to an attack on
German sovereignty. The bid had been favored by several
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the government has expressed unease at the free flow
of investment, declaring the former national telecommunications
company, Telecom Italia, off limits to foreign hostile takeover
bids and putting the brakes on banking deals.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere have pension funds and other foreign investment
firms set off more fury than in France. As French industry
restructures to improve its global competitiveness, it has
attracted billions of dollars in investment capital, much of it
from American and British pension funds. Now, the funds' role in
the French economy is spawning the latest in a series of fierce
conflicts that pit French cultural values against the demands of
international finance.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of France, Jacques Chirac, complained
publicly that French workers were being asked to sacrifice simply
to ``safeguard the investment benefits of Scottish widows and
California pensioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, the central
bank, tried to explain what he called ``a French paradox.'' While
France has emerged lately as the strongest locomotive of Europe's
economy, he said in an interview, ``the image that is displayed
might be misleading, since the rear-guard part of the economy is
more eloquent than the successful part.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue weighs on French-American relations, already burdened
by various squabbles. They include an American ban on French luxury
foods, to protest French unwillingness to import hormone-treated
American beef, and a refusal by France to buy genetically modified
American crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the investment debate also complicates life for the
government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, of the Socialist Party.
Tensions erupted in his administration last month after the
Communists, a junior partner in the coalition, called for laws
banning layoffs by profitable corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The financial trend is clear. In the first eight months of 1999,
foreign investment in French stocks and bonds totaled 457 billion
francs, or $70.3 billion, more than in all of 1998, when the inflow
of 400 billion francs was 50 percent higher than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall, Trichet said, partly explains recent French
economic gains. Growth in 2000 is expected to reach 3 percent, up
from 2.8 percent in 1999. Unemployment, the chief blemish on an
improving record, should drop below 10 percent for the first time
in years. Much of the investment driving the French revival has
come from institutional investors: among the top 40 companies on
the Paris stock exchange, an average stake of 35 percent is now
held by American and British institutional investors and pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than cheering their success, many French are wringing
their hands. When Crist of Calpers paid a visit, the leftist daily
Liberation outlined the immense size and power of the pension fund,
but felt obliged to reassure its readers that Crist was ``no Darth
Vader'' _ especially since the newspaper ran a photograph that made
him (italics)look(end italics) like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the jibes been restricted to the left. Jean-Louis
Beffa, the chairman and chief executive of Compagnie de
Saint-Gobain, the glass and building materials group, accused
foreign pension funds of forcing on French corporations ``a
quickness of change that imposes considerable human problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm not sure they're best adapted to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the French government has been gradually selling off
control of more than a score of huge enterprises like banks,
insurance companies, industrial companies and even the national
flag carrier, Air France. Since his election in 1997, Jospin, who
had campaigned with a pledge to end privatizations, has sold a
further chunk of assets worth roughly $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the auction of nationalized property for the
Socialists and their allies in the Communist Party, Jospin promoted
the idea of employee shareholding. Now, roughly three-fourths of
all the employees in privatized companies are shareholders in their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, 15 percent of the French population owns stock, far
below the 50 percent level for the United States. But the increase
has been profound, from 1 percent a decade ago, and at times is
crucial in corporate decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The power shifts were seen last year in an unusual takeover
battle within the French banking industry. Last March, two big
French banks, Societe Generale and Paribas, announced plans to
merge, only to see their plans upset days later by a third domestic
rival, Banque Nationale de Paris, which started a $37 billion
hostile bid for both its rivals together.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the French authorities was typical of an older,
cozier tradition of business-government linkage.
</P>
<P>
   Trichet, the central bank governor, convened the banks'
directors and urged them to agree to a three-way alliance. That, he
argued, would create a strong French banking champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Paris did not get its way. Banque Nationale won the backing
of investors to gain control of Paribas, but not of Societe
Generale, illustrating two lessons to the French. One was the power
of institutional investors, not only pension funds but also hedge
funds and arbitrageurs, to thwart government wishes. The other was
the increasing financial influence of workers, who, thanks to their
employee stock ownership plan, held roughly 8 percent of the stock
in Societe Generale. Employees, the biggest single bloc, voted
overwhelmingly against the Banque Nationale takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, said Sophie L'Helias, a French lawyer who
represents American funds, ``shareholders were always the ones
writing the checks so management and stakeholders could play
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Toulisse, national secretary of the CFDT labor union,
acknowledged that French labor-management relations, once a
you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours arrangement, produced
frequent strikes but also high productivity and comfortable
employee benefits. Now, with the rise of employee shareholders, he
said, labor relations has ``pushed from a game of two to a game of
three.
</P>
<P>
   The union seeks to tread a middle path, Toulisse said, deeming
employee shareholding neither the ``alpha and omega'' nor
``something diabolical.'' It wants to avoid a division between
employees who own shares in their companies and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Pension fund managers reject accusations that they wield undue
power and destroy jobs to benefit distant shareholders.
``Nonsense,'' said Crist, whose fund has roughly $2 billion in
French stocks, making it probably the largest single investor on
the Paris Bourse. He said that France would gradually move away
from total reliance on a pay-as-you-go public pension system, but
that ``this is not going to be a quick or easy transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The activist policies of Calpers, meanwhile, are aimed at
promoting respect for minority shareholders' rights, independent
boards of directors and greater openness in setting executive pay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Clapman, chief investment counsel of TIAA-CREF, the
teachers pension fund, has regularly visited France to sow the
seeds of shareholder activism. In 1997, the fund helped to lead a
successful minority shareholder revolt at Eramet SA, a mining
company in which the French Treasury held a stake, after the
government tried to appease the independence movement in a South
Pacific territory by swapping a nickel mine owned by Eramet for a
less profitable one owned by local separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Now shareholder activism is catching on, and the government is
trying to help. Legislation is being considered to compel the
release of details about executive compensation and to require
shareholder approval if the jobs of chairman and chief executive
are combined, to curb the omnipotence of French executives.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, Trichet, the central banker, and H. Carl McCall,
the New York state comptroller and pension trustee, plan to conduct
a public forum here on the role of pension funds in a modern
economy. Felix G. Rohatyn, the American ambassador in Paris and a
former investment banker, arranged McCall's visit _ to show the
French, he explained, that there was ``no contradiction between the
fiduciary responsibility of a pension fund manager and the social
responsibility of a public official.''

 &HT;    Titan-ic start bypasses Flutie
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn. _ Last season, Flutie Magic swept over Buffalo
like a late-autumn blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, the 1984 Heisman Trophy winner
and six-time Canadian League MVP, led Buffalo to a 10-6 record and
the playoffs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie played in the Pro Bowl and grocery stores couldn't keep
``Flutie Flakes'' on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, grocers might be demanding a frosted version of the cereal.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Bills to a 10-5 record this season, Flutie was
benched by Buffalo coach Wade Phillips. Rob Johnson, who has
started all of eight games in his five-year pro career, will start
today's AFC wild-card game at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And Flutie isn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that frustrates me more than anything is I've been
waiting 10 years for this opportunity,'' Flutie said. ``We've got a
great football team. We've got the best defense in the league.
We've got a real chance. And this is the reason I came back _ and
then all of a sudden you turn it over.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an all-too-familiar feeling for Flutie, who was benched 11
years ago by New England coach Raymond Berry. In the Patriots'
final game of the 1988 season, Berry started Tony Eason, who was
still hurt and unable to throw well. The Broncos won that game and
knocked New England out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what happened with the Patriots,'' Flutie said.
``What bothers me about this is that I felt the decision back then
was made because Tony was a first-rounder, Tony was making $1.2
million and I was making $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went into that offseason as a free agent and a starter,
they were going to have to pay me what Tony made. So they had to
make a decision then and do it. And I feel like I got caught in the
middle of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie might be caught in the middle of cap-o-nomics again. The
Bills are paying Johnson, a former backup with the Jaguars, about
$5 million a year; Flutie earned about $4.4 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Having two high-priced passers might not be an option for the
Bills, who are projected to be about $5 million over the salary cap
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, here's a situation where they've given up a
first-rounder for Rob, he signed for a lot of money, and he hasn't
done anything yet,'' Flutie said. ``It all had that same feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is a daring one by Phillips. Not since Jets coach Joe
Walton replaced Ken O'Brien with Pat Ryan in 1986 has a coach
benched a quarterback on the eve of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision certainly,'' Phillips said. ``I studied
the film. It wasn't a haphazard thing. I talked to our coaches, and
I think it gives us the best opportunity to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips might be right. Although Flutie is 17-9 as an NFL
starter, his passer rating of 75.1 this season is ranked only 23rd
in the league. Flutie has thrown 19 touchdowns and 16 interceptions
and averages only 6.63 yards per pass attempt. In his last five
games, the Bills scored only 85 points.
</P>
<P>
   Teams learned how to defend him this season.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents stacked the line of scrimmage and daredFlutie to beat
them with his arm. Teams also rushed him from the outside to
prevent him from leaving the pocket, where he is most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an All-American at Southern California, threw for 287
yards and two touchdowns in last week's 31-6 romp of the Colts. He
engineered four 80-yard touchdown drives against Indianapolis,
after the Bills had only five in their first 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is confident in me right now,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he thinks that Johnson can be more accurate
throwing the deep ball. That could be a key against the Titans, who
might be without injured free safety Marcus Robertson, who suffered
several facial lacerations in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie says he'll be ready if Johnson falters. If Buffalo loses,
it might be Flutie's last game in a Bills uniform. His relationship
with Phillips seems irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should talk to my wife,'' Flutie said. ``Basically, she
said, `I told you so,' and can't wait for me to come home. I don't
think my role with this team is through. We'll see how it plays
out.''

BRITAIN'S GRANADA GROUP CONSIDERS BIDS FOR TV RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A battle to rule Britain's commercial television
industry began on Friday when the Granada Group said it intended to
spoil the recently planned $6.6-billion merger between Carlton
Communications and United News &AMP; Media by trying to buy one of the
media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Granada, a leading British operator of television networks,
hotels and restaurants, said it would request permission from
regulatory authorities to bid for either company, though executives
at Granada declined to identify which one.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Carlton and United News announced that they would
merge, a deal that would create the largest commercial television
concern in Britain, reaching more than 65 percent of the nation's
homes.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is control of Britain's Independent Television Network,
or ITV, the principal nationwide commercial television network that
is broadcast conventionally rather than via a cable or satellite
provider. Seven companies currently own ITV, including Granada,
Carlton and United News.
</P>
<P>
   If the Carlton-United merger were approved and Granada were not
allowed to bid for one of the two companies, Granada would be left
with very little opportunity to acquire another company that could
give it the size and muscle to compete effectively with the
combined Carlton and United.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Carlton and United has yet to be approved by
regulators, and Britain's Office of Fair Trading is expected to
refer the deal to the Competition Commission for a full review. The
Broadcasting Act forbids media companies to control more than 15
percent of the audience and 25 percent of advertising revenue.
Carlton and United said their merger would give them a 14.9 percent
share of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Granada chief executive Charles Allen suggested that regulators
should block a merger between Carlton and United. ``We believe that
further ITV consolidation raises a number of competition and public
policy issues that should be referred to the Competition
Commission,'' Allen was quoted by Reuters. ``Obviously, it makes
sense for shareholders in Carlton and United to wait before taking
any action.'' Shareholders of both companies are expected to vote
on the merger later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Both Carlton and United issued a statement saying that the
companies' boards were committed to the merger and continued to
recommend it unanimously to their shareholders. The companies said
that Granada's move should be ignored, in part, because it
contained no specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Granada has made no secret of its desire to expand in the media
industry through acquisitions and has said it may split up into
media and hospitality divisions. It is one of Britain's largest
hotel and restaurant operators. The company's media enterprises
include a number of popular television productions like
``Masterpiece Theater'' and film documentaries like ``42 Up,'' a
series that chronicles the lives of several individuals. It also
has an agreement with The New York Times to create television
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if Granada were granted permission to make an
offer for either Carlton or United, such a deal would most likely
face even more regulatory hurdles than the Carlton-United merger
because it would be larger.
</P>
<P>
   ITV has historically competed for viewers only with the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s channels, which do not carry advertisements.
But the media companies that have stakes in ITV have become
convinced that they must consolidate to compete effectively for
advertising with commercial channels carried over Britain's cable
and satellite networks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Granada rose 4 pence, to 585.5 pence, or $9.66. Shares
of Carlton rose 16 pence, to 573 pence, or $9.45. Shares of United
fell 5.5 pence, to 792.5 pence, or $13.08.

 &HT;    History haunts Lions
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Detroit Lions quarterback Gus Frerotte should
feel right at home in this afternoon's playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Give him credit, too, for trying to brainwash his teammates into
feeling just as cozy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're playing the same Redskins team we played (in
Detroit on Dec. 5),'' Frerotte said. He played his first five NFL
seasons for the Redskins and still maintains a home in nearby
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if the Lions could believe him, but probably
more on their minds is their 0-19 all-time record against the
Redskins in Washington and Maryland since they moved from Boston
before the 1937 season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Lions are not the same team that began the season 6-2,
then 8-4, including a 33-17 win over the Redskins last month.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (8-8) hasn't won since, losing four in a row, while the
Redskins (10-6) won three of four and the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the history,'' Lions center Mike Compton said.
``Everybody keeps mentioning it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all of the bad history.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has won one playoff game in 42 years, 38-6 at home
against Dallas in 1991. The next week, they got drilled in the NFC
Championship game, 41-10 at Washington. The Lions also have lost
their last seven road playoff games, dating back to 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte was 2-4 this season while starting in place of Charlie
Batch, who re-fractured his right thumb in last Sunday's 24-17 loss
at Minnesota and might not even be able to play today in an
emergency. But Frerotte was good against his former team last
month. He passed for 280 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And he swears he will feel at home in FedEx Field, trying to
beat the team that made a scapegoat of him after last season by
cutting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like RFK,'' the Redskins' old stadium, he said.
``There won't be any bleachers rocking. The fans are farther from
the field. But it will be loud. It's kind of like going back to my
old home. I can't wait to run out of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have had problems of their own this season.
</P>
<P>
   New owner Daniel Snyder has become a modern NFL version of what
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was like in the 1970s and early
'80s, meddling almost daily in team affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive guru Bill Arnsparger was hired to advise embattled
coordinator Mike Nolan near midseason, and the Washington defense
has improved, although it still ranks second-worst in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight games, the Redskins allowed 27.8 points,
402.3 total yards and 127.4 rushing yards per game. In eight games
since, they have allowed 19.4 points, 310.9 total yards and 119.3
rushing yards. The offense, triggered by former Vikings quarterback
Brad Johnson, ranks No. 2 in the NFL and expects to get running
back Stephen Davis back. Davis, who led the NFC with 1,405 rushing
yards, missed last week's game with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's running game dealt well with the retirement of Barry
Sanders, but when his replacement, Ron Rivers, broke an ankle in
November, it suffered. Startling left tackle Ray Roberts was lost
for the season Dec. 19, and the Lions have averaged 47 rushing
yards over their past five games.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Cory Schlesinger is expected to get most of the
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start to lose a little bit ... there's a confidence
factor that you have to regain,'' Detroit coach Bobby Ross said.
``And I think that's what we're working on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   More problems for Detroit: Pro Bowl defensive tackle Luther
Elliss has a badly sprained ankle, and the other starting defensive
tackle, James Jones, isn't certain to play. His wife, Son-Ja,
earlier this week underwent a kidney and pancreas transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Lions beat the Redskins last month, it ended
another amazing Lions streak _ 16 consecutive regular-season losses
to the Redskins, home or away.
</P>
<P>
   Can Detroit snap another streak?
</P>
<P>
   Redskins veteran return man Brian Mitchell said, ``History can
fool you sometimes.''

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may not know that George Washington was something of a role
model for Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese revolutionary leader.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Virginia plantation owner and the communist
leader share much political ideology, but Ho recognized that
Washington's tactics during the American Revolution were the best
way for an underfunded, undermanned insurgency to fight against
superior forces.
</P>
<P>
   As history shows, Ho chose a successful path, but then he had
history to guide him. Washington, on the other hand, was something
of a madman, not that we like to question the sanity of the Father
of Our Country. But that is exactly what many of his aides did when
he marshaled his underarmed Continental Army for a surprise attack
as darkness fell on Christmas Day in 1776 against a highly trained
army of Hessian mercenaries in Trenton, N.J. The story of this
pivotal moment in our history is told Monday night in ``The
Crossing'' on A&AMP;E. Starring Jeff Daniels as a stoic Washington,
this adaption by Howard Fast of his own novel gives us a
straightforward and intelligent _ if somewhat passionless _ account
of the event without shedding much light on it.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly history and partly the enigma that is Washington.
Our image of Washington crossing the Delaware is probably taken
from Emanuel Leutzel's 1851 painting, where the general is standing
in the prow of a boat, rather foolhardy. In ``The Crossing,''
Washington sensibly sits in the middle of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly romantic, but Washington was, on one hand, a pragmatist.
It was the undertaking itself that was considered foolhardy. By
December 1776, Washington's army had been beaten badly in battle
after battle by the British and had shrunk from 20,000 men to less
than 2,000 in six months. In Washington's mind, a victory was
mandatory to even have a revolution. (He was, no doubt, right,
since only about a third in the American colonies even supported
the war.)
</P>
<P>
   To ``The Crossing's'' credit, all the political implications and
logistics of the attack are quite clearly laid out. As a history
lesson _ especially a TV history lesson _ the film is well done.
(One you wouldn't mind seeing used in classrooms.)
</P>
<P>
   The acting is uniformly solid, although the roles, especially
that of Washington, are more archetype than characters. So while we
see the brilliance of Washington's strategy, we never really grasp
the fire in his belly or understand what made him take such a risky
gambit. &QL;

GIULIANI CAMPAIGN COLLECTS FUNDS FROM 2 LOOSELY-REGULATED GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In preparing a run for U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has paid for much of his political operation by collecting
money through two little-known political committees that are
subject to looser fund-raising restrictions than an official Senate
campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   The two committees have taken in and spent nearly $1 million for
the mayor's political operation since March 1998, according to
disclosure records. The mayor collected much of the money from a
loyal corps of donors, many of whom have also given the legal limit
to Giuliani's separate Senate campaign committee. Often, the donors
contributed to all three accounts on the same day, the records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are generally required to finance their races through
official campaign committees, but in recent years many have
increasingly sought to use other vehicles to raise and spend money,
which has to some extent rendered the limits on donations to the
official campaign committees almost moot. This trend has spurred
calls for changes in the campaign finance laws that would seek to
limit the influence of such outside spending, markedly decreasing
the size of many donations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Giuliani has chastised his likely Democratic
rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for collecting more than $350,000
through a special Democratic Party national committee that can
legally accept donations in unlimited amounts. Some of that
so-called soft money appears to have been spent on television
advertising promoting Mrs. Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said his use of the two other committees was
entirely proper and was not an attempt to get around the limits.
They said they had received no objections from the Federal Election
Commission over the way that the Giuliani political operation was
financed.
</P>
<P>
   The official Giuliani campaign committee can accept a maximum of
$2,000 from each donor. Of the two other Giuliani committees, one,
Solutions America, which was set up under federal rules, has a
limit of $5,000 annually per donor. Under the rules, this type of
committee, known as a leadership account, is not supposed to be
used for campaign expenses, but rather to promote the candidate's
political philosophy and to contribute money to other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's other fund-raising committee, Giuliani for New York,
was established under even more lax New York rules and can collect
up to roughly $45,000 per donor. It is not supposed to be used for
federal campaigns, but for election to state offices like governor.
</P>
<P>
   By taking advantage of the different limits, the Giuliani
operation has been able to raise roughly $800,000 more from donors
who would otherwise have reached the $2,000 limit for contributing
to a Senate campaign, an analysis of campaign finance records
shows.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the same day in March 1998, a Wall Street
financier Dave H. Williams donated $1,000 to the Senate committee,
$5,000 to Solutions America and $20,000 to Giuliani for New York.
</P>
<P>
   The records also show that for 1998 and the first half of 1999,
the mayor's three committees shared costs of at least one major
fund-raising event, as well as rent, salaries and other
administrative items for the Giuliani political operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On April 15, 1999, the mayor's top political aide, Bruce
Teitelbaum, who the mayor this week said would be his campaign
manager, was paid $1,133.73 by the Senate campaign, $1,421.07 by
Solutions America and $1,133.73 by Giuliani for New York. For
several months, he was paid from the three different accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani aides said that in the second half of 1999, they had
used the two other committees mostly to finance advertisements to
build support for a referendum in November 1999 pushed by Giuliani
to change the city charter. The voters ultimately rejected the
Giuliani proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said that under the rules, the mayor was free to spend
from all three committees until he formally notified the Federal
Election Commission that he was considering running for Senate.
They said he did so in April 1999, and after that point, he had
largely stopped raising and spending money through the two
committees, with the exception of the Charter advertisements. They
acknowledged that the committees are not defunct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until late April we could raise and we could spend money
without it being viewed as promoting a Senate campaign because in
fact the mayor was undecided,'' said John Gross, the mayor's
campaign treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was widely expected that Giuliani would run for
Senate after Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced in November
1998 that he would not seek another term, Gross maintained that the
mayor had not begun focusing on the Senate until April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gross added that the Giuliani political operation has not used
either of the two committees to pay for television advertising for
the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Some election lawyers disputed the legal interpretation given by
Giuliani's aides.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers emphasized that they did not know whether any
election rules were violated, they said the issue did not rest on
when the mayor notified the Federal Election Commission that he was
considering running for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lawyers said, adherence to the rules required that
the Solutions America account and the state account could not spend
money at any time on Giuliani's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on what these people did with the money,''
said Jan Witold Baran, a prominent election lawyer in Washington
who represents Republicans. ``It is dependent on how the money was
spent and whether or not it promoted the Senate election in a very
specific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress have set up federal leadership
accounts, and other lawyers noted that the Federal Election
Commission has adopted criteria to ensure that the accounts are
separate from campaign committees and not used to circumvent the
donation limits.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the rules say that if two committees have the same
staff members and similar patterns of contributions, that could
indicate that they are affiliated. If so, donations from an
individual would be subject to the Senate committee's limit. In
Giuliani's case, the lawyers said, donors would be able to give a
maximum of only $2,000 to all three committees combined.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the rules regarding the financing of campaigns, the
issues are murky and there is not much enforcement. Still, a few
politicians, including Bob Dole, have run afoul of the rules
regarding leadership accounts. Dole was penalized by the FEC for
using his leadership account, Campaign America, to help his 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of tightening the campaign finance system said
that whatever the rules intended to keep the committees separate,
the leadership accounts themselves were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These leadership PACs have been used by members of Congress as
the equivalent of political slush funds to pick up various costs,
ranging from legitimate political expenses to costs that wind up
being personal expenses,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, an advocacy group in Washington. ``They are very
questionable from a campaign finance standpoint, but they are used
by many members of Congress.''

   (NYT27) UNDATED -- Jan. 7, 2000 -- RUSSIA-GERMWARFARE --
Yevgenia Ustinov at the grave of her husband and fellow scientist
Nikolai, who died after accidentally infecting himself with the
Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic killer that he and his colleagues were

BRAZIL GROUP PROTESTS 2 BANKS' FREE WEB ACCESS PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain)  (js) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Drawing attention to the growing
concentration of power among large companies in Brazil's Internet
industry, a group representing several hundred of the country's
Internet access providers protested on Friday over plans by two
prominent banks to offer free access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Association of Internet Providers said that the
entry of the banks, Banco Bradesco SA and Uniao de Bancos
Brasileiros SA, into the access business could inhibit competition
since the financial institutions' ability to draw on existing
client bases is so huge.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' forays have thrown the Brazilian Internet industry,
Latin America's largest, into a frenzy with many companies
redrawing strategies to compete under new conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're witnessing an attempt to conquer the Brazilian Internet
by institutions who have never given anyone anything free during
their existence,'' said Antonio Tavares, president of the Internet
providers association. ``Their rhetoric is of democratizing access,
but this is the kind of democracy recognizable only in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many people in the Internet business in Brazil think
that the service providers' complaints will not amount to much
unless these small companies find viable ways to compete with
larger companies, their protest has shed light on the competition
and consolidation that are advancing at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the growing strength of corporate titans illustrates
how the spread of the Web in Latin America's largest country has
raised competitive pressures since the Internet was introduced on a
commercial basis in Brazil five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign concerns like America Online and PSInet Corp. are
seeking to win new customers and take market share from Universo
Online, the leading domestic service provider. Other companies,
like Telefonica SA of Spain, have made large acquisitions of
existing companies, while Microsoft Corp. is teaming up with Globo,
Brazil's largest media group, to offer high-speed access over a
network of pay-television cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazingly competitive market,'' said Bruno
Fiorentini, the managing director of Yahoo's Brazilian operations.
``You have 10 large portals competing for advertising money and now
you have the big banks. The small providers will have to find other
ways to survive or they will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Internet service providers already have reduced the
monthly fees they charge because of competitive pressure. But they
still charge anywhere from 19 to 40 reais a month, or roughly
$10.40 to $22.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the fast-consolidating market, it is no surprise
that Brazil's largest banks moved to offer free Internet service.
Taking advantage of their large client bases, which in the case of
Bradesco and Unibanco amounts to a combined 11.4 million people,
the institutions are seeking to expand revenue from their offering
of financial services and to attract new clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to lunch in any nice restaurant in Sao Paulo and you
overhear talk of Internet this and Internet that,'' said Plinio
Patrao, the superintendent of Internet operations at Unibanco,
Brazil's third-largest bank not under control of the government.
``We realized we had to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the announcements of Bradesco and Unibanco
sent shares in both banks soaring on the Sao Paulo stock exchange,
other institutions have said that they are studying similar plans.
These banks include Banco Itau SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya of
Spain, which has a substantial Brazilian operation.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While financial institutions stake out claims on Brazil's online
map, their offerings of free dial-up service to the Web have
generated lively discussion over the pricing of Internet access.
With the advent of greater competition among Internet and telephone
companies, Brazil could be headed toward a model similar to that of
some European countries where free Internet access is common.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation of the telecommunications industry is largely
fueling this speculation. During the next several weeks, a number
of new companies are expected to start operations in competition
with existing concerns that provide conventional fixed-line
telephone service. The advent of competition in the fixed-line
business is part of a wide-reaching deregulation program that began
with the privatization of the state telecommunications monopoly in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone customers are charged by the minute for local calls in
Brazil, so it may be in these new companies' interests to work out
deals with local Internet service providers to have charges for
access to the Web imbedded in customers' phone bills instead of
charged separately. And in a newly competitive marketplace,
offering Internet access in conjunction with a given service
provider could attract new clients.
</P>
<P>
   While such a model does not appeal much to service providers
that depend on subscriptions for most of their revenues, it does
appeal to a number of other companies, like online retailers or
auctioneers, that benefit from increased customer access to the Web
in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great wonders will be done for our business with a greater
number of people on the Internet so I'm all for free access, which
I think is largely inevitable,'' said Antonio Bonchristiano, the
president of Submarino, one of Latin America's largest electronic
commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over free access continues, the Internet service
providers association said it was considering taking legal action
with government antitrust authorities against the banks. And the
group said it was asking the government to limit the reach of the
Brazilian subsidiary of Telefonica.

CITING SAFETY, U.S. DELAYS OPENING BORDER TO TRUCKS FROM MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, citing safety concerns, has decided
to delay opening all 50 states to Mexican trucks and buses this
month, as is called for by the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials denounced the decision as a violation of the
1993 pact, which calls for letting Mexican trucks and buses travel
anywhere north of the border beginning on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that NAFTA allows them to delay
or suspend certain provisions when they have safety or health
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to a two-month-old inspector general's report,
which found that when 21,000 Mexican trucks were inspected at the
border, before transferring goods to American trucks, 41 percent of
the Mexican vehicles failed to meet American safety requirements.
The report found numerous serious violations, including defective
brakes, badly worn tires and nonfunctioning lights.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which was first reported by The Los Angeles Times on
Friday, delighted the powerful Teamsters union at a time when Vice
President Al Gore is vigorously seeking its endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has long campaigned
against opening the border, pointing to the safety concerns and
fears that a large influx of low-paid Mexican truckers would cost
the jobs of thousands of American truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a sharp debate between administration
officials who did not want to anger the labor movement by opening
the border and some in the State Department and the U.S. trade
representative's office who feared that not opening the border
would strain relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in
Washington, said, ``The United States is in violation of the
treaty. Mexico has been insisting that the U.S. should comply with
NAFTA. The treaty is very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Mexico and the United States has heated up
since Mexico decided last month to move ahead with its trade suit,
in which it is seeking millions of dollars in compensation from
Washington for what it insists is wrongful closure of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Clinton administration has initiated its own
trade case against Mexico, asserting that Mexico's closing of its
borders to American trucks for the last four years has constituted
improper unilateral retaliation, which the administration asserts
is illegal under NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials would not comment on how long they
thought it would take to resolve this dispute, but several industry
officials said Friday that they thought the administration would
delay any border openings until after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials and some trucking executives said
that the White House decision not to open the border was intended
to help line up labor support for Gore in his battle against former
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said, ``With the Clinton administration, you always have to suspect
that politics played a big role in any decision. But the fact is
there are legitimate safety questions here, which several of our
own candidates have made note of.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insisted that the decision to keep the
border closed was motivated by safety concerns and not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important factor here is the safety concern for American
motorists,'' said Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the administration has blocked a
NAFTA provision. In December 1995, Clinton decided not to allow
Mexican trucks to travel beyond a narrow border zone and into all
of California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico _ as was called for by
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials had voiced optimism in recent months that the
Clinton administration, in facing a new NAFTA deadline, would make
some significant move toward opening the border to Mexican trucks
and buses on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With trucks carrying 90 percent of the goods traded between
Mexico and the United States, the border-opening provision has long
been looked to as a major step toward removing trade barriers
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, hailed the
administration's decision. ``Working families throughout the United
States appreciate this bold step taken by the Clinton
administration,'' Hoffa said in a statement. ``No longer will
companies be allowed to use NAFTA to take our jobs and endanger our
health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In fighting any move to open the border, Teamster leaders have
over the last year organized protest rallies, made stem-winding
speeches, issued scathing reports and lined up support from nearly
half the members of Congress. The union's leaders repeatedly
asserted that opening the border would endanger the jobs and living
standards of many Teamsters because Mexican truck drivers often
earn just $2 an hour, compared with the $18 an hour earned by many
American drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes just weeks before a Jan. 26 meeting at which the
board of the 1.4-million-member Teamsters union is expected to
decide whether to endorse Gore or Bradley. The Teamsters and the
United Auto Workers union were the only two major unions to oppose
the AFL-CIO's decision last October to endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Teamster officials have privately said that it
would be highly doubtful that the union would endorse Gore if the
administration opened the border to Mexican trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first indicated that he was leaning against opening the
border when he appeared in October at a New York City dinner
honoring Hoffa, where the president vigorously criticized Mexican
trucks for being unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said Friday,
``As the president has said, we are not going to open our border
until we are sure that our legitimate safety concerns have been
addressed. Under the NAFTA, countries can take reasonable measures
as to health and safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speeches to the Teamsters board last fall, Bradley and Gore
opposed opening the border because of safety problems with Mexico's
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has often emphasized the need for
safer trucks, both American and Mexican, saying that he favored
tougher enforcement over continued closing of the border.

   LOS ANGELES _ The Big West Council meets Sunday in San Diego,
and the possibility of adding Cal State Northridge as a future
member will be discussed, Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said the council won't vote to include CSUN or UC
Riverside in a future expansion, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to take a formal vote on this, only because it
would be a straw poll,'' Farrell said. ``Until our presidents vote
on it, I don't want to have the chance of those two bodies be
placed at odds with each other. We're going to discuss expansion
and discuss candidates ... then see where we go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, a member of the Big Sky Conference, is an affiliate member
of the Big West in softball and will join the conference in
baseball in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Big West is losing Nevada and Boise State as full-time
members next year and New Mexico State and North Texas have asked
to leave, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lineman transfers: Tim Shoffeitt, a sophomore offensive lineman
who started all 22 games he played in for the Cal State Northridge
football team, is transferring to Azusa Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Jeff Kearin said Shoffeitt told him his plans Friday
morning. Shoffeitt, 6-foot-1 and 290 pounds, made the Big Sky
Conference All-Academic team as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Shoffeitt's departure means Ashcon Madjid, a freshman from L.A.
Baptist High who redshirted last season, moves to the top of the
depth chart at right guard.

TIMES CO. COMPLETES PURCHASE OF WORCESTER TELEGRAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Times Co. said its acquisition of the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette, the third-largest daily newspaper in
Massachusetts, was completed Friday, with the previously announced
purchase price of about $295 million unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also owns The Boston Globe, named Globe
publisher Richard H. Gilman as president of the Worcester Telegram
&AMP; Gazette Corp. A spokeswoman said financial results for both
papers will be combined for reporting purposes under a single
division of Times Co., New England Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce S. Bennett continues as the publisher of the Telegram &AMP;
Gazette, reporting to Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Telegram &AMP; Gazette employees, Times Co. chairman
and publisher Arthur S. Sulzberger Jr. and president and chief
operating officer Russell T. Lewis pledged ``to ensure the
editorial independence'' of the paper while seeking new revenue
opportunities and operating efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ownership of The Boston Globe and the Telegram &AMP; Gazette
will enable us to better serve readers and advertisers in the
eastern half of Massachusetts,'' Lewis said in a news release
announcing completion of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said changes in administration and procedure are
underway, including a previously disclosed plan to cut 30 jobs from
a staff of about 500. He said all employees who are 57 or older
have been offered voluntary separation packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegram &AMP; Gazette, with a history of morning and evening
editions dating back to 1866, had been owned by Chronicle
Publishing Co. of San Francisco since 1986, following more than
half a century of ownership by Worcester-area families. The morning
Telegram and evening Gazette were merged in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's daily circulation is about 107,000 weekdays and
about 134,000 on Sundays, mostly in Worcester and Middlesex
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co. also owns 22 other daily and weekly regional
newspapers, mostly in the South and West. It publishes three
magazines and operates eight television stations and two New York
City radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Another business unit, Times Company Digital, operates nearly 50
Internet Web sites, including Boston.com, eWorcester.com,
nytimes.com, and winetoday.com.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co. reported sales in 1998 at $2.9 billion, and posted
revenues of $2.25 billion for the first nine months of 1999. Shares
closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at 45 3/4, up 1 1/16.

 &HT;    Keeping close tabs on the flu
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flu has pummeled more than a dozen Northeast and
Western states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Although metro Atlanta doctors have fielded many patient
complaints of cold- and flulike symptoms, CDC officials say this
season's flu bug has not been more severe or widespread than in
past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influenza activity is picking up across the country, but this
is nothing unusual for this time of year,'' said Thomas W. Skinner,
the federal agency's spokesman. ``Some areas might have been hit
harder than others, but that, too, is not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states reported the flu was widespread, and 22 states
reported it was a regional problem, meaning doctors are seeing more
than just a few, sporadic cases in certain areas. In other states,
flu cases are sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really been in the flu season for only about two
weeks,'' said Dr. Kathryn Arnold, a state public health official.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, about 50 physicians in the state's 19 health
districts report their flu case loads each week. When a physician
in the survey reports that more than 3 percent of patients have
flulike symptoms, public health workers assume the flu is a
``regional'' problem in the state. When more than 50 percent of the
physicians report the same information, the flu is considered to be
``widespread,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   In the states hardest hit, patients have been forced to wait in
halls and on gurneys in backed-up emergency departments. In some
cases, hospitals diverted patients while they struggled to add
extra staff. Those states include Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Actual numbers of flu cases are not available, state and federal
officials said. And although some hospital emergency rooms
experienced a spike in visits over the New Year's weekend _ when
doctors' offices were closed _ the crush of patients eased when
doctors reopened offices this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experiencing a heavier load'' of patients than on a
typical day, said Dr. Stanley Mogelnicki Jr., an internist with
WellStar Towne Lake Medical Center in Woodstock, Ga., ``but that's
not out of the ordinary for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said about 10 percent of his patients have come in with
flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC reported that 6 percent of overall patient doctor visits
in the nation were attributed to flulike symptoms, ranging from 4
percent of cases in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions and 15
percent in the West South Central region.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts note flu shots, which take about two weeks to be
effective, could still protect residents from the height of flu
season, expected to arrive here within three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And despite some media reports that claimed the flu shot was
ineffective against this year's strains, the CDC said that the
vaccine does offer protection. Patients also have a choice of new
anti-viral medications, including Tamiflu and Relenza released last
year, that can lessen symptoms if taken within 48 hours of the
flu's onset. Annually, up to 40 million Americans get the flu, with
about 300,000 hospitalized. Between 20,000 and 40,000 die from flu
and its complications.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writer Diane Stepp and the Associated Press contributed to
this report.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT INFLUENZA
</P>
<P>
   _ This year's dominant flu virus originated in 1997 and has
caused flu for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has been 25 years since a virus of this type returned for
even a second year.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CAUSES IT
</P>
<P>
   - Influenza, commonly called flu, is caused by viruses that
infect the respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
   FLU SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Three times as many people got flu shots this year as did so
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ The vaccine normally would be effective against a returning
virus, but flu deaths have increased this winter.
</P>
<P>
   WORST CASES
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1918, the Spanish flu caused the highest known
influenza-related mortality: Approximately 500,000 deaths occurred
in the United States.

ILLEGAL RUDDER MAY DOCK STARS &AMP; STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The high-flying Team Dennis Conner, with
its threadbare budget and a bunch of wise old grey heads calling
shots from the cockpit of Stars &AMP; Stripes, may have outsmarted
themselves this time. Or merely blundered.
</P>
<P>
   Having amassed the only undefeated record (3-0) after three
races in the challenger semifinals here, Stars &AMP; Stripes may get
tossed out of the regatta for breaching protocol, which is a nice
way of saying cheating.
</P>
<P>
   An international arbitration panel will decide Saturday whether
to dock Stars &AMP; Stripes one or more points. Or the panel could
remove the San Diego entry altogether. The crime is violating a
protocol requiring a boat's appendages (keels, rudders, wings,
etc.) be manufactured either in the competitor's country of origin
(in this case, the United States) or in New Zealand. The Stars &AMP;
Stripes beat Nippon in the series opener using a rudder
manufactured in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, while Team Dennis Conner was sitting on its 3-0
lead, it was notified that Nippon had issued a protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a race jury found Nippon's charge to be true: ``The
raw materials used to manufacture the rudder were sourced from the
USA and shipped to Australia where they were then formed, shaped,
and moulded and assembled into a rudder by the Australian
manufacturer,'' read the jury decision. ``The completed unit was
then shipped to Stars &AMP; Stripes in New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   The rudder was only used in the first race before it was
replaced. Stars &AMP; Stripes believed the rudder was in compliance
with what in called a ``very complicated rule.''
</P>
<P>
   If the two international panels rule Stars &AMP; Stripes has
violated the protocol, they could assess a lesser penalty, such as
the deduction of a point.
</P>
<P>
   But that still leaves a potential problem should Stars &AMP; Stripes
win the semifinals (and the Louis Vuitton Cup) to earn the right to
challenge New Zealand for the America's Cup next month.
</P>
<P>
   Under Article 8 of the Cup Protocol, the winning challenger must
be able to declare that it has ``complied with all aspects of the
conditions of Race, the Protocol, the Deed of Gift, the
Interpretive Resolutions, and the decisions of the America's Cup
Arbitration Panel.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, should Stars &AMP; Stripes win the semifinals and then be
ruled ineligible, the second-place boat _ the loser of the Vuitton
two-boat finals _ would get to race New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as this scenario may be, any ruling against Stars &AMP;
Stripes would make them vunerable to the eligibility issue.
</P>
<P>
   The nationality issue was most hotly contested in 1983 when
Australia II beat Conner's Liberty in Newport, R.I. The Australian
boat was fitted with a revolutionary winged keel that the New York
Yacht Club charged was designed in part by Dutch engineers in
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that contentious summer, New York tried to prove the
Australian-Dutch connection. Just days before the match, the NYYC
race committee considered withdrawing from the match. After a close
vote, the match went on, and Australia won the Cup.

BRUINS' FOUNDATION HAS CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ After the Bruins' appalling loss to the
Carolina Hurricanes Thursday night, right wing Joe Murphy walked
through the locker room, stopped momentarily, and rolled his eyes
in a manner that conveyed a perfect blend of exasperation,
embarrassment, and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are in disarray and they continue to get worse, not
better. They host the New York Islanders Saturday night to start
the second half of the season, and with only one win in their last
nine games and three victories in their last 18, the second 41
games had better be a whole lot better than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns has been trying to get the newest members of his
club to play the system that has made it successful the last two
seasons. That endeavor has been met with mixed results. Some
players follow it, others haven't mastered it, and others have
simply ignored it. Getting everyone on the same page has been a
significant challenge for Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a certain amount of guys pulling one way and a certain
amount of guys pulling the other way,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Jacques Laperriere had a parallel view of
things. He said there were three kinds of hockey players _ those
who made things happen, those who watched what happened, and those
who wondered what happened. On Thursday night, there were far too
many of the latter, not to mention the arena full of fans who were
tearing their hair out.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Burns spray-painted the defensive zone at the Ristuccia
Center, dividing it into four parts. The point? A back-to-basics
look at defensive responsibility. No running around, no leaving
your coverage area unless you're the designated support man, no
massive chaos as witnessed recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our zone play has been a problem,'' said Burns. ``In years
past, we took pride in not caring who scored a goal. All we cared
about was winning the game and keeping the goals-against down and
being in every game, fighting hard every game. There's a certain
way this team plays and a certain way we've had success. What we
have to do is get the individuals who weren't here into that
program. Some players have played on different teams with different
styles but they can't bring that into here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change the way a team plays overnight and feel that
`Well, this is an easier way.' Right now, players are finding a way
not to work. We're (trying to find) an easier way to do it and
there's not really an easier way. There is a work ethic that still
has to be there no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is also concerned that some players have more pressing
issues on their minds than the team's success. There's the issue of
individual bonuses, which tend to be divisive. There's the issue of
ice time, and some players thinking they should get more. There are
some players who would prefer to play more wide open. The coach
said he's determined to start from Square One and get his club to
focus on what's important _ winning. If they do that, he contends,
all the other stuff will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to at least pledge allegiance to the jersey and to
the fans,'' said Burns. ``You have to at least do that no matter
what system you play, who you're playing for, and whether you like
it or not. That's what we have to get back on board now. I'd
certainly hate to see a player leave a hockey game and feel good
about himself because they scored one goal yet we lost, 7-3. I
certainly have a problem with that. That's a domino effect. We're
playing with guys who can't get down low and do their jobs. Jason
Allison can't get down low and be the defensive guy he can because
of his wrist, so we have (Anson) Carter having to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Joe (Thornton) is creating a problem, too, that he won't
go down there and do it now because he feels like maybe he's saving
energy out there. When you have 11 returning players (not including
the goalies) in the game and the other guys have no clue what went
on here before, it's a bit different. We have to get these guys on
board. It's going to be for the good of the team.''

THE HIGHWAY TO SUCCESS LEADS A COACH ASTRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mike Nolan, the defensive coordinator of the Washington
Redskins, held the same position with the Giants from 1993-96, some
people in the team's front office thought that one day Nolan would
be a head coach. A few other teams felt the same way. Nolan
appeared to be on the fast track for stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dan Reeves was fired as the Giants' head coach, and instead
of waiting to see if Reeves would catch on elsewhere, Nolan took
the sure thing; he went to Washington as an assistant under Coach
Norv Turner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decision that Nolan may regret. If he had waited and
gone to the Atlanta Falcons with Reeves, Nolan would have coached
in a Super Bowl, and his job would now be secure. He would not be
waiting for his fate to be decided by ownership the way it is in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, if Nolan's defense, which has struggled in his
tenure as the defensive coordinator with the Redskins, does not
perform well in the postseason, Nolan will most likely be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins play their first-round National Football Conference
playoff game against Detroit at home Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington is to beat the Lions, the defense must play better
than when the two teams met in Detroit earlier this season and the
Redskins lost, 33-17. That snapped Washington's 18-0 winning streak
_ including two playoff games _ against Detroit. But still hanging
over Detroit is the fact that the Lions are 0-17 on the road
against the Redskins since the franchise moved to Washington in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan told reporters this week that he was not concerned about
his status and that his only job was to help the team win. ``That's
all I'm thinking about now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are one of the most intriguing teams in the
playoffs. Every step of the way, the owner Daniel Snyder hovers
over the franchise. No one has felt Snyder's heat more than Nolan
and his defense. At least once Snyder has called for Nolan to be
fired, with Turner intervening to save Nolan's job.
</P>
<P>
   Washington finished the regular season with the NFL's
30th-ranked defense, ahead of only the expansion Cleveland Browns.
Washington gave up 27.8 points, 402.3 total yards and 127.4 yards
rushing a game through its first eight games. The team improved in
its last eight, giving up 19.4 points, 310.9 total yards and 119.3
yards on the ground a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a fine defense,'' Coach Bobby Ross of the
Lions said.
</P>
<P>
   What Ross truly has to worry about is Washington's offense. The
Redskins scored 443 points this season, second only to St. Louis,
which scored 526. This was the team that scored 50 points against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   So Detroit, to have a chance, must score at least three
touchdowns, and that will only keep the Lions close to the
Redskins. What will make that harder for Detroit is the return of
Redskins runner Stephen Davis, who missed the final two
regular-season games with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is listed as probable but will start the game even
though he will not be 100 percent, rushed for 1,405 yards and 17
touchdowns during the season.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for the Redskins and a good performance by the defense
means Nolan, as well as the rest of the defensive staff, will
probably return. But more important, a victory puts Washington a
step closer to the Super Bowl.

BODY OF GIRL WHO DISAPPEARED IN 1986 IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ The mystery of Michele Dorr's disappearance
from her father's back yard in 1986 finally yielded to persistent
police work Thursday night when detectives unearthed the 6-year-old
girl's skeleton near a playground beside a highway here.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not say who led them to the grave, but people who
have followed the case assume it was Haddon Irving Clark, the
43-year-old handyman and drifter who was convicted of second-degree
murder in the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners in Baltimore confirmed late Friday that the
bones were Michele's. The pink ruffled bathing suit with white
polka dots she was wearing when she disappeared _ a detail repeated
over the years of unrelenting local coverage of the case _ was
found with the bones. The towel she was carrying when her father,
Carl Dorr, last saw her skip out the door on her way to a backyard
wading pool was not found, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Edward Tarney, who had worked on the case from the
beginning, could only shake his head in relief Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all lived with this case,'' Tarney said Friday
afternoon. ``We all have kids, and it's just something you live
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorr could not be reached Friday, but late Thursday night he
came out of his modest home in Kensington to tell reporters that
the news had come as a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have the chance to bury Michele and have a
funeral for her, which we haven't been able to do for so long,''
Dorr said. ``I still miss Michele to this day and I will continue
to miss her, but at least I'll have somewhere to say good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Michelle disappeared on May 31, 1986, the case
gripped the Washington area _ not only because a little girl had
been stolen from the presumed safety of her home, but also because
of the bizarre and often heartbreaking detours the investigation
took.
</P>
<P>
   Michele's parents were going through a harsh divorce proceeding
at the time. Dorr was an early suspect, particularly when his
estranged wife, upon hearing that her daughter had disappeared
while visiting Dorr, had blurted out, ``Carl did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure of the divorce and of his daughter's
disappearance, Dorr at one point confessed to her murder, but later
recanted. At another point he declared he was Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1993 murder of Laura Houghteling, 23, produced a break
in the case. Clark, who had done work around the house for Ms.
Houghteling's mother, confessed to the murder, and eventually led
police to Ms. Houghteling's grave near Interstate 270, north of
Washington. He was sentenced to 30 years in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   After the police had Clark in custody for the Houghteling
murder, they learned that he had lived two doors down from Dorr at
the time of Michele's disappearance, and he was charged in that
murder as well. The trial in the Dorr case turned on extensive
physical and circumstantial evidence, including testimony from a
cellmate that Clark had confessed to the killing. Clark was
convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison last October. The
police believe he stabbed Michele to death.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, residents of the Paint Branch development took awkward
strolls to the forested playground along the northbound lane of
Route 29 where Michele's body was unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Andy Blanc, 15, who lives nearby. ``I've
been living here for three years and we play basketball down here _
I've been stepping on her grave all this time, and it's just scary
to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clark was the one who led police to Michele's body, it is not
known why he waited so long to do it. Clark is appealing his
conviction in the Dorr murder and the police have speculated that
he may have hoped for a break by cooperating with investigators.
Clark also says he has found religion in state prison in
Hagerstown, and he has been seen on television newscasts singing
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr, who said he never doubted that Clark was his daughter's
killer, reacted caustically to the idea that prison might have
changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he has developed some kind of conscience,'' Dorr
said in a television interview Friday. ``It is very difficult for
me to see him on video singing Sunday school rhymes about Jesus
making him the man that he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tarney, the final chapter in the murder of Michele Dorr will
mean a little more time at home and a little less time working the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all spent a lot of time away from home while this was
going on,'' he said, ``but that's why we're here.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York
Times who extended the possibilities of the conventional obituary
form, shaking the dust from one of the most neglected areas of
daily journalism, died on Thursday at his family's summer home in
Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 60 and also had a home in Manhattan.
The cause was abdominal cancer, said his wife, Joan.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas began writing obituaries full time in 1995 after serving
as a police reporter, a rewrite man, a society news reporter and a
sports writer. He developed a fresh approach to the genre, looking
for telling details to illuminate lives that might otherwise have
been overlooked or underreported.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas saw himself as the sympathetic stranger at the wake
listening to the friends and survivors of the deceased, alert for
the moment when one of them would tell a memorable tale that could
never have made its way into Who's Who or a resume but that just
happened to define a life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when The New York Times proposed him for a Pulitzer
Prize in the category of spot news, the nomination began: ``Every
week, readers write to The New York Times to say they were moved to
tears or laughter by an obituary of someone they hadn't known until
that morning's paper. Invariably, the obituary is the work of
Robert McG. Thomas Jr., who hadn't known the subject, either, until
the assignment landed on his desk a few hours before deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery of portraits that Thomas compiled covered an
impressive range. Among them were Howard C. Fox, ``the Chicago
clothier and sometime big-band trumpeter who claimed credit for
creating and naming the zoot suit with the reet pleat, the reave
sleeve, the ripe stripe, the stuff cuff and the drape shape that
was the stage rage during the boogie-woogie rhyme time of the early
1940s,'' and Russell Colley, a mechanical engineer who became ``the
Calvin Klein of space'' and was known to a generation of astronauts
as the ``father of the space suit.''
</P>
<P>
   There were Rose Hamburger, a 105-year-old racing handicapper;
Marion Tinsley, a checker champion unbeaten by man or machine, and
a vivacious woman who started out as a showgirl and ended up a
princess (Honeychile Wilder is dead, and if the `21' Club is not in
actual mourning, the venerable former speakeasy on West 52nd Street
was closed for vacation last week when word got around that one of
its most memorable former patrons had died on Aug. 11 at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center'').
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a tall man with wavy hair who spoke in a voice soft with
traces of his native Tennessee, was an extremely gregarious and
social man. Last week he officiated at the annual New Year's Eve
party he first started giving at the family home in Shelbyville 32
years ago. About 5 percent of the town's 12,000 people attended,
and Thomas, wearing a blue silk shirt with embroidered sun and moon
that he bought for the occasion, cheered his guests and the new
century. As in past years, he expressed hopes that the fireworks he
had ordered would not set fire to the Presbyterian church across
the road.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   He was fond of writing about people who became legendary as a
result of a single exploit, like Douglas Corrigan, who took off
from New York in a tiny overloaded plane bound for California (he
said) in 1938 and landed in Dublin some 28 hours later. He became
an instant hero, forever to be known as Wrong Way Corrigan, but in
his obituary, Thomas went beyond recapitulation to suggest that
Corrigan was more cunning than befuddled. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he continued to claim with a more or less straight
face that he had simply made a wrong turn and been led astray by a
faulty compass, the story was far from convincing, especially to
the American aviation authorities who had rejected his repeated
requests to make just such a flight because his modified 1929
Curtiss-Robin monoplane was judged unworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, he wrote of Johnny Sylvester, who died in
1990, 64 years after he came to fame as a bedridden boy who
inspired Babe Ruth. Here is how Thomas began his obituary, which
was included in ``The Last Word: The New York Times Book of
Obituaries and Farewells'' (William Morrow): ``There are those who
will tell you that little Johnny Sylvester was never that sick and
certainly not dying. They will tell you that Babe Ruth never
promised to hit a home run for him in Game 4 of the 1926 World
Series, and that the three home runs that the Babe did hit in that
game in no way saved the 11-year-old youngster's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any representations to the contrary, these people will tell
you, were simply embellishments of a trivial incident by an
oversentimental press in a hypersentimental age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such people are known as cynics.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something mythic, too, about Sylvia Weinberger, Thomas
wrote, ``who used a sprinkling of matzoh meal, a pinch of salt and
a dollop of schmaltzmanship to turn chopped liver into a commercial
success.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert McGill Thomas Jr. was born and grew up in Shelbyville,
Tenn., where chopped liver is rare and schmaltz is not part of the
vernacular. He spent his 15th year cheering for a distant relative,
Sen. Estes Kefauver, as Kefauver ran for vice president on the
Democratic ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson. Three years later,
Thomas went to Yale, where he worked on the student newspaper and
flunked out as a result of a decision, he said, ``to major in New
York rather than anything academic.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining The Times as a copyboy in 1959, Thomas spent the
next four decades in a variety of reporting assignments, often
prowling police stations and working the phones in the late hours
to produce fast-breaking stories. With his fondness for anomalies,
Thomas might have described his own journalistic career as more
circuitous than meteoric.
</P>
<P>
   Always regarded as a stylish writer by his colleagues, he
sometimes ran into career turbulence because of an acknowledged
tendency to carry things like sentences, paragraphs, ideas and
enthusiasms further than at least some editors preferred. He went
beyond acknowledging this trait to defending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I go too far,'' he used to say. ``But unless you go
too far, how are you ever going to find out how far you can go?''
</P>
<P>
   All of this may explain the sympathy he showed in his obituaries
of underachievers and late bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly no sense of superiority in his account of
the life choice made by Steven Slepack, a man who gave up a
promising career in marine biology to become Professor Bendeasy,
``the man in the beribboned tuxedo jacket who delighted a
generation of schoolchildren by twisting balloons into animals in
Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a character actor named Jack Weston as ``the
quintessential New Yorker, which is to say he was born in Cleveland
and lived in Los Angeles for 18 years, hating every minute of it he
wasn't actually in front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing about Anton Rosenberg, a painter and jazz musician,
Thomas said he ``embodied the Greenwich Village hipster ideal of
1950s cool to such a laid-back degree and with such determined
detachment that he never amounted to much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For some admirers, for whom Thomas' work came to be known as
``McG's,'' a favorite was his obituary of Edward Lowe, which
revealed how Lowe, a sawdust merchant from Cassopolis, Mich., found
a new use for some kiln-dried granulated clay he had been selling
as a sop for grease spills in industrial plants and created a
million-dollar market for the product he named and marketed as
Kitty Litter.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas provided the antecedent action to the tale in a second
paragraph that established the historical significance of Lowe's
achievement: ``Cats have been domesticated since ancient Egypt, but
until a fateful January day in 1947, those who kept them indoors
full time paid a heavy price. For all their vaunted obsession with
paw-licking cleanliness, cats, whose constitutions were adapted for
arid desert climes, make such an efficient use of water that they
produce a highly concentrated urine that is one of the most noxious
effluences of the animal kingdom. Boxes filled with sand, sawdust
or wood shavings provided a measure of relief from the resulting
stench, but not enough to make cats particularly welcome in
discriminating homes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his admirers was Joseph Epstein, the literary essayist.
``I have noted an interesting general-assignment obituary writer
with the somewhat overloaded name of Robert McG. Thomas Jr., who
occasionally gets beyond the facts and the rigid formula of the
obit to touch on _ of all things to find in The New York Times _ a
deeper truth,'' Epstein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus Thomas on one Fred Rosenstiel, `who spent his life
planting gardens to brighten the lives of his fellow New Yorkers,
and to alleviate an abiding sadness in his heart. ... .' The
sadness, we learn later in the obituary, derived from Mr.
Rosenstiel's inability to `forgive himself for surviving the
Holocaust.' A fine touch.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Thomas is survived by their twin sons,
Andrew, of Lewes, Del., and David, of Manhattan; a sister, Carey
Gates Thomas Hines, of Birmingham, Ala.; and two grandchildren.

 &HT;    Keeping close tabs on the flu
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flu has pummeled more than a dozen Northeast and
Western states, but it has made a timid entry into Georgia so far,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Although metro Atlanta doctors have fielded many patient
complaints of cold- and flulike symptoms, CDC officials say this
season's flu bug has not been more severe or widespread than in
past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influenza activity is picking up across the country, but this
is nothing unusual for this time of year,'' said Thomas W. Skinner,
the federal agency's spokesman. ``Some areas might have been hit
harder than others, but that, too, is not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states reported the flu was widespread, and 22 states
reported it was a regional problem, meaning doctors are seeing more
than just a few, sporadic cases in certain areas. In other states,
flu cases are sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really been in the flu season for only about two
weeks,'' said Dr. Kathryn Arnold, a state public health official.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, about 50 physicians in the state's 19 health
districts report their flu case loads each week. When a physician
in the survey reports that more than 3 percent of patients have
flulike symptoms, public health workers assume the flu is a
``regional'' problem in the state. When more than 50 percent of the
physicians report the same information, the flu is considered to be
``widespread,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   In the states hardest hit, patients have been forced to wait in
halls and on gurneys in backed-up emergency departments. In some
cases, hospitals diverted patients while they struggled to add
extra staff. Those states include Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Actual numbers of flu cases are not available, state and federal
officials said. And although some hospital emergency rooms
experienced a spike in visits over the New Year's weekend _ when
doctors' offices were closed _ the crush of patients eased when
doctors reopened offices this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experiencing a heavier load'' of patients than on a
typical day, said Dr. Stanley Mogelnicki Jr., an internist with
WellStar Towne Lake Medical Center in Woodstock, Ga., ``but that's
not out of the ordinary for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said about 10 percent of his patients have come in with
flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC reported that 6 percent of overall patient doctor visits
in the nation were attributed to flulike symptoms, ranging from 4
percent of cases in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions and 15
percent in the West South Central region.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts note flu shots, which take about two weeks to be
effective, could still protect residents from the height of flu
season, expected to arrive here within three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And despite some media reports that claimed the flu shot was
ineffective against this year's strains, the CDC said that the
vaccine does offer protection. Patients also have a choice of new
anti-viral medications, including Tamiflu and Relenza released last
year, that can lessen symptoms if taken within 48 hours of the
flu's onset. Annually, up to 40 million Americans get the flu, with
about 300,000 hospitalized. Between 20,000 and 40,000 die from flu
and its complications.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writer Diane Stepp and the Associated Press contributed to
this report.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT INFLUENZA
</P>
<P>
   _ This year's dominant flu virus originated in 1997 and has
caused flu for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has been 25 years since a virus of this type returned for
even a second year.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CAUSES IT
</P>
<P>
   - Influenza, commonly called flu, is caused by viruses that
infect the respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
   FLU SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Three times as many people got flu shots this year as did so
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ The vaccine normally would be effective against a returning
virus, but flu deaths have increased this winter.
</P>
<P>
   WORST CASES
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1918, the Spanish flu caused the highest known
influenza-related mortality: Approximately 500,000 deaths occurred
in the United States.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He played often, and he played big, shelling out as
much as $100 a week. Still, Johnnie Ely could not believe that he,
an ordinary 66-year-old cook from the South Bronx, had won the New
York State Lottery's biggest prize ever.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lottery drawing for New York Millennium Millions
was held on New Year's Eve, Ely did not claim his bonanza until
four days later. ``On my way to work on Sunday, I walked by where I
bought my tickets and saw the sign: `We sold the $100 million
ticket,' but it just didn't click,'' Ely said Friday. ``On Monday,
I heard on the radio that the winner still hadn't claimed the
prize. My tickets had been sitting on my kitchen table since Friday
and I thought that maybe I should check them.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, but still could not believe what was staring him in the
face like a hungry hound. So he called his son, who verified that
his father's numbers _ 8, 23, 38, 39, 46, and 14 _ matched the
winning numbers. ``Next thing I did was a big mistake,'' Ely said,
flatly. ``I called my wife in and the first thing she asked was,
`Can I retire?'''
</P>
<P>
   He told his wife, Rosemary, a nurse to whom he has been married
for 35 years, to clean out her locker.
</P>
<P>
   Without pomp and circumstance, Ely, who had been a cook for 20
years, quit his own job Wednesday. He had the perfect setup: The
previous week, his co-workers at the Java Shop, a restaurant in
midtown Manhattan, had taken up a collection for a lottery pool. On
Wednesday, their manager, Winston Willer, told the workers that he
needed to check the tickets they had bought because the winning
ticket had been purchased at Garden Check Cashing Service at 250
West 49th St., down the street from the Java Shop, which is at 49th
and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ely said, `You don't have to check the tickets,''' Willer
recalled. ``He said, `I have the winning one.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me the evidence _ Xerox copies of the winning
ticket. Then he said, `Can I have some time off?' I have to take
care of some business. He didn't finish his shift and he never
returned.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his erstwhile co-workers, Gil Vidal, 62, wished Ely well.
``He's lucky,'' Vidal said. ``We work hard. It's pretty hot in this
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ely chose to take his winnings in a lump sum _ $44,371,562 _ in
lieu of payments over the years that would have equaled $100
million. His take-home prize will be $27 million after taxes, and
he will get it in about two weeks, said New York Lottery Director
Margaret DeFrancisco. The next-richest lottery winner was John
Falcon, a Manhattan resident who presented a $45-million ticket in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Ely has always had luck with the lottery, winning $1,300 three
or four times and $500 four or five times. He always lets the
computer choose his numbers, he said, because he has had no luck
picking his own.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a throng of reporters and cameras at Tavern on the Green,
Ely, who has three grown children, said the first thing he would do
with his windfall was buy a copy of The Daily News. ``I'm not going
to switch to The Times,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also planned to help finance the college education of
his nieces and nephews. Describing himself as a religious man ``but
not a fanatic,'' he said he would pray for continued good health.
</P>
<P>
   Ely, who appears to be two decades younger than 66, added that
he would continue to ``play Lotto and boogie down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other plans include buying some property and pursuing avocations
like reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors near Ely's co-op apartment in the Bronx, which costs
him $569.70 a month, said they were pleased for Ely, who can
frequently be seen in a black leather jacket and a black cap. ``I'm
very happy that somebody I know won,'' said Adolphus Braithwaite,
65, a retired detective. ``Although, of course, I'm sorry that it's
not me.''

JETS SIT IN LIMBO, BUT THOUGHTS FLY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The unsettling situation revolving around the Jets _
a team currently without an owner or a head coach _ moved into its
fourth day Friday with no resolution in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was one more bit of potentially disheartening
news for Jets fans. Mo Carthon, the team's running backs coach,
will be interviewed by the Cleveland Browns for the offensive
coordinator's post.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier it was learned that Romeo Crennel, the Jets'
defensive line coach, would be traveling to Cleveland to interview
for the defensive coordinator's job.
</P>
<P>
   Both Crennel and Carthon are part of a cohesive group of
assistants loyal to Bill Parcells, and the danger that they could
fragment during the current void has to be at least a little
worrisome to the Jets' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who still remains the Jets' director of football
operations after resigning as coach on Monday, stated this week
that he would not start the search for another coach until a new
owner stepped in. But that could happen early next week. And if it
does, there will most likely be a brief period before Parcells
names the man to succeed him _ unless, of course, he is persuaded
to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of this is a short period of limbo,'' Charlie
Weis, the Jets' offensive coordinator, said Friday. ``This will get
settled. Bill will straighten this out right away.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear at this point is this: The most seamless move
Parcells can make is to promote an assistant coach or take over the
team himself. If Parcells taps an assistant, it appears the
front-runner for the head coach's post may now be Al Groh, the
linebackers coach who was also Parcells' defensive coordinator for
four years in New England.
</P>
<P>
   While Dan Henning, the quarterbacks coach, is the only current
Jet assistant with experience as an NFL head coach and is a
respected teacher of signal callers, his losing record as the head
coach of the Atlanta Falcons and the San Diego Chargers might make
it difficult for Parcells to sell him to the new owner, or to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells picks from within, his chances of keeping his
assistants relatively intact will obviously improve. But at the
same time, the coaching staff is not the only matter of concern for
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The team is about $10 million over the salary cap and obviously
has some serious restructuring to do. At least one starter,
cornerback Marcus Coleman, who is a free agent, said that with the
unsettled situation he will now wait for the free-agency period to
begin rather than re-sign immediately. The Jets have offered him a
three-year deal worth about $4 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' other heralded free agent, linebacker Mo Lewis, has
listened to his team's offer, which includes a $6 million signing
bonus. But two agents contacted Friday said they believed Lewis
would probably be moving on to another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets may get one break this year. Free agency is scheduled
to begin in mid-February, but the league is negotiating with the
players association to push it back to early March. If that
happens, as appears likely, then Parcells, in his role as
operations chief, will have that much more time to assess his own
players as well as those he may attempt to bring in.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, it remains an iffy time for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one well-known agent, Brian Levy, who represents four
Jets, said the free-agency market for the team has changed because
of all the unknown factors.
</P>
<P>
   As for players re-signing with the Jets, Levy said, ``Obviously,
any type of uncertainty when you're trying to sell a team to a free
agent causes players to wonder about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he had not spoken with the Jets about one of his
players, Bobby Hamilton, the defensive end who will be a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if that isn't an aftereffect of what's going on,''
Levy said. ``I think that other teams will snipe at their free
agents before the situation is settled. If you don't know who the
coach is, do you want to play for them?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells is almost certain to have a head coach in place
by the time free agency really heats up.
   Bill Belichick _ the man who stepped down as the Jets' new coach
on Tuesday after only one day on the job and set off much of the
week's mayhem _ continued to keep a low profile Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend of Belichick's, Rob Ingraham, acting as his
spokesman, said Friday that Belichick would not be making any
statement on his attorney's advice, since a grievance against the
league has now been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, received the grievance on
Thursday. It asked that Belichick _ who had been the Jets'
defensive coordinator before being promoted to coach to succeed
Parcells _ be freed from his Jets' contract ``so that he can make a
living in the NFL.'' The league said Friday that there had been no
further communication regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets will have to respond to the letter by Monday. The
New England Patriots, who had requested permission to speak to
Belichick about becoming their coach and general manager, have not
had further dealings with the league.
</P>
<P>
   But it would not surprise anyone in football if the matter was
quickly dealt with, and that ultimately Belichick would become the
man in charge of the Patriots in exchange for one or more draft
choices yielded to the Jets by New England.

<P>
   The telephone rings. Your broker is on the line. He has a
suggestion: Move some of the extra cash in your account into a
mutual fund managed by his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Through last November, the big five retail brokerage firms _
PaineWebber, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Salomon Smith Barney,
Prudential and Merrill Lynch _ posted three-year cumulative returns
for their diversified domestic stock funds that were 7.3 percent to
26.3 percent lower than the industry average. One-year returns also
lagged behind, by 1.8 percent to 7.9 percent, according to Kanon
Bloch Carre, a Boston consulting firm that compiled its rankings
through asset-weighting _ giving large funds more weight than
smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   For all international funds, the relative performances of the
same five brokerage firms were even poorer. Weighted by assets, the
cumulative returns of their international offerings trailed the
industry average by more than 20 percent over the three years,
Kanon Bloch found, and by 2.5 percent to 21 percent over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The big brokerage firms have ``fumbled the  mutual
funds,'' said John Rekenthaler, research director at Morningstar
Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. ``They took their
position for granted,'' he added, ``and they lacked the hunger that
a lot of other mutual fund companies have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are some flowers amid the weeds. The Merrill
Lynch Pacific fund, for example, has been the top fund in its
category over the last decade, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, brokerage firms' funds have not been known for
standout performance. And since the bull market shifted into
overdrive in the mid-1990s, the relative overall record of the
brokerage funds has been downright dismal. Many investors who
bought in-house funds have paid a steep price in lost
opportunities, as many other broker-sold funds _ including those of
Alliance Capital, MFS Investments and AIM _ have outpaced their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   But investors seem to be waking up. Or perhaps some brokers are
splashing some cool water on their clients' faces. Whatever the
case, investors are yanking assets out of brokerage-managed funds.
The top five retail brokerage firms, which started 1999 with a
combined $240 billion in long-term assets in their funds, had
combined estimated outflows of more than $13 billion through
November, according to the Financial Research Corp., an industry
researcher in Boston. In the previous decade, combined flows had
never been negative, and as recently as 1993 the five firms enjoyed
$30 billion in inflows.
</P>
<P>
   The outflows, poor performance and new competition from index
funds and others have had a big effect on market share: Brokerage
firms now have 10 percent of all mutual fund assets, down from 19
percent a decade ago, according to Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance has been humiliating for some large firms
at a time when the fortunes of so many fund groups have soared.
</P>
<P>
   In-house funds are ``almost a trademark or signature product
within a company,'' said Raymond A. Mason, known as Chip, chief
executive of Legg Mason, a regional brokerage firm in Baltimore
whose largest fund, Legg Mason Value Trust, has beaten the S&AMP;P 500
stock index for nine consecutive years. ``It often ends up a
reflection of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some big brokerage firms _ which look to money
management as a more stable and reliable source of profits than
investment banking or stock-trading commissions _ are scrambling to
revamp their ailing fund businesses and to improve their funds'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether those efforts will pay off, or
whether investors shouldn't continue to be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who buy through a broker or other intermediary
generally pay a load of 4 percent to 6 percent of the purchase
price, which compensates the broker for time and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Although many investors now invest only in no-load funds, more
rely on brokers for advice and hand-holding and thus still own load
funds. But how does a broker decide what to recommend to a client?
Apparently, that depends on where the broker works, as some
brokerage firms have had far greater success than others in selling
in-house funds.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulli Associates, a research group in Boston, estimates that
80 percent of the money invested in funds by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter's customers goes into the firm's own funds. That compares
with 45 percent at Merrill; 35 percent at Salomon Smith Barney, a
unit of Citigroup; 25 percent at Prudential; and 10 percent at
PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Selling such funds raises the potential for a conflict between a
broker's desire to make money for the firm and his duty to steer
clients into the most suitable investments.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has discouraged brokerage firms from using higher
payouts or other incentives to push proprietary funds over outside
funds. A panel he appointed, led by Daniel P. Tully, the former
chairman of Merrill Lynch, reported in 1995 that some firms still
paid brokers more for selling proprietary products, and it urged
the firms to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say such differentiated payouts have stopped
at almost all _ if not all _ large firms, and the regulatory unit
of the National Association of Securities Dealers is weighing a
rule prohibiting higher payouts for proprietary sales.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, however, that incentives to sell in-house
funds have vanished. Some industry executives say in-house fund
sales at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lead to higher compensation for
branch managers at the firm _ giving brokers who want to win favor
with the boss an incentive to push proprietary funds.
</P>
<P>
   A Morgan Stanley executive declined to say whether branch
manager compensation was affected by the level of proprietary fund
sales. Officials at Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney said
their compensation of branch managers was not affected by
proprietary sales. PaineWebber and Prudential officials declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the performance of Merrill
Lynch's funds, a spokeswoman, Christine Walton, said that ``changes
in Merrill Lynch's asset management group in the past year have
sharpened our focus'' on earning high returns. Results are already
apparent, she said, noting that the Merrill Lynch Growth fund fell
by 24 percent in 1998 but returned 26 percent last year, following
a manager change.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney officials, in response tame
questions, said their stock funds took in close to $1 billion in
new money this year, although investor withdrawals from bond funds
meant that overall flows were slightly negative. But they disputed
Financial Research's methodology in calculating the firm's flows.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Morgan Stanley said they had positive cash flows
in each of the last few years, which they attributed to what they
called their funds' solid and steady performance. They said many of
their funds received four or five stars _ the two highest rankings
_ from Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential is expected to introduce funds this year that will
bring a broader range of styles and market capitalizations to its
lineup. ``During the past year, Prudential has integrated all of
its asset management expertise into one group,'' said Timothy
Biggs, a spokesman. ``We are now bringing the strength of that
organization to bear on our mutual fund offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber executives declined to discuss their funds'
investment performance or cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, means that your broker is doing
anything wrong if he recommends investing in in-house funds. Some
of those funds have strong records. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's
Small Cap Growth fund B shares, for example, soared 41.1 percent,
annualized, over the five years through Dec. 31, putting it near
the very top of its peer group, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   But the discrepancy between the performance of such standouts
and most other broker-managed funds is eye-opening. According to
Kanon Bloch, the diversified domestic equity funds managed by the
five large brokerage firms had cumulative asset-weighted returns
for the three years ended in November of 51.3 percent to 70.3
percent _ all below the industry average of 77.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For international funds _ including stock and bond funds _ the
five returned 24.4 percent to 39.9 percent over the three years,
not even close to the industry average of 60.7 percent, according
to Kanon Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   In its calculations, Kanon Bloch used Merrill Lynch's ``B''
class of fund shares _ which have the most assets but also higher
expense ratios than other classes, thus reducing returns somewhat.
Calculations for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter do not include results
from two fund families it acquired _ Miller Anderson &AMP; Sherrerd,
whose funds go by the name MAS, acquired in 1995, and Van Kampen
Investments, added in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Including those results, the firm's diversified domestic equity
funds had a 77.3 percent cumulative three-year return, just under
the industry average, and its international funds returned 38.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for big firms' overall lackluster returns? A
good deal of it stems from the brokerage funds' conservative bent
and their emphasis on the value style of investing during a period
in which large-cap growth stocks and highflying technology shares
have dominated the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the particular _ some would say peculiar _ nature of the
brokerage firm fund business has clearly added to the problems,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, fund performance was not crucial to the success of
an asset management unit. ``The idea was to let the outside funds
be spectacular, because when they go up, they attract money, and
when they go down, that gives a chance for the representative to
move the money out'' into one of the firm's own funds, said A.
Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., the research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Because the firms' mutual fund units have what the industry
calls ``captive'' shareholders for their funds, drumming up
enthusiasm in the sales force has been more important than
performance in attracting assets. For years, a number of securities
firms even paid brokers extra-large commissions for selling
in-house funds.
</P>
<P>
   But as pressure from regulators _ in the wake of what became
known as the Tully Report _ led firms to quit favoring in-house
funds, and as investors have gotten easier access to performance
data, brokers and investors alike have become quicker to sell
shares of any underperformer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, every brokerage firm's fund family is just a part of a
larger financial-services company, where most of the attention
traditionally has been on retail brokerage, investment banking or
trading. Those activities are the usual routes to the top positions
at such firms; asset management is not.
</P>
<P>
   Such firms are ``typically very, very political operations, and
there is a great rivalry between the capital markets, retail and
investment banking people,'' said Burton Greenwald, a consultant in
Philadelphia. ``You don't have that in a typical mutual fund
management company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it makes sense that many people who want to make
stock-picking their life's work go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some performance factors are easier to quantify. Many of the
larger funds managed by the big brokerage firms have annual
operating expenses that are higher than the industry average, even
though such expenses should decline as assets rise because the fund
is spreading fixed costs over a larger base.
</P>
<P>
   Even big index funds are not immune: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
according to Morningstar, has almost $2 billion in an S&AMP;P 500 Index
fund that charges a 1.5 percent expense ratio. (The T. Rowe Price
Equity Index 500 fund, by contrast, charges just 0.40 percent
annually.)
</P>
<P>
   Such disparities can make a huge difference over time: $10,000
invested in a fund that returns 15 percent a year for a decade will
grow to $40,500; the same amount compounding at 14 percent a year,
because its expense ratio is a point higher, will grow to just
$37,100.
</P>
<P>
   HigH fees might be forgivable if brokerage firms used the money
to pay for star managers. But their pay packages generally do not
approach those for managers at firms like American Funds, Fidelity
Investments, Putnam Investments and Janus, industry compensation
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms ``tend to spend as much money marketing the
product as they do on investment technology or investment talent to
manage the funds,'' said William Dougherty, president of Kanon
Bloch. ``They're marketing companies, and they tend to sell their
funds regardless of the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   With fund flows tepid, the firms are trying to turn their funds'
performance around. Salomon Smith Barney has been moving toward a
more consistent and rigorous investment approach that will adhere
more closely to capitalization and style classifications like value
and growth, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects the backgrounds of the two co-chairmen of
SSB Citi Asset Management Group, which includes the firm's mutual
fund unit: Peter Carman, former head of equities at Putnam, and
Thomas W. Jones, former chief operating officer of TIAA-CREF, the
huge pension fund for educators.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, PaineWebber hired Brian M. Storms away from
Prudential Investments to become president of its Mitchell Hutchins
Asset Management arm. In December, the firm bought an index-fund
boutique, DSI International Management, and it plans to roll out
several enhanced index funds this year. (Last month, it also showed
that its brokers can still pitch a fund, raising $2.1 billion for
one that invests in stocks recommended by Edward M. Kerschner, a
respected PaineWebber strategist.)
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, created when Morgan Stanley merged
with Dean Witter, Discover in 1997, has been integrating its fund
units. That has led to some cross-pollination, with managers from
the different fund groups serving as subadvisers for funds in other
families.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest changes may be at Merrill Lynch. Jeffrey M.
Peek, appointed head of Merrill Lynch Asset Management two years
ago, brought in Robert C. Doll Jr., Oppenheimer Funds' chief
investment officer, to run its fund unit and led a shake-up of the
business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has also been moving to promote new growth-fund
offerings and has hired a new index-fund team from Deutsche Bank.
And it has added respected portfolio managers like James McCall,
formerly of Pilgrim Baxter &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no guarantees in the fund business. That is why
Edward Jones, the nation's seventh-largest brokerage firm, has long
had a policy of not selling its own brand of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never want our name on any mutual fund, because from time
to time, the performance is going to disappoint,'' said John
Bachmann, managing principal of the firm, ``and we certainly don't
want our customers blaming us.''

GLAMOROUS WELL-WISHERS MEET IN COURT FOR A CLUB FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The glamorous world of Miami Beach celebrity culture
collided Friday with the gritty workings of what prosecutors called
a Brooklyn Mafia crew, as a South Florida nightclub impresario
charged with murder was ordered released from custody on $15
million bail.
</P>
<P>
   As a white stretch limousine waited at the curb outside U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, two fixtures of South Beach nightlife,
Ingrid Casares, a restaurateur, and Sofia Vergara, a model and
Spanish-language television personality, milled in the hallways
with their publicist, Lizzie Grubman, waiting to offer the
nightclub owner, Chris Paciello, support.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello, 28, whose real name is Christian Ludwigsen, moved from
Staten Island to Miami in 1993 and quickly opened a string of
glittering restaurants and dance clubs, including Liquid and the
Bar Room, that attracted the likes of Madonna and the actress
Gwyneth Paltrow. But in November, just as he was planning to open
another club, he was accused in a federal indictment of being a
member of a robbery squad connected to the Bonanno organized crime
family. He turned himself in to the authorities in Florida on Dec.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Brooklyn contend that on Feb. 18, 1993, Paciello
drove the getaway car during a botched robbery in which a Staten
Island woman, Judith Shemtov, 46, was fatally shot. He has also
been charged with robbing a Chemical Bank branch at the Staten
Island Mall on Dec. 14, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello has denied the charges, and his lawyer, Roy Black, said
Friday that the government's accusations were a result of his
client's fame, not any ties to organized crime. ``Unfortunately,
the way our society works,'' Black said, ``when someone becomes a
successful or high-profile person, they also become a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Paciello walked into the courtroom for his bail hearing on
Friday smiling at Ms. Casares, his business partner, and Ms.
Vergara, the co-host of a television show on the Univision network,
who described herself as Paciello's former girlfriend. The two
women stood in court beside members of Paciello's family, including
his grandfather, Louis. In turn, each agreed to secure a share of
the $15-million bail with cash, securities and their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of bail surprised even prosecutors, who said it was
one of the highest they had ever seen. By comparison, John A.
Gotti, the acting boss of the Gambino crime family, was required to
put up $10 million when he was released from federal custody in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions of Paciello's bail agreement were as severe as
its cost, prompting the presiding judge, Magistrate Joan M. Azrack,
to announce to the court, ``There are more conditions on this bond
than I think I've ever seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Paciello will be required to live at his
mother's home in Staten Island for almost three months. He will be
subjected to round-the-clock video surveillance and random
unannounced visits, and he is barred from owning a cellular phone
or pager. On April 1, he will be allowed to move to his home in
Florida, Ms. Azrack said, with similar restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing drew to a close, Paciello blew a kiss to his
supporters and was led from the courtroom. His release could take
two to three weeks, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bail hearing, Paciello was taken to a separate
courtroom where he joined the eight other defendants named in the
racketeering indictment. The other defendants, mostly men in their
20s from Brooklyn, are known in court papers as the Bath Avenue
Crew because they grew up near Bath Avenue in Bensonhurst. Anthony
Spero, whom prosecutors described as the former acting boss of the
Bonanno family, is also one of the defendants in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges the men with six murders and with trying
to commit four more while working with the Bonanno family between
1991 and 1995. They are also accused of a dozen other charges,
including arson, extortion and selling marijuana and crack cocaine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Walden, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in court Friday
that the government was close to working out a plea deal with one
of the defendants, whom he would not identify. As Walden and a team
of defense lawyers, including Gerald L. Shargel, who has
represented both Gotti and his father, John J. Gotti, addressed
Judge Edward R. Korman, Paciello mouthed endearments to his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Maryann Reynolds, the mother of one defendant,
Thomas Reynolds, said she was tired of being in court because,
``Nothing gets done, nothing gets solved.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Casares came out of the courthouse, Ms. Reynolds,
who lives on Staten Island, acceded to the glow of celebrity,
telling reporters: ``Ingrid's here. Everyone can leave me now.''

FLORIDA JUDGE TO RULE ON LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP FOR CUBA BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The wrangling over a 6-year-old Cuban boy shifted Friday
from the streets to a Miami courthouse, where a state judge said
she would decide early next week whether to grant legal
guardianship to the boy's great-uncle, with whom he is living.
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Rosa Rodriguez grants the request by the boy's lawyers,
the great-uncle could immediately reapply for political asylum on
behalf of the boy, Elian Gonzalez. The tangled legal process could
delay or block the boy's return to Cuba. But legal experts said
Friday that it would be unlikely for the judge to take legal
custody away from the boy's father, who has asked for Elian's
return and was found by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to have a close relationship with his son.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to step up the pressure, local leaders met Friday
night in Washington with Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss a
decision by INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, which included Dade-Metro Mayor Alex Penelas and
Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, appealed to Reno to overturn the order.
</P>
<P>
   After the 45-minute meeting, which was arranged by Vice
President Al Gore, Penelas told reporters that he asked Reno to
``consider the clear desire of the mother,'' that Elian grow up in
the United States. Penelas added that he felt the boy's father
``has been coerced'' into demanding that the boy return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno decides not to overturn the ruling, Penelas said, he
urged her to at least delay the decision for 35 to 45 days to allow
lawyers for boy's relatives in Florida to prepare a legal case to
block his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the vice president to intercede on Elian's behalf, and
he did,'' Penelas said earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, INS officials ruled that federal and international
laws compelled them to honor a request by Elian's father to be
re-united with his son. Elian's mother and stepfather died at sea
when the boat they were taking to the United States capsized in
November. The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has said he was unaware
that his former wife was planning to flee the country with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which had hoped to avoid a messy,
protracted fight with Cuban exiles over the boy, now finds itself
the focus of heated street demonstrations and faces the possibility
that the boy may not be voluntarily turned over for his flight back
to Cuba. One hundred and thirty people were arrested in Miami on
Thursday in protests that snarled traffic and angered motorists.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on his way to the peace talks between Syria
and Israel on Friday, urged protesters to take their concerns to
court and refrain from lawlessness. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case,'' Clinton said. ``We need to keep this out of the
political process as much as possible within the established legal
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., requested
that the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, Rep.
Dan Burton, D-Ind., issue Elian a subpoena to appear before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Burton, in consultation with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said
he would not issue a subpoena, but left open the possibility, ``if
it becomes necessary.'' Burton, a strong ally of Cuban exiles, has
the power unilaterally to issue congressional subpoenas. A subpoena
would delay the boy's return until he appeared before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the lawyers' case in state court here was
likely to fail, although judges had wide discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to challenge the father's custody, and there is
not a shred of evidence that he is an unfit father, they would have
to do it in Cuba, where the custody agreement was reached,'' said
David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, another law professor at the university,
agreed. ``I think that both procedurally and in terms of the
merits, they have a slim chance of success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's legal maneuvers fail, lawyers here are expected to
ask first for a temporary restraining order in federal court
barring Elian's return, and then a preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was mostly quiet Friday with only one sparsely attended
demonstration downtown. But in Cardenas, Cuba, Elian's hometown,
about 50,000 people attended a rally demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Coast Guard and the Border Patrol have revised the death
toll in the boat sinking that led to Elian's arrival here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven people died in that voyage and 3 survived, making it a
total of 14 people on the boat,'' Dan Geoghegan, a spokesman for
the Border Patrol in Miami said Friday. Initial reports were that
13 people were on the boat and that 10 had drowned.

STARS AND STRIPES CAUGHT UP IN DISPUTE OVER RUDDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ It was a vintage America's Cup news
cycle: accusations and revelations off the water; high intensity
and close-quarter racing on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what all the sailors live for,'' said Paul
Cayard, the skipper of America One, after his crew and new boat had
beaten Nippon Challenge by 23 seconds on Friday. ``Those kinds of
races where the boats are not the factor, and where the crews are
tacking and grinding, and getting the sails up and down makes all
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   This contentious competition is seldom so straightforward,
however, and on Friday night the regatta's international jury
convened to consider a protest against Team Dennis Conner's Stars
and Stripes. The jury's deliberations could complicate matters
considerably for Stars and Stripes, which leads the challenger
semifinals with a 3-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon, which lost to Stars and Stripes on the first day of the
six-team semifinals, had protested that Conner's team used an
illegal rudder in the race. The rudder was, Nippon claimed, in
breach of Article 19 of the America's Cup protocol because it was
not made in the United States or in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the rudder was designed by American designers
but manufactured in Australia with materials shipped from the
United States. The rudder was installed for the semifinals and then
quickly removed after the opening victory over Nippon and replaced
by a rudder of wholly American origin.
</P>
<P>
   Why was it replaced so hastily? Conner was not saying. ``It's a
little bit like Monica Lewinsky talking about her case while it's
still going on. It's not really appropriate,'' Conner said
Saturday, shortly before Stars and Stripes raced America One. ``But
we're quite confident that we'll be fine and we haven't violated
any rules and that we'll be totally vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The other syndicates believe the rudder was replaced because
America True, the team headed by Dawn Riley, had asked the
arbitration panel for a clarification of Article 19: a request that
the panel still has not answered formally.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Stars and Stripes is indeed in breach of
the rules. The arbitration panel opened deliberations Saturday and
has asked each of the semifinalists to provide its interpretations
of Article 19. It will then reconsider the issue on Sunday morning,
make a formal interpretation and refer the matter back to the jury
for action if required.
</P>
<P>
   Article 19 reads: ``Providing a Challenger's yacht arrives in
New Zealand with appendages (including foils, bulbs, canards, etc.)
designed by a national and manufactured in the country of the
Challenger, further appendages may be constructed in New Zealand
for that yacht provided they have been designed by a national of
the country of the Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nippon certainly thinks it understands its meaning. In a news
release issued Saturday, it said, ``The protocol is loud and clear
even when it is translated in Japanese, French, Italian or any
other language.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Marcus Hutchinson, a spokesman for the Louis
Vuitton Cup, as the challenger series is known, possible penalties
could include forcing Stars and Stripes to re-race Nippon; granting
a point to the Japanese and stripping a point from the Americans,
or even expelling Stars and Stripes on the grounds that it would no
longer be eligible to compete in the America's Cup finals against
New Zealand should it win the Challenger series.
</P>
<P>
   Conner has spent much of his career navigating amid America's
Cup controversy. ``There's nothing in the rules that says the
rudder can't be made in Australia,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, Stars and Stripes was represented by Peter
Isler, Peter Holmberg and Tom Whidden. According to a witness, they
said Stars and Stripes did not believe the nationality rules
applied to underwater appendages like rudders and argued that the
nationality issue had been diluted in the modern America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes has not raced since Wednesday, when it damaged
its stern scoop in a collision with Le Defi Francais. Stars and
Stripes, which seems to perform better in higher wind conditions,
was to return to action against America One in light to moderate
winds. The race matched the two leaders in the series _ America One
is now 3-1 with six races remaining in this round, which will cut
the challengers from six to two. Prada and Nippon are 2-2. America
True is 1-2 and Le Defi Francais is 0-4.

 Stock Message Board Brouhaha Flares  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Anybody who has surfed stock message boards on Internet sites such
as Yahoo or Silicon Investor has seen them _ anonymous, sometimes
scurrilous postings that dis a company, its management and its
products.
<P>
   ZixIt, a Dallas designer of Internet commerce software, noticed
a raft of such missives on the company's Yahoo message board last
year, placed by posters identified only as ``twenex,''
``stockerama'' or similar aliases.
</P>
<P>
   ZixIt's Web transaction-authorization system had ``no chance of
success,'' its stock was ``a sure way to financial ruin'' and its
CEO was ``busy smoking a big fat cigar and laughing his ass off,''
messages warned.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Internet fare. Except, it turned out, more than 400 such
messages were posted by Paul Guthrie, vice president of technology
research at Foster City's Visa International, which sells a system
that competes directly against ZixIt's e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, ZixIt sued Visa in a Texas court,
charging the giant credit card association with libel. Guthrie's
Yahoo postings were ``malicious, highly arrogant, and filled with
false statements,'' ZixIt's complaint charged.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the complaint said, they were part of a larger ``plan
to destroy ZixIt through various means, including improper
intimidation, anonymous fronts, and business and personal
disparagement.'' The company demanded a jury trial and unspecified
monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Visa admits that Guthrie posted the messages and may have done
so while on the job. But it insists he was acting on his own.
``There was no knowledge or approval by anyone at Visa,'' said
spokesman Michael Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Visa said Guthrie is still an employee but wouldn't comment on
whether he has been disciplined. Guthrie, who supervises Visa
technology initiatives including the e-commerce software, didn't
return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the episode is a classic David versus Goliath
story: Was mighty Visa, with 21,000 bank members and 5,000
employees worldwide, trying to crush tiny ZixIt, which is still in
the development stage with no revenue and just 78 employees?
</P>
<P>
   From another angle, though, the ZixIt /Visa spat shows how the
Internet speeds up and intensifies all kinds of communication. And
that presents a new array of challenges to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this have been happening in the real world for
centuries,'' said Henry Dinger, a Boston e-commerce lawyer with the
firm Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar, citing anonymous slander campaigns
and phony letters to the editor. ``The Internet is exacerbating the
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it's not clear what responsibility Visa has to
control the Internet behavior of its employees, given the rapid
development of technology and law.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and other organizations have issued rules regulating
Internet use and notified employees that their Web activity could
be monitored, in part because of legal concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was ZixIt, not Visa, that fingered Guthrie. ZixIt
declined to say how it identified the Visa executive. It may have
had outside help. In recent years, investigative agencies have
sprung up nationwide that track down Internet posters.
</P>
<P>
   That Guthrie was exposed proves one thing. On the Internet, said
Dinger, ``people are not as anonymous as they think they are.''

 Xilinx Makes A Chip for All Seasons  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Keeping up with the Joneses may soon get a bit easier, at least
when it comes to making sure your cell phone, TV and other consumer
electronics devices can do all the latest tricks _ without making
you trade up for a new model.
<P>
   That's the promise of a new family of ``future-proof'' chips
that semiconductor vendor Xilinx plans to unveil on Monday. The
chips, which will cost as little as $10 apiece in volume, will
allow manufacturers of next-generation digital devices to add new
features, as well as fix bugs, simply by offering software updates
for users to download over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly a household name, even in its home region, Xilinx
has lately been attracting plenty of attention from Wall Street.
Over the past year, its stock price has more than doubled, giving
it a market capitalization of about $14.5 billion _ second only to
Intel among Silicon Valley semiconductor companies. At one point
during the past week's Nasdaq sell-off, the company had lost more
than 10 percent of that value, but by week's end, it had regained
most of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Merrill Lynch put Xilinx on its ``Top 10 Tech''
list, replacing Intel. And the next month, Standard &AMP; Poor added
the company to its S&AMP;P 500 index, though that move generated only a
fraction of the publicity Yahoo gained when it was added to the S&AMP;P
list a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   This year, which for Xilinx ends March 30, the company's
revenues are expected to approach $1 billion _ an increase of
nearly 50 percent over last year. About 70 percent of that comes
from networking and communications customers, including Cisco,
Nortel, Lucent and just about every other major provider of
Internet plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Most Xilinx products are of a class called field programmable
gate arrays (FPGAs) _ chips whose internal structure, and thus what
they do with data, can be modified at any time. Xilinx invented the
category, and it still claims 50 to 60 percent of the market for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, FPGAs have been so expensive, according to
Xilinx CEO Wim Roelandts, that they've mainly gone into high-price,
low-volume products, including mainframe storage devices, medical
electronics and industrial robots as well as networking equipment,
</P>
<P>
   But the new chips, called the Spartan-II family, will allow
Xilinx to address a market that's three times as large as its
current one, Roelandts said. They're due to go into full production
by the end of this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company has actually offered low-cost FPGAs for several
years, but until now they've been limited to less than 40,000
``gates'' _ the tiny logical switches used to manipulate data
inside the chip. The Spartan-II series will incorporate up to
150,000 gates _ well into the ``sweet spot'' for mass-market
products, which according to Roelandts typically require 100,000 to
300,000 gates.
</P>
<P>
   New digital devices that will incorporate the upgradable Xilinx
chips, according to Xilinx spokesman Mike Seither, include DVD
players, cell phones, high-definition televisions, audio equipment
and cable and digital subscriber line modems. Many of them, he
said, were on display at this week's Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas, he said, though the only company willing to disclose
plans to use the chips was Replay Networks, a Mountain View
manufacturer of tapeless TV recorders.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading yesterday Xilinx rose $4.63, to $45.44. The
company split its stock 2-for-1 in March of last year and again in
December.

 A Trunkful of Car Gadgets  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As Bay Area commuters know all too well, getting stuck in traffic
is a grand waste of time.
<P>
   But at the Consumer Electronics Show this week, big companies
such as Motorola and Sony joined with startups like Command Audio
to unveil new computer-controlled, voice-activated, Web-attached
automobile gizmos designed to fill those wasted commute hours with
productivity, not to mention distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers soon will be able to download spoken versions of their
e-mail, the latest stock quotes or stories from the Wall Street
Journal while they're waiting to get past the morning mess at the
Bay Bridge toll plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can use the time to record their favorite music from
their CD collections or MP3-formatted songs downloaded off the
Internet while negotiating Hospital Curve. And mom and dad can
sidetrack their kids from bickering in the back seats by flicking
on a video (or DVD) of ``The Matrix'' on the new theater systems
designed for cars.
</P>
<P>
   Car stereos are no longer just car stereos.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first car didn't even have a radio,'' said James Armstrong
of Point  &LR;   &LR; Roberts, Wash., as he checked out a special GMC Yukon
sport utility vehicle decked out with about $2,500 worth of JVC
audio and video electronics. The gear included a DVD player,
computer navigation system, two independent video screens for the
rear seats, two headphones for the passengers and booming 12-inch
subwoofers for the driver and anyone else standing within earshot
of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by some of the exhibits at the annual electronics
extravaganza in Las Vegas, auto dealers may soon start using more
megahertz instead of more horsepower to sell cars.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips are already in use throughout even the average
sedan in everything from engine controls to stereo systems. But
now, electronics companies are bringing the Web to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, Clarion Corp. and Ford Motor Co. unit Visteon
Automotive Systems all unveiled new in-dash or dash-mounted car
computers that they hope to start shipping later this year. Each
offers a wider range of services than the standard AM-FM cassette
deck, to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Motorola's iRadio, with models costing between $500
and $1,000, combines digital cellular phone service, satellite
links and the Internet to allow drivers to download traffic reports
on demand, instead of having to wait until an on-the-air radio
station broadcasts them.
</P>
<P>
   A driver also can get e-mail, updated stock quotes, tune in 100
different radio stations delivered by satellites, download
MP3-formatted digital music and find the nearest McDonald's or dry
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Motorola announced a partnership with Redwood City
startup Command Audio Inc., which is trying to sell a subscription
service for drivers to download audio versions of written news,
sports and information from sources like Time magazine and the Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Command Audio, which also markets a handheld receiver made by
RCA, initiated the service last month in Denver and Phoenix,
although it may not reach its own home market until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But chief executive Don Bogue believes interest in the
$15-per-month Command Audio subscriptions will accelerate because
both motorists and mass transit riders want to make better use of
their travel time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a great opportunity in addressing the market
for mobile consumers,'' Bogue said. ``For all consumers, there is
just an explosive amount of media, but just less and less time to
consume it. They don't have time to read a daily newspaper
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the iRadio, Visteon's ICES, which stands for Information,
Communication, Entertainment and Security, is linked to a Web site
so a driver can personalize a selection of entertainment and data.
The voice-activated ICES may be out in the second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Markatos, Visteon's multimedia and electronic systems
supervisor, conceded the initial $3,200 cost of a ``fully
installed'' ICES will initially turn off the average car buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price point has got to come down to $500, but it can in
time with (sales) volume,'' Markatos said. That may happen by 2003,
especially as more car computer systems are sold overall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarion Corp., showed off the ``concept'' of its
second-generation AutoPC, which can play MP3 music and run two
video screens for rear-seat passengers to view DVD movies and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jukka Rissanen, a Clarion marketing specialist, said the company
hasn't released the sales numbers for its first-generation AutoPC,
which went on the market last year. But he said the newer model
might be ready for sale in the fall at about the same price,
$1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of MP3, the popular audio format used to compress songs
downloaded from the Internet, Atlanta's i2go.com introduced its eGo
player. The $270 device not only plays MP3 music through a car
stereo, but can compress e-mail messages into an MP3 format and
read back the text in a synthesized human voice.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. is also trying to fill
drive time, in particular, the commute hours of trendy digital-age
GenerationY youth.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Electronics Inc. unleashed several new car products under
its year-old Xplod brand, including an AM-FM stereo that can record
songs onto a MiniDisc.
</P>
<P>
   The MD Record, due to hit the U.S. market in March at a retail
price of $699, allows drivers to record tracks from their CDs,
using an optional CD changer, or from the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It has a 10-second memory so users can record songs or programs
off the radio even after they started. An included timer can record
up to 80 minutes worth of a programming after the driver leaves the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Even people too busy to record their favorite songs at home,
``have some time in the car,'' said Romeo Hakusui, a senior vice
president for Sony's mobile communications division.
</P>
<P>
   The era of the drive-in theater may be dead, but electronics
manufacturers are trying to create a new drive-on theater
phenomenon. At CES, there were a slew of products to turn that car
or SUV into a rolling entertainment unit, including new car DVD
video players from Sony and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   There were also kits like the $700 Back Seat Theater from TMI
Products Inc. of Corona (Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone is worried about all that expensive equipment
luring thieves, Clifford Electronics of Southern California offered
a new car security system that can be controlled remotely through
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of these smart car devices said their ease of use and
often hands-free operation should make them safe to operate while
driving. Yet there is already a national debate about whether the
use of cell phones in cars is safe, although attempts to ban their
use have failed except in one Midwest town. A New England Journal
of Medicine study showed drivers using cell phone were 34 percent
more likely to have an accident than drivers without cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harrington, communications director with the nonprofit
National Safety Council, was concerned the new car devices
introduced in Las Vegas also will take drivers' eyes and minds off
the roads if not used with proper precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's hands-free,'' said Harrington. ``If
you bought technology stocks on Monday, you wouldn't be feeling
good about it today, so as you're making your expletive-deleted
comments, you have to be aware that does add to the risks that
you're going to hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   And he noted motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of
death for people age 25 and under. ``They're targeting a market
that needs to pay attention to driving the most,'' Harrington said.

   Unemployment Rate Stayed At 4.1 Percent in December
</P>
<P>
   Employers created 315,000 new nonfarm jobs in December, 75,000
more than economists had predicted and the biggest one-month gain
since July. With more people entering the work force, the
unemployment rate remained at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, where
it has been for the last three months. The report showed that
unemployment for all of 1999 averaged 4.2 percent, down from 4.5
percent in 1998 and the lowest rate since 1969, when it was 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.4 percent,
slightly more than expected. But because workers are producing more
for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far shows few signs of
setting off a surge in inflation. The figures increased the
likelihood that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates
next month.

Officials have had a difficult time putting their finger on what it

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brini Maxwell, the svelte and stylish creation of Ben
Sander, is a drag queen's answer to Martha Stewart. Dressed in a
meticulously coiffured blond wig, patent leather pumps and an array
of vintage dresses, she gushes over obscure household tips,
etiquette and recipes on her weekly television show.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed by the black heel marks on the kitchen linoleum? Try a
dab of lighter fluid on a paper towel. Want to save money on paper
plates? Wash and reuse the trays from TV dinners. Interested in a
new dish to delight your guests? How about a crown roast of cheese?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheese,'' says Brini, stealing a line from the critic Clifton
Fadiman, ``is milk's leap to immortality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brini Maxwell Show,'' taped in Sander's small Chelsea
apartment by his mother, the actress Mary Jane Wells, appears in
Manhattan on a leased access television channel on Friday nights.
Though there are no viewer ratings systems for leased access cable
shows, Brini (rhymes with ``teeny'') has received hundreds of
letters and e-mail messages since the show began in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I always enjoy your show and try to watch it
every week,'' Brenda Dally said by e-mail. ``I must admit,
though,'' she continued, ``that after one of your episodes, I feel
quite inadequate to my role of wife, and know that my hubby
probably feels a twinge of regret at marrying a modern career woman
instead of an efficient, elegant nest builder like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sander says his alter ego's appeal lies in her polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brini is a terribly good cook and hostess,'' he said. ``She is
the perfect homemaker. She slips in the door because she isn't
threatening. She ushers in gay culture in an acceptable disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Men in heels are nothing new on television. Milton Berle
regularly donned a dress on ``The Texaco Star Theater'' in the late
1940s. RuPaul had a talk show on VH1 from 1996 to 1998 and has
appeared in Old Navy commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But if drag makes steady appearances on nationwide television,
it has flooded Manhattan cable television: there are now four
weekly programs with drag queen hosts and one with a woman dressed
as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Brini was one of four drag queens nominated for the Glammy Award
for Best TV Performer, given by the drag queen community last
month.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 drag queens and their guests burst into applause as
Brini, dressed in an ivory floor-length skirt with a side slit, a
black sweater and a Mongolian lamb's wool wrap, swooshed through
the crowd and onto the stage to accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful how supportive the drag community is of each
other,'' she said, her white rhinestone necklace flashing in the
stage lights.
</P>
<P>
   Brini has appeared in 28 episodes. The program started as ``At
Home With Tigs'' and centered on a jet-setting drag character. But
Sander felt the character was ``too tony'' and turned to his
fourth-floor walk-up for inspiration; his apartment is filled with
furniture, artwork and dishes that are decades old.
</P>
<P>
   He then took the name Brini from a character in a Stephanie
Powers mini-series, ``Deceptions,'' in which she played twins. The
name Maxwell came from Barbra Streisand's character in ``What's Up,
Doc?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brini's outfits include capri pants, produced on Sander's sewing
machine, and billowy skirts with garish bows. The result is a
composite of television characters played by Donna Reed, Marlo
Thomas and Mary Tyler Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is trying to recreate his childhood,'' Ms. Wells
volunteered from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he says, ``I was born in 1969.'' Although the fictional
models were long gone by the time Sander became a dedicated
television viewer, he reaches out to recreate the security and
innocence of their worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Brini I have more self-confidence,'' Sander said. ``I
express myself more freely. I think of myself as an icon. Without
Brini I am a loner who finds it difficult to make lasting
friendships. Parts of me are so disparate and there is some shame
associated with them. It is difficult to let all of myself be known
to people. I guess part of me is ashamed of being gay.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each show opens with a montage of shots of Brini: posing in
Central Park on the Alice in Wonderland sculpture (as did the
television character Rhoda); standing in front of Bergdorf Goodman
in a bright checkered coat and turquoise hat; wearing a blue and
white dress, along with a red, white and blue pillbox hat, in front
of the Queensboro Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes revolve around tensions between Brini and her neighbor
Mary Ellen, played by Thom Hansen. Mary Ellen, whose acerbic asides
are lost on Brini, is recruited to do various household tasks she
would prefer to forgo. When Brini makes Swedish meatballs, Mary
Ellen is ordered to kneed the ground meat, but finds that her fake
fingernails come off in the dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise woman will prepare her nails after dinner,'' Mary Ellen
intones into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Brini inserts 30-second shorts that give household tips, like
boiling spices in a pan to get rid of the smell of stale cigarette
smoke. Sadness is held at bay, even when it intrudes in the lives
of the cast. Mary Ellen is the willing victim in an episode on how
to care for an invalid, taped while Hansen's real-life partner was
dying of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna Reed's mother would never have died,'' Hansen, 46, said
in an interview.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Margaret Moran's parents died within six weeks of each
other in 1975, her first concern was for her brother, Jimmy,
developmentally disabled since birth. Ms. Moran was 30 and working
in Boston as a book editor. Jimmy, four years older, was living in
a group residence in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our parents gone, I knew there was nothing to do but step
in and take responsibility for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want to.
But someone had to make sure he was well taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morans had left $140,000 to cover their son's financial
needs. The money, which was invested in money market funds, had
dwindled to $269 by last July. While Philadelphia County has since
picked up most of the $93-a-day residence bill, the balance comes
out of Jimmy's $680 monthly Social Security check, leaving Ms.
Moran with $271 to pay for medical care, clothing and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't go very far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been born a generation earlier, Jimmy Moran would
probably have died before his inheritance ran out; a developmental
disability often meant a shortened life expectancy. But now,
``people with disabilities are living longer, just like the general
population,'' said Stanley Klein, a Brookline, Mass., psychologist
and consultant on disability-related concerns. ``It used to be
unusual to see elderly parents caring for adult children. Now it's
becoming common.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 480,000 adults with mental retardation live with
parents who are 60 or older, according to Rick Berkobien, a
spokesman for the Arc, formerly the Association for Retarded
Citizens; some research, he added, suggests that ``there may be as
many families in those circumstances who are unknown to either the
aging or mental retardation services systems.''
</P>
<P>
   At 58, Jimmy Moran has a developmental age of 7 and a passion
for taking apart flashlights. ``But, like many middle-aged
people,'' his sister said, ``he has aches and pains and tends to
doze off in front of the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the medical advances that have extended human
longevity have proved a mixed blessing as more and more people
begin to outlive their savings. Moreover, through most of the last
century, ``children with disabilities were routinely
institutionalized by their families and cared for at public
expense,'' Klein noted.
</P>
<P>
   It could be grossly substandard care, as anyone familiar with
names like Willowbrook and Pennhurst may know. But the closing of
these and other facilities in the 1970s and '80s, together with
shrinking Medicaid and Medicare allotments and soaring health care
costs, has shifted the financial burden to families. Many are
buckling under the weight.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when she realized that her brother's inheritance
would soon run out, Ms. Moran began putting aside some money on her
own. She said she had managed to save only ``a few thousand''
dollars to date; even so, she is light years ahead of the vast
majority of families in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 Census report, about nine million Americans,
not counting those in institutions, ``have disabilities so severe
that they require personal assistance to carry out everyday
activities.'' In most cases, experts say, their families have taken
no steps to secure their financial future.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include making sure that there is enough money set
aside to cover housing, food, health care, day-to-day nurturing and
other necessities after the parents die, and that there will be a
responsible adult to protect the child's interests. Such
considerations are common to all estate planning. The difference is
that healthy children eventually outgrow their need for financial
support; those with disabilities are always dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are any number of reasons why these families don't plan
ahead,'' said Christopher D. Sullivan, who heads a new Merrill
Lynch service billed as the first financial planning program
intended expressly for families of children with disabilities.
``They may think it's unnecessary on the assumption the child will
die first. Or they simply can't imagine someone else taking over
their parental duties.''
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, just getting through the day leaves little
time and energy to plan for the future _ especially for ``sandwich
generation'' families caring for their own aging parents as well as
for a child with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when cognitive deficits, as well as mental
illness, autism and traumatic brain injury, were associated with
shortened life spans. In the 1920s, for example, the average age at
death of children with Down syndrome was 9, according to Senate
testimony by David Braddock, head of the department of disability
and human development at the University of Illinois. It rose to
30.5 in the 1960s and to 55.8 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of older persons with developmental
disabilities living into their own retirement and outliving their
family caregivers has increased substantially in recent years,''
Braddock said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who is deaf, runs Merrill Lynch's investment service
for deaf and hearing-impaired clients; he founded the service a
decade ago. In 1997, Exceptional Parent magazine commended the firm
for pioneering efforts to reach out to disabled clients _ and, at
the same time, took it to task for not doing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd done quite a lot in the area,'' Sullivan said.
``What I wasn't aware of was the wide gap between the long-term
needs and preparedness of families.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap became grimly real to him several months later, when the
parents of his wife's cousin, an adult with profound mental
retardation, were killed in a Thanksgiving weekend car accident.
``They had always taken complete responsibility for their
daughter's care and never involved their other children,'' he said.
``Now there was no one to step in and make sure she was happy and
comfortable. It was a terrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Merrill Lynch program is a detailed
planning exercise in which a family assesses all aspects of its
current and projected financial situation. Working with a financial
consultant, families review expenses that they are paying on their
own _ including those for housing, medical care, clothing,
recreation, vacations and personal needs _ and then figure out a
realistic way to make sure those expenses continue to be met after
they die. The firm then prepares a ``financial foundation report''
that can serve as the basis of a comprehensive financial strategy.
The cost of the report is about $250.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most compelling objectives of the Merrill Lynch
program is the preservation of eligibility for various federal
benefits. Probably the most fragile of those is Supplemental
Security Income, generally available to people who are 65 or older
or disabled, provided that they own no more than $2,000 in assets
(excluding a house, car and burial plot, among other items). The
monthly payment for an individual can be up to $512 nationally, but
most states kick in some money of their own; in New York, the
add-on is $86. In addition, eligibility for SSI is often a
prerequisite for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a benefit definitely worth protecting, regardless of the
income level of the family, but it is also easy to lose. ``The
problem is that many families don't understand the full
implications of the $2,000 ceiling on assets,'' said Barton
Stevens, a special-needs estate planner in Scottsdale, Ariz. ``If a
grandparent dies and leaves money to the child, the SSI benefits
will be terminated, plus Medicaid can claim reimbursement for every
dollar it has spent.'' Only when the assets have been spent down to
$2,000 can a new application for SSI be approved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The standard way around such traps is to place the assets in a
special-needs trust, administered by a trustee appointed by the
family. Approved by Congress in 1993, such a trust lets the family
save and invest money for a child without jeopardizing government
entitlements. But it must be set up with obsessive attention to the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a problem with your heart, you wouldn't consult an
eye doctor,'' said Douglas Moore, senior counsel of estate and
trust services for Salomon Smith Barney. ``By the same token, don't
have a real estate lawyer set up your special-needs trust. They can
be tricky, so it's essential to use a specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   Errors and omissions can not only put SSI benefits at risk, but
they can also set off costly gift and income tax consequences, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who are not specialists may err, for example, by
including instructions that the funds be spent on necessities like
food and housing. ``There's a reason these are also known as
supplemental needs trusts,'' Moore said. ``They're expressly
intended to pay for things that enhance the beneficiary's quality
of life, like vacations and hobbies. If the income is earmarked for
basics, the trust will be disqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Williams, a special-needs lawyer in Glendale, Calif.,
said she often found herself ``fixing trusts done by other lawyers
who don't fully understand the underpinnings and how they work _ or
they try to get creative, and run afoul of the rules.'' Her advice:
``Ask your lawyer how many special-needs trusts he or she has done.
If they say that yours is their first, but that a trust is a trust,
go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the trust is written, it is a good idea to send a copy to
the Social Security Administration for review, Stevens suggested,
``and request a letter confirming that the trust is in
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Because special-needs trusts must be irrevocable, older parents
with limited resources sometimes shy away from them. ``They're
uncomfortable tying up their money knowing that they may have
long-term savings or health care issues of their own,'' said James
Cotto, a Merrill Lynch financial consultant in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
But you can have a trust ``without funding it, and draft your will
so that your assets go into the trust when you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ann McDonnell's three adult daughters suffer from a
variety of physical, mental and developmental disabilities. Ms.
McDonnell, who is divorced, established trusts that will receive
the proceeds of a separate life insurance trust when she dies.
``Their older sister will slip easily into my role,'' said Ms.
McDonnell, who is 61 and lives in Mount Kisco. ``She'll be the one
to make decisions affecting them, but she won't have to worry about
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families sidestep the issue of trusts and government
entitlements altogether by handing all their assets to their
offspring who are not disabled _ along with the burdens of
long-term care. That, Stevens said, can be a bad move. For one
thing, there is nothing, other than good faith, to prevent those
children from using the money to make a down payment on a home or
pay off debts.
</P>
<P>
   Venality is not the only risk. He told of a California couple,
parents of a grown son with Down syndrome, who willed all their
assets to their two married daughters. ``The daughters love their
brother and aren't likely to misuse the funds,'' he said. ``But the
money is in their name, and that exposes it to creditors and
litigation. If they die, the money goes to their husbands. And, if
they get divorced, their husbands get half, since California is a
community property state.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it is no wiser to leave all the money to the
disabled child, on the grounds that his need is greater than that
of his siblings. That may breed only enmity and jealousy. ``When
more than one child is involved, special-needs estate planning is
an inherently touchy situation,'' said William Testa, chief
executive of the Morris County, N.J., chapter of the Arc. ``It can
create a chasm in a family just when the support of siblings is
most important.'' All family members _ brothers and sisters as well
as parents _ should have a voice in the planning process, added
Sullivan of Merrill. ``Saving for your disabled child shouldn't
preclude setting up a college fund for your other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie and Mike Golden's 18-year-old son, Joshua, was born with
Angelman syndrome, a genetic impairment that causes seizures,
mental retardation and a range of physical limitations. Their
daughter, Jessica, who is 21 and works as a cosmetologist, ``has
grown up with the idea that someday her brother may be her
responsibility,'' Ms. Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's important to us,'' she added, ``to make sure that he
doesn't take over her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Goldens established a special-needs trust
for Joshua two years ago, to be financed by the proceeds of a life
insurance policy they recently bought. They have also set in place
a far-reaching circle of friends and family in and around their
Baltimore neighborhood, including teachers, nurses, and physicians'
assistants, as well as neighborhood youngsters who visit Joshua for
play dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have told us to call them in any emergency, day or night.
Others can give only limited time and resources, but they have
something to offer, too,'' Ms. Golden said. ``The important thing
is that the burden of caring for Joshua won't fall entirely on
Jessica. And our son will continue to live at home, surrounded by
people who love him. That's very reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from setting their child's financial house in order,
families should also prepare a letter of intent _ a biographical
profile that describes the precise nature of the child's
disability, medical history, capabilities and limitations, likes
and dislikes, daily routine and relevant behavioral quirks and
nuances. If the child has a favorite TV show or breakfast cereal,
or an aversion to broccoli, it should be duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen letters of intent that say things like, `If our son
has an episode and gets upset, you can calm him down by putting on
a Scooby-Doo video,''' said Cotto, the financial consultant in
Mount Kisco. ``That can be very helpful to future caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a letter of intent is not legally binding, ``in many
ways it's the most important document of all,'' Stevens added.
``It's the voice of mom and dad instructing what they want for
their child and how to meet his or her needs after they're no
longer around.'' The letter should be updated regularly as the
child grows and changes, ``and shared with any family members and
friends, so they can ask questions while mom and dad are around.''
If the child lives in a residential facility or otherwise spends
time away from home, ideas from staff members can be enlightening,
``since kids tend to behave differently when their parents aren't
around,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' he added, ``it's not a bad idea to observe the
child in that setting, and record what you see in the document.''
</P>
<P>
   Letter of intent can be especially important in the case of
individuals who cannot communicate their needs in an understandable
way. Ms. Williams recalled meeting with a married couple and the
wife's 46-year-old brother, who had suffered an oxygen deficit at
birth, leaving him at the cognitive level of an 18-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, he started rocking back and forth and smiling,
saying `bubba, bubba,''' Ms. Williams said. ``His sister told me he
was saying `bubbles,' which meant Pepsi-Cola. He wanted a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless those who cared for him knew that, she said, ``he would
become increasingly frustrated, and after a week he'd stop
communicating with the outside world. That's the kind of tragic
outcome that can be averted with a letter of intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Few families caring for children with disabilities take the time
to map out a formal financial plan, much less a letter of intent.
``I'm forever amazed at how so many people lack any awareness of
basic estate planning issues, or have even drafted a will,'' said
Moore of Salomon Smith Barney, who works primarily with affluent
families that do not have disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estate planning involves confronting your own mortality,'' he
noted. ``A lot of people, regardless of their circumstances, are
just uncomfortable with that.''

CATCHING THE TECHNOLOGY TSUNAMI TO A ROBUST '99 FINISH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for wording changes and updated figures)  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though technology stocks took a drubbing in the first week of
the new year, fund investors fell into two groups throughout 1999:
the have-techs and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   By loading up on technology stocks, particularly companies with
an Internet component, many fund managers outperformed the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. But, as in 1998, managers who shunned
such hot growth stocks and kept the faith that undervalued
stalwarts of the ``old economy'' would bounce back were generally
not rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Investing abroad, especially in emerging markets, also paid off
in the fourth quarter, but not so handsomely as it had earlier in
the year. On average, international stock funds gained 25.97
percent in the quarter, compared with a return of 18.35 percent for
the average United States diversified stock fund, according to
Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The growth style of investing, as it has for the last five
years, trumped value investing: the average domestic large-cap
growth fund gained 28.04 percent in the quarter, more than
quadruple the 6.03 percent gain of the typical domestic large-cap
value fund, Morningstar said. ``There will be a value market again
someday, but I may not be alive to see it,'' said Scott Cooley, 31,
a Morningstar analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Technology funds again ruled the domestic roost, racking up an
average gain of 61.88 percent for the quarter, according to
Morningstar _ although the always volatile group gave back some of
the gains last week. Of the 20 best-performing specialized stock
funds last quarter, all but two had ``technology,'' ``Internet'' or
some variant in their names. Heading the list was PBHG Technology
and Communications, which surged 111.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And technology is providing widespread access to investment
data. That information, in turn, is helping drive money into funds
holding the hottest technology stocks, said Richard Kauffman,
managing director of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``The Internet has allowed individuals to assess the
good-performing mutual funds and that has tended to concentrate the
cash'' going into them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger you are, the harder it is to get performance,''
Kauffman continued. ``That's part of the reason you've had this
bifurcation in the market toward growth stocks and Internet stocks
and away from everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fund managers are trying to ride the wave. David D. Alger,
chief executive of Fred Alger Management in New York, cranked up
the technology holdings in some of his funds last year and posted
impressive returns. Spectra Fund, a large-cap growth fund that
Alger manages with Dave Hyun, increased its weighting in technology
stocks to 58 percent in October from about 35 percent a year
earlier, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Spectra ended last year up 72.01 percent. Alger Capital
Appreciation Retirement, another fund for which Alger is a
co-manager, made a similar leap into technology and gained 88.73
percent for the year, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't tech funds, but we want to own the best
companies, the most exciting companies, the growth companies,''
Hyun said. ``We want to be where the action is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund buyers shared that sentiment. Robert Adler, president of
AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., said investors loaded up on
technology stocks in the second half of 1999 by snapping up shares
of technology funds and aggressive-growth funds. In late December,
he said, cash was pouring into those two categories at a weekly
rate of $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never happened before,'' said Adler, whose company
tracks fund flows. ``There has never been a focus on any sector the
way it has appeared over the last six months in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In joining the new-technology parade, many investors appear to
have shed all fear of risk, continuing to shift money out of more
conservative funds and pouring it into the riskiest, least
diversified funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds, for example, drew only about 4 cents of every dollar
that went into mutual funds in 1999 through November, the most
recent data available, down from 34 cents in the corresponding
period of 1998, according to the Financial Research Corp. Through
November, more than $5.6 billion flowed out of tax-free bond funds;
$943 million left government bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bond funds, on average, lost 1.29 percent in the
quarter and 3.55 percent for the year. The average taxable bond
fund returned just 1.2 percent for the quarter and 1.51 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, there was a phenomenal surge of cash into the
aggressive-growth funds managed by Janus Capital of Denver. More
than $35 billion flowed into Janus's 30 funds in 1999, second only
to about $45 billion that went to the indexing king, the Vanguard
Group, and about 65 percent more than went into Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest fund company. Total assets in
retail mutual funds at Janus more than doubled last year, to $172
billion.
</P>
<P>
   If one fund best represented mutual fund investing at the end of
the 20th century, it might be Janus Twenty. A concentrated
portfolio laden with fast-rising technology stocks, it has spawned
a raft of imitators. Since 1995, the fund's annual returns have
ranged from 28 percent to 73 percent as its assets have swollen to
more than $31 billion, even though it closed to new investors in
April. It was up 38.35 percent in the fourth quarter, and 64.9
percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It even lost a manager during the spree, when Thomas Marsico
handed the reins to Scott Schoelzel and left to run his own fund
firm, Marsico Capital in Denver. Marsico started a similar fund,
Marsico Focus, which has returned more than 50 percent in each of
its first two years, largely through big bets on technology stocks,
including Qualcomm. The fund already has more than $3.2 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marsico is starting to swim against the tidal wave into
technology. He has trimmed his Qualcomm stake to less than 8
percent of the Focus portfolio from more than 10 percent in
November. He is now buying shares of Citigroup, Fannie Mae and
Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we saw with pharmaceutical stocks in 1991,''
Marsico said of the technology mania. ``When people are this
aggressive about getting into a group, most of the gains have
already been had.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentrated investing _ making relatively big bets on a small
number of stocks _ was not always a winning strategy last year. One
of the fund industry's biggest disappointments was the Sequoia
fund, which had amassed an enviable long-term record by seeking out
undervalued companies. Dragged down by a big stake in Berkshire
Hathaway, the holding company run by Warren E. Buffett, Sequoia
returned just 1.33 percent in the quarter and lost 16.54 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, value funds lagged behind. Returns for value
funds _ large-cap, midcap and small-cap _ were around 6 percent in
the quarter. The only categories of stock funds that fared worse
were those investing in precious metals, down an average of 11.41
percent; natural resources and real estate, each of which returned
around 0.25 percent, on average; and financial funds, which
returned 5.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The second-best performers among stock funds, behind technology,
were those invested in communications _ up 40.03 percent in the
quarter and 81.37 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among international funds, the best-performing categories last
quarter were those that specialized in Latin America, up 38.38
percent on average, and emerging markets, up 34.69 percent. Showing
how much things can change in a year, Lexington Troika Dialog
Russia roared back from one of the worst years any fund has ever
had to post the best return of all international stock funds for
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which holds shares of Russian companies, rose 95.36
percent in the quarter and 159.76 percent in 1999, after losing 83
percent the previous year, when Russia defaulted on debt.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the top three _ and six of the top 10 _
international stock funds were Japan funds, including two handled
by Nick Edwards, a managing director of Credit Suisse Asset
Management, which acquired Warburg Pincus Asset Management in July.
Those funds, Warburg Pincus Japan Small Co. and Warburg Pincus
Japan Growth, gained 328.66 percent and 266.1 percent,
respectively. ``It was a remarkable year,'' Edwards said. ``All of
us fund managers ought to sit down and have a cold shower.''
</P>
<P>
   While Edwards said he did not expect a repeat performance in
2000, he predicted that Japanese stocks, like Sony, would continue
to benefit from corporate restructuring and an economic recovery.
``What is quite healthy about Japan is there are still a lot of
skeptics out there,'' he said. ``People still love to hate Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversified Asia Pacific stock funds were the second-best
international performers last year, up 90.97 percent on average,
followed by emerging-markets stock funds, at 71.7 percent, and
Latin America stock funds, at 60.63 percent. European stock funds,
up 29.47 percent, also outperformed their American counterparts. up
26.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most big losers among international stock funds specialized in
stocks of gold producers and other metals companies. Worldwide,
precious-metals funds took a big hit in the fourth quarter, losing
11.41 percent on average; they were up just 3.01 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their generally much stronger performance, funds that
invest in foreign stocks drew relatively little notice from
American investors, Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   The intense and narrow focus on domestic technology stocks has a
scary side, he added. ``The question remains, when the market
begins to correct, will focused outflows begin to drive the market
in reverse?''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, he said, is that fund investors have more and
faster access to information about their investments today than
ever before. ``They're aware of what they've made,'' Adler said,
``and they're aware of the risk of losing what they've made.''

N.H. NEWSPAPER FAULTS RUSSERT'S HANDLING OF DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Union Leader, a sponsor of the debate
among Republican presidential candidates on Thursday night,
apologized Friday because, it said, the moderator, Tim Russert,
paid so much attention to the two front-runners at the expense of
the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Leader, the largest newspaper in the state, has an
aggressively conservative viewpoint and has often been successful
in using its weight in New Hampshire politics. This year the paper
has endorsed Steve Forbes for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a signed editorial on the front page, the publisher,
Joseph W. McQuaid, wrote that Russert had apparently decided to
make the debate ``his own two-man show with candidates George Bush
and John McCain, virtually ignoring the four others for much of the
questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   If readers and viewers are upset, McQuaid declared, they are
``no more so than this newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert, of NBC News, said that an analysis of the tape showed
that the time allotted each of the candidates was ``remarkably
comparable,'' and that he had been complimented on his handling of
the debate not only by Bush and McCain but also by two other
candidates: Gary L. Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch.

 &HT;    Tax cut issue dominates GOP debate
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a debate dominated more by a raucous South
Carolina crowd than any of the candidates, the two Republican
presidential front-runners sparred for the second time in two
nights on taxes and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the few substantive exchanges in the debate _ disjointed
by a hodgepodge of questioning formats, applause and boos from the
crowd _ were between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his closest
rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain. The gentlemanly tone that
prevailed between the two early on has begun to evaporate as the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary approaches. South Carolina hosts its
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your people are running around saying your tax cut is
bigger than mine,'' McCain said of Bush's $483 billion tax-cut
proposal, which he called ``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, we ought to pay down the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Bush: ``There is enough money to take care of Social
Security, there's enough money to meet the basic needs of our
government, and there's enough money to give people a substantial
tax cut, and that's what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got more heated a few minutes later when Bush asked Utah
Sen. Orrin Hatch why so few Republican senators voted for McCain's
campaign finance reform bill, which the Arizona senator has made
the centerpiece of his campaign but that Bush says would hurt the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I or any other Republican be for a bill that's
unconstitutional?'' said Hatch, referring to the bill's
restrictions on campaign contributions. ``John is starting to sound
like the accordion player who only knows one tune: `Lady of
Spain.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain demanded a chance to respond to Bush and Hatch,
proclaiming that ``I've always thought that what's best for the
country is best for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are defending an illegal system,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing stiff in earlier debates, Bush for the second
night in row seemed relaxed, often employing the wry humor that he
has displayed in the Texas Governor's Mansion. When a reporter
asked each of the candidates to name the biggest mistake of his
adult life, Bush said his occurred when he was managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed off on that wonderful transaction: Sammy Sosa for
Harold Baines,'' Bush said of the trade that sent Sosa, one of the
greatest home-run hitters in the game, away from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the fifth debate for Bush, McCain, magazine
publisher Steve Forbes, Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes. They will
meet again Monday in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republicans traditionally back the establishment
candidate and this year is no exception. In recent weeks, McCain
has gained on Bush here, but still isn't close to erasing Bush's
large lead. The picture is different in New Hampshire, where Bush
and McCain are in a dead heat and where McCain's blunt, outspoken
style has played well with the state's fiercely independent voters.

MENDING KINGS CATCH A BREAK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although Christmas has passed and the All-Star
weekend is a month away, the Los Angeles Kings find themselves with
a bit of a break after recording a victory and a tie against two of
the league's better teams.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday night's 4-2 win over the Florida Panthers, the
Kings don't play again until Tuesday against Ottawa. After a
physical practice Friday, the team has today off before
participating in the NHL Skills Competition on Sunday at the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings aren't looking at the break as lost momentum, rather a
chance to get injured players healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feels pretty good that we have started playing well
again,'' said third-line center Ian Laperriere, who practiced with
the team Friday for the first time since bruising his left knee 10
days ago against Edmonton. ``We are going to be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (18-15-7) play five of their next six games at home
and all are against teams that made the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Laperriere, who was thought to be lost for several weeks,
could be back for Ottawa. First-line center Jozef Stumpel, also
sidelined with knee problems, hopes to play against the Senators,
but that is less likely. Stumpel underwent an MRI on Thursday and a
second on Friday to check for structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still sore but it's better,'' Stumpel said. ``A couple of
days can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel would have been a likely candidate to participate in the
skill competition, which will be held for season ticket holders
only on Sunday. Among the activities: fastest skater, hardest shot,
most accurate shot, stick handling and goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   Each team in the NHL has its own skills competition, with the
winners to face off the day before the Feb. 6 All-Star Game in
Toronto. It is sponsored by the NHL Players Association with
proceeds to benefit the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel is considered one of the league's finest stick handlers
but has missed all but three games in the past two months with
injuries. Ziggy Palffy, perhaps the Kings most-skilled offensive
player, also will not participate in the Skills Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, the team's leading scorer with 35 points, has been
bothered by a strained lower back the past month. His availability
has been a game-time decision the past few games, but he did play
Thursday and recorded an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziggy was in practice today and said he was fine, but we let
him out a little early as a precaution,'' coach Andy Murray said.
``For the next few weeks we probably won't know until game time if
he is going to play. That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's uncertainty created some interesting lines Thursday.
Luc Robitaille, who played with the second unit of Bryan Smolinski
and Glen Murray on Tuesday when Palffy was out, was back on the
first line Thursday. Donald Audette, benched for several games,
returned to the second line.
</P>
<P>
   Len Barrie, who scored two goals Thursday as the first-line
center, also popped up on the third and fourth lines against the
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings haven't had much good news about goaltender Jamie
Storr, who has had trouble recovering from a concussion suffered
Dec. 11 in Montreal. But Storr has been skating lightly the past
two days after doctors cleared him to step up his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said he could do more than the exercise bike, so we let him
go out there and shoot around some pucks. But he is still a long
ways off.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coaches don't participate in the skills competition,
Murray is spending the next few days in Minnesota with his family
before returning Monday for practice.

GOP CANDIDATES REDIRECT THEIR FIRE TOWARD DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>

   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A day after an aggressive and sometimes
vitriolic encounter in New Hampshire, the Republicans went easier
on each other in debate Friday night, this time turning much of
their fire on President Clinton and the Democratic candidates for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain took several shots at the Democrats, mocking
Gore's 1997 comment that there had been ``no controlling legal
authority'' barring him from making fund-raising calls from his
office. And McCain called it ``disgraceful'' that Gore had said at
a recent debate that senior appointees to military posts would be
judged on whether they would support allowing homosexuals to serve
in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a total destruction of the entire concept of the
military, and we as Americans should reject such a thing,'' said
the Arizona senator who endorsed the current ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Friday night Gore backed away from his statement, saying
he had not meant to imply ``that there should ever be a personal
inquiry into the political views'' of military appointees, putting
him closer to his opponent Bill Bradley, the former senator, who
also favors allowing openly gay people into the military.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against the Democrats was begun by the publisher
Steve Forbes, who accused Gore's campaign manager, Donna Brazile,
of making ``racist remarks'' and said she should be fired for her
suggestion that Republicans had no interest in helping black
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, you're absolutely right,'' Gary L. Bauer replied with
zest. ``Let me just say to the good people in this audience, You
have watched for 10 years while the Democratic Party has tried to
smear our party with charges about racism, with charges about not
caring about the poor, with all kinds of scare tactics.'' Bauer
added, ``Al Gore's campaign manager ought to be ashamed of herself
and she ought to resign tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by the South Carolina Republican Party,
featured a crazy-quilt format, which included e-mail inquiries,
questions from the audience and rapid responses limited at some
points to two sentences. The audience of 3,000 often booed and
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whose performance in some earlier
debates was criticized as lackluster, seemed almost totally at
ease, even when questioners tried to pin him down on the incendiary
issue here of whether the Confederate flag should be flown over the
Capitol. The very question posed by the MSNBC moderator, Brian
Williams, drew loud boos from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said repeatedly that he believes that South Carolinians
should be left to decide the fate of that flag and that a candidate
for president should not meddle. But Williams asked him if he was
personally offended by the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're trying to get me do is express the will of the
people of South Carolina,'' he said. ``I believe the people of
South Carolina can figure out what to do with this flag issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams tried a different tack: Did Bush have a visceral
reaction, as an American citizen, to seeing the flag?
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American citizen,'' Bush said, ``I trust the people of
South Carolina to make the decision for South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, McCain was put on the defensive
over reports that he had intervened before the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of companies whose executives
are donors to his campaign. He was asked about an Associated Press
report that two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser
for him, he sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing
them of being unfair toward the phone company's proposed merger
with another Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   Once again McCain said that his role as chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee was to ``oversight bureaucracies. ``I will
continue to do that job,'' he said. He added that ``I believe that
people like me should weigh in, particularly when it is my
responsibility as chairman of the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not the only one whom the panel of questioners sought to
put on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, whose opposition to abortion is a cornerstone of his
campaign, was asked what he would say to his daughter if she were
raped and wanted to end the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would comfort her, I would pray with her, I would explain
that she couldn't make right the terrible thing that had happened
to her by taking the life of an innocent, unborn child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the second between the Republican candidates in
two days, reflecting the accelerating pace of the 2000 campaign.
And it capped a week of intensified competition between Bush and
his chief challenger, McCain, in which the two men have sparred
over tax cuts, Social Security and the overhaul of the campaign
finance law.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most revealing segments of the evening came when each
candidate was asked to name the biggest mistake he had made as an
adult and what he had learned from it.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, the radio commentator, railed at the question,
saying it was invasive and intrusive and more fittingly discussed
in confession with a priest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain started off with humor, saying that he had thought his
biggest mistake may have come during his years in the Navy when he
raised his hand after a disastrous fire on his aircraft carrier to
volunteer to serve on another carrier. He was later shot down and
held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   But then he became serious and said his biggest error was
meeting with federal regulators years ago on behalf of Charles H.
Keating Jr., a corrupt savings and loan association operator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stuck with comedy for his own answer, in the process
bringing up his mother, who is highly popular in South Carolina.
Referring to reports of his raucus past, he said: ``Well, as you
know, I've had a perfect background. After all, I was raised by
Barbara Bush.'' The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Then he mentioned his former position as managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. ``I signed off on that
wonderful transaction, Sammy Sosa for Harold Baines.'' Sosa has
since become one of the most prolific homerun hitters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's primary comes less than three weeks after New
Hampshire's. It is the first of the Southern primaries and has
often been pivotal in the fight for the Republican presidential
nomination. McCain, who is running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire
but well behind him nationally, considers the state critical to any
chance he has of pulling off an upset. He is trying to mobilize the
state's large numbers of veterans and active duty military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New Hampshire, however, South Carolina does not have a
history of propelling mavericks forward. It has been more likely to
restore the fortunes of front-runners who stumbled in New Hampshire
or Iowa. Four years ago, for example, it was where Bob Dole
effectively put an end to the campaign of Patrick J. Buchanan, who
had won New Hampshire with his appeal to conservatives and the
economically downtrodden. And this time much of the state's
political establishment has rallied around Bush.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republicans are also considered more conservative
than those in New Hampshire, with the candidates vying for the
support of the Christian right who make up a large portion of the
electorate.

GORE BACKTRACKS ON LITMUS TEST ON GAYS FOR MILITARY CHIEFS

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore backtracked Friday
night on comments he made in a debate Wednesday when he said he
would require any appointee to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree
in advance to let gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of
inquiry into the personal political opinion of the officers in the
U.S. military,'' Gore told reporters at a quickly assembled news
conference in Des Moines on Friday night after questions began
mounting about his intent.
</P>
<P>
   At a debate in New Hampshire on Wednesday night, the vice
president said he would require such a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff that that individual support my policy, and yes, I would
make that a requirement,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Friday put him in line with his opponent for the
Democratic nomination for president, former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also said that current law should be changed to
allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military. But when asked
in Wednesday's debate about a litmus test on the issue for his
appointees to the Joint Chiefs, he said only that, if he were
elected, he would expect military leaders that he appointed to
carry out his orders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced in Friday night's debate with Republican
candidates for president when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a
veteran of the Vietnam War, called Gore's Wednesday remarks
``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More so than in any other presidential campaign, Democrats are
appealing to gays this year, particularly in California and New
York where there are many gay voters, and where a very significant
number of delegates will be chosen in primaries March 7. But
homosexuality is still a sensitive issue in many areas of the
country, and support for having gays serve in the military could
hurt Gore in the South in the general election if he became the
nominee. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's public retraction _ his press secretary, Chris Lehane,
called it a ``clarification'' _ came within an hour of his attempt
to clear up another campaign embarrassment, this one fostered by
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile had said in a recent interview that Republicans used
blacks like Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, for photo opportunities but did not really care about
them. Gore called Powell on Friday night and told reporters at the
same news conference that he had ``reaffirmed my respect'' for the
general. He refused to say whether he had apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Friday that he had been misheard Wednesday. ``That is
not what I meant to convey _ that's what you heard,'' he told
reporters here tonight in the corner of a high school gymnasium
after a pep rally. Even so, his remarks Wednesday night seemed
unequivocal. Asked if he would tolerate dissent among the top
officers, he said, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks had been widely criticized by military leaders
and former military officials. Even in his own campaign, there was
reaction to Gore's remarks Friday. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a
Vietnam veteran, said commanders of small, specialized units should
be allowed to choose members without the hindrance of broad
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has been openly courting black voters and
homosexual voters, and Gore's backtracking Friday night on the
litmus test and on Ms. Brazile's comments suggested that the
campaign had perhaps gone too far on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   There was an odd confluence of these two episodes in the person
of Powell, one of the most popular figures in America. He objected
in 1993 to President Clinton's attempt to allow gays to serve
openly in the military, which resulted in the compromise of the
``don't ask, don't tell policy.'' But as someone who has
traditionally remained above the political fray, he did not comment
on Gore's suggestion Wednesday on the litmus test. But he did
respond to Ms. Brazile's comments, sending a note to Gore that he
had been ``disappointed and offended'' by them. Gore, like Bradley,
has put an especially strong emphasis on the gay vote in this
campaign, appealing directly to homosexuals in speeches, meetings
with gay leaders and in policy positions. In New York, both have
slated openly gay delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore did not back down Friday night from his commitment
to allowing gays to serve openly in the military. But his comments
were a reflection of the difficulty that any commander-in-chief
would have in implementing it. ``You have to have a determination
to implement it if that kind of change is going to take place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But before Gore backpedaled on the litmus test, some of his
supporters said they believed Bradley had proved more politically
adept than Gore at winning over gay supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals have found increasing strength at the ballot box.
People who identify themselves as gay make up between 8 percent and
9 percent of the primary electorate nationwide and a bit more in
New York and California, according to polls of voters leaving the
booths in previous elections. In general elections, they account
for about 5 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers believe that while Bradley is newer to his
overt commitment to gay rights than Gore, he has gained traction in
the gay community for two reasons. One is that Gore suffers by
association with President Clinton. Although Clinton was the first
presidential candidate to openly court gays, many were disenchanted
with his compromise on gays in the military, settling for a ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy that now even Clinton has called
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that some Gore supporters think Bradley has
out-foxed Gore in the race for gay votes. ``Gore has a stronger
record over a longer period of time of being a leader on these
issues,'' said Richard Socarides, until recently the Clinton
administration official who oversaw gay and lesbian issues. ``But
it's frustrating because he's been out-maneuvered on tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Gore has long argued privately within the
administration to allow gays to serve openly in the military, it
was Bradley who first said publicly in this campaign that he
favored such a policy. Gore did not publicly declare his support
for the policy until after Hillary Clinton and then the president
both criticized the current policy. This played into the damaging
perception that Gore is a politician who waits for political cover
before taking a bold position.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore has been looking for ways to distinguish
himself on matters of interest to homosexuals. Gore supporters said
that the sharper comments at Wednesday night's debate _ while not
planned because the litmus-test question was not foreseen _ stemmed
from Gore's long-held belief that gays should serve openly but also
from his need to try to gain an edge over Bradley and separate
himself from the Clinton compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Giske, a vice chairman of the New York State Democratic
Party and one of the lesbian leaders whom Gore is to meet with
Monday in New York, said that while she was watching Gore's
comments at the debate, she thought, ``Of course he is looking for
a way to put his own stamp on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   California and New York are home to significant blocs of gay
voters, and for the first time in presidential politics, those
voters are now themselves part of a calculated strategy to win the
Democratic nomination. Homosexuals figure as prominently in Gore's
plans to stop Bradley as do African-Americans and organized labor,
while Bradley is counting on them to help transform his insurgent
candidacy into the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time there's been a competition in any
presidential primary for the gay and lesbian vote,'' said Jeff
Trammell, Gore's top adviser on gay issues. ``It's part of the
coming of age politically for gay and lesbian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different in this election is not only the competition
for the gay vote but that the gay vote is now perceived to be
significant enough to form part of Gore's bedrock strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The current thinking inside the Gore camp goes like this: Gore
is poised to win the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24 but is neck and neck
with Bradley in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1. If New Hampshire
legitimizes Bradley, New York, which votes March 7 and is already
extremely receptive to Bradley, could follow suit. In that case,
California, which also votes March 7, becomes all the more critical
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is counting on organized labor and minorities to help
him in New York, he is also relying on homosexuals to stop any
Bradley momentum in California, advisers said. Turnout among gays
could be higher than usual in California this year because of an
initiative on the ballot to ban same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said that the vice president's comments reflected
a growing consensus that supporting gay rights is not as
politically perilous as it once was, particularly since several
recent high-profile murders of gays.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in December found that 70 percent of Americans
support allowing gays in the military (although 76 percent of those
in senior military ranks are opposed).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Bradley are sensing a change in public opinion,''
said Aaron Belkin, an assistant professor of political science at
the University of California at Santa Barbara and director of a
center that studies gays in the military. ``The issue has become
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``they really want the gay votes in
California. Both are coming from exactly the same position, they're
just trying to outflank each other.''

Detroit Tigers slugger. Aviva Kempner and her brother, Jonathan,
knew of Greenberg from their father, Harold, who left Lithuania for
Pittsburgh in 1925 and settled in Detroit. To Harold Kempner,

   LUCIE-AUBRAC-VIDEO (Undated) _ In 1943 in Lyon, France, at the

Nothing like a little Gallic news from home to rally a man.
Unfortunately, Raymond (Daniel Auteuil) is suspected by the state
attorney of belonging to the Resistance, which means he won't be
curling up with Lucie (Carole Bouquet) for quite a while, if ever.
It is at this point that we begin to appreciate the differences
between a thriller from the French director Claude Berri, a student

   FEDERAL-THEATER-PROJECT (New York) _ Hallie Flanagan
(1890-1969), who headed the Federal Theater Project in its brave

Rock,'' treats her deservedly as a heroine of America's one effort
to create what she envisioned as a free, adult, uncensored theater.
But in trying to reproduce the commotions of the 1930s, the film

   WRONG-MOUNTAIN-THEATER (New York) _ David Hirson's second play,
``Wrong Mountain,'' will open on Thursday at Eugene O'Neill
Theater. His first play ``La Bete,'' set in 17th-century France,
opened at the same theater on Feb. 10, 1991, and very shortly
became one of the most famous flops in Broadway history. ``Wrong
Mountain,'' directed by Richard Jones, who also directed ``La
Bete,'' makes demands on the audience to see in the lives of
artists, reflections of their own existential problems. This time
Hirson's play has a contemporary setting, and it is written in
nonrhyming prose, the story of Henry Dennett, 60, an embittered,
unappreciated poet who, infuriated by the presumption of his
ex-wife's new boyfriend, a popular playwright named Guy Halperin,
makes a bet that he can write a play and have it produced. By Bruce

about the song recital for some time. As an art form the song
recital has been languishing, she says, which is why seven years
ago she set up a foundation to do something about it. Ms. Horne
speaks of the problem with considerable authority. Besides being
one of the great operatic mezzo-sopranos in history, she has been
an devoted recitalist. She lost count of total number of recitals
she has given when the tally topped 1,300 a few years back. By

Europe and America. And though some mavens have demurred, the hype
has been buttressed by albums remarkable for both artistic quality

   20TH-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The 20th century was, in musical

customary complaints of audiences encountering new music, whether
Igor Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' John Coltrane's ``Ascension''
or Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock rendition of the national anthem. I'm
referring, rather, to the way that 20th-century composers have
embraced sounds _ environmental, industrial, often random _ and
thereby laid siege to inherited notions of musical order. If last
century's avant-garde taught us anything, it is that such
disturbances can be the stuff of art. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).  &QL;

celebrated his 30th birthday, in 1890, he was already an
exceptional painter. Equally comfortable with portraits, still
lifes, domestic interiors and seascapes, he had learned what he
wanted from his French Impressionist contemporaries and was now
going his own way. Yet, when he died in 1949, aged 89, he was a
relatively marginal figure, regarded as something of an eccentric
by his fellow Belgians and known abroad principally for the
sinister masked figures and skeletons that peopled many of his
paintings, drawings and etchings. But talented he was, above all in
his early years, as quickly becomes apparent in a major

descend it, makes you feel like an affluent if doomed character in
a turn-of-the-last-century Edith Wharton novel. But you probably

JOHNSON GETTING HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This could be the day Rob Johnson becomes a great
USC quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, time out, Trojans fans are saying. It's been five years
since Johnson peeled off the cardinal and gold. The annals of the
school's great quarterbacks are closed at least until Carson Palmer
throws his next touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's technically too late for Johnson, who ended his USC
career in 1994 distinguished as the leader of the first four-year
class that never defeated UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But I also know how it works on campuses everywhere: It doesn't
matter how insignificant or even despised you were when you were
there, as long as you bring glory to the old school in your
professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a girl who's too shy to raise her hand in typing class
blossoms into an Oscar winner, and the high school that ``made
her'' names the library for her.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, an athlete who's better known to the campus police chief
than to his coach matures into an all-pro, and his college boasts
about its latest star ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there's hope for Rob Johnson if he can quarterback the
11-5 Buffalo Bills to an upset of the 13-3 Tennessee Titans today
in the strongest game of the NFL's wild-card playoff weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, playing for his second NFL team, he's finally getting
another shot at winning the big one that eluded him in college.
</P>
<P>
   In upstate New York this week, there have been enough tears shed
for Doug Flutie, the quarterback Johnson replaces, to make Lake
Erie overflow.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Bills to the playoffs, Flutie has been pushed
aside by head coach Wade Phillips after Johnson has one winning
performance inan anything-but-pivotal regular-season finale against
the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange move, benching a veteran with a reputation for
miracles, inserting a guy with a grand total of eight NFL starts.
</P>
<P>
   But look at it from Johnson's end, and they're feeling sorry for
the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   How'd you like to go through life remembered for letting down
half a city, always a heartbeat away from a chance to prove
yourself, never quite getting the chance?
</P>
<P>
   That's been Rob Johnson the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in fact, a great quarterback by every measure except the
one by which Trojans are ultimately measured _ number of victories
over UCLA and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   After three years as the starter he was USC's all-time leading
quarterback, first in completions (678), percentage (.646), yards
(8,472) and touchdown passes (58). He still holds those records.
</P>
<P>
   But he was 0-5-1 (the tie with Notre Dame in 1994 in Johnson's
final game at the Coliseum) against USC's two rivals. And although
it wasn't all his fault there wasn't much of a running game to
support him fans can't excuse his interception in the end zone at
the end of the 1993 loss to UCLA that cost the Trojans a Rose Bowl
berth or his painfully similar error the following year in the same
game.
</P>
<P>
   A Newport Beach native, son of a football coach (Bob), brother
of a CFL quarterback (Bret), cousin of a major-league pitcher
(Bart), 6-foot-4 and built to throw the deep routes, Johnson was
one of those guys for whom everything seemed to come easy.
</P>
<P>
   It was just as easy for his critics to question his footwork,
his decisiveness and his judgment with big games in the balance.
They saw a perfectionist who didn't know when throwing a pass away
_ instead of taking a sack or risking an interception _ was the
better part of valor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why, having once been labeled a Heisman Trophy
candidate and likely top quarterback in the 1995 NFL draft, he
dropped all the way to the fourth round before the Jacksonville
Jaguars took him. Among the six quarterbacks to go before Johnson
was Steve McNair, his opponent today in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   If they had a Hall of Fame for exhibition-game quarterbacks,
they'd waive the five-year waiting period for Johnson. But in his
first three regular seasons he threw just 35 passes while backing
up Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a trade to Buffalo and a five-year, $25 million
contract but, so far, more frustration. He began 1998 as the Bills
starter, got hurt, watched Flutie work his magic. He was back on
the bench for the first 15 games of 1999 ...
</P>
<P>
   And now a chance, the biggest game of his pro career. Johnson is
only one NFL quarterback with something to prove in these playoffs.
Seven of the 12 scheduled starters will be making their playoff
debuts. Only Jacksonville's Brunell, Dallas' Troy Aikman and
Miami's Dan Marino _ who also has something to prove after 16 great
seasons without a championship _ have ever won a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bills lose, Johnson might be in for more abuse. A Toronto
columnist has predicted Flutie will have to bail them out ``when
Johnson can't hack it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bills win, the impact might be felt in Los Angeles. Maybe
all those big-game losses at USC weren't his fault after all.

BUSH WOULD USE FORCE TO TAKE BACK PANAMA CANAL IF EVER CLOSED TO
FREE COMMERCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Confederate flags, the Clinton administration
and personal shortcomings were issues of contention for six
Republican presidential candidates debating for the second night in
a row Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush engaged in major saber-rattling for
the conservatives and military presence in South Carolina by
declaring that he would use force to take back the Panama Canal if
it is ever closed to free commerce. The canal was officially turned
over to Panama on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do whatever it takes to keep the canal open. It is in
our national strategic interest to have a peaceful hemisphere,''
Bush said. ``I'll liberate the canal if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, meanwhile, found himself again
explaining another letter he wrote, as chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, to the Federal Communications Commission on
behalf of a campaign contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McCain was questioned about a letter he wrote
to the FCC on behalf of Paxson Communications, run by a contributor
whose jet he leases, when it wanted to buy a television station.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was questioned Friday about a letter to regulators at the
FCC last April in which he said he was ``extremely troubled'' by
delays in their handling of the merger of Ameritech with SBC
Communications. The letter was written less than two weeks after an
Ameritech executive hosted a political fund-raiser for McCain in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a constituent of mine, a person of this country, can't
get an answer from a bureaucracy that's being paid for with their
tax dollars, I believe that people like me should weigh in,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was sponsored by the South Carolina Republican Party
as part of its Silver Elephant Dinner honoring Sen. Strom Thurmond.
Other GOP contenders who participated included conservative
activists Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, publisher Steve Forbes and
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is a battleground state for McCain and Bush, with
both advertising heavily here. McCain wants to win New Hampshire on
Feb. 1, South Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb.
22 to gain the momentum to catch up with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent poll here, conducted Dec. 6-19 by KPC
Research for local news media, showed Bush leading in South
Carolina 54 percent to McCain's 21 percent. All other candidates
were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked his personal reaction to the Confederate flag, a
seemingly straightforward question but a contentious local issue
because South Carolinians are debating whether a depiction of the
rebel colors should be removed from state flag. The NAACP has
called for a tourism boycott of the state until the state flag is
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dodged the question, saying he was not going to be drawn
into a local battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with
the flag issue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to a question of what was the greatest mistake of
their adult lives, most of the candidates used the occasion to
criticize President Clinton while avoiding answers too personally
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made my share of personal mistakes. Fortunately, none of
us here put together tonight will match what has been done in the
White House in the last 7 1/2 years,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said the biggest mistake of his life was meeting with
federal banking regulators, along with four other senators, on
behalf of Arizona savings and loan executive Charles Keating. When
Keating's financial empire collapsed as part of the savings and
loan crisis of the late 1980s, the federal government was stuck
picking up the $2.6 billion tab. McCain has always maintained he
did nothing wrong, but that he regrets his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that will always be a mark on my record and
something that people will judge me for for the rest of my life,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who previously has said he was once ``young and
irresponsible,'' was almost flippant in his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I've had a perfect background. After all, I was
raised by Barbara Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his biggest mistake was, when he was managing partner
of the Texas Rangers baseball club, he traded away Sammy Sosa for
Harold Baines of the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who later become a member of the Chicago Cubs, went on to
become one of the leading home run hitters of recent years.

GORE BACKTRACKS ON LITMUS TEST FOR MILITARY CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore backtracked Friday
night on comments he made in a debate Wednesday when he said he
would require any appointee to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree
in advance to let gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of
inquiry into the personal political opinion of the officers in the
U.S. military,'' Gore told reporters at a quickly assembled news
conference in Des Moines on Friday night after questions began
mounting about his intent.
</P>
<P>
   At a debate in New Hampshire on Wednesday night, the vice
president said he would require such a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff that that individual support my policy, and yes, I would
make that a requirement,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Friday put him in line with his opponent for the
Democratic nomination for president, former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also said that current law should be changed to
allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military. But when asked
in Wednesday's debate about a litmus test on the issue for his
appointees to the Joint Chiefs, he said only that, if he were
elected, he would expect military leaders that he appointed to
carry out his orders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced in Friday night's debate with Republican
candidates for president when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a
veteran of the Vietnam War, called Gore's Wednesday remarks
``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More so than in any other presidential campaign, Democrats are
appealing to gays this year, particularly in California and New
York where there are many gay voters, and where a very significant
number of delegates will be chosen in primaries March 7. But
homosexuality is still a sensitive issue in many areas of the
country, and support for having gays serve in the military could
hurt Gore in the South in the general election if he became the
nominee. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's public retraction _ his press secretary, Chris Lehane,
called it a ``clarification'' _ came within an hour of his attempt
to clear up another campaign embarrassment, this one fostered by
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile had said in a recent interview that Republicans used
blacks like Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, for photo opportunities but did not really care about
them. Gore called Powell on Friday night and told reporters at the
same news conference that he had ``reaffirmed my respect'' for the
general. He refused to say whether he had apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Friday that he had been misheard Wednesday. ``That is
not what I meant to convey _ that's what you heard,'' he told
reporters here tonight in the corner of a high school gymnasium
after a pep rally. Even so, his remarks Wednesday night seemed
unequivocal. Asked if he would tolerate dissent among the top
officers, he said, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks had been widely criticized by military leaders
and former military officials. Even in his own campaign, there was
reaction to Gore's remarks Friday. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a
Vietnam veteran, said commanders of small, specialized units should
be allowed to choose members without the hindrance of broad
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has been openly courting black voters and
homosexual voters, and Gore's backtracking Friday night on the
litmus test and on Ms. Brazile's comments suggested that the
campaign had perhaps gone too far on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   There was an odd confluence of these two episodes in the person
of Powell, one of the most popular figures in America. He objected
in 1993 to President Clinton's attempt to allow gays to serve
openly in the military, which resulted in the compromise of the
``don't ask, don't tell policy.'' But as someone who has
traditionally remained above the political fray, he did not comment
on Gore's suggestion Wednesday on the litmus test. But he did
respond to Ms. Brazile's comments, sending a note to Gore that he
had been ``disappointed and offended'' by them. Gore, like Bradley,
has put an especially strong emphasis on the gay vote in this
campaign, appealing directly to homosexuals in speeches, meetings
with gay leaders and in policy positions. In New York, both have
slated openly gay delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore did not back down Friday night from his commitment
to allowing gays to serve openly in the military. But his comments
were a reflection of the difficulty that any commander-in-chief
would have in implementing it. ``You have to have a determination
to implement it if that kind of change is going to take place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But before Gore backpedaled on the litmus test, some of his
supporters said they believed Bradley had proved more politically
adept than Gore at winning over gay supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals have found increasing strength at the ballot box.
People who identify themselves as gay make up between 8 percent and
9 percent of the primary electorate nationwide and a bit more in
New York and California, according to polls of voters leaving the
booths in previous elections. In general elections, they account
for about 5 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore advisers believe that while Bradley is newer to his
overt commitment to gay rights than Gore, he has gained traction in
the gay community for two reasons. One is that Gore suffers by
association with President Clinton. Although Clinton was the first
presidential candidate to openly court gays, many were disenchanted
with his compromise on gays in the military, settling for a ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy that now even Clinton has called
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that some Gore supporters think Bradley has
out-foxed Gore in the race for gay votes. ``Gore has a stronger
record over a longer period of time of being a leader on these
issues,'' said Richard Socarides, until recently the Clinton
administration official who oversaw gay and lesbian issues. ``But
it's frustrating because he's been out-maneuvered on tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Gore has long argued privately within the
administration to allow gays to serve openly in the military, it
was Bradley who first said publicly in this campaign that he
favored such a policy. Gore did not publicly declare his support
for the policy until after Hillary Clinton and then the president
both criticized the current policy. This played into the damaging
perception that Gore is a politician who waits for political cover
before taking a bold position.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore has been looking for ways to distinguish
himself on matters of interest to homosexuals. Gore supporters said
that the sharper comments at Wednesday night's debate _ while not
planned because the litmus-test question was not foreseen _ stemmed
from Gore's long-held belief that gays should serve openly but also
from his need to try to gain an edge over Bradley and separate
himself from the Clinton compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Giske, a vice chairman of the New York State Democratic
Party and one of the lesbian leaders whom Gore is to meet with
Monday in New York, said that while she was watching Gore's
comments at the debate, she thought, ``Of course he is looking for
a way to put his own stamp on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   California and New York are home to significant blocs of gay
voters, and for the first time in presidential politics, those
voters are now themselves part of a calculated strategy to win the
Democratic nomination. Homosexuals figure as prominently in Gore's
plans to stop Bradley as do African-Americans and organized labor,
while Bradley is counting on them to help transform his insurgent
candidacy into the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time there's been a competition in any
presidential primary for the gay and lesbian vote,'' said Jeff
Trammell, Gore's top adviser on gay issues. ``It's part of the
coming of age politically for gay and lesbian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different in this election is not only the competition
for the gay vote but that the gay vote is now perceived to be
significant enough to form part of Gore's bedrock strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The current thinking inside the Gore camp goes like this: Gore
is poised to win the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24 but is neck and neck
with Bradley in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1. If New Hampshire
legitimizes Bradley, New York, which votes March 7 and is already
extremely receptive to Bradley, could follow suit. In that case,
California, which also votes March 7, becomes all the more critical
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is counting on organized labor and minorities to help
him in New York, he is also relying on homosexuals to stop any
Bradley momentum in California, advisers said. Turnout among gays
could be higher than usual in California this year because of an
initiative on the ballot to ban same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said that the vice president's comments reflected
a growing consensus that supporting gay rights is not as
politically perilous as it once was, particularly since several
recent high-profile murders of gays.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in December found that 70 percent of Americans
support allowing gays in the military (although 76 percent of those
in senior military ranks are opposed).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Bradley are sensing a change in public opinion,''
said Aaron Belkin, an assistant professor of political science at
the University of California at Santa Barbara and director of a
center that studies gays in the military. ``The issue has become
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``they really want the gay votes in
California. Both are coming from exactly the same position, they're
just trying to outflank each other.''

<P>
   On a bitter cold afternoon last fall, a handful of Russian
scientists gathered at a cemetery in Siberia for an impromptu
ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of what was
once the Soviet Union's largest laboratory for developing viral
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lev Sandakhchiev, the director of the lab, known as Vector,
situated in the town of Koltsovo, raised a plastic cup of vodka to
the memory of Dr. Nikolai Ustinov, a scientist who died in the
spring of 1988 after accidentally infecting himself with the
Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic killer that he and his colleagues were
trying to perfect as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Ustinov's widow, Yevgenia, at the foot of her
husband's still-contaminated grave, Sandakhchiev, toasted their
fallen colleague and friend, who documented the progress of the
disease as it ravaged him, in a diary stained in his own blood.
``Thank God it is over,'' Sandakhchiev said, as tears streamed down
his face.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly a decade since the fall of the Soviet Union,
Sandakhchiev, quietly aided by the United States, says he has been
steering Vector, or the State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology, away from its past and toward peaceful research.
Rather than using germs to kill people, he says, Vector _ which was
a secret place that did not appear on maps _ is now trying to save
people, and itself in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. intelligence analysts and congressional staff members
remain wary of Vector's research and fearful that Russia may still
be conducting secret germ warfare work at closed military sites and
institutes. But administration officials and scientists who have
toured the lab _ once the crown jewel of the Soviet germ warfare
empire _ say the administration's investment to transform Vector
seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has endorsed a proposal backed by
President Clinton to conduct research into smallpox vaccines and
anti-viral drugs at both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and at Vector, a decision that helped cement
Vector's status as a legitimate player in international science.
</P>
<P>
   Given such developments, U.S. officials and germ warfare experts
say, Vector has quietly been removed from the administration's
``threat'' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mention of Vector used to send shivers down the spines of
intelligence analysts,'' said Amy Smithson, a germ and chemical
warfare specialist at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington,
and the author of a new study of the administration's programs to
reduce the threat of the former Soviet Union's germ warfare
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with all of Sandakhchiev's changes and the frequent
visitor traffic in and out of there, Vector hardly rates as a
concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once part of a closed Soviet city, Vector has
increasingly welcomed foreign scientists. In September, the center
played host to more than 50 American and foreign scientists at a
conference financed in part by the United States. It also gave a
reporter an unprecedented tour of laboratories where the most
sensitive germ research was once conducted and allowed Vector's
scientists to discuss their previous smallpox research and other
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and officials say Vector scientists are now joining
forces with American and European scientists in various commercial
and nonprofit research ventures: making diagnostic kits for markets
in the former Soviet Union, enriched milk for children, interferon
and antibodies, even cosmetics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one project, Vector scientists and two American biotech
companies are developing a powerful new anti-viral drug that was
tested last year at Vector and that they hope will help neutralize
Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers, thus reducing the threat of
bioterrorism, or will replace other drugs to which bacteria and
viruses have grown increasing resistant.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of transformation has been neither smooth nor easy.
Enmeshed in Soviet-style secrecy and nationalism, hardliners in
Russia have resisted scientific exchanges and Vector's growing ties
to the West, U.S. officials and Russian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, skeptics in Congress and national security
circles also initially opposed the administration's attempts to
finance the center's transformation, warning that Russia might use
U.S. aid to continue offensive germ research at other, still-closed
labs.
</P>
<P>
   But several key critics of the program were surprised when the
administration quietly informed Congress earlier last year that
Vector had rebuffed potentially lucrative offers from Iran to buy
products, technology and scientific expertise. Detailed audits of
Vector's grants show that the millions of dollars invested by
Washington _ which now account for about half of Vector's annual
budget _ have been spent as Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress substantially increased the Pentagon's
request to finance programs to open Russia's germ labs, bringing
the total to $14 million. While the State Department has yet to
decide how to allocate the money, its biological programs could get
as much as $48 million, more than three times last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Daily life at the isolated installation remains difficult,
however. Vector, deprived of most Russian government funds, now
struggles to get by with about 2,200 scientists _ less than half
the number who worked at the lab during its heyday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Ken Alibek, a defector who was a top official
in Moscow's germ warfare program, smallpox had long been the Soviet
Union's strategic biological weapon of choice. ``Moscow,'' he wrote
in ``BioHazard,'' a book published last year by Random House, ``had
stored up to 20 tons of the virus at other facilities to ensure
that Moscow would never be caught short.'' Those stocks have since
been destroyed, say Alibek and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his country had promised to end its germ weapons
program, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, financed the
construction of dozens of installations at Vector for the smallpox
weapon project in the 1980s, soon after the World Health
Organization had unwittingly declared the ancient scourge
eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those installations are empty, unfinished or
deteriorating through neglect. A giant viral reactor built then has
been dismantled, and Vector has lacked money even to buy monkeys
for tests since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what was planned for this facility, we were lucky that
communism ended when it did,'' said an administration official who
follows biological issues closely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the administration's conversion strategy has
involved the World Health Organization, some of whose scientists
have been suspicious of Vector ever since they learned that the lab
once carried out secret germ research in violation of a 1972 treaty
banning germ weapons, which the Soviet Union had signed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Russia quietly moved to Vector its collection of
smallpox strains from the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in
Moscow, although the WHO had designated Ivanovsky as the only
official storage site in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO quickly visited Vector and designated it as the official
site, but the move raised suspicions. Sandakhchiev asserted in an
interview that the strains had been moved merely because Russia
faced a terrorist threat from war in Chechnya and Vector provided a
more secure site for Russia's 120 different smallpox isolates _ the
world's largest collection, twice the size of America's.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about smallpox intensified this year after Alibek and
others warned that strains of the deadly virus had found their way
to Iraq, North Korea and other countries and that therefore the
supposedly eradicated disease still posed a threat to a now
unvaccinated world.
</P>
<P>
   Based on such reports, Clinton reversed his earlier support for
the WHO's decision to destroy the virus at the two declared storage
sites in Atlanta and at Vector. In Geneva in May, Washington led a
successful campaign within the WHO to defer destroying the virus
and to endorse research on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Sergei Shchelkunov, a leading smallpox
expert at Vector, said more work was now needed to understand the
virulence and peculiarities of all the strains, which should help
to develop new vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1991, Dr. Alexander Guskev, a Vector scientist,
led a team more than 2,400 miles across Siberia to the tiny town of
Chersky, north of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   There the scientists unearthed in the deep permafrost the
still-frozen bodies of people wrapped in deer skin shrouds and
buried in pits who were thought to have died of smallpox nearly 145
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Guskev insisted that his goal was not to find more smallpox
strains, which were plentiful at Vector. The mission's goal, he
insisted, showing visitors videos of the expedition, was to
disinfect the cemetery of what might be a dangerous living virus.
</P>
<P>
   Initial biopsies of bone and skin fragments from the bodies
found no trace of the virus, he said. But the team returned the
following July and August and hit scientific pay-dirt _ frozen
bodies so well preserved that pox marks were still visible. ``But
when we returned to Vector, we found that we couldn't isolate or
revive the virus-like particles,'' Guskev said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to return to another permafrost area next summer to
further his studies, although he now lacks funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such research is a luxury that Vector cannot afford and whose
medical application is debatable,'' an American military scientist
said. ``Until the past is truly dead and buried, I doubt that
anyone will fund it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandakhchiev, whom even Alibek praised for his ``determination
to protect his employees,'' seems eager to bury the past. ``All
labs like ours have a responsibility to be open and to share
information,'' he said in an interview. ``To fight disease and
inspire mutual trust, we must communicate with each other. That is
our future. There is no alternative.''

PLEA OF NOT GUILTY IN BRICK ATTACK ON WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rk) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man charged with attacking a woman with a brick
in Midtown Manhattan in November pleaded not guilty Friday and said
he was in his girlfriend's apartment in the Bronx at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Paris Drake, 32, is charged with attempted murder,
attempted robbery, assault and weapons possession in the attack on
Nicole Barrett, 27, a native of Texas. She was hit with a six-pound
paving stone on the afternoon of Nov. 16, and needed two brain
operations as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the incident, it was thought that the attacker
was homeless and mentally ill. The attack prompted a crackdown by
the Giuliani administration on homeless people who sleep on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   But from details presented Friday during the hearing in State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, it appeared that Drake was neither
homeless nor mentally ill. He had no history of psychiatric
problems and had lived at least temporarily with his girlfriend on
the Grand Concourse. A woman sat with his lawyers in the courtroom
Friday, holding an infant, but the lawyers would not identify her.
</P>
<P>
   And Drake is being represented by a lawyer, who has offices on
Park Avenue, who was hired by his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the attacker, and he's not the panhandler the press
has painted him,'' said the lawyer, Louis A. Zayas. ``Quite
frankly, I think they've got the wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got family members that care a great deal about him,''
Zayas said.
</P>
<P>
   In a police statement made public Friday, Drake said he was
unemployed and could not remember the last time he had worked. He
routinely spent his days on Eighth Avenue, between 34th and 41st
streets, where he bought almonds, crushed them and sold the powder,
pretending it was crack, the statement said. With the profits, he
took the subway to 146th Street, bought crack and got high,
according to the statement. He repeated the trip two or three times
a day, depending on how much money he made, he told the police.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was arrested after an inmate at Rikers Island told the
police that he had bragged about the crime after his Nov. 23 arrest
on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Drake first told the police he spent Monday, Nov. 15, going in
and out of the apartment on the Grand Concourse, buying crack and
food. But when asked how he spent Nov. 16, he said he had stayed in
the apartment both Monday and Tuesday, resting from the previous
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have said they thought prosecutors were
relying on too little evidence in charging Drake and that they
might have a difficult time convicting him. Officials have said
there are no fingerprints or other physical evidence to link him to
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   One of six witnesses who viewed a lineup identified Drake as the
suspect. But papers from the district attorney's office show that
another witness identified a photograph of a different person as
the attacker and had earlier identified a third person in a lineup
as the person who hit Ms. Barrett. The other witnesses failed to
pick Drake out of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   After the arraignment, Zayas said the police had found the wrong
person to charge in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire New York Police Department's detective bureau was
mobilized to find someone who was responsible for this,'' Zayas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution offered no new evidence against Drake Friday. If
convicted of all the offenses, he could be sentenced to 72 years in
prison. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, who has returned to her family in Texas, is
recovering faster than expected, but doctors have said she may have
permanent brain damage.

GORE'S COMMENTS ON JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are questions to Vice President Al Gore on gays in the
military Wednesday and his responses in the Democratic presidential
debate in Durham, N.H., as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you become president, will you nominate members of the
Joint Chiefs who only support your gay policy? In other words, will
it be a litmus test?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have rejected the notion of litmus tests on the Supreme
Court by saying that there are ways to find out the kind of
judgment somebody has without posing specific litmus tests.
</P>
<P>
   I think that it's a little different where the Joint Chiefs of
Staff are concerned because you're not interfering with an
independent judicial decision. As commander in chief, a president
is giving orders in effect or he is the superior of the officers
that are reporting to the commander in chief in the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, that President Harry Truman
brought about after World War II in integrating the military. And I
think that would require those who wanted to serve in on the
position of _ on the Joint Chiefs to be in agreement with that
policy. So, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, if I understand you correctly, you would only nominate
members of the Joint Chiefs if they supported your gay support __
</P>
<P>
   A. I would think _ here, I think that the new policy has to be
implemented in a way that accomplishes the goal and yet recognized
the practical challenges that the military leadership will have to
confront in making that change. I would insist, before appointing
anybody to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that that individual support
my policy. And, yes, I would make that a requirement.

EXCERPTS FROM THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-DEBATE) 
(EDS: The full text of the debate is available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics) 
(js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a Republican presidential debate
Friday night, involving Gary L. Bauer, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by The New York Times. The
debate was in West Columbia, S.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Next question to Senator McCain. Senator, I'm reading from
The Associated Press a few minutes ago this evening, and I read
``Two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him,
Sen. John McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators
accusing them of being unfair toward the phone company.'' Senator,
your letter went on to say that the letter was not meant to benefit
any one single person and you have said in your own defense that
this is part of what is wrong with Washington. However, do you
understand now the appearance here, and can you tell us here
tonight is there anything else about the transportation you use,
about the letters you have written, anything else that you know of
that is about to come out?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I have first of all no idea, but the fact is that again,
my job as chairman of the Committee of Commerce, Science and
Transportation is to oversight bureaucracies that are supposed to
be serving the people. The Federal Communications Commission has
not been doing that. All the times when I have weighed in, I have
asked them to do their duty and to expedite the procedures as they
are laid out under the law and according to existing regulations. I
will continue to do that job and when a constituent _ a person of
mine _ who has trouble _ or a citizen of this country _ who can't
get a reaction or an answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with
their tax dollars, I believe that people like me should weigh in,
particularly when it is my responsibility as the chairman of the
committee. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Governor Bush, a few blocks from here, on top of the state
capitol building, the Confederate flag flies with the state flag
and the U.S. flag. It is, as you can hear from the reaction of
tonight's crowd of 3,000 people from South Carolina, a hot button
issue here. The question is: Does the flag offend you personally?
...
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what
to do with this flag issue. It's the people of South Carolina __
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I may __
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I don't believe it's the role of someone from outside
South Carolina and someone running for president to come into this
state and tell the people of South Carolina what to do with their
business when it comes to the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As an American citizen, do you have a visceral reaction to
seeing the Confederate flag __
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: As an American citizen, I trust the people of South
Carolina to make the decision for South Carolina. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're also going to give the candidates a chance to ask each
other questions tonight and we begin with Mr. Forbes who has a
question for Mr. Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: Gary, you've obviously read in the papers about a key
official in the Gore campaign, Donna Brazile, who made very racist
remarks about General Powell and about Congressman J.C. Watts. I
believe, and I think you believe, and I hope we can get our
colleagues here tonight together to ask Al Gore to fire Donna
Brazile and apologize to two great Americans, J.C. Watts and
General Powell. Will you join me in that?
</P>
<P>
   BAUER: Steve, you're absolutely right. And let me just say to
the good people in this audience, you have watched for 10 years
while the Democratic Party has attempted to smear our party with
charges of racism, with charges of not caring about the poor, with
all sorts of scare tactics, that we don't care about the weak and
the sick and the handicapped. They do it time and time and time
again, and all too often our party in the face of that has run for
the tall grass. It is time for us to stand up. We are a party of
great principles. Al Gore's campaign manager ought to be ashamed of
herself, and she ought to resign tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Senator McCain, you will begin. All gentlemen will answer
this first question. Has affirmative action made America a better
nation?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Yes. But quotas have made it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gary Bauer. ...
</P>
<P>
   BAUER: I would agree. I think that the idea behind affirmative
action was legitimate and decent. But when you start counting by
race, you divide America ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gov. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Only if affirmative action means equal opportunity for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: Quotas and set-asides are wrong. And that's why we
genuinely need real affirmation of opportunity starting by letting
parents choose their own schools for their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Senator Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   HATCH: When affirmative action means job training, outreach and
education, it's good. When it starts pitting one group against
another through a system of preferences, it's bad. And I've got to
tell you quotas are wrong for America and I agree that equal
opportunity is what we should have for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ambassador Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: I think it may be more important to ask whether it's
helped the people it was supposed to help. And I think it has
actually hurt them by damaging the reputation of many minorities in
this country and not giving them credit for their real
achievements. And I think that's wrong. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Senator McCain and Governor Bush and gentlemen, starting with
the senator, the subject again is taxes.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Well, governor, I know your people are running around
saying that your tax cut is bigger than mine, that yours is bigger
than mine. I think the phrase they use is a tax gap between Bush
and McCain. I'm more concerned about the surplus gap. It's fiscally
irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus
that we may not have. My tax plan is fiscally conservative. It's
about the same as yours for middle-income and lower-income
Americans. It places a top priority on saving Social Security. It
offers a needed tax break for middle-income people and it begins
paying down the national debt. My friends, we ought to pay down the
national debt. George, the American people are tired of people who
make promises, who make promises about tax cuts that they can't
keep ...
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: The senator and I have a fundamental disagreement. Let me
see if I can put it in human terms for you. Chris and Beth Bradley
came to the airport today. They make $42,000 a year in income.
Under the plan that you laid out, senator, here in South Carolina,
they will receive a $200 tax cut. Under the plan that I proposed
and will give to the United States Congress, they receive $1,852
tax cut. I believe _ and the fundamental difference, the
fundamental difference is that the additional $1,600, the
difference will go to Washington under your idea. And under my idea
it goes into people's pockets. There is enough money to take care
of Social Security. There's enough money to meet the basic needs of
our government and there is enough money to give the American
people a substantial tax cut, and that's exactly what I'm going to
do.

   BRITAIN: EX-CABINET AIDE FREED
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Aitken, 57, a former Conservative Party cabinet
minister found guilty of perjury last year in a doomed libel
action, was freed from jail after serving seven months of an
18-month sentence. He must now spend months under curfew in his
London house, wearing an electronic ankle tag that allows his
movements to be monitored. Once considered a future leader of his
party, he is now planning to study theology at Oxford University.

   BRITAIN: SUPPORT FOR CANING
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of British parents want to see the return of
corporal punishment to schools, a survey for The Times of London
shows. Caning was outlawed in public schools 14 years ago and in
private ones last year, and teachers' union officials said there
was no chance of its return. They also said parents must share the
blame for discipline problems.

   Four ethnic Albanian men from Kosovo, held in Serbian jails
since July 1998 on terrorism charges, were freed after the case
against them was dismissed for lack of evidence, according to the
Humanitarian Law Center, a Belgrade human rights group. The four,
accused of attacking a police convoy, were handed over to
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
who escorted them to Kosovo.

   Infrastructure Minister Julio Montes has resigned amid local
press reports that he had opposed President Hugo Chavez's decision
to appoint an army general as head of a state-run agency that works
closely with Montes' department. Chavez has denied those accounts,
saying Montes stepped down because of a health problem, not because
he was alarmed at the growing role of the military in the

   Nearly 400 Colombian peasants who fled fighting between leftist

   KENYA: MARRIED WOMEN SEPARATE
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old woman in a western tribe has divorced her young
wife because of ``cruelty and violence.'' Some tribes allow women
to marry when an elderly widow has not had a son, and one is needed
to perpetuate the family line. The widow usually chooses the man
who is to father the child with the younger woman. Such marriages
are not recognized by law, but the court allowed the divorce after
village elders failed to resolve the problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Timothy Charles Venn Elliott, a Manhattan advertising
executive, died Dec. 30 at his home on the Upper East Side. He was
51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, his associates said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Elliott, a native of England, was the managing
director of the flagship office in New York of FCB Worldwide. He
had previously led Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dorset, Elliott was educated at Harrow School and
graduated from Cambridge University, earning a B.A. in 1969 and an
M.A. in 1974. In a 30-year-career in advertising, he worked for a
number of agencies, including Benton &AMP; Bowles in London and, for 15
years, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather in South Africa, Canada and eventually New
York, where he managed international accounts for companies like
American Express and Trans World Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He joined FCB Worldwide in New York in 1997 to handle its
Citibank business worldwide and moved to San Francisco to direct
its office there in 1998. He returned to New York last January to
take charge of that office.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is survived by his wife, Daryl Elliott, executive vice
president of Young &AMP; Rubicam in New York.

GRIZZLIES OUTREBOUND NETS IN 101-91 VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The prospect of witnessing history
apparently did not excite the sports market of Northern New Jersey
on Friday night. A crowd generously announced as 14,246 came to
Continental Arena to see the Nets try for a franchise record of 10
consecutive home victories when they played the Vancouver
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies are one of the worst teams in the National
Basketball Association, but they led the Nets most of the way and
left with a 101-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson led Vancouver with 28 points and Mike Bibby
had 20, including 4-of-6 shooting from 3-point range. Othella
Harrington, a Grizzlies forward, had 12 rebounds and Vancouver
finished with a 51-32 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles led the Nets with 21 points, and Stephon Marbury
had 19 to go with 11 assists. Keith Van Horn also had 19 points,
including three field goals from outside the arc as the Nets'
second-half comeback fell short.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies made all 21 of their free throws; the Nets were 12
of 16 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach Don Casey said the free-throw totals of both teams
gave a hint of the final outcome. The two Vancouver forwards,
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Harrington, were a combined 17 for 17 from
the line. Of Casey's two starting forwards, Kendall Gill was 5 for
6 and Van Horn was 0 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your front line is not getting any foul shots, you have
to guess what was is going on,'' Casey said. ``Our offensive end
was like an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, referring to his assists, said, ``I was doing my job. I
was getting people the ball where I was supposed to.'' When asked
about the Nets taking so many jump shots from the outside, Marbury
said, ``They packed it in and made us shoot jump shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McIlvaine, the Nets' center, left the game after being poked
in his left eye early in the second half when he and Kittles went
up for a rebound. It was bloodshot after the game. But McIlvaine
said that he could have returned and that the injury was not as
serious as one earlier this season in the right eye that caused him
to have double vision for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles started well for the Nets (12-20), scoring 12 points in
a first quarter that ended with Vancouver leading, 28-27. But
Kittles went scoreless in the second quarter as the Grizzlies ran
out to a 53-45 halftime lead. The Nets were outrebounded by 30-15
in the first two quarters. Harrington and Bibby each had seven
rebounds for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury led the Nets with only 4 points at the half. Dickerson
led all scorers with 18 points, on 8 of 14 from the field including
2 of 3 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine had three personal fouls and played only 13 minutes in
the half, with no points, two rebounds and one turnover to go with
three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' next game could be difficult. They travel to Miami to
play the Heat on Saturday night, the first meeting of the season
between the two Atlantic Division rivals. The Heat leads the
division with a record of 21-10 and is tied for fourth over all in
the 29-team National Basketball Association. Last season, the Nets
were 1-3 against the Heat.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: FORBES TAKES THE OFFENSIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several months of ``will he or won't he'' questions about
whether Steve Forbes would unleash negative advertisements against
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ended Friday when the Forbes campaign
begin using a 30-second spot in New Hampshire attacking Bush's
stand on taxes. The commercial comes just a day after Bush pledged
to cut taxes ``so help me God,'' and the Forbes spot accuses him of
breaking a no-new-tax pledge he made in Texas in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER William Eisner &AMP; Associates, Hales Corners, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement opens with a black-and-white
sign reading ``Mary C. Williams, Taxpayers for Accountability,
Houston.'' It dissolves to a close-up head shot of Ms. Williams
talking earnestly into the camera. It also features tight views of
her hands holding up a copy of a pledge Bush signed with her group
in 1994 saying he opposed enacting a state income tax or increasing
the Texas sales tax. The advertisement alternates between close-ups
of Ms. Williams and shots of Bush's signature on the group's
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``There's something you need to know about George W.
Bush. In 1994, he signed a pledge with my organization that he
would not support sales tax or business tax increases. In 1997,
unfortunately, he broke this pledge. He proposed an increase in the
business tax and sales taxes. Governor Bush wants people to examine
his record to see how he will perform as president. And his record,
as far as taxes are concerned, is a record of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: In January 1997, Bush proposed a sweeping
restructuring of the Texas tax system, which he called the
centerpiece of his legislative agenda. The plan called for a $3
billion-a-year cut in local property taxes, which would be paid, in
large part, by a half-cent increase in state sales taxes and new
taxes on businesses, including the first-ever taxes on lawyers,
accountants, doctors and other professional partnerships. The
purpose of the tax plan was to end a 25-year court battle over
inequities in public school financing and would have, over all,
lowered taxes. The plan was defeated by the state Legislature the
following May in what was seen as a stinging defeat to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bush was sharply criticized for breaking his 1994
campaign pledge to oppose sales tax increases, and many political
observers suggested that this episode could haunt him if he made a
similar pledge in his 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The tax issue is tricky for Bush, especially after
his father's famous ``read my lips'' pledge not to raise taxes,
which was later broken. Forbes has made tax reduction the
centerpiece of his campaign, but until now has refrained from
attacking Bush directly in television commercials, as he did in
attack advertisements against Bob Dole in 1996, leaving Dole
wounded and Forbes' reputation tarnished. With Forbes trailing
badly in the polls in New Hampshire, he has now pulled off the
gloves. The Forbes campaign has long said it could turn out attack
ads within 24 hours, if necessary. This advertisement, coming just
a day after Bush's ``so help me God'' pledge, proves their point.
It is expected that this commercial, now being shown on New
Hampshire and Boston television stations, will be followed by other
negative advertisements from Forbes.

BUSH ATTACKS MCCAIN IN S.C. DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Texas Governor George W. Bush repeatedly went
on the attack Friday night against his chief rival in this vital
primary state, accusing Arizona Senator John McCain of supporting
big government and a Democratic version of campaign finance
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a POW in Vietnam who has said he would quit the race if
he loses in this state with its large population of veterans,
responded during a nationally televised Republican presidential
debate by ridiculing Bush's support for the way political parties
accept unregulated ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt what is best for the country is best for the
party,'' McCain said, turning to Bush before an audience of 3,000
Republicans attending the debate, which was held in conjunction
with the state GOP's Silver Elephant fund-raising dinner. ``You are
defending an illegal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, eager to deliver a knockout blow to the Arizonan here,
came prepared with an attack against McCain on the party's core
issue: tax cuts. Bush said that under his plan, a couple earning
$42,000 per year would get an $1,852 tax break. He said they would
get only a $200 reduction under McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under my idea,'' the budget surplus ``goes into people's
pockets,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain disagreed, saying, ``It's fiscally irresponsible to
promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus that we might not
have.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, Bush and McCain dominated the
debate of the six GOP candidates. But unlike in New Hampshire,
where McCain is statistically tied with Bush in some polls, the
Texas governor has been far ahead here. The four other candidates _
publisher Steve Forbes, former Reagan aide Gary Bauer, talk show
host Alan Keyes, and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch _ also threw their
share of barbs, but mostly at Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, viewing South Carolina as an early must-win state, has
tailored his pitch to the state's many veterans, Northerers who
settled here, and native Southerners who will determine the
outcome. He talked about his best-selling book, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' which recounts his POW experience, and joked about how
he volunteered for duty aboard an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush, in perhaps the most unexpected moment of the evening,
was asked to describe the biggest mistake of his adult life, he
turned it into a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was managing general partner of the mighty Texas Rangers. I
signed off on that wonderful transaction: Sammy Sosa for Harold
Baines,'' Bush said, referring to the team's trade of the future
superstar home-run hitter for a veteran designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in contrast, said his biggest mistake was his
participation in the ``Keating Five'' scandal in which he met with
regulators on behalf of a contributor.
</P>
<P>
   That general issue of intervening with regulators continued to
dog McCain. Debate moderator Brian Williams, the MSNBC-TV anchor,
asked McCain about a report that he wrote a letter on behalf of
phone company Ameritech, which wanted government permission to
merge with the SBC phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, The Globe reported that McCain wrote to the
Federal Communications Commission seeking a prompt decision on a
television license that was sought by a campaign contributor who
also allowed the McCain campaign to use a corporate jet. In both
cases, McCain said he was only asking a government agency to take
action and did not request a specific action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a constituent of mine or a citizen . . . can't get an
answer,'' McCain said, ``I believe that people like me should weigh
in.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, McCain said he plans Saturday to release all
letters he has written to government agencies on similar matters.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is arguably the most important primary after New
Hampshire, which votes on Feb. 1. The Republican primary is held
here Feb. 19, providing an 18-day focus on South Carolina, with
only some distraction for the Delaware vote on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's debate was far different from the one held
Thursday in Durham, N.H. The partisan crowd here stomped and
hollered and booed at various questions, applauded their favorites
and hooted others. Some questions were posed by members of the
audience, and others were delivered via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the liveliest parts of the evening, Bush declined to
be drawn into a question of whether he is personally offended by
the Confederate flag that flies above the statehouse here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are trying to get me to express the will of the people of
South Carolina,'' Bush said, refusing to reveal his personal view.
``I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do
with this flag issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams persisted, asking, ``As an American citizen, do you
have a visceral reaction to seeing the Confederate flag?''
</P>
<P>
   As the sound of hundreds of booing Republicans filled the room,
Bush turned to Williams and said, ``Sorry. As an American, I trust
the decision to the people of South Carolina,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate also included these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Bush, pressed by Bauer about whether he would try to regain US
control of the Panama Canal, said he would ``liberate'' it if he
was convinced Panama was not allowing commerce to pass through. But
Bush remained vague on such a possibility, saying, ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   --McCain, asked by Keyes whether he would reinstitute the ban on
gays in the military, said: ``I will not, Alan.'' McCain said the
current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy is a good one, but he
called it ``disgraceful'' that Democratic candidates Al Gore and
Bill Bradley said Wednesday they want a chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff who backs having gays serve openly in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should as Americans reject such a thing because of the
harmful effects it will have on the military of the United States
of America,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer, asked what he would do if his daughter was raped and
sought an abortion, responded: ``I would explain she couldn't make
right the terrible thing that happened to her by taking the life of
an unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Republican candidates, who gave varied responses about the
value of affirmative action, generally agreed that anything
resembling racial quotas should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   --Forbes called on Gore to fire his campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, who said in an interview Wednesday, ``The Republicans
bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because they have no program,
no policy. . . . They'd rather take pictures with black children
than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Brazile's comments were ``very racist.'' Gore said
he called Powell to express his respect for the former Joint Chiefs
chairman, and said Brazile will continue as campaign manager.

ROCKER AGREES TO TESTING IMMEDIATELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Md.)  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Rocker traveled to Baltimore Friday to begin the
psychological testing that was ordered by Major League Baseball a
day earlier following the disparaging comments that he made last
month about gays and minority-group members.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking baseball executive said Rocker immediately agreed
to start the testing, and the Atlanta Braves pitcher was scheduled
to meet with Dr. Joel Solomon and Dr. Robert Millman, consultants
to baseball who have been mutually approved by the Major League
Baseball Players Association and the Player Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had the right to refuse to submit to the testing but had
he done so, said a baseball official with knowledge of the
negotiations between Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, and the
players association, Selig would have then issued immediate
disciplinary measures against Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The union agreed that Rocker should be tested, which delayed
Selig's dispensing any punishment and also gave Rocker the chance
to prove that, despite the inflammatory remarks he made to Sports
Illustrated, he is a rational person.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Rocker is disciplined, it is still conceivable that
the union will file a grievance on his behalf. But baseball would
invoke Paragraph 3(a) of the Basic Agreement to explain why Rocker
violated his major league contract.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the agreement pertains to loyalty and states: ``The
player agrees to perform his services hereunder diligently and
faithfully, to keep himself in first-class condition and to obey
the club's training rules, and pledges himself to the American
Public and to the club to conform to high standards of personal
conduct, fair play and good sportsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   When Selig was contacted at his office in Milwaukee on Friday,
he refused to answer questions about Rocker and explained that he
must be cautious because he was the judge in this case. Selig
declined to say if he thought that Rocker had failed ``to conform
to high standards of personal conduct'' and would not specify what
he would do after Rocker completed the psychological tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do what I think is right in the best interests of
baseball in every way,'' Selig said. ``How I think it impacts the
best interests of baseball is the only thing that will influence my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why Rocker, who is from Macon, Ga., was asked to
meet the doctors in Baltimore. Millman represents baseball, while
Solomon represents the union in certain cases involving players who
require medical attention. They have worked together on several
substance-abuse cases with major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where John is,'' Stan Kasten, the Braves'
president, said. ``The reason I don't know is these things are
always done in a confidential manner. I've heard that his father
said he's in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said that Rocker planned to ``get whatever help he
needed,'' which Rocker has shown by submitting to the testing a day
after Selig's order. While Rocker has been criticized for calling
an African-American teammate ``a fat monkey'' and for making racial
and homophobic slurs about New Yorkers, there have also been
questions about his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said that the Braves and baseball had the license
to punish Rocker because the First Amendment's right of free speech
was applicable only in government action, not in the private
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   While free speech exists in the workplace, Siegel said, there
are certain limitations on it when those words have an adverse
impact on a person's job or create a hostile work environment.
Since Rocker is undergoing testing, which Siegel said could be
construed as adversely affecting his job, and since some teammates
have expressed disdain over his comments, Siegel noted that that
could be construed as fostering a hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of the private workplace, major league baseball
and the Atlanta Braves have concerns and interests there about
their business,'' Siegel said. ``So his rights arery strong.
In fact, they're pretty weak at best.''

DODGERS SIGN SANTANGELO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Continuing their offseason plan of acquiring
players with strong clubhouse character, the Los Angeles Dodgers
gained a measure of versatility by signing free agent F.P.
Santangelo to a two-year, $1.6 million contract Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A switch-hitter, Santangelo plays all three outfield positions
and anywhere in the infield. He adds depth to the bench and gives
manager Davey Johnson a late-inning double-switch candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those quality, versatility guys,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``He's one of those guys you can start a
week at second base, a few days at shortstop, a week at third and
he won't hurt you. He can play center field for a month. He gives
Davey so much more versatility and flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, 32, played predominantly at center (49 games) and
left (26) with the San Francisco Giants last season, but he also
played right (9), second base (11), third base (3) and shortstop
(1). He also has a good swing, hitting .260 in 113 games last
season with a .406 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo will be paid $750,000 during the 2000 season and
$850,000 in 2001. Performance-based incentives could earn him an
additional $1.3 million during the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my value to a team is being able to play a lot of
positions and being able to play every day,'' Santangelo said.
``I'm just thrilled to be part of the Dodgers. Regardless of what
they say of my role, things always change so you can't worry about
that. I want to go in and earn a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo spent the first four years of his career with
Montreal. He broke into the major leagues when Malone was the
Expos' general manager. He can also partially fill the leadoff
role.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants, Santangelo usually batted first and second. He
hit .262 with a .392 on-base percentage from the first spot. He
also has a strong reputation of being a solid clubhouse guy, which
fits into the Dodgers' offseason free agent acquisitions. Both Orel
Hershiser and Gregg Olson have similar characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my career, at all levels, I've been on a lot of winning
teams, and those teams ... it's a bunch of guys pulling for each
other and wanting to win,'' Santangelo said. ``It's not guys
worried about their ERA or how many hits they had. If you can get
that kind of attitude ... that's what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santangelo signing wasn't the only news the Dodgers made.
They avoided salary arbitration with pitcher Darren Dreifort,
inking the right-hander to a one-year, $3.7 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, 27, was 13-13 with a 4.79 ERA in 1999 before missing
the last few weeks of the season with arm problems. The Dodgers
wanted to sign Dreifort to a multi-year deal, but he's eligible for
free agency after the season and he's expected to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Scott Boras, the agent for Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Beltre, said he doesn't expect a decision on the grievance filed by
the players association on Monday until next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to imagine it's going to be some time in February,''
Boras said. ``I hope it's early in the month instead of later.''
</P>
<P>
   After signing at the age of 15, Beltre is seeking free agency.
Major League Baseball already declined that request.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be heard by arbitrator Shyam Das. He's expected to
take an additional 10 days to two weeks after the hearing before
making a decision.

OFFICERS IN DIALLO TRIAL WANT EXPERTS TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four police officers accused of murder in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo plan to call two police firearm and
training experts and a Columbia University psychology professor as
expert witnesses at their trial next month, according to court
papers filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion submitted Friday to the State Supreme Court in
Albany, the Bronx district attorney's office asked Judge Joseph
Teresi to review whether the defense witnesses _ James Fyfe, a
Temple University criminologist; Jon Cerar, a former commander of
the New York Police firearms and tactics division; and Lynn A.
Cooper, a Columbia professor and psychologist who specializes in
human perception _ should be allowed to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they questioned whether the expert
testimony would be relevant. If the witnesses are allowed to
testify, the prosecutors have asked Teresi to preclude them from
discussing the core issue of the case, namely whether the officers'
conduct was justified, because to do so, the prosecutors argued,
would pre-empt the jury's role as the ultimate finders of fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These experts, if permitted to testify at all,'' the motion
said, ``should be limited to matters of expertise that do not
invade the province of the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion said Fyfe would testify about, among other things,
how long it takes to fire a semiautomatic pistol 16 times, as two
of the officers involved in the shooting did. The papers did not
specify the nature of Cerar's testimony, but as a police commander,
Cerar supervised the tactical training under which officers learn
the circumstances in which it is permissible to fire their guns.
Ms. Cooper, the papers said, is preparing a report for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who fired 41 times at Diallo last February as he
stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building, have said
they mistakenly believed he was reaching for a gun. He was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Worth, a lawyer for one of the officers, Edward
McMellon, said the defense would challenge the prosecution motion.
``The jury needs to be educated as to proper police training to see
that these officers followed it,'' Worth said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The defense also filed a motion Friday, under seal, that asked
Teresi to review prosecution witness statements to see whether
additional evidence must be turned over to the defense before
trial, defense lawyers said. Under the law, defendants in criminal
cases are entitled to review material collected by the authorities
that would help bolster their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers said they had provided the judge with a
rationale for their belief that certain outstanding material is
favorable to the officers. But they asked that their papers be
sealed because they did not want prosecutors to gain a tactical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not file it to keep it from the eyes of the public,
just the prosecutors,'' said Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for
Officer Sean Carroll. ``We do not want the prosecutors to get
tipped off to what our theory of the defense might be prior to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight news organizations, including The New York Times, the
Daily News, Newsday and the Associated Press, have objected to the
use of sealed motions in the case. Earlier this week, the
organizations filed their own motion asking the judge to rule that
all motions and proceedings in the case be public. Teresi told
prosecutors and defense lawyers Friday that they must respond to
that motion by Jan. 14.

THE LIST OF THE WORLD'S MAJOR RELIGIONS UNCHANGED OVER A
MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news, in religion, is often that there is no news. That
is a dirty little secret journalists writing about religion would
prefer to keep from their editors and the people who sign
paychecks. To the extent that social science can measure religious
attitudes and conduct _ rates of belief and membership, for
instance, or frequency of worship and prayer _ what stands out is
how glacial the changes are over decades.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, come to think of it, over the millenniums. Any list
of the world's major religions in the year 2000 looks very much
like the list of the world's major religions in the year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some dropouts, to be sure. A thousand years ago,
Odin, Thor and the other gods of the Norse pantheon were just
ceasing to be forces to be conjured with, sometimes literally, in
Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western hemisphere, Mesoamerican religion, which had
produced monumental pyramids, temples and ceremonial centers, was
in decline, passing from its classic Mayan period to the Aztec
forms that were eventually, like Inca religion in the Andes,
crushed by the Spanish conquistadors.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, Islam had long since dethroned Zoroastrianism from its
official position. By the year 1000 some Zoroastrians had migrated
to India (where they would be known as Parsis, or Persians) to
escape persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Zoroastrianism lives on today, a remnant of what was once an
immensely influential religion. The ancient religions of the
Americas and Africa live on as well, not only as the traditional
practices of indigenous peoples and their cousins in diaspora but
also as consciously revived faiths or even as subterranean streams
in Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been dropouts from the ranks of world
religions, there have been no new contenders. The major religious
families of today were all around a millennium ago: Hinduism,
Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam. So
too, with the exception of Sikhism, were the more regional faiths
like Jainism and Shinto.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny that homo religiosus has displayed an almost
endless capacity for religious creativity as well as conflict.
Hardly was the last millennium warm when Christianity formally
split into Latin and Byzantine halves, when Judaism struggled
through a series of Christian massacres and expulsions, when Islam
experienced a golden age of philosophy and theology in Baghdad, and
when Buddism reconsolidated itself in Tibet and flowered into an
array of distinct schools in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Every century since then has been marked by new religious
insights, movements, revivals and reactions. For the West, none was
of greater import than the Protestant Reformation and its
aftermath. It remains the case that virtually every development
that has lasted took place within, not outside, the existing great
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, Deism seemed like the natural successor
to Christianity. Thomas Jefferson once entertained hopes that
Unitarianism might prove to be the wave of the religious future for
19th-century America. In the 1840s, Auguste Comte tried to erect a
``religion of humanity'' on his positivist theories of society, and
the phrase long remained in vogue among rationalist reformers.
Transcendentalism, Swedenborgianism, spiritualism and theosophy,one after another, had their days in the sun, earlier versions of
today's New Age movements.
</P>
<P>
   But these and similar movements, although many of them retain
devoted followers and intellectual resources, have never become the
quintessentially modern expressions of the religious impulse that
was once predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, Bolshevik or Maoist Communism would have
had a claim to being counted among the world's major religions, at
least as a functional equivalent. But when historians review the
20th century, Communism may appear, religiously speaking, as a
phenomenon of less long-range impact than the Islamic revival or
Pentecostal Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Is this persistence of the major religions not curious? In a
world where not only new technologies but entirely new fields of
knowledge spring up almost overnight, why not entirely new
religions, and if not overnight then maybe one or two per century?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they do. The world has never been short of charismatic
leaders, metaphysical speculators, masters of esoteric doctrines
and seekers open to new revelations. Religions are constantly being
invented and reinvented: Scientology, goddess worship, neopaganism,
Gate of Heaven, the Church of Elvis are only a few among thousands.
A dozen new religions were probably born on the Web this week.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them finds a niche in the spiritual environment _ for a
while. But unless they are deeply implanted, or ultimately
absorbed, in one of the great religious traditions, they seem
destined to wither and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, there seems to be no reason why this must be so. But
a pattern of more than a thousand years standing cannot be ignored.

IOWA'S WRESTLING PROGRAM IS KEEPING ITS WINNING WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEIDI PEDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   T.J. Williams knew the Iowa wrestling team hadn't done its job _
not by Iowa standards _ in simply winning the 1998 Midlands
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes may have won the team title at the event, a
prestigious annual meet held at Northwestern University, but Iowa
hadn't displayed total dominance. Williams was the only Hawkeyes
wrestler to win his weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Williams figured Iowa's performance wasn't good enough to
satisfy coach Jim Zalesky, and he was right. The morning after the
team arrived back home in Iowa City, Iowa, the wrestlers found
themselves doing hourlong sessions of sprint laps at Carver-Hawkeye
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would get done \Rwith one session\S and were all exhausted,
and we knew that they were going to make us do more,'' Williams
said. ``And then it hit me _ this is what it's all about right
here. Nobody else is doing this. This is what wins championships.''
</P>
<P>
   At Iowa, which has won the past five NCAA crowns, nothing less
than championships are expected. Expectations haven't changed,
despite the major changes the Iowa program has undergone in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes, the No. 1-ranked team in the latest National
Wrestling Coaches Association's NCAA poll, continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   Zalesky said he wants to see improvement from the Hawkeyes.
Although Iowa is 5-0 in duals and has been extremely strong in the
lower weight classes, athletes in the upper weight classes have
proven vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the guys they've gotta be prepared. We have a standard
at Iowa, and we have to keep that standard,'' Zalesky said. ``If
you're getting your butt kicked, you run back to the center of the
mat.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Zalesky became familiar with the Iowa standard,
set by legendary coach Dan Gable, long ago. Zalesky won three
individual NCAA titles from 1982to 1984 while wrestling for Gable,
then served as an assistant at Iowa before getting the nod as head
coach when Gable retired after the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Any new coach would have his work cut out for him. Gable had
taken the Iowa wrestling program to legendary status and in 21
years had guided the Hawkeyes to 21 Big Ten and 15 NCAA team
titles, including a string of nine in a row that tied the record
for consecutive NCAA titles by any school in any sport. Hawkeyes
athletes also achieved All-America status 152 times, and won 45
individual NCAA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his third season, Zalesky has already felt the pressure
his position can bring. Although the Hawkeyes won the 1998 Big Ten
and NCAA titles, Iowa had four returning NCAA champions to do it
with, and many observers gave credit for the season to Gable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure anywhere at the top. To me it's good
pressure,'' Zalesky said. ``I've got a great administration, a
great fan base. To me, there are more positives than negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalesky has proven that he can spur the team when he needs to.
After Iowa lost the Big Ten title last year for the first time in
26 seasons, finishing second behind Minnesota, the Hawkeyes came
back to win the NCAA title by two points over the Golden Gophers.
Sophomores Williams and Doug Schwab won individual crowns, and
sophomore Eric Juergens took third.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, who still holds an office at Iowa as ``assistant to the
director'' and is co-head coach of the 2000 U.S. Olympic freestyle
team, said he thinks Zalesky has adjusted to his new job well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both years have been hard on him, but we haven't
dropped from the national title ranks,'' said Gable, who will
attend the Lone Star Duals as a broadcaster for Iowa Public
Television. ``His communication has picked up a lot, and his ways
of translating information away from the mat have been key in the
last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, who holds a 13-1 record this season at 141 pounds, said
he came to Iowa knowing that he would probably be wrestling for
someone other than Gable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at who else was around, and I knew the program was
still going to be top-notch,'' he said. ``The attitude hasn't
changed one bit. We still preach the same thing. We still outwork
everybody.'' nn

TOWN'S MUSEUM PROJECT GOING NOWHERE SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. _ Ever since the day in 1983 when residents
broached the idea of building a National Purple Heart Museum here,
the museum has remained just that: an idea _ whose time came, went
and kept on going, for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an advisory panel that includes Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf
and the actor James Garner, more than $1.2 million in state grants
and the support of Gov. John Rowland, the military museum today is
little more than an aging set of computer-enhanced blueprints and
an unfulfilled flight of fancy for an unknown town seeking a
tourist lodestone.
</P>
<P>
   A report this week by the Connecticut attorney general's office
offers a detailed explanation. According to the report, the
12-member board charged with planning, financing and building the
$18.75 million museum was so incompetent that it spent more than
$500,000 in public and private funds and allowed the museum's
former executive director to mishandle tens of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management was inept and shoddy, and record keeping was
completely inadequate; accounting was essentially incompetent,''
the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said by telephone. ``We
believe the blame lies with the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum was conceived as a one-of-a-kind shrine of history
and memorabilia dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of Americans
who have received the Purple Heart medal, which is awarded to
members of the military wounded in battle. The museum was to be
situated in this middle-class town of shopping malls on the
Massachusetts border because, according to local lore, this is
where Gen. George Washington in 1774 enlisted one of the first
soldiers to receive the medal.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were so enthusiastic about the museum that the
powerful state Bond Commission, headed by the governor, voted in
1998 to grant $1 million to make it a reality. Town officials
envisioned streams of tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the glitter and high hopes, Blumenthal says, could
offset the gross financial ineptitude of the museum's directors.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the board has spent more than $500,000, mostly in state
grants, for about $33,000 worth of architectural plans, Blumenthal
said. Shoddy bookkeeping and a lack of fundamental accounting
measures make it unclear what happened to the rest of the money, he
said. Although he added that despite their bad judgment, board
members had only the best intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the financial problems were tied to the dealings of the
museum's former executive director, Joseph Donohue, who according
to the state report was hired in 1997 without a contract, used
state grant money to pay his personal health insurance premiums and
federal tax bills, and often filtered private donations through his
own bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be much stronger oversight so as to assure
competent management,'' Blumenthal said. He added that he had
referred his findings about Donohue, who resigned as executive
director of the museum in April, to Connecticut's chief state's
attorney, John Bailey, for possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, who now works in Washington, could not be reached for
comment Friday. But his successor, and the museum board's current
executive director, Charles Alfano, called Blumenthal's report
``flawed'' and said it gave the false impression that hundreds of
thousands of dollars had been wasted. In fact, Alfano said, the
cost of mismanagement by the board, which he said had been
corrected, added up to less than $20,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he began investigating the Purple Heart Museum
project about three months ago, after complaints from contributors
and volunteers began filtering into his office. Since then, the
state Department of Economic and Community Development has stopped
the disbursement of the remaining state grant money.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday, when the attorney general's report was made
public, Alfano has been meeting with state and town officials to
coax them into releasing the money. Once that begins, he said, the
museum will send out 125,000 direct-mail solicitations for
donations and begin mapping out a fund-raising strategy with a
California public relations firm that has agreed to work at no
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to kick off our national campaign in early
spring,'' Alfano said. But he added, ``We can't move forward unless
we get the remainder of the state grant.'' The earliest the museum
may be ready for visitors is in late 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the land reserved for the museum remains an expanse of
scrub stuck bordered by a nursing home, a cemetery and Interstate
91.
</P>
<P>
   How much of the $18.75 million cost the museum board has on hand
even Alfano did not know Friday. But, he said, ``We probably could
get by with $15 million.''

 &HT;    Past plays powerful role in S.C. debate
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ On the weekend that South Carolina's
Republicans gathered to hear their presidential candidates talk
about the future, the past reared its insistent head to demonstrate
that it still packs a powerful political charge.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome South, candidates of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of any other questions they faced at Friday night's
televised forum here, the candidates had to negotiate the tricky
issue of whether the Confederate flag should fly over state
buildings, the burning question of the hour in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The past has a way of creeping back unobstrusively here. After
honoring their nonagenarian senator, Strom Thurmond, the party
faithful dined listening to the soundtrack of Ken Burns ``Civil
War'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever relevance it has for the presidential election, the
flag question wasn't long in coming in the debate, and it seemed to
work entirely to the benefit of the front-runner, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan, I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out
what to do with this flag issue,'' Bush told questioner Bryan
Williams, when asked if the flag offended him personally.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that he got a big round of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But, did he have ``a visceral reaction to seeing the Confederate
flag?'' he was asked in possibly the most fruitless follow-up in a
debate so far this campaign. More applause _ although later, when
he pointed out that the same self-determinist approach should apply
to whether South Carolina should have a lottery _ a Democratic
proposal _ the response was more tepid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up another easy clap line when all the candidates
were asked the worst mistake they'd made as adults. Trading Sammy
Sosa, the Texas Rangers co-owner said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has made this state and New
Hampshire the battlegrounds where he hopes to unseat Bush, did not
have as easy a ride.
</P>
<P>
   His first question dealt with his intercession on behalf of
Ameritech, a regional telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such report to crop up in the past few days,
clouding his support for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the hourlong format never gave the challenger much
opportunity to draw the kind of sharp distinctions he needs to cut
into Bush's substantial lead here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been riding high, butw year has brought some
choppy waters for the former Navy pilot. Not only his constituent
services but his taste in rock bands have been called to question.
(He defended his Senate activities but backed off an endorsement of
Nine Inch Nails at a New Hampshire debate Thursday night when
challenged by former Ambassador Alan Keyes.)
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty he will have expanding his New Hampshire success
into South Carolina is also becoming more apparent as the
substantial political machine that has been supporting George
Bushes, father and son, in this state since the 1970s swings into
action.
</P>
<P>
   Former S.C. Gov. Carroll Campbell spoke at a Bush pep rally
before the debate, and former aides are showing up in the Bush
campaign at an increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the flag a moment. Considering that it really is a state
issue and presidential candidates can do little other than pander
or get themselves in trouble with it, it was a dumb question to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   But does the fact that we're asking so many dumb questions about
the past reveal that we don't know many smart questions to ask
about the future?

RELIEF PLANNED FOR N.J. DRIVERS STUCK IN LONG INSPECTION LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey drivers may have shorter and warmer waits while their
cars are inspected: Federal regulators have authorized use of a
speedier emissions test, and the testing company agreed Friday to
install heated waiting areas at inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists criticized the decision to revert to the
faster test, which is less stringent, and accused Gov. Christie
Whitman and other officials of putting political expedience ahead
of clean air. The change still needs legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of her proposal is, do less to protect the
health of New Jersey residents,'' said Curtis Fisher of New Jersey
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers have endured long waits _ up to five hours in places _
since stricter emissions testing began on Dec. 13 to bring the
state into compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act. Drivers must
wait outside their cars during the test, which can take more than
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, whose administration awarded a $463 million contract to
a private company, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, to
install and run the new testing system, expressed outrage this week
at the company's performance. She demanded Thursday that Parsons
install heated waiting areas, which the company said it would begin
building on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also asked the federal Environmental Protection Agency
to allow the former, faster test to be used when waits exceed 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the agency wrote to Whitman's transportation
commissioner, James Weinstein, authorizing use of the less
stringent test until June 30. But the agency also told Weinstein
that it expected to meet with him in April for a report on the
company's progress in permanently reducing waits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, legislators are to vote on a bill introduced by the
state Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, to amend New
Jersey's emissions testing law to allow the speedier test, said Rae
Hutton, a spokesman for DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   The DiFrancesco bill would also call for other measures to
reduce waiting times, including exempting cars five years old or
less from testing, temporarily suspending safety inspections, and
directing Parsons to give drivers vouchers so they can have the
inspections done at private licensed service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the state Division of Motor
Vehicles, said those options are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hutton said that DiFrancesco, a Republican, was considering
holding hearings on the award of the testing contract to Parsons,
the sole bidder, in 1998. Democrats have been the loudest critics
of the contract award, pointing out that Parsons contributed
$62,000 to New Jersey Republicans in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Friday that waiting times at inspection
stations are already falling, thanks to basic moves to improve
workers' efficiency. Carl Golden, a spokesman for Parsons, said the
average waiting time at inspection stations statewide was down to
16 minutes Friday from 24 minutes on Wednesday.

DON MARTIN, `MAD'S `MADDEST ARTIST,' IS DEAD AT 68 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By ERIC NASH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Martin, the Mad magazine cartoonist with a rubbery slapstick
style whom the magazine billed as ``Mad's maddest artist,'' died on
Thursday at Baptist Hospital in Miami. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Christine Thompson, a hospital
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's hapless characters inhabited a topsy-turvy, Kafka-esque
world in which a hotel guest complaining about cockroaches might
discover that the desk clerk himself was a giant cockroach,
complete with four arms, stubble, cigar and irately quivering
antennae. His prototypical drawing was of a jug-eared, slack-jawed,
knock-kneed and hinge-footed man impervious to all types of mayhem,
even when he is tap-dancing over an open manhole and bouncing off a
skyscraper beam.
</P>
<P>
   After selling his first cartoon to Mad in 1956, Martin continued
to draw for the magazine until 1987, when he left to work for a
rival magazine, Cracked, because of disagreements over reprint
rights with Mad's publisher, William M. Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other magazines, Mad pays artists on a work-for-hire
basis and reserves the profitable reprint rights. Martin felt so
strongly about the issue that he testified before a congressional
subcommittee on the rights of freelance artists. Paperback
collections of Martin's previously unpublished cartoons were issued
starting in 1962 with ``Don Martin Steps Out!'' and have sold more
than 7 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   His gags fit in well with the ``sick'' school of 1950s humor,
but his loose, kinetic style and outrageously physical form of
attack brought the strips into their own dimension. Like latter-day
Harold Lloyds, his characters named Fonebone and Captain Klutz were
at odds with the modern world. Machinery was always the enemy, from
power tools to steamrollers to things as simple as a paper-towel
dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   Martin elevated the comic book sound effect to new onomatopoeic
heights. In his wacky world, a squirting flower went ``SHKLITZA,''
and recalcitrant meals of spaghetti or pizza made inimitably meaty
sounds. Each form of physical torture had its own exquisite sound:
getting slapped in the face with a wet mackerel went ``SPLADAP,''
while getting conked with a frying pan went ``PWANG.'' His own
vanity license plate read ``SHTOINK.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed his style to influences as diverse as the
grotesque characters of Bosch, the manic energy of Warner Brothers
cartoons and the elegant line of Al Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's admirers included Gary Larson, known for the twisted
humor of ``The Far Side.'' An animated version of Martin's cartoons
also appeared briefly on Fox Television's ``Mad TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was born in Passaic, N.J., grew up in Brookside, N.J.,
and attended public school in Morristown, N.J. ``It is interesting
that all three towns deny any and all of this information,'' he
wrote in a biographical note in the 1970s. He then studied at the
Newark School of Fine Art for three years and graduated from the
Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He drew despite a degenerative eye condition for which he
underwent corneal transplants. To produce his last strips, he
needed to wear special contact lenses that caused great discomfort
and to work with a magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Norma; a son, Max; a brother, Ralph,
and a grandson.

 HARALD HERMANN ROSSI, 82, INNOVATOR IN USE OF RADIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Harald Hermann Rossi, a biophysicist who improved the
ability to measure minute amounts of ionizing radiation and their
effects on living things, died Jan. 1 at his home in Upper Nyack,
N.Y. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   While he was active professionally until his death, he had been
suffering from heart disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi formally retired as a professor of radiation oncology at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in
1987 and took emeritus status. He had joined the department of
radiological research at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital as a
research scientist in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi left his mark by developing what became known as
microdosimetry, a technique he explained in 1959 in the Journal of
Radiation Research with his paper ``Specification of Radiation
Quality.'' It provided the scientific underpinnings for the
measurement of radiation, a topic that continues to generate
international conferences and intense research the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Microdosimetry measures the microscopic distributions of energy
for different types of radiation. Those measurements are important
factors in radiation therapy and radiation protection. Rossi
refined the field while working as a physicist and as the
radiation-protection officer at Presbyterian from 1954 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In a later paper, ``Theory of Dual Radiation Action,'' written
with Dr. Albrecht M. Kellerer, Rossi advanced the understanding of
the biological impact of different types of densely ionizing
radiation, particularly neutrons. The paper also brought about
stricter regulations for protection against such radiation and an
international effort, completed in 1986, to reassess the amounts of
radiation absorbed by survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on
Japan in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi designed many instruments now used in radiation
measurement. Among them was a proportional counter, known as the
Rossi counter, which measures the energy deposited by radiation in
microscopic sites like cells.
</P>
<P>
   Harald Rossi, a native of Vienna, studied at the University of
Vienna and the University of Bristol, England, before coming to the
United States in 1939. He completed his doctorate in physics at
Johns Hopkins in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He remained on the faculty there until 1945, but during World
War II he was assigned to the Manhattan Project. Working for the
Army Corps of Engineers, he began to devise new measurements of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi is survived by his wife of 53 years, Ruth Marguerite Gregg
Rossi; their son, Gerald, of Ridgewood, N.J.; two daughters, Dr.
Gwendolyn R. Gladstone of Exeter, N.H., and Harriet R. Furey of
Wappingers Falls, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.

HEART RECIPIENT'S DEATH A TRAGIC 1ST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - At a time when most 13-year-old boys were playing
video games, David Mendoza became Arizona's youngest heart
transplant recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the East Phoenix area teen became the first
Arizonan to undergo a second heart transplant, and eventually, he
received a third.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Mendoza, 31, became the state's first heart
transplant recipient to earn a tragic distinction _ he died of
complications from chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a risk of so-called opportunistic organisms
affecting these patients,'' said Dr. Jack Copeland, who performed
two of Mendoza's transplants at University Medical Center in
Tucson. ``But we've never lost a patient due to chicken pox.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's death caught Copeland and his team by surprise.
Although Mendoza initially had a fever of 103, he seemed to be
recovering after his mysterious exposure to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all sort of underestimated the risk, David included,''
Copeland said. ``I saw him at 11:30 Tuesday night, Jan. 4, and he
was joking around. He felt pretty good, he looked pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza took a turn for the worse and died late Wednesday,
Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Born with a heart defect that left him with just two chambers
instead of four, Mendoza received his first transplant in 1981. At
the time, heart transplants were a nascent medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   University Medical Center performed its first heart transplant
in 1979. Since then, it has done more than 500.
</P>
<P>
   After his first heart transplant, Mendoza developed graft
arteriosclerosis, a form of chronic rejection. The condition
required that he receive another transplant in 1984 and a third in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   His plight caught the public's attention, prompting Jack
Weckesser of Glendale to raise $3,000 for Mendoza through a Grand
Canyon hike fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said Mendoza's death was a blow to him and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody really loved David,'' the surgeon said. ``We felt
like he was our adopted child or something. When he was growing up,
it was was fun to see him take on responsibility and earn a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza worked as a counselor for the state.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who live in Scottsdale, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his medically troubled life, Mendoza maintained a
quick wit and a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after being sedated for a transplant surgery, Mendoza
awoke to realize his chest bore no fresh incision because a donor
heart turned out to be unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, Copeland's a miracle worker; he did it without an
incision,'' Mendoza quipped to the medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept us laughing all the time,'' Copeland said. ``He was
just a great kid.'' &QL;

KIDS SHORTCHANGED, EDUCATORS CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Arizona's piggybank for education is getting fatter,
approaching $1 billion, thanks to sales of state trust land. Yet,
the schools aren't getting any richer.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators argue that the system is set up to benefit
taxpayers, not kids. And they want trust land to give an extra
boost to schools. More computers, perhaps. Or a longer school year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Legislature pours money from trust land into the
regular school budget, offsetting the amount coming from taxes. If
trust income goes up, the taxpayers get a break, but there's no
additional money for education.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bob Burns, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, maintains that the formula is a fair and effective way
to divvy up funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the debate as to whether there's enough
money,'' the Glendale Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   But others want to earmark trust money for extras, such as the
all-day kindergarten class at Andalucia Primary School in the
Alhambra Elementary School District in west Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen 6-year-olds worked on their journals on Friday, Jan.
7, drawing pictures and trying to write sentences. Then, they
turned to ``5'': holding up the right number of fingers and
objects, watching teacher Linda Cerracchio demonstrate how to write
it.
</P>
<P>
   When the school year started, 20 of the children spoke virtually
no English, but ``you can't tell it now,'' Cerracchio said. Coming
from impoverished households, many didn't know colors or recognize
their written names.
</P>
<P>
   Without all-day kindergarten, Alhambra Superintendent Carol Peck
said, ``they are at a disadvantage that takes years to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Alhambra pays for extended kindergarten through a budget
override, but Peck worries whether voters will approve it again in
March. She wishes there were funds for giving help even earlier, by
expanding the district's preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   For years, no one would have thought much about tapping state
trust land for such projects. It just didn't generate much cash.
</P>
<P>
   Trust land, now 9.3 million acres, was given to Arizona at
statehood as a way to raise money for public institutions, mostly
schools.
</P>
<P>
   `LOOK TO THE FUTURE' &QL; 
Profits from selling or mining trust land go into a permanent fund,
with the interest distributed each year. The permanent fund is
approaching $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a billion isn't enough, just look to the future,'' said
Keith Meyer, a spokesman for the State Land Department, which
oversees trust land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, voters allowed the fund to make stock investments,
which should pump up returns.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the trust includes lucrative urban land. A $40 million
parcel along Interstate 17 was sold to USAA, a military insurer, in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what the interest from that one sale could do, said
Chuck Essigs, an assistant superintendent in the Mesa Unified
School District: It could pay for 70 new teachers. It could buy
2,500 computers.
</P>
<P>
   FREEZE SUGGESTED &QL; 
Essigs suggests freezing the amount of money that the trust
contributes to the overall education budget. Although it accounts
for just 3 percent of the state's $2.4 billion contribution to
education, Essigs figures that legislators would be loath to hunt
for the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ann Day, R-Tucson, proposes phasing trust money out
of the education budget over several years. Then, she would
dedicate it to something special, such as reducing class size.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that the system needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with using trust land to foot part of the total
bill for education? wondered state Sen. Randall Gnant,
R-Scottsdale, who heds the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
hasn't decided whether to support earmarking the money for specific
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear that goes along with it is that you'll see a
reduction in the overall education budget,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Land Department, Meyer calculates that losing trust
money from the education budget would cost each taxpayer nearly $50
more.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more twist in the issue: the move to dedicate trust
money to special projects is backed by environmentalists who hope
to preserve some of the trust land from development.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of school organizations are leery about how such
conservation would work, especially if it meant giving up land
without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Robey of the Arizona School Boards Association says one
intriguing idea is that adjacent trust land might be more valuable
if some was left undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   Income from trust land makes up just 2 percent of total local
and state spending on schools, according to a study by the
non-profit Sonoran Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to rush land to the market without really
understanding the net income of selling properties,'' said Luther
Propst, executive director of the Tucson-based institute.
</P>
<P>
   And he adds that educators shouldn't overlook one special cost:
When trust land is sold for subdivisions, the schools get a flood
of new students. &QL;

FLORIDA JUDGE TO RULE ON LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP FOR CUBA BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS grafs 9-13 with Burton's subpoena of boy) 
(bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The wrangling over a 6-year-old Cuban boy shifted Friday
from the streets to a Miami courthouse, where a state judge said
she would decide early next week whether to grant legal
guardianship to the boy's great-uncle, with whom he is living.
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Rosa Rodriguez grants the request by the boy's lawyers,
the great-uncle could immediately reapply for political asylum on
behalf of the boy, Elian Gonzalez. The tangled legal process could
delay or block the boy's return to Cuba. But legal experts said
Friday that it would be unlikely for the judge to take legal
custody away from the boy's father, who has asked for Elian's
return and was found by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to have a close relationship with his son.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to step up the pressure, local leaders met Friday
night in Washington with Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss a
decision by INS to reunite Elian with his father in Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, which included Dade-Metro Mayor Alex Penelas and
Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, appealed to Reno to overturn the order.
</P>
<P>
   After the 45-minute meeting, which was arranged by Vice
President Al Gore, Penelas told reporters that he asked Reno to
``consider the clear desire of the mother,'' that Elian grow up in
the United States. Penelas added that he felt the boy's father
``has been coerced'' into demanding that the boy return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno decides not to overturn the ruling, Penelas said, he
urged her to at least delay the decision for 35 to 45 days to allow
lawyers for boy's relatives in Florida to prepare a legal case to
block his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the vice president to intercede on Elian's behalf, and
he did,'' Penelas said earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, INS officials ruled that federal and international
laws compelled them to honor a request by Elian's father to be
re-united with his son. Elian's mother and stepfather died at sea
when the boat they were taking to the United States capsized in
November. The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has said he was unaware
that his former wife was planning to flee the country with his son.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Rep &UR; . &LR;  Dan Burton, chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee, is- sued a subpoena for Elian to
appear before his panel on Feb. 10 in an effort to keep him in this
country at least temporarily. An actual commit- tee hearing may not
even take place, a Republican committee aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, R-Ind., who is an ally of Cuban exiles, acted at the
behest of Rep. Lin- coln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. It was an about-face
from a statement issued hours earlier say- ing he would not
subpoena the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing himself, Burton explained: ``I want to make sure
that Elian's rights are protected. I am concerned that without a
ruling from the judges, Elian is without legal protection over the
weekend. I am issuing this subpoena to provide a measure of legal
protection while the court is considering this case.''

   Democratic aides on the panel called the move a political
gesture that could not prevent Elian's depar- ture.
 &UR;  &LR; The Clinton administration, which had hoped to avoid a messy,
protracted fight with Cuban exiles over the boy, now finds itself
the focus of heated street demonstrations and faces the possibility
that the boy may not be voluntarily turned over for his flight back
to Cuba. One hundred and thirty people were arrested in Miami on
Thursday in protests that snarled traffic and angered motorists.

   President Clinton, on his way to the peace talks between Syria
and Israel on Friday, urged protesters to take their concerns to
court and refrain from lawlessness. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case,'' Clinton said. ``We need to keep this out of the
political process as much as possible within the established legal
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., requested
that the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, Rep.
Dan Burton, D-Ind., issue Elian a subpoena to appear before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Burton, in consultation with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said
he would not issue a subpoena, but left open the possibility, ``if
it becomes necessary.'' Burton, a strong ally of Cuban exiles, has
the power unilaterally to issue congressional subpoenas. A subpoena
would delay the boy's return until he appeared before the
committee.

   Legal experts said the lawyers' case in state court here was
likely to fail, although judges had wide discretion.
</P>

   ``If they want to challenge the father's custody, and there is
not a shred of evidence that he is an unfit father, they would have
to do it in Cuba, where the custody agreement was reached,'' said
David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, another law professor at the university,
agreed. ``I think that both procedurally and in terms of the
merits, they have a slim chance of success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's legal maneuvers fail, lawyers here are expected to
ask first for a temporary restraining order in federal court
barring Elian's return, and then a preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was mostly quiet Friday with only one sparsely attended
demonstration downtown. But in Cardenas, Cuba, Elian's hometown,
about 50,000 people attended a rally demanding the boy's return.

   The Coast Guard and the Border Patrol have revised the death
toll in the boat sinking that led to Elian's arrival here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven people died in that voyage and 3 survived, making it a
total of 14 people on the boat,'' Dan Geoghegan, a spokesman for
the Border Patrol in Miami said Friday. Initial reports were that
13 people were on the boat and that 10 had drowned.
