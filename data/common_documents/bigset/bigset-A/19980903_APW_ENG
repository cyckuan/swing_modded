	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ First-half goals by Joe-Max
Moore and Edwin Gorter carried the New England Revolution to a 2-0
Major League Soccer victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
on Wednesday.
	   The victory gave New England coach Walter Zenga, who replaced
Thomas Rongen on Aug. 24, his first professional win. It also
snapped a two-game Revolution losing streak, moved New England out
of the cellar in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 9-19 record good
for 23 points and kept its slim post-season hopes alive.
	   The MetroStars, who had already clinched a post-season berth,
suffered their third straight setback, losing for the fourth time
in their last five games. New York-New Jersey is now 14-14 with 38
points and remained in third place in the MLS East.
 &UR; Fire 3, Fusion 2
	   In Chicago, rookie Josh Wolff broke a 2-2 tie with his fourth
MLS goal in the 84th minute as the Chicago Fire defeated the Miami
Fusion.
	   The Fire (17-10) won both games this season against the league's
other expansion club.
	   Wolff knocked a rebound into the net after Fusion goalie Matt
Napoleon had made two diving saves just a minute earlier.
	   Ante Razov gave Chicago a 2-0 lead in the first half. He scored
in the 19th minute on a cross by Roman Kosecki and in the 30th
minute with an assist by Jerzy Podbrozny.
	   Miami (13-14) rallied on goals by rookie Tyrone Marshall and
midfielder Henry Gutierrez. Marshall took a pass from Diego Serna
in the 63rd minute and dribbled around Fire goalie Jorge Campos for
his first career goal. Five minutes later, Gutierrez scored on a
header with assists from Leo Cullen and Pablo Mastroeni.
 &UR; Rapids 3, Wizards 2
	   In Denver, second-half substitute Wolde Harris scored two goals
and added an assist to lead the Colorado Rapids to a victory over
the Kansas City Wizards.
	   Ross Paule scored the game-winner on a give-and-go with Harris
in the 84th minute as the Rapids (13-15, 35 points) took control of
third place in the Western Conference with a six-point swing
against the fifth-place Wizards (11-17, 29 points).
	   The Wizards took a 1-0 lead in the first half on a goal by
Digital Takawira, assisted by Paul Rideout and Preki. Takawira has
scored 10 goals in 13 career games against Colorado.
	   Harris, who entered the match in the 59th minute, tied the score
at 1-1 with an assist from Adrian Paz in the 72nd minute. Colorado
took a 2-1 lead five minutes later when a shot by Paz deflected off
Harris and beat Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann inside the near
post.
	   The Wizards tied the score at 2-2 in the 83rd minute when Mark
Chung scored his second goal in as many games. Twenty seconds
later, Paule netted the winning goal.
 &UR; Galaxy 3, Burn 0
	   In Pasadena, California, Mauricio Cienfuegos scored in the first
half and Carlos Hermosillo and Cobi Jones in the second as the Los
Angeles Galaxy defeated the shorthanded Dallas Burn.
	   Playing without three of its usual starters, including leading
scorer Jason Kreis, Dallas took six shots, one on goal, both season
lows.
	   Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made one save before being
replaced with 9:50 to play by Matt Reis, who did not need to make a
save to complete the Galaxy's fifth shutout.
	   The Western Conference-leading Galaxy (21-7, 61 points) improved
to 17-2 against teams with losing records. The Burn (13-15, 31
points) remained two points ahead of Kansas City (11-17, 29 points)
in the race for the conference's fourth and final playoff berth.
Both teams have four matches remaining.
	   Los Angeles needs two points in its final four matches or one
Chicago loss to assure itself of its second Western Conference
championship in its three-season history.

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Rookie John Snyder pitched seven innings of
three-hit ball as the Chicago White Sox beat Baltimore 3-2 on
Wednesday night, extending the Orioles' losing streak to a
season-high 10 games.
	   The 10-game skid is the Orioles' worst since they lost 21
straight to open the 1988 season. They fell below .500 for the
first time since July 26.
	   Snyder (5-2) struck out one and walked one as Chicago registered
its second three-game sweep of the Orioles in a nine-day span _ the
first in Baltimore since June 1996.
	   Carlos Castillo pitched the eighth, and Bob Howry got three outs
for his fourth save. Albert Belle drove in his 126th run and walked
twice for the White Sox, whose four-game winning streak matches
their season high.
	   Alan Mills (1-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Angels 13, Indians 5
	   In Cleveland, Randy Velarde homered and had four hits as the
Anaheim Angels rocked Bartolo Colon with seven runs in the first
two innings.
	   Gregg Jefferies tied his career high with four hits and drove in
three runs, and Jim Edmonds had three hits including a 415-foot,
three-run homer in the second _ a crushing blow to sputtering
Cleveland.
	   Colon (13-8) had his shortest outing this year and second
shortest of his career, lasting one inning plus five batters. He
allowed seven runs and nine hits. He is 4-4 with a 5.94 ERA since
appearing in his first All-Star game.
	   The AL West-leading Angels matched their season high with 21
hits.
	   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks (9-2) held Cleveland at bay until
allowing two runs in the seventh, the first on Manny Ramirez's 35th
homer.
 &UR; Rangers 5, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Ivan Rodriguez snapped a 1-for-11 slump with two
hits, including a two-run homer that helped Texas beat Detroit.
	   Rick Helling (17-7) gave up one run on six hits with four walks
and seven strikeouts over 6 1-3 innings, becoming the first Texas
pitcher since Kenny Rogers in 1995 to win 17 games.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 39th save. He allowed a
run on Bobby Higginson's sacrifice fly.
	   Brian Moehler (12-12), who started the season 9-0 at home, lost
his fifth straight decision and dropped to 9-3 in Tiger Stadium.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra hit a ninth-inning grand slam to
join Mark McGwire as one of five players to hit 30 homers in each
of his first two seasons.
	   Boston overcame a 3-0 deficit and a 15-hit attack and won with
just six hits to maintain an eight-game lead over Texas in the AL
wild-card race.
	   The winning burst against Bobby Ayala (1-10) began when third
baseman Russ Davis dropped a backhanded stab at Mike Benjamin's
grounder for an error. Darren Lewis walked, the runners moved up on
Darren Bragg's sacrifice bunt and Mo Vaughn was walked
intentionally.
	   Garciaparra, who had 30 homers last year, hit his first career
grand slam into the screen above the left-field wall. Rudy York,
Ron Kittle and Jose Canseco also had at least 30 homers in each of
their first two seasons.
	   Benjamin also homered for Boston for support of Tom Gordon
(7-3).
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Quinton McCracken extended his team-record
hitting streak to 15 games and doubled home the go-ahead run in the
seventh as Tampa Bay beat Minnesota.
	   McCracken, who singled in the fifth, broke a 1-1 tie in the
seventh. Miguel Cairo led off with a triple that left fielder Marty
Cordova lost in the lights and McCracken doubled against LaTroy
Hawkins (7-13).
	   With one out in the ninth, McCracken hit a ground ball that
shortstop Pat Meares misplayed for an error, allowing two runs to
score.
	   Esteban Yan (5-4) pitched 2 1-3 innings for the victory. Albie
Lopez pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major league save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Royals 0 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Toronto's Kelvim Escobar limited
Kansas City to four hits in 8 1-3 innings and Alex Gonzalez hit his
12th homer.
	   Escobar (4-2) struck out seven _ including five straight in the
fourth and fifth innings _ in his second consecutive victory over
Kansas City. He beat the Royals 11-1 last week in Toronto.
	   The Blue Jays have won six straight to improve to 73-66, the
first time they've been seven games over .500 since April 1994.
	   Jose Rosado (7-11) was the loser.
 &UR; Athletics 2, Yankees 0
	   In New York, the Yankees' quest to reach win No. 100 on the
earliest date in major league history was delayed when they lost to
the Oakland Athletics in a game that began more than two hours late
following heavy rain.
	   It was the first shutout loss at home for the Yankees since last
Sept. 19 against Toronto, and it ended David Cone's perfect 11-0
record in Yankee Stadium this season. It also marked just the third
time in 67 home games this season that New York (99-38) failed to
lead for at least part of the game.
	   The earliest date a team won its 100th game is Sept. 9, a feat
accomplished by both the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 1954 Cleveland
Indians. New York's next attempt will be Friday, when it starts a
three-game series against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park.
	   Gil Heredia (3-0) allowed just five hits in 7 2-3 innings as
Oakland beat the Yankees for just the third time in 11 games this
season.

SwissAir plane crashes off Nova Scotia, 229 aboard

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 229 on flight, people found in water, tightens. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A SwissAir plane carrying 229
passengers from New York to Geneva crashed in the Atlantic Ocean
off the coast of Nova Scotia, a Canadian rescue official said.
	   Grant Lingley, a Halifax emergency medical official, said people
were found in the water and they were being taken to hospitals, but
it was unclear if there were any survivors.
	   ``People are being located and are being transported in,'' he
said.
	   The plane was flying Wednesday night with 215 passengers and a
crew of 14 when it declared an emergency at 10:30 p.m. EDT (0230
GMT Thursday), said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax
Rescue Coordination Center.
	   Speaking on Swiss radio, spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said he
couldn't confirm the plane was flight 111. He said there were two
planes in the area at the time.
	   Rescuers were searching for survivors early Thursday morning and
search planes have spotted debris and an oil slick in the area
where the plane disappeared, authorities said.
	   The MD-11 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:30
p.m. EDT (0030 GMT Thursday) and attempted an emergency landing at
Halifax Airport shortly after the pilot reported smoke from the
cabin.
	   Moments later, the plane lost contact with air traffic
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, the province bordering Nova
Scotia, and disappeared off the radar screen.
	   An airport worker said the pilot dumped 208 tons of fuel over
nearby St. Margaret's Bay.
	   The plane is believed to have crashed about seven miles (11
kilometers) south of Peggy's Cove on Nova Scotia's South Shore.
	   A Hercules, two Labrador helicopters and several coast guard
vessels were on their way to the scene. Witnesses said emergency
crews were scouring the area and dozens of ambulances and fire
trucks were waiting along the coastline.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine of the search and rescue center said
the weather in the area had been good, with clear skies and
relatively calm seas.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Local fishermen headed into the water to help the rescue
operation wtinesses said.
	   In Moscow, U.S. President Bill Clinton was told of the Swiss Air
plane's disappearance just before he departed for Ireland.
	   ``We're aware of the report,'' press secretary Mike McCurry told
reporters. ``The White House is seeking additional information.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen appealed
Thursday to King Norodom Sihanouk to help break a political
deadlock while thousands of people kept up round-the-clock protests
demanding Hun Sen's election victory be overturned.
	   The Cambodian leader and senior leaders of his Cambodian
People's Party traveled to the northern town of Siem Reap, near the
ancient Angkor Wat ruins, to enlist the king's aid in avoiding a
looming constitutional crisis.
	   Sihanouk, whose powers are curbed by the constitution, retains a
moral authority for many Cambodians but it is unclear that he can
persuade the emboldened opposition to accept an election they say
was stolen.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son and head of the largest
opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and his ally Sam Rainsy have urged the
monarch not to propose a coalition government. They have already
said they would reject such a partnership with Hun Sen if their
complaints are not addressed.
	   In Phnom Penh, thousands of people joined in a student-led
demonstration in front of the state-run TVK television station as
the protests _ unprecedented in size and duration _ entered their
11th day.
	   Wearing mock white cardboard graduation hats, the students said
they were angered because the television station had not covered
Wednesday's protest at the Royal Palace and offices of the European
Union, where they urged the international community withdraw
endorsement of the election.
	   The state-run media rarely covers anything but
government-sanctioned activities.
	   About 30 riot police armed with electric prods waited inside the
Information Ministry, where TVK is headquartered. Confrontation was
avoided when 10 student demonstrators were allowed onto the
premises to speak with a TVK official.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a senior Information Ministry official, said
that the rallies were not aired ``because they are illegal.''
	   Though Hun Sen's party won a slight majority of 64 of the 122
National Assembly seats, he lacks the two-thirds majority needed to
form a government alone. The opposition has threatened to block all
attempts to do so when the new assembly meets Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen has suggested that he may try to amend the constitution
to allow him to rule alone, a move that would likely plunge the
country even further into more of the turmoil which the elections
were supposed to resolve.
	   The opposition's complaints of irregularities in voting and
counting have been rejected by the National Election Commission and
the Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body.
Both are packed with Hun Sen's supporters.
	   Sihanouk, 75, has offered to play a mediating role, inviting
representatives of the three main parties to his Siem Reap palace,
where he will preside over a weekend working group. The offer was
immediately accepted by party leaders.
	   The king said in a statement released Wednesday that the purpose
of the meeting was ``to discuss different issues that have created
a great political crisis in our motherland.''
	   The king, who is fond of referring to the Cambodian people as
his children, described it as a ``family meeting.''
	   ``I cannot promise the meeting will have a positive result, but
I hope it will be useful in making the nation feel better during
this current political crisis,'' he wrote.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-prime minister in a violent coup. Hun Sen hoped the new
polls would help him win back legitimacy and aid.
	   International observers largely endorsed the elections as
credible, but few stayed through the long counting and appeals
process. The pre-election campaign was marred by killings and
intimidation of opposition workers.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone
has had her court appeal to run in the 100-meter event at this
month's Commonwealth Games rejected.
	   Peris-Kneebone, 27, took her case to the Court of Arbitration

overlooked her for one of the three berths available in the
100-meter &QR;  She was chosen in the 4x100- and the 200-meter events.
	   The decision by Malcolm Holmes, QC, was announced Thursday.
	   Peris-Kneebone was hoping to replace Tania Van Heer in the event
after recording a better time than her rival during the season. Van
Heer had a better placing at the selection trials.
	   Peris-Kneebone may still get to run the 100-meters, if Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor succumbs to an injured knee.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Rookie John Snyder pitched seven innings of
three-hit ball as the Chicago White Sox beat Baltimore 3-2 on

pitcher since Kenny Rogers in 1995 to win 17 games.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 39th save. He allowed a
run on Bobby Higginson's sacrifice fly.
	   Brian Moehler (12-12), who started the season 9-0 at home, lost
his fifth straight decision and dropped to 9-3 in Tiger Stadium.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra hit a ninth-inning grand slam to
join Mark McGwire as one of five players to hit 30 homers in each
of his first two seasons.
	   Boston overcame a 3-0 deficit and a 15-hit attack and won with
just six hits to maintain an eight-game lead over Texas in the AL
wild-card race.
	   The winning burst against Bobby Ayala (1-10) began with Mike
Benjamin's infield single. Darren Lewis walked, the runners moved
up on Darren Bragg's sacrifice bunt and Mo Vaughn was walked
intentionally.
	   Garciaparra, who had 30 homers last year, hit his first career
grand slam into the screen above the left-field wall. Rudy York,
Ron Kittle and Jose Canseco also had at least 30 homers in each of
their first two seasons.
	   Benjamin also homered for Boston in support of Tom Gordon (7-3).
	   Jay Buhner homered for Seattle.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Quinton McCracken extended his team-record
hitting streak to 15 games and doubled home the go-ahead run in the
seventh as Tampa Bay beat Minnesota.
	   McCracken, who singled in the fifth, broke a 1-1 tie in the
seventh. Miguel Cairo led off with a triple that left fielder Marty
Cordova lost in the lights and McCracken doubled against LaTroy
Hawkins (7-13).
	   With one out in the ninth, McCracken hit a ground ball that
shortstop Pat Meares misplayed for an error, allowing two runs to
score.
	   Esteban Yan (5-4) pitched 2 1-3 innings for the victory. Albie
Lopez pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major league save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Royals 0 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Toronto's Kelvim Escobar limited
Kansas City to four hits in 8 1-3 innings and Alex Gonzalez hit his
12th homer.
	   Escobar (4-2) struck out seven _ including five straight in the
fourth and fifth innings _ in his second consecutive victory over
Kansas City. He beat the Royals 11-1 last week in Toronto.
	   The Blue Jays have won six straight to improve to 73-66, the
first time they've been seven games over .500 since April 1994.
	   Jose Rosado (7-11) was the loser.
 &UR; Athletics 2, Yankees 0
	   In New York, the Yankees' quest to reach win No. 100 on the
earliest date in major league history was delayed when they lost to
the Oakland Athletics in a game that began more than two hours late
following heavy rain.
	   It was the first shutout loss at home for the Yankees since last
Sept. 19 against Toronto, and it ended David Cone's perfect 11-0
record in Yankee Stadium this season. It also marked just the third
time in 67 home games this season that New York (99-38) failed to
lead for at least part of the game.
	   The earliest date a team won its 100th game is Sept. 9, a feat
accomplished by both the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 1954 Cleveland
Indians. New York's next attempt will be Friday, when it starts a
three-game series against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park.
	   Gil Heredia (3-0) allowed just five hits in 7 2-3 innings as
Oakland beat the Yankees for just the third time in 11 games this
season.

Commonwealth Games to open, vying for attention with power struggle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In Malaysia's traffic-choked
capital, site of the upcoming Commonwealth Games, the international
sports extravaganza is vying for attention with a nasty political
power struggle.
	   The Games, drawing athletes from Canada, Kenya, Zimbabwe,
Jamaica, New Zealand, Britain and 64 other nations, open next week
in the capital city of Kuala Lumper for the first-ever staging in
Asia.
	   Despite a gleaming new sports stadium, thousands of
red-white-and-blue banners hailing the Games and an omnipresent
smiling monkey mascot, most Malaysians seem more interested in the
country's roller-coaster politics.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has rankled the West with
his verbal barbs against Jews and currency speculators, sacked his
deputy prime minister late Wednesday.
	   Former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim, who also held the post of
finance minister, was holed up at home Thursday. In a scenario
worthy of a cheap thriller, Anwar was awaiting possible criminal
charges on allegations of sexual misconduct or even for allegedly
divulging state secrets.
	   Riot police surrounded the posh neighborhood Wednesday night
where both Anwar and Mahathir reside. Hundreds of supporters
streamed into Anwar's home in a show of solidarity.
	   Yet foreign athletes _ swimmers, divers, runners, shotputters
and hockey players _ lumbered and glided through the city, for the
most part ignoring the political drama unfolding around them.
	   Those competing have focused instead on the Sept. 11 opening of
the Commonwealth Games, which showcase athletes from countries that
once belonged to the British Empire.
	   ``I think the athletes are all quite pleased. The Australians
said things are great,'' Chandra Shekran, the media manager for the
Games, told The Associated Press.
	   The spokesman said he wasn't sure how much the participants were
aware of the political events transpiring just a few kilometers
(miles) away from their training areas.
	   ``Foreign teams give thumbs-up to facilities at Games Village,''
the English-language daily Star newspaper said Wednesday. The teams
began arriving in Malaysia this week.
	   Road crews worked at full-tilt under a broiling sun, seeking to
finish sidewalks and stretches of asphalt. Homeowners were urged to
slap another coat of paint on the walls of their homes as a
welcoming gesture for the 6,000 athletes and coaches expected to
attend.
	   The main press center on the outskirts of the city opened
earlier this week, but as of Thursday some media representatives
were complaining security was lax at the site.
	   ``I'm proud to be Malaysian'' is the motto of this feisty
country of 22 million people which has rejected any help from the
International Monetary Fund during the current Asian economic
meltdown. The country has put all of its pride on the line in
seeking to organize the best Games ever.
	   Queen Elizabeth II will close the Games on Sept. 21, stopping in
Kuala Lumpur during her only foreign voyage of the year.
	   The organizers have been spared one headache: the haze that
blanketed the city last year hasn't returned, thanks in large part
to rains that quelled huge forest fires in nearby Indonesia.
	   This year's Games, the 16th in the series, are expected to dwarf
the 1994 event in Victoria, Canada, which drew only 3,430 athletes
and officials.

Soldiers patrol two northern Indonesian towns hit by rioting,

	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Searching for looters, Indonesian
police stopped cars at checkpoints and residents swept up debris
Thursday in two northern towns hit by rioting.
	   Army reinforcements patrolled coastal Lhokseumawe, a center of
Indonesia's natural gas and petroleum industry where mobs burned
buildings and looted Chinese-owned stores earlier this week.
	   There were no reports of violence Thursday. But a day earlier,
Indonesia's military commander risked an increase in tensions by
reversing a decision to withdraw troops from the region.
	   Citing security concerns, Gen. Wiranto sent hundreds of troops
back to Aceh province, where the military has been accused of
atrocities while fighting Islamic separatist rebels. Investigators
have found mass graves with alleged victims of the military.
	   Last month, Wiranto had apologized for the military's past
record and, in a conciliatory gesture, pulled out 1,000 soldiers
from Aceh, which lies on the northern tip of Sumatra island.
	   The Aceh town of Idi was also quiet Thursday after mobs damaged
a Chinese temple and burned goods. The riots were triggered by
bitterness toward the military but lacked political direction, with
mobs targeting a common scapegoat _ the country's ethnic Chinese
minority.
	   Chinese, who make up 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
people, dominate the economy and have been blamed for an economic
crisis that has unleashed hardship on millions of poor Indonesians.
	   During the riots, one ethnic Chinese trader and his family hid
in the house of an indigenous Indonesian friend. Shopkeeper Toni
Halim said he would stay in Lhokseumawe because he was born there
and knows no other home.
	   ``We think the rioting is finished,'' Halim said.
	   One person died and 12 were injured in the mayhem Monday and
Tuesday in Lhokseumawe. The unrest was the worst since 1,200 people
died in May during riots in Jakarta that helped oust Indonesia's
long-serving, autocratic former president, Suharto.
	   Police at checkpoints were pulling over trucks after reports
that some rioters had been riding in vehicles. Several people have
been arrested.
	   Although President B.J. Habibie is implementing democratic
reforms, there are fears that economic turmoil will trigger more
unrest. After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered
riots around Indonesia over the past week.
	   In several villages in central Java island, thieves have
resorted to looting rice straight from the fields. Some farmers are
camping in their fields to prevent it being harvested overnight,
The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
	   In Jakarta, authorities have started to deploy police and
soldiers to oversee rice distribution to the poor.

Protester arrested as PM on the campaign trail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ An environmentalist was arrested
Thursday after jumping onto Prime Minister John Howard's car.
	   Howard, in the opening days of a five-week campaign ahead of the
Oct. 3 federal election, had just finished an engagement at the
Maritime Museum of Townsville.
	   Anti-nuclear demonstrators shouted and banged on the side of the
building as Howard addressed the crowd inside the museum.
	   When Howard left in his government car, a large man known
locally as ``Hinchinbrook Harry'' leapt on the hood. He was seized
by police, and one of Howard's bodyguards, and they all fell
heavily on to the road as Howard's car sped away.
	   Howard has attracted a small number of demonstrators at most of
his campaign functions, but this was the first time an arrest had
been made.

McGwire hits two more homers as Cardinals rout Marlins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit a pair of home runs for the second
consecutive night Wednesday against Florida, giving him a
career-best 59. He needs just two more to tie Roger Maris'
37-year-old U.S. Major League Baseball record.
	   McGwire homered in the seventh inning against Brian Edmondson
and again in the eighth on the first pitch from Rob Stanifer. Each
was a two-run homer, helping the St. Louis Cardinals win 14-4.
	   The first homer, which landed halfway up in the upper deck in
left field, was estimated at 497 feet (149 meters), making it the
third-longest in the history of Pro Player Stadium. The second
homer was to left center and traveled an estimated 458 feet (137
meters).
	   In his first three at-bats, McGwire grounded into a double play,
walked twice and scored on pitcher Kent Mercker's grand slam in the
fourth. Mercker (9-11) allowed two earned runs in seven innings.
	   Jesus Sanchez (6-8) took the loss. Mark Kotsay homered for
Florida.
 &UR; Astros 4, Braves 2 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Houston's Randy Johnson dominated Atlanta for eight
innings and easily won the showdown with four-time Cy Young winner
Greg Maddux.
	   Johnson allowed only four hits and fanned 10, the 99th time he's
reached double figures in strikeouts, second in baseball history to
Nolan Ryan's 215.
	   Johnson (6-1) batted in the ninth and began warming up for the
final inning before feeling a cramp in his left leg. The trainer
came out and then walked back to the dugout with Johnson at his
side.
	   The Astros ace retired 14 of the last 15 hitters he faced. Billy
Wagner worked the ninth for his 27th save despite giving up a homer
to Andruw Jones.
	   The Astros pounded Maddux (17-7) for 10 hits in seven innings,
scoring all of their runs on three homers. Jeff Bagwell hit his
29th homer in the second, Craig Biggio put the Astros head for good
with a two-run drive in the fifth, and Sean Berry hit a leadoff
shot in the seventh.
 &UR; Cubs 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 56th homer to tie Hack Wilson's
68-year-old club record and Gary Gaetti added a two-run shot for
Chicago.
	   Sosa, leading off the bottom of the sixth, hit an 0-1 pitch from
Cincinnati's Jason Bere into the first row of the right-field
bleachers.
	   Glenallen Hill singled with one out in the eighth off Gabe White
(5-5) and Gaetti hit a 3-0 pitch into the left-field bleachers for
his 14th homer and third since joining the Cubs on Aug. 19. One out
later, Scott Servais hit his seventh homer to give the Cubs a
two-run cushion.
	   Felix Heredia (2-3), who gave up a two-run double to Dmitri
Young that put the Reds ahead 2-1 in the top of the eighth, got the
win. Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his 42nd save.
 &UR; Giants 12, Expos 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit his fourth home run in four
games and Jeff Kent had two doubles and four RBIs for San
Francisco.
	   Bonds' 32nd home run of the season, a three-run shot into the
upper-deck in right off reliever Shayne Bennett made it 12-2 in the
fifth inning. Bonds, who went 3-for-3, also had an RBI single in
the second.
	   Kirk Rueter (14-9) gave up two runs and five hits in 5 1-3
innings to pick up the win. Javier Vazquez (4-14) took the loss.
	   Mike Mordecai homered for Montreal.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 2, Pirates 1, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Tony Batista hit a tying home run in the ninth,
then tripled and scored on Devon White's single in the 11th as
Arizona beat Pittsburgh for a team-record five-game winning streak.
	   Batista led off the 11th with a triple into the right-field
corner off reliever Jeff Tabaka (2-2). White singled to left for
the go-ahead run.
	   Aaron Small (3-0) pitched the 10th as Arizona improved its
extra-innings record to 5-2. Gregg Olson pitched the 11th for his
25th save.
	   Batista tied it with a one-out home run in the ninth off Pirates
closer Ricardo Rincon, who blew his third consecutive save chance.
 &UR; Brewers 8, Rockies 4 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jeff Cirillo, Dave Nilsson and Jeromy Burnitz hit
two-run homers in Milwaukee's victory over Colorado.
	   Burnitz's 31st homer capped a five-run sixth that put Milwaukee
ahead 7-2. Rafael Roque (3-1) allowed two runs on five hits in six
innings.
	   Pedro Astacio (11-14) gave up seven runs on six hits in six
innings.
	   Kirt Manwaring homered for Colorado.
 &UR; Mets 4, Padres 1 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Mike Piazza, Edgardo Alfonzo and Lenny Harris
homered off faltering Andy Ashby for all of New York's runs as the
Mets beat San Diego to remain a game behind Chicago in the National
League wild-card chase.
	   Piazza and Alfonzo homered for the second straight night, and
Piazza finished the nine-game West Coast trip with five homers and
12 RBIs.
	   Armando Reynoso (6-1) limited the Padres to four hits in eight
innings. He struck out six and walked three. John Franco finished
for his 31st save.
	   Ashby (16-7) failed for the fourth time to win his 17th.
	   Eight-time NL batting champion Tony Gwynn, in his second game
back from the disabled list, hit his 12th homer of the season with
two out in the first for San Diego's only run.
 &UR; Dodgers 6, Phillies 0 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Carlos Perez threw a two-hitter for his first
victory with Los Angeles and Matt Luke and Eric Karros hit solo
homers.
	   The Dodgers had lost all six of Perez's starts since he was
obtained from Montreal along with Mark Grudzielanek on July 31.
Perez (8-13) struck out five and walked four in his seventh career
shutout.
	   Tyler Green (6-9) was the loser.

Philippine peso, stocks fall on Malaysian political concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell sharply
against the U.S. dollar in early trading Thursday, pressured by
worries over political turmoil in Malaysia.
	   Traders said the dismissal late Wednesday of Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim triggered renewed
dollar buying in the Philippines and other regional markets.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.502 pesos, up from Wednesday's
average of 43.067 pesos.
	   Anwar's dismissal came after Malaysia imposed restrictions on
the conversion of its currency, the ringgit, into dollars.
	   In contrast, several Philippine officials underscored plans to
deepen economic reforms and pledged not to follow Malaysia's lead
in imposing capital controls to quell currency volatility.
	   Stocks sagged, meanwhile, in step with the weaker peso and Wall
Street's overnight losses, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index fell 4.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,192.95, following a
6.01-point uptick Wednesday.
	   Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone topped the list of
most actively traded issues following a company notice saying it is
moving to preempt a possible hostile takeover. PLDT's shares closed
unchanged.
	   Investors in the Manila market continue to exercise caution amid
the volatility on Wall Street, said Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant
vice president for institutional sales at Orion-Squire Securities
Inc.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 45.06-point decline to
7,782.37 reflected investor jitters over the fate of global
economies due to the crisis in Asia, he said.
	   ``The U.S. market is still vulnerable, so investors are
reluctant to position in the local market,'' Aklan said.
	   Global financial markets have looked to Wall Street for
direction since the United States remains one of the few economies
boasting strong fundamentals. But a prolonged weakness in the U.S.
stock market could ignite fears its economy is finally succumbing
to the global malaise.
	   Aklan said that while Philippine fundamentals remain generally
better off than those of its Southeast Asian neighbors, its stock
market is still vulnerable to negative investor sentiment as
overseas markets are battered.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS throughout; ADDS Pentagon sending warplanes to
Guam, conservative backlash in Japan, details. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring Tokyo's pleas not to conduct further
ballistic missile tests, North Korea could be planning a second
firing similar to one earlier this week that sent shock waves
through the region, Japanese officials said Thursday.
	   Japanese and South Korean armed forces went on an increased
level of alert to prepare for another launch and Tokyo went on a
diplomatic offensive to dissuade the communist state from going
ahead with the test.
	   But the North _ which has criticized Japan for making ``a fuss''
over the first test launch on Monday _ was apparently brushing off
Tokyo's calls for restraint.
	   ``They are rejecting our protests,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka told reporters.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first test of the new missile and rattled Tokyo by
demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases. Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are
stationed here.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Thursday that
Japan's military had upgraded its level of alertness against a
second test. He declined to comment on what measures Japan is
taking, or what information Japan had indicating a launch was
planned.
	   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   Yonhap said South Korea's military has also been placed on
coastal alert for signs of heightened North Korean military
activity.
	   Japanese media, meanwhile, said military ships were being
dispatched to the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile
launch. Defense Agency officials refused to confirm that report.
	   The United States was also strengthening its presence in the
region. The Pentagon was sending six B-52 and B-2 stealth bombers
to the Pacific island of Guam, though officials said the warplanes
were being moved only for training.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Nonaka said the Japanese government was
concerned the North might conduct a second launch to coincide with
the convening of its national congress on Saturday or the country's
national day celebrations next Wednesday.
	   But Yonhap said that the South Korean government does not
believe the North will be prepared to launch another missile in
time for the Saturday congress, when de facto leader Kim Jong Il is
expected to be formally elected president.
	   A second test is certain to further chill relations between
Tokyo and Pyongyang, which had been on the mend until the first
missile test, at a time when North Korea is increasingly dependent
on outside aid to stave off famine.
	   The first test has already prompted Japan to withdraw an offer
of talks on establishing diplomatic relations, and the government
has ruled out further food aid to the impoverished North. Japan has
also suspended work on an international project to build nuclear
reactors there and canceled all charter flights to and from the
North.
	   On Thursday, Japan's upper house of Parliament unanimously
adopted a resolution condemning North Korea's test launch and
calling for the government to take strong measures against the
country.
	   The missile test has also spurred more talk of Japan of setting
up with the United States an anti-missile defense system.
	   Conservatives in Japan were calling for more drastic measures.
	   ``In order to counter such a threat, we have to establish a
cold, merciless policy of power politics,'' the right-wing Sankei
newspaper said in an editorial Thursday. ``We also have to let them
know that we have the option of attacking launch sites in North
Korea in self-defense.''

Holocaust survivors languish in Israeli mental hospitals

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: About 1,000 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors in
Israel are patients in psychiatric hospitals. Hospital
administrators say government trustees have refused to release
German reparation funds to improve the patients' lives. An AP
reporter visited one hospital. Under privacy regulations, patients
could be identified only by initials.
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BAT YAM, Israel (AP) _ It's a sweltering day. There is no air
conditioning and C., an Auschwitz death camp survivor who has been
hospitalized with schizophrenia for half a century, lies motionless
in her bed.
	   The lights have been turned off in a vain attempt to cool the
room the 76-year-old woman shares with 15 other mental patients.
	   The air is thick with humidity and sweat trickles from the faces
of the ill and their caretakers. Down the hall, the stench of urine
wafts over from two toilets shared by 35 patients.
	   ``These are difficult conditions,'' nurse Esther Michaeli said,
sighing. Her ward is housed in several one-story concrete buildings
initially intended for Italian prisoners of war in World War II.
	   The quiet agony of some of the survivors first came to light
after the Maariv daily reported in June that government trustees
have refused requests to use the patients' German reparation funds
to improve their living conditions. No official figure was
available for the value of their accounts, but Maariv reported that
the total is in the millions _ money that reverts to the state if
the patients die without heirs.
	   The newspaper's story spurred shame and outrage in Israel, which
considers itself the protector of all Jews who lived through the
Nazi genocide. But the debate quickly faded from the headlines as
two committees began to look into how to untangle the bureaucratic
web.
	   For now, little appears to have changed.
	   At Abarbanel Hospital in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam, 120 of
5,000 patients are Holocaust survivors. Among them are J., a
retired mechanic who is haunted by flashbacks of his parents being
shot to death by storm troopers in front of his eyes, and G., who
killed a German officer trying to rape her. She lived a normal life
in Israel for years before beginning to suffer from paranoid
delusions.
	   Sixty of the survivor patients were moved into a new wing last
year and live in relative comfort. Only two patients share each
air-conditioned room. The halls are brightly painted, filled with
photographs of patients attending hospital parties.
	   The other 60 remain in the shabby former prisoner-of-war
barracks, among them C., who grew up in a small town in Poland and
is the lone member of her family to survive the Nazi genocide.
	   After her arrival in Israel following World War II, she gave
birth to a son, but was unable to raise him when she was diagnosed
with schizophrenia and hospitalized in 1951.
	   Michaeli, the nurse, said C. rarely has visitors. Her son lives
in Canada, and only comes to Israel every few years.
	   During a reporter's recent visit, C. sat up in her bed, a strand
of colored plastic beads spilling over her white hospital smock.
She gazed cross-eyed from side to side, oblivious to the woman in
the adjacent bed beating her chest lightly, or to another's stiff,
outstretched limbs.
	   It is for patients like these that Abarbanel director Avner
Elitsur had been requesting German reparations money from
government trustees. Elitsur said he wanted to buy air conditioners
and TV sets, and pay for holiday parties and outings.
	   ``It's not just a public hospital. It's the home of the patients
who will be in the hospital for the rest of their lives,'' Elitsur
said as he walked through the grounds dotted with palm trees.
	   The patients' bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   Defending their actions, members of the fund said they were only
permitted to release reparations money for private use of the
patients. Any purchase from which others also would benefit would
have to be refused.
	   Health care workers said money for dentures easily would be
approved, while a request for a field trip that would include
several patients inevitably would be denied.
	   In response to the Maariv story, the justice and health
ministries set up a committee to investigate and parliament's Law
Committee held an emotional hearing on the controversy last month.
	   Tsur, the general custodian, told the committee it was unfair to
blame him. ``I wasn't approached,'' Tsur said, pounding his fists
on a table. He said he would have granted requests had they been
received.
	   Holocaust survivor Shevah Weiss, a legislator from the
opposition Labor Party, said the money should be freed without
bureaucratic delays.
	   ``I had an uncle who went mad during the Holocaust in front of
me. I look at this through his eyes,'' Weiss said.
	   Back at Abarbanel, C. has no idea she is at the center of such a
painful debate. A reporter's questions _ ``Do you get reparations?
What do you remember from the war?'' _ do not seem to register.
	   But a human touch, a pat on the arm, and C.'s gaze turns into a
wide smile.

SwissAir plane crashes off Nova Scotia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swissair spokesman confirming flight number,
CORRECTS no. of passengers to 213 sted 229. EDITS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A SwissAir plane carrying 228
people from New York to Geneva crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off
the coast of Nova Scotia.
	   Grant Lingley, a Halifax emergency medical official, said people
were found in the water and being taken to hospitals. It was
unclear if there were survivors.
	   ``People are being located and are being transported in,'' he
said.
	   The plane was flying Wednesday night when it declared an
emergency at 10:30 p.m. EDT (0230 GMT Thursday), said Lt. Cmdr.
Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue Coordination Center.
	   SwissAir spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel told Swiss radio that
flight SR111, an MD-11, was carrying 213 passengers and 15 crew
members. He had no other details.
	   Rescuers were searching for survivors early Thursday morning and
search planes have spotted debris and an oil slick in the area
where the plane disappeared, authorities said.
	   The MD-11 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:30
p.m. EDT (0030 GMT Thursday) and attempted an emergency landing at
Halifax International Airport shortly after the pilot reported
smoke from the cabin.
	   Moments later, the plane lost contact with air traffic
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, the province bordering Nova
Scotia, and disappeared off the radar screen.
	   An airport worker said the pilot dumped 208 tons of fuel over
nearby St. Margaret's Bay.
	   The plane is believed to have crashed about seven miles (11
kilometers) south of Peggy's Cove on Nova Scotia's South Shore.
	   A Hercules, two Labrador helicopters and several coast guard
vessels were on their way to the scene. Witnesses said emergency
crews were scouring the area and dozens of ambulances and fire
trucks were waiting along the coastline.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine of the search and rescue center said
the weather in the area had been good, with clear skies and
relatively calm seas.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Local fishermen headed into the water to help the rescue
operation wtinesses said.
	   In Moscow, U.S. President Bill Clinton was told of the Swiss Air
plane's disappearance just before he departed for Ireland.
	   ``We're aware of the report,'' press secretary Mike McCurry told
reporters. ``The White House is seeking additional information.''

 &UR; Businessman tied to ousted Malaysian deputy premier to appear in
court

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A business associate of Malaysia's
sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was expected to appear
in a Kuala Lumpur courtroom on Thursday to face allegations which
could help to explain why Anwar was fired.
	   Malaysia's Attorney General, Mohtar Abdullah, filed affidavits
Thursday at the country's high court against Anwar's associate S.
Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has not yet said why he sacked
his deputy Wednesday. But police said Anwar, who was also finance
minister, was under investigation for allegations in a recently
published book.
	   The book, entitled ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM,''
alleged that Nalla, as the associate is popularly known, arranged
sexual trysts between Anwar and various women.
	   Anwar, who is married and has six children, has denied the
charges and secured an injunction against the book. The defamation
trial of author Khalid Jafri has been set for October.
	   Since the book first appeared in July, Nalla has been detained
under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which allows the government
to hold suspects without trial if they are deemed to pose a threat
to national security.
	   Nalla is being held for illegally holding 125 rounds of
ammunition at his house, a charge that carries a mandatory death
penalty. The ammunition was reportedly uncovered during the police
investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations in the book.
	   Political sources say, however, that the real reason Nalla is
being held is that he was found in possession of classified
documents which were traced back to Anwar.
	   Nalla's lawyer, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, visited Anwar at his
official residence Thursday morning. He told reporters he discussed
the Nalla case with the ousted finance minister.
	   Nalla was expected to make an appearance at the high court later
Thursday.

MD-11 only wide-body airliner powered by three engines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The Swissair plane that crashed off the eastern coast of Canada
on Wednesday was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, the world's only modern
wide-cabin airliner powered by three engines.
	   The 200-foot (60-meter) aircraft can carry 285 people in
standard configuration, or up to 410 people when all the seating is
economy class. The Swissair plane had a standard seating
arrangement, according to the flight schedule.
	   Boeing took over production of the MD-11 when it purchased St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Earlier this year, Boeing
announced that it planned to stop making the airliner in 2000.
	   The plane is built in Long Beach, California.
	   The airliner has a range of approximately 7,630 miles (12,278
kilometers), while carrying 285 passengers and their baggage. The
extended-range version can fly approximately 8,225 miles (13,236
kilometers).
	   The design's first flight was on Jan. 10, 1990.
	   A Federal Express cargo MD-11 crashed while landing early on the
morning of July 31, 1997, at Newark International Airport in New
Jersey. The five people aboard escaped safely before the plane
burned.

Chinese officials express renewed confidence in economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's economic growth should pick up in the
third quarter of this year, officials said Thursday, announcing
statistics showing a renewed consumer confidence index.
	   The State Statistical Bureau said consumer sentiment was higher
in August following three straight months of decline, while a new
index on consumer satisfaction remained stable in August.
	   According to a bureau survey, in August 35 percent of
respondents expected their personal economic situation to improve
in the next 12 months. Only 13 percent predicted their situation
would worsen.
	   Thursday's report did not elaborate or account for the other 52
percent of respondents. Numbers from previous months were compiled
but not released.
	   The bureau also said it was confident that growth in China's
gross domestic product during the third quarter would exceed the
7.0 percent registered in the first half of the year.
	   Qiu Xiaohua, the bureau's chief economist, said a 100 billion
yuan (dlrs 12.11 billion) government bond issue program would help
the country meet its annual growth target of 8.0 percent.
	   The government expects prices to begin to rebound, ending the
current deflationary trend by the end of the year.

Report: Taiwan sets date for negotiator's China visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's top China negotiator will visit
Beijing from October 12-18 for contacts that Taipei hopes will help
end a three-year break in talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation is expected to
announce the dates of Chairman Koo Chen-fu's long-awaited visit
later Thursday, Taiwan's China Times reported.
	   But his exact agenda while in China must still be worked out
with the foundation's Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the paper said.
	   An SEF spokeswoman said a letter would be sent to the
association Thursday afternoon, but declined to confirm the dates
of Koo's visit.
	   Taiwan hopes Koo's trip will pave the way for restoring
negotiations between the two groups that China, angry over moves by
Taiwan to raise its international profile, broke off in June 1995.
	   But Beijing has indicated it has low expectations for the visit,
turning a deaf ear to Taiwanese calls for preliminary talks to
arrange substantive discussions between Koo and ARATS officials.
	   Hopes dimmed after an ARATS deputy secretary general snubbed
requests for agreements on a Koo agenda and avoided contact with
SEF officials during a visit to Taipei in July _ fueling
speculation that China was seeking to sideline the foundation in
favor of groups in Taiwan more amenable to its positions.
	   China wants a tacit recognition from Taiwan of its sovereignty
over the island, and demands that political talks about
reunification between the sides be part of further discussions.
	   Taiwan maintains that the sides should avoid sovereignty
questions in favor of agreements on resolving fishing disputes and
other substantive issues discussed in previous rounds.
	   The chairmen of the SEF and ARATS last met in 1993 in Singapore
for watershed talks that marked the first formal contact between
the sides since the communists tossed Taiwan's ruling Nationalists
out of China in 1949.

Coach's croc plan foiled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) - A swimming coach planned to spice up
his training sessions by putting a three-meter (10-ft) crocodile in
the pool to make his athletes go faster.
	   Mark Davies' plan was foiled when the reptile park which was to
supply the crocodile backed down, while Darwin City Council said it
would never had let him get away with it anyway.
	   Davies said he planned to drug the crocodile and wire its jaws
shut before putting it in the normal pool with his squad of
swimmers, aged 7-20.
	   ``I had told them that to help them swim faster they should
imagine that a three-meter crocodile was chasing them, so I
thought, because our sponsor is Crocodylus Park, we might be able
to actually get a real crocodile,'' Davies said Thursday. ``I
thought it would be a good start to the swimming season.''
	   A spokesman for the wildlife park, Paul Rosenzweig, said the
three-meter crocodile had been unavailable so he took along to the
swimming club's training two crocodiles which were each less than a
meter (three feet) long.
	   Rosenzweig said they had planned to put the crocodiles in the
pool with the children but they changed their minds and just
allowed the children to touch and have their photographs taken with
them.
	   ``It was not for safety reasons that we didn't put them in, it
was just because there were so many people around who might have
become worried or scared that something might happen,'' Rosenzweig
said.
	   ``We would have done it if we could have done it in a quieter,
more controlled environment, say when the pool was shut to the
general public,'' he said.
	   He denied reports that the only reason the crocodiles were not
put in the pool was because of a Darwin City Council refusal to
allow it to take place.
	   Council chief executive Allan McGill said today that under no
circumstances would the council allow crocodiles to be put in
public pools.
	   ``Public swimming pools are for people, not for crocodiles and
as well we do not condone the stress to a crocodile that must ensue
from being physically restrained and put in chlorinated water,''
McGill said.

Protester arrested after jumping onto prime minister's car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ An environmentalist was arrested
Thursday after jumping onto Prime Minister John Howard's car.
	   Howard, in the opening days of a five-week campaign ahead of the
Oct. 3 federal election, had just finished an engagement at the
Maritime Museum of Townsville.
	   Anti-nuclear demonstrators shouted and banged on the side of the
building as Howard addressed the crowd inside the museum.
	   When Howard left in his government car, a large man known
locally as ``Hinchinbrook Harry'' leaped onto the hood. He was
seized by police, and one of Howard's bodyguards, and they all fell
heavily onto the road as Howard's car sped away.
	   Howard has attracted a small number of demonstrators at most of
his campaign functions, but this was the first time an arrest had
been made.

Britain, Ireland move on anti-terrorism legislation as Clinton
</HEADLINE>
arrives &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: Recaps previous; will be led with Clinton's arrival around
0800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined to crush IRA
dissidents who killed 28 people in a car-bombing, Britain and
Ireland pushed anti-terrorist legislation toward passage Thursday
as the target town prepared a subdued welcome for U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
	   Clinton planned to visit Omagh, scene of the Aug. 15 bombing,
during a hectic round of appearances Thursday before flying on to
Dublin.
	   Britain's House of Commons debated past midnight over Prime
Minister Tony Blair's legislation which would make it easier to
lock up the violent opponents of Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   The bill passed the key debate stage in the House of Commons on
a vote 391-17 early Thursday and later cleared the Commons
unopposed in its final reading. The bill was sent to the House of
Lords for consideration later in the day.
	   Critics of the legislation, including some with Blair's
governing Labor Party, protested that Parliament needed more than
two days to consider the bill, which would restrict the right to
silence for suspected members of active terrorist groups, and give
greater weight in court to police testimony that a suspect belonged
to a banned organization.
	   Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, while supporting
the legislation, said it was likely to be imperfect because of the
haste with which it was drafted.
	   ``It is almost bound to have loopholes. It would be a miracle if
it did not have loopholes,'' Major said. He added that the haste
was understandable ``to respond to the public mood for action
following the atrocity at Omagh.''
	   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern won near-unanimous
backing for similar legislation.
	   ``These people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them
to respect the strength of Irish democracy,'' Ahern said, referring
to the so-called Real IRA, which admitted detonating the 500-pound
(225-kg) bomb on a busy shopping day in Omagh.
	   The group has since announced it was suspending its attacks in
Northern Ireland but has not joined the Irish Republican Army in
calling a cease-fire.
	   Ahern warned the dissidents that ``they should not be in any
doubt about this government's determination to crush and dismantle
any organizations that still engage in violence.''
	   In advance of Clinton's visit, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
moved closer to saying that three decades of violence had come to
an end. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, in a statement welcomed by
Clinton, Blair, Ahern and some Protestant leaders, said that
violence must be ``a thing of the past, over, done with and gone.''
	   That statement paved the way for Adams to join other party
leaders in meeting David Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
embryonic assembly in which Catholics and Protestants will share
power.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party said the meeting would have
happened anyway, but the positive reaction to Adams' statement
created fresh optimism about the prospects for self-government in
Northern Ireland.
	   Sinn Fein followed up Wednesday by announcing that Martin
McGuinness _ its senior negotiator and the IRA's reputed former
chief _ would work with the Canadian-led commission dealing with
disarming paramilitary groups.
	   Disarmament, resisted by both the IRA and its foes on the
Protestant side, was part of the peace agreement negotiated by
eight parties in April and overwhelmingly ratified in both parts of
Ireland in referendums in May.

 &UR; SwissAir plane carrying more than 200 crashes off Nova Scotia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more details, comments; this is first SwissAir crash
since 1979. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 228 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cabin and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
	   ``We have no survivors. We do have one unfortunate victim so
far,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue
Coordination Center, as rescue efforts continued early Thursday in
the inky darkness off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   Rescue official Andre Ereaut said four bodies had been recovered
so far.
	   A Swissair spokeswoman said the plane carried 213 passengers and
15 crew. It was not immediately known if there were Americans on
board.
	   In Atlanta, Delta spokesman Bill Berry confirmed that Delta
passengers were on board the flight, which the two airlines share.
	   Swissair Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy International
Airport about 0030 GMT Thursday bound for Geneva and declared an
emergency about an hour later, Chamberlain said.
	   The pilot reported smoke in the cabin of the McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 shortly before losing contact with the air traffic control
tower in Moncton, New Brunswick, The Canadian Press said.
	   The plane also dumped fuel over nearby St. Margaret's Bay before
crashing, the news agency quoted an airport worker as saying.
	   Some aircraft debris was believed found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax, and
the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine of the Search and Rescue Center in
Halifax said the weather in the area was good, with clear skies and
relatively calm seas.
	   Residents told of hearing loud noises from an aircraft passing
overhead. Dozens of ambulances were dispatched to the scene and
rescue vessels began combing the waters off the coast.
	   CBC reported deteriorating weather conditions at the scene,
including rain.
	   Chamberlain said rescue crews were searching for the aircraft
seven miles off Peggys Cove. Local fishermen were called to the
area because they are familiar with the waters.
	   ``There have been lights spotted in the water, white lights,
that could be from lifejackets. We're not sure,'' Search and Rescue
spokesman Dan Bedell said.
	   There were four rescue planes and four helicopters in the area,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said. A Canadian navy
ship, the HMSC Preserver, also was on the scene.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   Canadian air force Col. Brian Akitt said federal emergency
officials informed him at 0250 GMT that an airliner was believed to
have gone down off the coast and the military was preparing a
rescue operation.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Bachman told
The Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Police at Kennedy Airport were not allowing reporters inside the
Delta airlines terminal used by Swissair.
	   An elderly man entering the terminal told reporters ``I know
somebody on this flight'' before police allowed him inside the
terminal.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.

Asian markets turn mostly lower

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets were lower in early trading
Thursday as investors dumped regional stocks amid political and
economic uncertainty in Malaysia, where the reform-minded finance
minister was sacked.
	   The 0.5 percent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on
Wednesday also added to the gloom in Asia, analysts said.
	   Wall Street's fall pulled share prices in Taiwan to a near
two-year low. The technology-heavy Weighted Price Index, which is
sensitive to U.S. market movements, slumped 3.4 percent to close at
6,251.38, its fourth biggest drop this year.
	   Elsewhere, the dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim, the market-friendly
finance minister, by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, hit
neighboring Singapore the hardest. Its key Straits Time Index
plunged 2.1 percent by midday to 810.19 points.
	   Malaysia's ban on overseas trading of the ringgit and equities
also has had the largest impact on Singapore because the economies
of the two countries are closely linked.
	   But in Malaysia, where Mahathir has often criticized speculators
who prey on open markets, the key Composite Index jumped 3.9
percent to close morning trading at 306.20 points.
	   Dealers said that local buying spurred by new central bank
measures that were announced before trading began Thursday had
mitigated the political uncertainty.
	   The measures will effectively add liquidity to the financial
system as well as make money cheaper.
	   In Japan, which is seen as the barometer of Asia's fortunes,
share prices fell, with the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average closing at 14,261.24 points, down 115.38 points, or 0.80
percent, from Wednesday, when the index had gained 0.05 percent.
	   The much-watched Japanese currency also rose against the U.S.
dollar on concern over speculation that foreign funds were dumping
dollar holdings and on yen-bullish comments from Japanese
officials.
	   At 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) Thursday, the dollar was trading at 136.99
yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market, down 0.63 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo, and below its late New York level of 137.50 yen
overnight.

Sacked deputy prime minister awaits possible criminal charges

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister remained holed up at his home Thursday awaiting possible
criminal charges and vowing to ``reveal what really happened.''
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was also finance minister, was sacked
Wednesday after months of bitter political differences with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Anwar said in a telephone interview published in Thursday
editions of Kompas, a daily newspaper in Jakarta, Indonesia, that
he would ``reveal what really happened in the government.''
	   He was scheduled to make his first public comments at his
residence later Thursday.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor, meanwhile,
said Anwar was under investigation on charges contained in a book
that has widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is alleged in the book to have arranged
Anwar's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are currently being tried for defamation. Anwar,
who is married and has six children, has vehemently denied all
charges of sexual affairs.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly had
resisted for weeks.
	   An aide to the prime minister said the Supreme Council of the
ruling United Malays National Organization would meet Thursday to
discuss Anwar's position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice
president, though it was likely he would be stripped of the post.
	   It appeared that some of Anwar's allies were abandoning him. The
leader of the UMNO youth wing, once seen as Anwar's power base,
announced Thursday they backed the sacking.
	   ``The youth wing of the Barisan National reiterates its
allegiance to the prime minister,'' said Zahid Hamid, president of
the powerful UMNO youth wing. The Barisan National is the ruling
coalition of 14 parties, dominated by UMNO.
	   A close friend and longtime UMNO member said Anwar supporters
were devastated by the political events.
	   ``He made a huge mistake by mixing with the wrong people,'' said
the well-known attorney who asked not to be identified. ``He
discarded his old friends and relied on untrustworthy people.''
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor,
had been left out of economic decisions for months after differing
with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Although Mahathir has never publicly blamed his finance minister
for the economic mess, he openly said the tight monetary policies
of the central bank were not going to deliver recovery.
	   The unprecedented political conflict sent Asian currencies
falling against the U.S. dollar Thursday. The Singapore dollar has
proved most vulnerable to the uncertainty, dropping steeply in
early trading.

Businessman tied to Anwar to appear in court

case with Nalla, details from affidavit &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A business associate of sacked
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was expected to appear in court
Thursday on charges that could help to explain why Anwar was fired.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor filed in High
Court on Thursday an affidavit in the case of S. Nallakaruppan, who
has been detained on weapons charges.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla is ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   A book entitled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM,'' alleges
that Nalla, as he's popularly known, arranged sexual trysts between
Anwar and women.
	   Anwar, who is married and has six children, has denied the
charges and secured an injunction against the book. The defamation
trial of author Khalid Jafri has been set for October.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has not yet said why he sacked
his deputy Wednesday. Police said Anwar, who was also finance
minister, was under investigation for allegations made in the book.
	   Since the book first appeared in July, Nalla has been detained
under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which allows for the
government to hold suspects without trial if they're deemed a
threat to national security.
	   Nalla is being held for illegally holding 125 rounds of
ammunition at his house, a charge that carries a mandatory death
penalty. The ammunition was reportedly uncovered during the police
investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations in the book.
	   Political sources say the real reason Nalla is being held is
that he was found in possession of classified documents which were
traced back to Anwar.
	   Nalla's lawyer, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, visited Anwar at his
official residence Thursday morning. He told reporters he discussed
the Nalla case with the ousted finance minister.
	   Nalla was expected in High Court later Thursday.
	   The affidavit said that Nalla and Anwar could face charges under
the Internal Security Act, the Official Secrets Act, the Women and
Girls Protection Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ With winds of 75 mph (120 kph),
Hurricane Isis hit the Mexican mainland early Thursday as it headed
north along the Gulf of California.
	   Winds rocked giant trucks and blew down road signs, forcing
closure of the main coastal highway. On Wednesday, one woman was
killed and her husband was missing after they tried to cross a
stream in Los Cabos on the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula, said Emigdio Suarez Aguilar, a civil protection official
in Baja California Sur state.
	   The body of Josefina Espinosa Agundez, 48, has been recovered.
Her husband is presumed dead. While Isis was still a tropical storm
Wednesday, it wreaked havoc on the peninsula, cutting power and
electricity and forcing thousands of residents from their homes.
	   At 0500 GMT, the center of the hurricane was about 10 miles (16
kms) southwest of Los Mochis, the weather service said. It was
moving north about 10 mph (16 kph) and may eventually shift
somewhat westward. The storm was expected to weaken as it moved
over land, the U.S. National Weather Service in Miami reported.
	   In the port city of Mazatlan, flooding was reported in 15
neighborhoods and the army was helping residents evacuate.
Forty-nine shelters have been set up and 2,500 people have been
placed in shelters in the state, the government news agency Notimex
report.
	   A hurricane warning was in effect Thursday for a 260 mile
(418-kilometer) stretch from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the
east side of the peninsula and a 400 mile (643- kilometer) stretch
from El Dorado to Bahia Kino on the mainland. A tropical storm
warning was in effect for a 300 mile (482-kilometer) stretch on the
west side of the peninsula from Puerto Cortez to Punta Eugenia.
	   The hurricane center said 5 to 10 inches (12 to 25 centimeters)
of rain was possible in the storm warning area, as well as in
portions of mainland Mexico. Dangerous flash floods and mudslides
were possible.
	   With Isis toward the west and Hurricane Earl in the east near
the Florida coast, heavy rains fell in much of Mexico.
	   In southern Chiapas state, more than 300 families had to be
evacuated after flooding along two rivers in the coastal
municipalities of Mapastepec and Acapetuhua.
	   Heavy rains also forced 95 families to seek shelter in the
municipalities of Jiutepec and Yautepec in the central state of
Morelos, Notimex reported.

Geneva airport sets up crisis center for crash relatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva airport was gearing up early Thursday
morning to cope with the crash of a Swissair jetliner from New
York.
	   Shortly after reports came in of the accident involving a
Swissair MD-11 jetliner, Geneva airport officials were alerted to
set up a crisis center to take care of passengers' next of kin,
duty officer Daniel Teysseire told reporters.
	   ``I don't remember when we have had such a serious crash,''
Teysseire said.
	   The airport's arrivals board said SR111, the only scheduled
flight from New York to Geneva, which was due to arrive at 9.30
a.m. local time (0330 GMT), was ``delayed.''
	   In Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said President Flavio Cotti
had been informed of the crash and called a special meeting of the
country's ruling coalition cabinet.
	   Swissair set up emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland and
one in New York _ for members of the public and relatives looking
for details on the flight.
	   ``Everything is ready to handle the special cases,'' Teysseire
told reporters. He gave no details of the nationality or identity
of the plane's 213 passengers and 15 crew.
	   ``It's very bad news but in such cases I try to be cool and
remember what I have to do.''
	   Geneva's last air accident was in 1982, when an Egyptair Boeing
707 went down on the airfield causing three serious injuries,
Teysseire said.
	   For Swissair, it is the first serious accident for almost 20
years.
	   Fourteen people were killed on Oct. 7, 1979, when a DC-8 jet
belonging to the company overshot the runway at Athens during
landing and burst into flames.
	   In the company's worst accident to date, 80 people were killed
when a Caravelle jet crashed at Durrenasch, Switzerland, in
September 1963.
	   In February 1970, all people 47 on board were killed when plane
of the same make crashed at Wurelingen in Switzerland. That crash
was caused by the explosion of a terrorist bomb.

Students resume classes following big protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ University students resumed studies for
exams Thursday and Yangon was calm following the largest protest so
far amid recent stepped-up agitation against the military regime.
	   Gates to the campus of the Yangon Institute of Technology,
locked during Wednesday's protest, were open and riot police were
no longer deployed on nearby roads. Traffic moved freely.
	   The protest by some 500 students Wednesday centered on exams
scheduled for Saturday, nearly two years overdue since universities
were closed during the last bout of student unrest in 1996.
	   The institute recently reopened classes for crash courses to
study for the exams, but students did not feel they had adequate
time to prepare. They marched about the campus Wednesday and
demanded a postponement.
	   The authorities, confronted with a renewed campaign for more
democracy led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, reacted quickly
and deployed hundreds of police in the area and sealed off roads.
	   After a day of negotiations with their teachers, the students
were finally allowed to leave the campus. The government indicated
that there would be no arrests. The demands for exam postponement
appeared not to have been met.
	   The institute has been a hotbed of student unrest in the past
and authorities are keeping a close eye on the universities as they
grapple with Suu Kyi's latest campaign. About 200 students staged a
hit-and-run protest at an intersection Aug. 24.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has demanded that
a parliament elected in 1990 finally be allowed to convene.
	   The elections were overwhelmingly won by her National League for
Democracy, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962,
never allowed the legislature to meet.
	   The stepped-up campaign coincides with the 10th anniversary of
an uprising against military rule that was crushed by the army,
leaving an estimated 3,000 people dead.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, whose activities are severely restricted, and
senior leaders of her party met foreign diplomats Wednesday to
discuss the recent campaign. Few details were disclosed.
	   Suu Kyi appears to have recovered from a recent 13-day roadside
standoff on a bridge outside Yangon with authorities, who refused
to let her van travel to the provinces to meet supporters.
	   On Tuesday, she was interviewed by foreign journalists and
appeared fit.
	   She said it was ``quite possible'' the government would carry
through with threats to arrest opposition leaders and ban her party
if she tries to convene the parliament.
	   The government accuses Suu Kyi and the NLD of working with
foreign nations to destabilize the country.

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen met Thursday with
King Norodom Sihanouk to help break Cambodia's political deadlock
while thousands of people kept up round-the-clock protests
demanding his election victory be overturned.
	   Hun Sen and senior leaders of his Cambodian People's Party
traveled to the northern town of Siem Reap, near the ancient Angkor
monuments, to enlist the king's aid in avoiding a looming
constitutional crisis.
	   Sihanouk, whose powers are curbed by the constitution, retains a
moral authority for many Cambodians but it is unclear that he can
persuade the emboldened opposition to accept an election they say
was stolen in massive fraud.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son and leader of the
largest opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and ally Sam Rainsy have urged
the monarch not to suggest a coalition. They have already rejected
a partnership with Hun Sen if their complaints are not addressed.
	   In Phnom Penh, thousands of people joined in a student-led
demonstration in front of the state-run TVK television station as
the protests _ unprecedented in size or duration _ entered their
11th day.
	   Wearing mock white cardboard graduation hats, the students said
they were angered because the station ignored Wednesday's protest
at the Royal Palace and offices of the European Union, where they
urged the international community withdraw endorsement of the
election.
	   The state-run media almost never covers anything except
government activities.
	   About 30 riot police armed with electric prods waited inside the
Information Ministry, where TVK is located. Confrontation was
avoided when 10 student demonstrators were allowed into the
premises to speak with a TVK official.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a senior Information Ministry official, said
that the rallies were not aired ``because they are illegal.''
	   Though Hun Sen's party won a slight majority of 64 of the 122
National Assembly seats, he lacks the two-thirds majority needed to
form a government alone. The opposition has threatened to block all
attempts to do so when the new assembly meets Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen has suggested that he could try to change the
constitution so he can rule alone, a move that will plunge the
country even further into turmoil the elections were supposed to
resolve.
	   The opposition's complaints of irregularities in voting and
counting have been rejected by the National Election Commission and
the Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body.
Both are packed with Hun Sen's supporters.
	   Sihanouk, 75, has offered to play a mediating role, inviting
representatives of the three main parties to his Siem Reap palace,
where he will preside over a weekend working group. The offer was
immediately accepted by party leaders.
	   The king said in a statement released Wednesday that the purpose
of the meeting was ``to discuss different issues that have created
a great political crisis in our motherland.''

Five-man delegation heads to Afghanistan to retrieve three

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A five-man delegation, including two
Iranian diplomats, headed Thursday to neighboring Afghanistan to
retrieve three of at least 33 Iranians deatined in the war-ravaged
nation.
	   Differences between Iran and the ruling hard-line Taliban army
have deepened since 11 Iranian diplomats disappeared following a
Taliban takeover of key parts of north Afghanistan from its
northern-based opponents.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms, ammunition and
money to its enemies, while Iran says the religious militia is
holding 70 of its nationals, including the 11 diplomats and a
journalist for the official Iranian news agency.
	   The Taliban, however, say it is holding only 33 Iranian
nationals, all truck drivers whom they suspect of ferrying in
military supplies to its enemies.
	   The Iranians were captured in early August when Taliban troops
took the key opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan. The Iranian diplomats were working at the Iranian
Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif at the time.
	   Iran asked neighboring Pakistan, a close Taliban ally, to
intercede to free its nationals. Pakistan, one of the few countries
to recognize the Taliban, has sent its ambassador, Aziz Khan, to
Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar to help retrieve the
captured Iranians.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar offered Wednesday to free
the three Iranian captives as a ``gesture of good will''.
	   Since the disappearance of the diplomats, Iran has begun
wide-scale military exercises on its border with Afghanistan,
deploying more than 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers.
	   Earlier this week, Iran warned Afghanistan that it would
consider all options to retrieve its nationals. There were some
reports from Tehran that the authorities there feared the diplomats
had been killed by Taliban troops.
	   The Taliban has denied the accusation.
	   The delegation is expected to return to Pakistan later Thursday.

Anwar may find little support among his old allies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia Politics

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The day after he was sacked as
Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim is finding himself
with few friends.
	   The youth wing of the governing United National Malays
Organization, or UMNO, once seen as Anwar's power base, met
Thursday and announced it was backing Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   ``The youth wing of the Barisan National reiterates its
allegiance to the prime minister,'' said Zahid Hamid, president of
the powerful youth wing. The Barisan National is the ruling
government coalition of 14 parties, dominated by UMNO.
	   Two months ago, when Zahid rocked the party's annual convention
by raising the issue of internal reform and corruption, he was seen
by many as a close ally of Anwar, the party's youth leader from
1982 to 1987.
	   Zahid's campaign against cronyism and nepotism, including
allegations that party leaders had misused their positions to
enrich relatives and friends, was quickly crushed by Mahathir.
Zahid fell silent.
	   Anwar, 51, in July also quickly praised Mahathir and swore
loyalty to the man who has led Malaysia for 17 years. But it was
obviously too late for him to mend fences with the boss with whom
he had differed on economic policy.
	   ``The youth wing requests everyone to remain calm at this
time,'' Zahid said Thursday, in an indication that Anwar's
supporters were unlikely to hold public demonstrations.
	   Former Cabinet colleagues of Anwar, who was deputy prime
minister for five years, met and endorsed Mahathir's dramatic move.
	   Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz, who
had often worked closely with her colleague in the finance
ministry, described it as a ``very sad of turn of events'' but did
not support Anwar.
	   ``Today, I read in the newspapers that people say leaders come
(and) leaders go. That is very true. No one is indispensable,'' she
said.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid said:
``I feel sad because this is happening at a time when the country
is facing an economic slowdown.''
	   But no tear was publicly shed for Anwar, even by those who had
spent decades with him in politics.
	   ``The history of UMNO has shown that every test can be
overcome,'' said Ibrahim Ali, a senior party leader who was Anwar's
partner in radical student politics in the 1970s. Both men were
imprisoned together for two years under the Internal Security Act
for inciting a peasant protest a quarter-century ago.
	   As it became increasingly clear that Anwar was going to be
charged once again, and perhaps arrested, under the same security
law, party colleagues said they had confidence in the judiciary.
	   ``We believe in the wisdom of the leadership and the Malaysian
legal system to decide the situation,'' said Zulfiki bin Mohamed
Alwi, another senior UMNO leader.
	   The security law allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   ``Actually it goes to show that nobody is above the law, that
where the law applies does not matter, be it a small or a big
man,'' said Rafidah, the trade minister.
	   Police investigations into a book containing allegations against
Anwar had found the case to involve national security
considerations that could lead to his prosecution, said the
national news agency Bernama.

Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside; Russian currency slides

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin saying he will not withdraw his
candidacy, Communist Cabinet minister quits, ruble rate falling. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Viktor Chernomyrdin insisted Thursday he would
remain a candidate for prime minister, despite opposition demands
that he withdraw so that a compromise figure could deal with
Russia's deepening financial crisis.
	   But Communist Leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated that his party
will vote against Chernomyrdin a second time on Friday.
	   Communists and their allies blame Chernomyrdin for landing
Russia in the current mess, and Chernomyrdin was overwhelmingly
rejected in voting Monday.
	   The State Duma has scheduled a second vote for Friday, although
some lawmakers have called for Chernomyrdin to withdraw and others
are seeking another candidate.
	   ``Neither my conscience nor my sense of duty allows me to take
such an irresponsible step,'' the acting prime minister told the
Interfax news agency.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, President Boris Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to
dissolve the parliament.
	   However, as Russia's ruble slipped and the International
Monetary Fund signaled it might delay a loan payment to Russia this
month, the ranks of those opposing Chernomyrdin began to thin.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated Wednesday
that his 50-member faction, third largest in the Duma, would
support Chernomyrdin after having abstained from the first vote.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operating room,'' the Liberal Democratic
Party leader said.
	   Influential regional leaders in the Federation Council,
parliament's upper house, also endorsed Chernomyrdin. The chamber
will likely pass a resolution Friday backing Chernomyrdin's
candidacy, council member Murtaza Rakhimov said _ putting more
pressure on the Duma, the lower house, to confirm him.
	   However, the Duma sent a letter to Chernomyrdin on Wednesday
urging him to step aside. The Communists want a compromise
candidate such as Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov or acting Industry
Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Maslyukov, a former Soviet bureaucrat, was the only Communist in
the Cabinet, appointed by Yeltsin earlier this year to appease
parliament. But he resigned Thursday, saying the government had
never passed the necessary measures creating his ministry.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The Russian ruble went
far beyond the state-set fluctuation band Wednesday and the Central
Bank said it had no choice but to leave the currency to the mercy
of market forces.
	   The Central Bank had announced on Aug. 17 that the ruble would
be allowed to fluctuate in a band of 6.0-9.5 to the U.S. dollar or
16.6 cents 10.5 cents.
	   But the official rate broke through the lower limit for the
ruble Tuesday, and was set Wednesday morning at 13.5 against the
dollar or 7.4 cents.
	   The government's revenues have continued to fall. Acting tax
chief Boris Fyodorov said that tax collections in August had
amounted to 11.2 billion rubles, some 2 billion rubles (dlrs 150
million at Wednesday's exchange rate) less than planned. He said
the financial crisis had pushed many taxpayers to delay payments,
while those actually made often were stranded in the banks.
	   Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund officials have said the
fund might delay its next disbursement of a major stabilization
loan.
	   A dlrs 4.3 billion installment is expected in coming weeks, but
IMF officials said Russia must do more to improve the economic
situation, Russian media reported.
	   Russia reached a deal in July with the IMF and other
international financial institutions for more than dlrs 22 billion
in loans this year and next, but the money did not ward off the
latest economic crisis.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The man who was prime minister during
Rwanda's massacre of more than 500,000 Tutsis in 1994 may seek a
lighter sentence Thursday for admitting guilt to genocide and
pledging to testify against other alleged ringleaders.
	   Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians.
	   ``He became the first person to accept culpability for genocide
before an international court,'' the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda said. The offense was decreed and defined in
1948 after the Nuremberg trials.
	   Thursday's session was staged amid security that was lighter
than the previous day, when the tribunal found former village mayor
Jean-Paul Akayesu guilty of genocide. Kambanda arrived under police
escort, but not wearing a bulletproof vest as Akayesu had.
	   The 300-page judgment against Akayesu, in addition to being the
first-ever international verdict on genocide, also marked the first
time an international court defined rape as a genocidal crime.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo
trading Thursday on verbal intervention by Japanese officials and
lingering concern over the direction of Wall Street. Japanese
stocks declined.
	   The dollar bought 136.99 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.63
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 137.50 yen overnight.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice minister
for international affairs, warned that the yen may continue to
strengthen against the U.S. currency, prompting some dealers to
unload dollar holdings, traders said.
	   But worry that the Dow Jones industrial average may stage a
repeat performance of Monday's plunge also weighed on the dollar,
they said.
	   ``Sakakibara's comments continue to have an effect, but the main
reason (for the dollar's weakening) is that overseas investors feel
that the Dow could be unstable for some time,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro Bank.
	   On Wall Street overnight, the Dow average dropped 45.06 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 7,782.37. It had suffered its second-biggest
point loss ever on Monday, dropping 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent,
to 7,539.07.
	   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks closed lower Thursday on similar unease
about global markets, along with mounting concern over profit
growth at Japanese companies, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 115.38 points,
or 0.80 percent, to close at 14,261.24. On Wednesday, the index had
gained 6.99 points, or 0.05 percent.
	   Fresh worries about corporate earnings were triggered by Hitachi
Ltd.'s surprise reversal early Thursday of a previous net profit
forecast for the fiscal year through March to a net loss _ the
first red ink ever for the leading electronics manufacturer.
	   The market was also pulled lower after the Nihon Keizai business
daily reported that Toa Steel had effectively gone bust and that
its operations will be taken over by steelmaker NKK.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange lost 4.99 points, or 0.45 percent, to
1,113.77. The TOPIX rose 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent, the previous
day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.070 percent, up from Wednesday's 1.065 percent. Its
price fell to 112.62 yen, down from 112.66 yen.

Moths force swap to long pants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ When New Zealand lawn bowler Millie
Khan takes to the Malaysian greens from late next week in search of
Commonwealth Games gold, she'll probably be wearing long trousers
rather than her more traditional white skirt.
	   But it won't be because the 60-year-old legend has suddenly
become fashion conscious.
	   She, like the rest of the New Zealand women's bowling team, are
worried about moths nipping their legs.
	   Last month the team practised in Kuala Lumpur to adjust to the
heat and conditions they will experience.
	   One night one of the women ran screaming from the greens,
shouting that she had been bitten. The culprit was allegedly a
Malaysian moth in heat.
	   Apparently the moths, about the size of the palm of an average
hand, are attracted to the lights for breeding. Some used the
greens to express their passion and were promptly squashed by a
speeding bowl.
	   Bowls New Zealand president Malcolm Kidd said because the dress
code was more liberal, players were allowed to play in long pants
to escape the moths' attention.

Philippine students block traffic at U.S. Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Several dozen student activists lay
down on a busy boulevard in front of the U.S. Embassy on Thursday,
briefly blocking traffic to oppose a proposed military pact with
Washington.
	   Police and embassy security guards stopped the protesters from
approaching the embassy, which has been tightly guarded following a
bomb threat and the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
	   Before blocking traffic, the 30 activists stood on concrete
rectangular flower pots in front of the embassy and yelled slogans
against the pact, called the Visiting Forces Agreement, which would
allow U.S. troops to stage war exercises in the Philippines.
	   The protesters left without any violence or arrests.
	   Early this year, Philippine and U.S. officials signed the
agreement, which governs the conduct of military exercises and
provides some legal protection to U.S. soldiers while on duty in
the country. It must be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate
before it can take effect.
	   Critics say the accord infringes on Philippine sovereignty
because it limits the Manila government's right to prosecute
American soldiers who commit crimes here.

Taiwanese economic downturn sends more people to hawk in street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The economic downturn has forced growing
numbers of unemployed people to work as street vendors to make ends
meet, officials and newspapers reported Thursday.
	   In Taipei, a recent official survey revealed there were 18,000
unlicensed and 6,200 licensed street vendors. But the China Times
newspaper said a lackluster stock market and worsening economic
slowdown have sent the number up further.
	   The official jobless rate in Taipei in the first six months
remained at last year's level of 2.35 percent. The capital has a
population of 2.6 million.
	   But Tang Yun-teng, a Labor Bureau official, said the rate may
fail to reflect an increase in company shutdowns and layoffs.
	   ``Many of the unemployed may have chosen to work as street
vendors,'' Tang said. ``They could be chased away by the police
anytime, but they are willing to take the risk in order to live.''
	   Taiwan's high savings rate has also allowed many of the
unemployed to stay with their families without seeking government
help, Tang said.
	   Affected by the regional financial turmoil, Taiwan's exports
fell 7 percent in the first six months this year, and its economic
growth rate is expected to be slightly over 5 percent this year,
compared with 6.8 percent last year.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 229 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
	   ``We have no survivors. We do have one unfortunate victim so
far,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue
Coordination Center, as rescue efforts continued early Thursday in
the inky darkness off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   Rescue official Andre Ereaut said four bodies had been recovered
so far.
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Local fishing vessels helped comb the waters for possible
survivors. But early Thursday, there were only reports of rescuers
finding bodies and human remains in 16-degree (61-degree
Fahrenheit) waters.
	   Philippe Roy, a Geneva airports spokesman, said the Geneva-bound
Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy International Airport about 8:30
p.m. (0030 GMT) with 215 passengers _ including two infants _ and
14 crew.
	   The passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many from the
French-speaking west of the country, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz told a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   One of the crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot had apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   In Atlanta, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the ``best
information available'' was that 53 Delta passengers were on board
the flight.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour
into the flight, Chamberlain said.
	   The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit shortly before losing
contact with the air traffic control tower in Moncton, New
Brunswick, The Canadian Press said.
	   The plane also dumped fuel over nearby St. Margaret's Bay before
crashing, the news agency quoted an airport worker as saying.
	   Some aircraft debris was believed found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax, and
the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Residents told of hearing loud noises from an aircraft passing
overhead. Dozens of ambulances were dispatched to the scene and
rescue vessels began combing the waters off the coast.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Bachman told
The Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Claudia Zinck-Gilroy added: ``The motors were still going, but
it was the worst-sounding deep groan that I've ever heard.''
	   Chamberlain said rescue crews were searching for the aircraft
seven miles (11 kilometers) off Peggy's Cove. Local fishermen were
called to the area because they are familiar with the waters.
	   There were four rescue planes and four helicopters in the area,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said. A Canadian navy
ship, the HMSC Preserver, also was on the scene.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday morning, said Inspector Anthony Insanti
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department.
The Port Authority manages Kennedy airport.
	   ``Our first priority are the families,'' Insanti told reporters
at Kennedy airport. ``I believe about 15 families are here. I'm
sure the number will increase.''
	   Insanti said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   Police Officer R. Morris, who has been taking family members in
as they arrive, said ``They seem to be handling it pretty well.''
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.

India's defense to buy more commercial technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's defense industry will streamline
itself by giving up work on products already available on the
market, Defense Minister George Fernandes said Thursday.
	   For years, defense laboratories duplicated the work of
commercial factories for everything from clothing and telephones to
computer software and aircraft parts, Fernandes told a meeting of
information technology experts in New Delhi.
	   Army Chief V.P. Malik added that he planned to move toward a
fully computerized inventory control system and wanted to make the
1 million-strong Indian army ``fully computer literate.''
	   As incentive, only computer literate officials will be allowed
to travel abroad, he said.

Police kill one man after crowds attack Indonesian police station

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police shot to death a villager after
mobs angry over the arrest of two residents attacked a police
station, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Officers seized six Molotov cocktails from rioters in Way Halom
village on the outskirts of Palembang, about 400 kilometers (250
miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Kompas, a daily Jakarta newspaper, said a 35-year-old villager
was killed during the violent demonstration Wednesday for the
release of two youths accused of stealing. Protesters hurled rocks,
smashing windows in the police station.
	   ``The mobs were brutal. Police fired warning shots, but (the
rioters) ignored them,'' Kompas quoted police spokesman Lt. Col.
Sardjo as saying.

Korea's conglomerates strike deals on merging subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two top South Korean computer chip
makers agreed to merge Thursday in an industry shakeup that forced
the nation's bloated conglomerates to reorganize some of their key,
overlapping subsidiaries.
	   The marriage between Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. and LG
Semicon will create the world's second largest computer memory-chip
maker with a combined 17-percent market share. Samsung, also from
South Korea, leads the market with a 19 percent share.
	   The Hyundai-LG merger was the highlight of a package agreement
unveiled Thursday, in which the nation's top five conglomerates
merged 17 of their key subsidiaries.
	   ``The deals will relieve some of the burden of the excessive,
overlapping investments,'' said Sohn Byung-doo, vice chairman of
the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobby of big businesses.
	   ``The restructuring drive will spread further in the future and
will help reclaim international confidence for the country's
economy.''
	   The deals also included:
	   _A merger of the aircraft components subsidiaries of Samsung,
Daewoo and Hyundai.
	   _A merger of rolling stock arms of Hyundai and Daewoo. A smaller
rolling stock builder, Hanjin, will join the merger later.
	   _Samsung and Hyundai will merge their petrochemical companies.
	   _Hyundai will take over the oil refinery and gas-station chain
owned by Hanwha.
	   _Samsung will sell its ship engine plant to Hanjoong, a
state-owned heavy industries company.
	   _Hyundai and Hanjoong will merge their power plant-building
operations.
	   Officials still have to work out details of these deals, Sohn
said.
	   Conspicuously absent in Thursday's industry shakeup was
automobile companies, whose sprawling facilities have come to
symbolize South Korea's industrial overexpansion.
	   South Korean car makers are operating at half their combined
annual capacity of 4 million vehicles.
	   The auto industry restructuring was stalling pending the fate of
bankrupt Kia Motor Co., the country's No. 2 carmaker, now up for an
international auction.
	   Mostly family-run enterprises known as ``chaebol,'' South Korean
conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and over
diversifying during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for
its financial crisis.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has been insisting on their
restructuring, promising tax breaks and other benefits. Kim has
said he would withhold loans from state-controlled banks unless the
debt-ridden conglomerates restructured themselves.
	   The International Monetary Fund demanded a reorganization of
Korean conglomerates as a condition for a record dlrs 58 billion
bailout in December.
	   Major South Korean businesses have been reeling under sluggish
sales at home and falling prices abroad, which critics attributed
partly to oversupply by South Korean firms.
	   South Korean computer chip makers, for example, have cut their
monthly production by up to 25 percent this year in an attempt to
boost prices in a glutted market.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 cross-funded
subsidiaries.
	   At least eight of them collapsed under heavy debt last year,
saddling banks with billions of dollars in bad loans and fueling
the financial turmoil still besetting the nation.

Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside; Russian currency slides

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Chernomyrdin quote, Communists seeking open
vote, impeachment debate expected soon. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Viktor Chernomyrdin insisted Thursday he would
remain a candidate for prime minister, despite opposition demands
that he withdraw so that a compromise figure could deal with
Russia's deepening financial crisis.
	   But Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated that his party
will vote against Chernomyrdin a second time. Communists and their
allies blame Chernomyrdin for landing Russia in the current
economic mess, and he was overwhelmingly rejected in voting Monday.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
President Boris Yeltsin fired Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin as acting premier.
	   The State Duma plans a second vote on Chernomyrdin on Friday,
although some lawmakers have called for Chernomyrdin to withdraw
and others are seeking another candidate.
	   ``Neither my conscience nor my sense of duty allows me to take
such an irresponsible step,'' the acting prime minister told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Chernomyrdin also rejected lawmakers' suggestions that he was
using the prime minister's job as a springboard to a presidential
bid in 2000 _ even though he is widely considered to be a leading
contender.
	   ``I would like to see the nut who would call this a good
starting point for presidential elections,'' he told Interfax.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, President Boris Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to
dissolve the parliament.
	   However, as Russia's ruble slipped again Thursday and the
International Monetary Fund signaled it might delay a loan payment
to Russia this month, the ranks of those opposing Chernomyrdin
began to thin a bit.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky indicated Wednesday
that his 50-member faction, third largest in the Duma, would
support Chernomyrdin after having abstained from the first vote.
	   ``It would be easier for him to continue the surgery since he
has just come out of the operating room,'' the Liberal Democratic
Party leader said.
	   Influential regional leaders in the Federation Council,
parliament's upper house, also endorsed Chernomyrdin. The chamber
will likely pass a resolution Friday backing Chernomyrdin's
candidacy, council member Murtaza Rakhimov said _ putting more
pressure on the Duma, the lower house, to confirm him.
	   However, the Duma sent a letter to Chernomyrdin on Wednesday
urging him to step aside. The Communists want a compromise
candidate such as Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov or acting Industry
Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Maslyukov, a former Soviet bureaucrat, was the only Communist in
the Cabinet, appointed by Yeltsin earlier this year to appease
parliament. But he resigned Thursday, saying the government had
never passed the necessary measures creating his ministry.
	   The Communists said Thursday they want the second vote on
Chernomyrdin to be an open vote, with each lawmaker voting
publicly. This would prevent Communists from breaking ranks, and
publicly denouncing Chernomyrdin while privately supporting him to
prevent new elections.
	   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said the Duma could be ready to
debate an impeachment motion against Yeltsin next week. The motion,
like previous attempts, stands little chance of passing, given the
president's strong constitutional powers.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The ruble fell to 13.5 to
the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday morning. It crashed through
the lower limit of a government-set fluctuation band on Tuesday and
again Wednesday.
	   The Central Bank had announced on Aug. 17 that the ruble would
be allowed to fluctuate in a band of 6.0-9.5 to the U.S. dollar or
16.6 cents 10.5 cents.
	   The government's revenues have continued to fall. Acting tax
chief Boris Fyodorov said that tax collections in August had
amounted to 11.2 billion rubles, some 2 billion rubles (dlrs 150
million at Wednesday's exchange rate) less than planned.
	   He said the financial crisis had pushed many taxpayers to delay
payments, while those actually made often were stranded in the
banks.

Prosecutors arrest former Japanese Defense Agency official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested a former senior Japanese
Defense Agency official and three company executives Thursday for
in a scandal involving cozy ties between the government and a
defense contractor.
	   The officials arrested are suspected of allowing a private
supply company to keep profits made by overcharging the government
in exchange for giving jobs to retiring Defense Agency employees.
	   After raiding the central Tokyo headquarters of Japan's Defense
Agency, prosecutors said they arrested Kenichi Ueno, a 59-year-old
former deputy director of the agency's procurement department.
	   Ueno is suspected of having conspired to reduce the amount of
money Toyo Communication Equipment Co. had to reimburse the
government after overcharging for military supplies.
	   Prosecutors said they also arrested Toyo Communication president
Shinichi Ito and sales director Yasunori Nagamoto, along with Hideo
Arai, a former defense project promotion chief at NEC Corp. _ the
largest shareholder in Toyo Communications _ and the current head
of another NEC affiliate.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.2 million) to the government in 1994 for having sold
overpriced equipment over a five-year period. But it wound up only
having to return 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4 million) to government
coffers.
	   In return for the lower payment, Ueno, who left the agency in
1995, had allegedly pressured Toyo Communication to hire several
retired Defense Agency officials.
	   The Defense Agency issued a statement Thursday calling the raid
``extremely regrettable.''
	   ``We'll do our best to improve defense procurement...in order to
regain the public trust,'' the statement said.
	   The arrests come as just the latest scandal involving
questionable ties between civil servants in Japan and private
companies eager to do business with the government.
	   Earlier this year, Tokyo prosecutors arrested officials working
at the Finance Ministry and central bank on influence-peddling
charges.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A building that was being demolished
collapsed in northern Vietnam, killing five workers and injuring
12, police said Thursday.
	   The five-story building had been put up for workers of the Bim
Son cement plant, in Thanh Hoa province, in 1980, police said. It
had deteriorated and was abandoned several years ago.
	   Police blamed the Sunday accident on lack of coordination
between several groups of workers hired by the contractor.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A mechanical engineer says he warned
contractors that a foot bridge built to carry athletes across a
polluted river would buckle under the pressure of large groups of
people.
	   The bridge collapsed July 14, 1997 at the opening ceremony of
the Maccabiah Games, an international sporting event for Jewish
athletes, sending dozens of Australians into the waters below. Four
team members died and many were injured.
	   Five people, including contractors and the bridge engineer, are
on trial in Tel Aviv District court on charges of criminal
negligence as a result of the collapse.
	   Igor Zolitsky, who works for the bridge's engineer, testified
Wednesday that he ran the bridge design through computerized
simulation tests which revealed it would not be strong enough to
hold more than 100 people at one time.

Taiwan says Malaysian political wrangling shouldn't affect ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Relations with Malaysia are unlikely to be
affected by political wrangling in that country that forced out the
deputy prime minister, the government said Thursday.
	   Cabinet spokesman Chen Chien-jen said Taiwan's relations with
Malaysia ``should not'' be affected by the firing Wednesday of
Anwar Ibrahim, who was also Malaysia's minister of finance.
	   A spokesman for the Economics Ministry said Taiwan will continue
encouraging investment in Malaysia because the ``basic economic
policies there have not changed.''
	   However, Taiwan is keeping a close eye on developments in
Malaysia, where Taiwanese have sunk U.S. dlrs 8.45 billion to
become the country's second-largest source of direct foreign
investment, said the spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous.
	   Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang departed for Kuala Lumpur
Thursday for annual talks on investment, tariffs and business
promotion, the Economics Ministry said.
	   With Southeast Asia plunged into economic crisis, Taiwan has
agreed to raise its quota on imports of Malaysian-made cars to give
a shot in the arm to that country's sagging exports, the China
Times newspaper reported.
	   Taiwan's vice president and premier both visited Malaysia
earlier this year to reaffirm economic ties, despite the lack of
diplomatic relations between Taipei and Kuala Lumpur.
	   Wang will also lead Taiwan's delegation at a meeting in Kuala
Lumpur of Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ministers to
discuss promotion of small and medium-size businesses, the
Economics Ministry said.

Report: Thailand, Indonesia face dlrs 40,000 fines for allged farce
</HEADLINE>
game

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Tiger Cup tournament committee has
recommended that the Thai and Indonesian national soccer teams be
fined dlrs 40,000 for a match in which neither allegedly played to
win, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   In one of the most bizarre moments in soccer history, Indonesia
scored an intentional own goal in the final seconds of Monday
night's final group match, handing Thailand a 3-2 victory.
	   Both teams have acknowledged they did not want to play Vietnam,
particularly on National Day in Hanoi, Vietnam, where boisterous
fans have packed the 20,000-seat stadium during the Tiger Cup.
	   Quoting minutes from a meeting of the tournament committee, The
Straits Times reported that dlrs 40,000 fines each were being
recommended to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Football
Council, when it meets Friday in Hanoi.
	   ``If the committee had the authority ... to do so, it would wish
to suspend the two teams for at least six months,'' the newspaper
quoted the minutes as saying.
	   The committee said it hopes that the ASEAN Football
Confederation and the international soccer body, FIFA, would ``take
the necessary action against this display of poor sportsmanship,''
according to the newspaper report.
	   If Thailand gets suspended for more than three months, the
national team will not be able to play in the Asian Games in
Bangkok in December.
	   The newspaper quoted both team managers as saying the suggested
fine was too high.
	   Andrie Amin, identified as the Indonesian team manager, was
quoted as saying he expected a fine of no more than dlrs 10,000.
	   ``We will probably appeal if the recommendations are made
official,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
	   ``The punishment recommended is too heavy,'' said Kasem
Julayawongse, identified by the newspaper as the Thai team manager.
``We played our football and did nothing wrong.''
	   However, the Thai team manager who was in charge during the
disputed game was Teerachai Wutitham and he announced his
resignation Wednesday in Hanoi.
	   But there also were hints that both Indonesia and Thailand
feared that Vietnam had fixed a Saturday match that ended in a draw
after Singapore had two goals disallowed for questionable offsides
calls. Vietnam has denied any wrongdoing.

Ethnic Chinese sheltering in military offices in riot-torn

Indonesian town

offices.

<TEXT>
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Too terrified to return home,
about 100 ethnic Chinese were holed up Thursday in military offices
in a riot-torn northern Indonesian town.
	   Army reinforcements patrolled coastal Lhokseumawe, a center of
Indonesia's natural gas and petroleum industry where mobs burned
buildings and looted Chinese-owned stores this week.
	   There were no reports of violence in northern Aceh province on
Thursday. But members of the ethnic Chinese minority kept their
shop shutters down for fear of more unrest.
	   The riots were triggered by bitterness toward the military but
lacked political direction, with mobs turning on the Chinese, a
common scapegoat in times of tension.
	   Two groups of 50 Chinese were staying in offices of the military
district commander, sleeping on borrowed mattresses and cooking.
Some had fled their houses on Tuesday during the worst of the
rioting.
	   ``They're still scared,'' said army Lt. Col. Giyono. ``It's up
to them how long they want to stay.''
	   On Wednesday, Indonesia's military commander risked an increase
in tensions by reversing a decision to withdraw troops from Aceh.
	   Citing security concerns, Gen. Wiranto sent hundreds of troops
back to Aceh, where the military has been accused of atrocities
while fighting Islamic separatist rebels. Investigators have found
mass graves with alleged victims of the military.
	   Last month, Wiranto had apologized for the military's past
record and, in a conciliatory gesture, pulled out 1,000 soldiers
from the province, which lies on the northern tip of Sumatra
island.
	   The Aceh town of Idi was also quiet Thursday after mobs damaged
a Chinese temple and burned goods.
	   Chinese, who make up 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
people, dominate the economy and have been blamed for an economic
crisis that has unleashed hardship on millions of poor Indonesians.
	   During the riots, one ethnic Chinese trader and his family hid
in the house of an indigenous Indonesian friend. Shopkeeper Toni
Halim said he would stay in Lhokseumawe because he was born there
and knows no other home.
	   One person died and 12 were injured in the mayhem Monday and
Tuesday in Lhokseumawe. The unrest was the worst since 1,200 people
died in May during riots in Jakarta that helped oust Indonesia's
long-serving, autocratic president, Suharto.
	   Police at checkpoints were pulling over trucks after reports
that some rioters had been riding in vehicles.
	   Although President B.J. Habibie is implementing democratic
reforms, there are fears that economic turmoil will trigger more
unrest. After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered
riots around Indonesia over the past week.
	   In several villages in central Java island, thieves have
resorted to looting rice straight from the fields. Some farmers are
camping in their fields to prevent it being taken overnight, The
Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
	   In Jakarta, authorities have started to deploy police and
soldiers to oversee rice distribution to the poor.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Tajikistan border guards were shot and killed
by unidentified assailants near the country's southern frontier
with Afghanistan, a news report said Thursday.
	   The shooting occurred Wednesday night, and the attackers managed
to escape in the darkness, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The two Tajik border guards were serving in the Russian
military, which has been guarding the border for years. The Russian
forces supported the Tajik government during a civil war that ended
last year, and now they focus their efforts on drug and weapons
smugglers coming from Afghanistan.

Geneva airport sets up crisis center for crash relatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Geneva airport geared up early Thursday morning to
cope with the crash of a Swissair jetliner carrying 229 people from
New York.
	   Shortly after the MD-11 jetliner crashed, Geneva airport
officials were alerted to set up a crisis center to take care of
passengers' relatives, duty officer Daniel Teysseire said.
	   ``Everything is ready to handle the special cases,'' he said.
	   The airport's arrivals board earlier Thursday said SR111, the
only scheduled flight from New York to Geneva, due to arrive at
9:30 a.m. local time (0330 GMT), was ``delayed.''
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country.
	   One of the 14 crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him. The airline didn't
release a passenger list.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax. He
couldn't confirm reports of smoke in the cockpit.
	   Swissair CEO Jeffrey Katz plans to fly to New York on Thursday,
Tschanz said.
	   In Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said President Flavio Cotti
was informed of the crash and called a special meeting of the
country's ruling coalition Cabinet.
	   Swissair set up emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland and
one in New York _ for members of the public and relatives looking
for details on the flight.
	   Geneva's last air accident was in 1982, when an Egyptair Boeing
707 went down on the airfield causing three serious injuries,
Teysseire said.
	   For Swissair, it is the first serious accident for almost 20
years.
	   Fourteen people were killed on Oct. 7, 1979, when a DC-8 jet
belonging to the company overshot the runway at Athens during
landing and burst into flames.
	   In the company's worst accident to date, 80 people were killed
when a Caravelle jet crashed at Durrenasch, Switzerland, in
September 1963.
	   In February 1970, all 47 people on board were killed when plane
of the same make crashed at Wurelingen in Switzerland. That crash
was caused by the explosion of a terrorist bomb.

Tokyo exchange halts trading in steelmakers after report of
</HEADLINE>
collapse

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Trading in shares of leading steelmaker NKK Corp.
and affiliate Toa Steel Co. was suspended Thursday after a
newspaper reported Toa Steel has gone bust, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said.
	   Toa Steel, with debts of about 260 billion yen (dlrs 1.89
billion), will go out of business and hand over its operations to
parent company NKK, marking the biggest-ever failure of a Japanese
manufacturer, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported in its evening
editions Thursday.
	   Toa Steel is considering liquidating itself, but a formal
decision was not expected before Friday morning, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
	   Before the trading was halted, Toa shares dropped 17 percent to
63 yen (dlrs 0.46) and NKK shares had fallen 9 percent to 113 yen
(dlrs 0.82).

Officials raid factory, seize compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officers stormed a factory that
allegedly produced pirated compact discs, seizing 4,000 compact
discs and machinery worth 8 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.02 million), police said Thursday.
	   The raid is the first under a new law that took effect last week
requiring optical disc factories to obtain a license. The law is
part of the territory's recent efforts to crack down on copyright
infringement.
	   Police detained four men, aged between 26 and 48, a police
statement said.
	   Johnny Chow, deputy head of the customs' intellectual property
investigation, told government radio that 19 of the 20 suspected
unlicensed factories have moved away or closed down in the
three-month grace period after the law was passed.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. The U.S. has placed Hong Kong on a watch list for
copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs,
CD-ROMs and VCDs still thrive in busy shopping centers. Copies of
local or Hollywood movies are widely available for under 40 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5), sometimes before they're released in
local cinemas.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth U.S.
dlrs 83 million, the biggest such seizure in the territory.

Man dies after drinking tea in suspected poisoning attempt

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man in central Japan collapsed and died after
drinking canned tea that investigators suspect was part of a string
of poisonings gripping the country, police said Thursday.
	   Ichijuro Nakazawa, 58, collapsed after drinking the tea at
breakfast on Monday. He died at a hospital in Obusecho, 180
kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Tokyo, prefectural police
spokesman Shigehiro Ozaki said.
	   The incident was reported to police by Nakazawa's wife Tsugiko
on Thursday, the day after she heard on the news that cyanide-laced
tea had been discovered at a nearby supermarket.
	   Ozaki, however, said the cause of the death and the content of
the tea are still under investigation.
	   The police spokesman said Nakazawa's wife told police that the
can had a tiny hole in the bottom that had been later covered up,
like the one discovered on Tuesday at a nearby supermarket.
	   In that case, the supermarket manager took the can off the shelf
because it was dented, drank from it but spit out the foul-tasting
liquid. Police suspected that the poison might have been inserted
from the hole.
	   In a separate case, insecticide was found Wednesday in a bottled
drink from a vending machine in Nara, 380 kilometers (240 miles)
west of Tokyo.
	   The tainted drinks were the latest in a series of poisoning
cases in Japan. In July, four people died and dozens fell ill after
eating curry tainted with arsenic served at a community festival in
Wakayama, western Japan.
	   Last month, poisoned tea served at an office in northern Japan
made 10 people ill. Then a fake diet drink mailed to some Tokyo
homes sent a teen-ager to the hospital.
	   There have been no arrests in those cases.
	   Doctors at the hospital said Nakazawa died of sudden heart
failure, Japan's semi-government television network NHK reported.
Nakazawa, whose heart had failed by the time he arrived at the
hospital, was pronounced dead an hour later.

French economy still on course for growth target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France is well on course to reach its target of
three percent gross domestic product growth for 1998, Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in a statement Thursday.
	   Strauss-Kahn's comments followed the release of GDP data for the
second quarter, showing that whatever else happens over the year,
GDP growth will be at least 2.5 percent for the year.
	   He predicted GDP would grow by three percent ``at the very
least.''
	   The minister said the level of domestic demand, notably a one
percent rise in consumer demand in the second quarter, is more than
compensating for a decline in foreign demand for French exports due
to the crisis in Asia.
	   He said it is also contributing to an acceleration in the level
of corporate investment.
	   The French economy expanded by 0.7 percent in the second quarter
of 1998 after rising 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to
preliminary data released Thursday by the national statistics
office.

Corruption said to divert flood aid

<TEXT>
	   GORAKHPUR, India (AP) _ Corrupt officials are siphoning off
money and food meant for victims of devastating floods in northern
India, a government official said Thursday as private aid workers
and flood victims complained of shortfalls.
	   ``Our village has been flooded over the past three weeks, and we
were without food for a fortnight. We have not seen any officials
around,'' said Beharilal Yadav, a farmer in Brajenganj village, 630
kilometers (about 400 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   A top government relief official reached by The Associated Press
in the Uttar Pradesh state capital of Lucknow said an estimated 40
percent of relief funds may have been stolen. The official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigations would begin as
soon as the emergency was over.
	   Flooding has affected 47 of the state's 83 districts and swamped
more than 3.2 million hectares (8 million) acres in the last month.
The death toll from the relentless rains has risen to nearly 1,350.
Nearly 12 million villagers have been marooned or left homeless as
the monsoon rains pushed rivers over their banks in Uttar Pradesh,
the most populous Indian state with 150 million people.
	   The water levels were no longer rising and rains were letting up
Thursday, officials said. But the floods were expected to recede
very slowly.
	   The Uttar Pradesh government announced 1 billion rupees (about
dlrs 240,000) in relief funds was disbursed, and Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee released an additional 150 million rupees
(about dlrs 3 million) from the federal relief fund. It was the
largest relief disbursement in the northern Indian state.
	   District relief official Net Ram denied accusations that relief
wasn't reaching victims.
	   ``We have been distributing food packets and rescuing marooned
people `round the clock. Such charges are politically motivated,''
Ram said.
	   ``There is a shortfall between government figures and the money,
food and clothes people are receiving,'' said Dr. Shiraz Wahija,
president of the Uttar Pradesh chapter of the Voluntary Health
Association of India, a respected private development group.
	   Wahija was coordinating rescue and relief efforts by major
private groups, including Rotary and Lions clubs, Catholic Relief
Services, Church Auxiliary Services Associations and Oxfam.
	   Radhey Shyam, who normally ferries pilgrims in central India to
the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna, two of the holiest rivers
in Hinduism, was drafted by the government to come north to help
rescue stranded villagers. He said he was promised 315 rupees (dlrs
7.50) a day, but had not been paid since arriving July 30.
	   He said that when he threatened to return home, officials said
they would confiscate his boat.
	   Private groups, political parties and business leaders are
supplementing government efforts. Sahara India diverted two
helicopters from its commercial airline services and a fleet of
jeeps and cars to distribute food, clothing and medicine.

minister said Thursday that he had been framed in a political
scandal and would fight all charges against him.
	   Anwar Ibrahim said allegations against him of sexual misconduct
and of leaking state secrets were a ``total fabrication,'' the
government news agency Bernama reported.
	   ``I'm going to fight it all the way,'' he told reporters as he
was leaving his official residence to attend a news conference.
	   Anwar, who was also finance minister, was sacked Wednesday after
months of bitter political differences with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was
under investigation on charges contained in a book that has
widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is alleged in the book to have arranged
Anwar's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are being tried for defamation. Anwar, who is
married and has six children, has vehemently denied all charges of
sexual affairs.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly had
resisted for weeks.
	   An aide to the prime minister said the Supreme Council of the
ruling United Malays National Organization would meet Thursday to
discuss Anwar's position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice
president, though it was likely he would be stripped of the post.
	   It appeared that some of Anwar's allies were abandoning him. The
leader of the UMNO youth wing, once seen as Anwar's power base,
announced Thursday they backed the sacking.
	   ``The youth wing of the Barisan National reiterates its
allegiance to the prime minister,'' said Zahid Hamid, president of
the powerful UMNO youth wing. The Barisan National is the ruling
coalition of 14 parties, dominated by UMNO.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor,
had been left out of economic decisions for months after differing
with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 229 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
	   ``We have no survivors. We do have one unfortunate victim so
far,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue
Coordination Center, as rescue efforts continued early Thursday in
the inky darkness off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   Rescue official Andre Ereaut said four bodies had been recovered
so far.
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Local fishing vessels helped comb the waters for possible
survivors. But early Thursday, there were only reports of rescuers
finding bodies and human remains in 16-degree (61-degree
Fahrenheit) waters.
	   Philippe Roy, a Geneva airports spokesman, said the Geneva-bound
Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:17
p.m. (0017 GMT) with 215 passengers _ including two infants _ and
14 crew.
	   The passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many from the
French-speaking west of the country, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz told a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   One of the crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot had apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   In Atlanta, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the ``best
information available'' was that 53 Delta passengers were on board
the flight.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour
into the flight, Chamberlain said.
	   The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit shortly before losing
contact with the air traffic control tower in Moncton, New
Brunswick, The Canadian Press said.
	   The three-engine plane also dumped fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, the news agency quoted an airport
worker as saying.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris believed to be from the aircraft was found off Clam
Island between Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest
of Halifax, and the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Residents told of hearing loud noises from an aircraft passing
overhead. Dozens of ambulances were dispatched to the scene and
rescue vessels began combing the waters off the coast.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Bachman told
The Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Chamberlain said rescue crews were searching for the aircraft
seven miles (11 kilometers) off Peggy's Cove. Local fishermen were
called to the area because they are familiar with the waters.
	   There were four rescue planes and four helicopters in the area,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said. A Canadian navy
ship, the HMSC Preserver, also was on the scene.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday morning, said Inspector Anthony Infante
of the Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   ``Our first priority are the families,'' Infante told reporters
at Kennedy airport. ``I believe about 15 families are here. I'm
sure the number will increase.''
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman
Jamie Finch said the U.S. agency was in consultation with its
counterparts in Canada and has offered any assistance desired. But
he said it had not decided whether a U.S. team would be sent to the
scene.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.

Major quake shakes northern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
6.0 shook northern Japan Thursday, but there were immediate reports
of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which struck at 4:58 p.m. (0758 GMT), was centered
near the rural town of Shizukuishi in Iwate Prefecture (state),
roughly 510 kilometers (320 miles) north of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   Masayuki Oshida of the Iwate prefectural police said there was
no immediate word of casualties or damage, although the quake shook
his office.
	   The quake was centered near Mt. Iwate, a volcano where
seismologists have recently recorded increasing volcanic activity.
	   The Meteorological Agency said there was no fear of tsunami,
undersea waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   A quake of magnitude 6 is considered large and is capable of
causing moderate damage. Japan is one of the world's most
earthquake-prone nations.

Woman who shot pro-Israeli leader freed from detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli allied militia in Lebanon
released Thursday a Lebanese Communist woman who was captured after
she shot and seriously wounded the group's leader 10 years ago.
	   Soha Bishara, 31, was released at the order of her victim, Gen.
Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia, the SLA said.
	   A statement by the group said Lahd ordered her freed for ``pure
humanitarian reasons.''
	   Bishara was released at 10 a.m. (0700GMT) from the Khiam
detention camp in the Israeli-occupied security zone in south
Lebanon and handed over to representatives of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. She later crossed into government-held
territory.
	   Bishara, a Communist activist, shot Lahd on Nov. 7, 1988, at his
house in Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
	   She had gained access to his secure house by befriending his
wife. On that day, she pulled a pistol and shot Lahd three times.
	   But the retired Lebanese army general survived with serious
injuries and was transferred to Israel for treatment.
	   Bishara has since been held at the SLA-run detention center in
Khiam without charges or trial.
	   She was among the prisoners most sought for release by Lebanese
guerrillas who had swapped prisoners and bodies with Israel and the
SLA in the past. But the SLA has repeatedly refused to free her.
	   Lahd, 67, commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese
militia that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its
troops patrol the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in
absentia for treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern
communities from cross-border guerrilla raids.

Israel, Palestinians disagree over whether they have agreed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new twist in their protracted
negotiations, Israel and the Palestinians argued Thursday over
whether they have reached agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel has accepted a 13 percent pullback, with some conditions,
and that it was now up to the Palestinians to meet their security
obligations so a deal can be reached.
	   However, the chief Palestinian negotiator said the Israeli offer
_ full withdrawal from 10 percent, but only a limited one from the
remaining 3 percent _ was rejected by the Palestinians.
	   The dispute came as the United States appeared to be stepping up
its involvement in the negotiations after weeks of letting the two
sides fend for themselves.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday evening, while on a visit to
Moscow. Netanyahu aides quoted Clinton as telling the Israeli
leader that after his return to Washington he would get personally
involved in the negotiations.
	   Israeli newspapers speculated Thursday that the U.S. Mideast
peace envoy, Dennis Ross, or even U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would be dispatched to the region in the next few days.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan and chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said they had no word that Ross or Albright
were coming.
	   The Haaretz daily said Clinton might try to arrange a meeting
with Netanyahu and Arafat around Sept. 23, at a time when both
leaders are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Negotiations on the scope of an Israeli troop withdrawal have
dragged on for months. In January, the United States proposed a 13
percent pullback, to be met by Palestinian security gestures.
	   The Palestinians accepted the U.S. plan, while Israel initially
rejected it. However, in recent weeks, Israel has been inching
toward agreeing to a 13 percent withdrawal, albeit with conditions.
	   Under the Israeli offer, submitted to the Palestinians in
writing last month, Israel would withdraw from 10 percent, while
another 3 percent of the land would be earmarked as a nature
reserve. In that area, Israel would retain full security control.
	   Netanyahu has yet to announce Israel's offer formally, but in an
interview with Israel army radio Thursday, he did not rule out a 13
percent pullback.
	   Netanyahu suggested that the scope of the withdrawal was no
longer an issue. ``If there is a Palestinian willingness to meet
these (security) obligations, there will be an agreement,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, Bar-Illan, was more specific.
	   ``The prime minister had indicated that Israel would consider
withdrawing from 13 percent of the West Bank, provided that 3
percent would be under conditions in which Israel would have full
security control,'' Bar-Illan said. ``The scope of withdrawal is no
longer an issue. Palestinian compliance is.''
	   However, Erekat said the Israeli offer was a ploy. By insisting
on full security control in 3 percent of the area, Israel was in
fact not withdrawing from that land, Erekat said.
	   Erekat said that when Israel presented the offer, ``we rejected
it in five minutes.''
	   Both sides said key issues remained unresolved, including
working out a blueprint for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants and better security cooperation.
	   Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officers had worked out
such a plan last December, but it was scrapped by Netanyahu who
insists it be renegotiated.

Three politicians identified in Thai bank scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Three politicians from Thailand's chief
opposition party have been publicly linked to the collapse of a
bank that started a chain reaction leading to the Asian economic
crisis.
	   The House of Representatives committee on finance announced
Wednesday that the trio from the New Aspiration Party could face
embezzlement charges stemming from 6.4 billion baht (dlrs 160
million) borrowed from the Bangkok Bank of Commerce.
	   The three _ Chuchart Harnsawat, Manote Chaowarat and Chattawat
Mutamara _ were publicly named, in contrast to other politicians
who had taken loans from the bank, because they were not making
serious efforts to repay them, the committee's secretary said.
	   Thai prosecutors have tracked down billions of baht worth of
overseas assets belonging to suspects in the scandal surrounding
the bank and ordered them frozen. Swiss authorities announced
Wednesday that they have frozen dlrs 40 million in suspect
accounts.
	   The Bangkok Bank of Commerce was the center of Thailand's
biggest-ever banking scandal. In 1996, directors revealed that it
had bad debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the
time).
	   The bank's troubles triggered a loss of confidence in the Thai
banking system that led to floating the baht a year later, which
set off the Asian economic crisis.
	   So far, no one has been convicted of any wrongdoing in the bank,
though violations of Thai banking regulations were legion. After
being kept alive by the government for the past two years, the bank
was closed as part of recent financial reforms.
	   Surapong Towichakchaikul, the secretary of the finance
committee, was cited by The Nation newspaper Thursday as saying
that the three opposition MPs were the only ones being sued by the
bank.
	   The identities of other politicians has been kept secret by the
central bank in line with privacy regulations.
	   Rakesh Saxena, the bank's adviser, has been blamed by Thai
authorities for most of the shady practices at the bank. He has
fled to Canada and is fighting attempts to extradite him.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Weeping, shocked relatives of Swissair crash
victims gathered Thursday at Geneva's Cointrin Airport to be
counseled by a 50-member team.
	   A tall blond woman who appeared to be in her early 30s arrived
crying with an older woman and two man shortly after the midmorning
scheduled arrival time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They appeared to wander aimlessly for a few minutes until
they were beckoned by airport security staff to a special area
where they were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   A woman in a Swissair uniform put her arm around another young
woman, head bowed and crying, and led her to the area.
	   Airline officials, who declined to release the passenger list
until relatives have been notified, said most of the passengers on
the flight were believed to be residents of western Switzerland.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organization like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   More than 30 relatives gathered at the airport by midmorning.
Airport officials escorted them to the crisis center.
	   The crisis center includes police psychologists and counsellors,
with 30 people waiting for calls, said airport spokesman Philippe
Roy said.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said there were 215 passengers on board, two of them
babies, and 14 crew members.
	   One of the crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him. The airline didn't
give any further information on those on board.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot had apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   Tschanz confirmed that the pilot had reported smoke in the
plane's cockpit south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
	   Attached to the Geneva airport's arrivals board, which at first
said the flight was ``delayed,'' was a piece of paper directing all
those concerned with the flight to the information desk.
	   In Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said President Flavio Cotti
had been informed of the crash and called a special meeting of the
country's ruling coalition cabinet.
	   Swissair set up emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland and
one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the flight.
	   Salvation Army officers were also present to help console
relatives.
	   ``We are available to families,'' said representative Doris
Droz. ``We are there for them and to share their pain with them.''
	   ``Everything is ready to handle the special cases,'' airport
duty officer Daniel Teysseire said. ``It's very bad news but in
such cases I try to be cool and remember what I have to do.''
	   Geneva's last air accident was in 1982, when an Egyptair Boeing
707 went down on the airfield causing three serious injuries,
Teysseire said.
	   For Swissair, it is the first serious accident for almost 20
years.
	   Fourteen people were killed on Oct. 7, 1979, when a DC-8 jet
belonging to the company overshot the runway at Athens during
landing and burst into flames.
	   In the company's worst accident to date, 80 people were killed
when a Caravelle jet crashed at Duerrenaesch, Switzerland, in
September 1963.
	   In February 1970, all 47 people on board were killed when a
plane of the same make crashed at Wuerenlingen in Switzerland. That
crash was caused by the explosion of a terrorist bomb.

Indonesian government rules out foreign exchange controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesian government officials have
ruled out for now the imposition of foreign exchange controls
similar to those set up in Malaysia, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Senior Economic Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the
government will not impose foreign exchange controls and will stick
to the existing free foreign exchange system for the time being.
	   ``But we will continue to study new developments,'' The Jakarta
Post quoted him as saying Wednesday.
	   Indonesia is struggling with its worst economic crisis in
decades. Financial turmoil erupted last year with a plunge in the
value of the rupiah.
	   Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin said Indonesia could
consider a fixed exchange rate regime.
	   ``There are several alternatives that we are examining, whether
a fixed rate, a peg, or a free floating system. The point is, we
are still open,'' the Media Indonesia daily quoted Syahril as
saying.
	   But he stressed that Malaysia's move to fix an exchange rate and
enact capital controls wasn't ``necessarily the best for
Indonesia.''
	   Under a deal with the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia is
opening up its economy in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
	   The government is targeting a year-end exchange rate target of
10,000 rupiah to the dollar. The rupiah was trading at around
10,900 on Thursday.

Woman who shot pro-Israeli leader freed from detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli allied militia in Lebanon
on Thursday released a Lebanese woman detained for shooting and
seriously wounding the group's leader 10 years ago.
	   Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia, ordered Soha Bishara, 31, released for ``pure
humanitarian reasons.''
	   Bishara was released at 10 a.m. (0700GMT) from the Khiam
detention camp in the Israeli-occupied security zone in south
Lebanon and handed over to representatives of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. She later crossed into government-held
territory.
	   Bishara, a communist activist, shot Lahd three times on Nov. 7,
1988, at his house in Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied
zone. She gained access to his house by befriending his wife.
	   Bishara had been held at the SLA-run detention center in Khiam
without charges or trial.
	   She was among the prisoners most sought for release by Lebanese
guerrillas who swapped prisoners and bodies with Israel and the SLA
in the past. But the SLA has repeatedly refused to free her.
	   Lahd, 67, commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese
militia that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its
troops patrol the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in
absentia for treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern
communities from cross-border guerrilla raids.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 229 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
	   ``We have no survivors. We do have one unfortunate victim so
far,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue
Coordination Center, as rescue efforts continued early Thursday in
the inky darkness off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   Rescue official Andre Ereaut said four bodies had been recovered
so far.
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Local fishing vessels helped comb the waters for possible
survivors. But early Thursday, there were only reports of rescuers
finding bodies and human remains in 16-degree (61-degree
Fahrenheit) waters.
	   Philippe Roy, a Geneva airports spokesman, said the Geneva-bound
Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:17
p.m. (0017 GMT) with 215 passengers _ including two infants _ and
14 crew.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour
into the flight, Chamberlain said.
	   In Atlanta, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the ``best
information available'' was that 53 Delta passengers were on board
the flight.

Annan holds Congo peace talks at nonaligned summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Annan holding talks, South African charges
against Zimbabwe president; Edits to conform, trim, changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Seeking to end a bitter civil war in
the Congo that has dragged in neighboring countries, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday held peace talks at the
Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Attending a breakfast meeting of southern African leaders were
heads of state from Zimbabwe and Angola, who have backed Congolese
President Laurent Kabila. Congo representitives were at the talks,
but Congo delegate Kikaya bin Karubi said Kabila did not attend and
had already flown back to Congo.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela also attended the
meeting.
	   Kabila made a surprise appearence at the summit Wednesday, but
used the opportunity to talk of war, not peace. He blasted Rwanda
and Uganda, saying they had invaded his vast central African
country.
	   Instead of being a love fest of leaders of developing countries,
the summit of 53 heads of government has seen divisiveness caused
by the the Congo war.
	   Kabila asked the summit to ``unequivocally condemn the
aggression'' of Uganda and Rwanda and request their troops'
withdrawal from Congo.
	   Though both Rwanda and Uganda deny sending troops to help rebels
seeking to oust Kabila, the embattled president has refused any
cease-fire until foreign troops opposed to him leave his borders.
	   After a series of rapid gains, the rebels are now on the retreat
as Kabila's forces, backed by military might from Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia, have pushed them back into eastern Congo.
	   The conflict has dominated the summit of developing countries,
which is striving to move away from its Cold War origins and carve
out a new political and economic role for the world's poorer
nations.
	   It also has contributed to a growing rift between South Africa
and neighboring Zimbabwe, the two regional powers. Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki wrote Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe an angry
letter accusing him of not cooperating in peace efforts, The Star
of Johannesburg reported Thursday.
	   On Wednesday, Annan held talks here with Kabila, and with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, both of whose countries have troops fighting alongside
Kabila's.
	   But chances that Annan could hold joint talks with all the
factions on Thursday were slim. Nujoma left the summit Wednesday
night and Kabila said he didn't know if he wanted to have any more
discussions.
	   The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda deny their forces are
helping Congo rebels, but senior U.S. diplomat Princeton Lyman, a
guest at the summit, indicated Rwanda and Uganda do have troops in
Congo.
	   ``There are foreign troops on both sides, and that's got to be
recognized, and a plan for withdrawing them has to be part of the
(peace) process,'' Lyman told The Associated Press.

Japanese stocks post decline, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices;
ADDS 4th graf stock trader quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices closed lower Thursday on
growing worries about corporate earnings. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 115.38 points,
or 0.80 percent, to close at 14,261.24. On Wednesday, the index had
gained 6.99 points, or 0.05 percent.
	   Fresh worries were set off by Hitachi's surprise reversal of a
previous net profit forecast for the fiscal year through March to a
net loss _ the first red ink ever for the leading Japanese
electronics manufacturer.
	   ``Amid grim corporate news such as Hitachi's, investors are
worried that more (manufacturers) may also report downward earnings
revisions,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general manager at Meiko
Securities Co.
	   The market was also pulled lower after the Nihon Keizai business
daily reported that Toa Steel had effectively gone bust and that
its operations will be taken over by steelmaker NKK, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange fell 4.99 points, or 0.45 percent, to
1,113.77. The TOPIX rose 8.61 points, or 0.78 percent, the previous
day.
	   Declining stocks exceeded advancing shares 830 to 289, with 170
issues closing unchanged. An estimated 375 million stocks changed
hands on the first section, down from 485 million shares on
Wednesday.
	   Some equity investors also remain jittery after the plunge
earlier this week in U.S. stocks, traders said.
	   On Monday, The Dow Jones industrials average suffered its
second-biggest point loss ever. The Dow average declined 45.06
points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,782.37 on Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar fell
against the yen on verbal intervention by Japanese officials and
lingering concern over the direction of Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 135.59 yen in late afternoon trading, down
2.03 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 137.50 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from
135.38 yen to 138.45 yen.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice minister
for international affairs, warned that the yen may continue to
strengthen against the U.S. currency, prompting some dealers to
unload dollar holdings, traders said.
	   But fears that the Dow Jones industrial average may stage a
repeat performance of Monday's drop also weighed on the dollar,
they said.
	   ``Sakakibara's comments continue to have an effect, but the main
reason (for the dollar's weakening) is that overseas investors feel
that the Dow could be unstable for some time,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro Bank.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.085 percent, up from Wednesday's 1.065 percent. Its
price fell to 112.51 yen, down from 112.66 yen.

Despite recession, China says Hong Kong's economy still sound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Thursday that despite a recession,
Hong Kong's economy remains strong and will shake off its financial
woes.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said China has ``all
along supported'' Hong Kong's efforts to stabilize its shaky
financial markets and maintain the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the
U.S. dollar.
	   ``Hong Kong has unique superiority in various aspects and sound
economic fundamentals and strengths,'' Zhu said at a regular
briefing for reporters. ``We believe it can certainly overcome the
temporary difficulties.''
	   A year after it reverted from British to Chinese rule, Hong Kong
is gripped by its worst economic recession in 13 years. Its economy
shrank during the first half of the year, by 5 percent in the
second quarter, compared with 5.3 percent growth for all of 1997.
	   Asked about Hong Kong's economic problems, Zhu praised the
territory's government headed by former shipping magnate Tung
Chee-hwa as ``adept and effective in administration.''
	   ``The situation in Hong Kong is sound in general,'' Zhu said.
``The people in Hong Kong and foreign businessman have confidence
in the prospects of Hong Kong and the international community is
optimistic about its future.''

Suddenly, a plane goes down in Nova Scotia's cold, dark waters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLANDFORD, Nova Scotia (AP) _ By all accounts it was a pleasant
evening on Peggy's Cove, with a light wind and medium seas, when
suddenly a plane roared down from the sky and crashed into the cold
water, leaving a large field of floating debris and jet fuel
stretched over two miles (three kilometers).
	   ``I heard a huge crash, like thunder,'' said Wilfred Morash, a
resident of Blandford. ``Then all of the sudden on my scanner the
alarms went off and they said a plane had gone down in Peggy's
Cove.''
	   Within minutes fisherman and local boaters were searching for
survivors in the debris, making frantic radio calls to the Halifax
Search and Rescue Center, said navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau.
Rescuers said the air was thick with the smell of jet fuel, she
added.
	   ``(The debris) is spread out over a very large area,'' said John
Campbell, a charter boat captain, calling from his boat.
	   Soon all of the available ships from this small fishing
community, accustomed to making rescues in the often violent North
Atlantic, converged on the crash site. Coast Guard helicopters
hovered overhead and a navy refueling ship, the HMCS Preserver,
steamed into the bay.
	   Above the helicopters, a large navy C-130 Hercules circled,
searching the water with advanced rescue equipment, dropped flairs
that lit the black water in an orange glow.
	   ``They are mobilizing fishing boats and anything to head out,''
said Eleanor McMahon, vacationing in the Blandford area. ``It is
very eerie. Nothing happens here.''
	   As the ships and helicopters played spotlights across the 16
degree (61-degree Fahrenheit) water, jet fuel shimmered off the
surface. Luggage, Styrofoam and bodies bobbed up and down in the
waves, Campbell said.
	   ``It's almost a floating city with the number of boats here.
They are making repeated calls that they are finding bodies and
human remains,'' a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
Rob Gordon, said by telephone from one of the boats. He said the
largest piece of debris was a shredded life raft.
	   On shore, firefighters paced the beach near the crash sight,
behind them more than a dozen ambulances lined up to treat
survivors and take them to hospitals. They waited in vain.
	   ``We are continuing to consider this a rescue effort,'' said
Grant Lingley, a spokesman for the regional emergency health
services, about five hours after the crash. But he admitted that
hospital officials had sent their extra staff home.

Strong quake shakes northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two suffering minor injuries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook northern Japan Thursday,
slightly injuring at least two people.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck at 4:58
p.m. (0758 GMT). It was centered near the rural town of Shizukuishi
in Iwate Prefecture (state), roughly 510 kilometers (320 miles)
north of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   Two guests at a nearby resort suffered minor injuries and all
150 guests were evacuated from the building, said Mika Nakamura, an
official at Shizukuishi town office.
	   Masayuki Oshida of the Iwate prefectural police said there was
no immediate word of serious casualties or damage, although the
quake shook his office.
	   The quake was centered near Mt. Iwate, a volcano where
seismologists have recently recorded increasing activity.
	   After the earthquake, the Meteorological Agency issued a warning
that a further increase of volcanic activity may be coming. But it
said it had observed no changes at the mountain.
	   The agency also said there was no fear of tsunami, undersea
waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   A quake of magnitude 6 is capable of causing moderate damage.
Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Weeping, shocked relatives of Swissair crash
victims gathered Thursday at Geneva's Cointrin Airport to be
counseled by a 100-member team.
	   A tall blond woman who appeared to be in her early 30s arrived
crying with an older woman and two man shortly after the midmorning
scheduled arrival time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They appeared to wander aimlessly for a few minutes until
they were beckoned by airport security staff to a special area
where they were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   A woman in a Swissair uniform put her arm around another young
woman, head bowed and crying, and led her to the area.
	   Airline officials, who declined to release the passenger list
until relatives have been notified, said most of the passengers on
the flight were believed to be residents of western Switzerland.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organization like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   More than 30 relatives gathered at the airport by midmorning.
Airport officials escorted them to the crisis center.
	   The crisis center includes police psychologists and counsellors,
with 30 people waiting for calls, said airport spokesman Philippe
Roy said.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said there were 215 passengers on board, two of them
babies, and 14 crew members.
	   One of the crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him.
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet, the
chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said an
emergency team was attempting to contact relatives.
	   ``It could well take some time to reach all the people,'' and no
further details will be given before that, Schorderet said. The
flight operated with three classes.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot had apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   Tschanz confirmed that the pilot had reported smoke in the
plane's cockpit south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
	   Schorderet said the plane was put into service in August 1991
and was overhauled in August and September last year. It had been
checked as all are before takeoff, he added.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   Attached to the Geneva airport's arrivals board, which at first
said the flight was ``delayed,'' was a piece of paper directing all
those concerned with the flight to the information desk.
	   In Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said President Flavio Cotti
had been informed of the crash and called a special meeting of the
country's ruling coalition cabinet.
	   Swissair set up emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland and
one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the flight.
	   Salvation Army officers were also present to help console
relatives.
	   ``We are available to families,'' said representative Doris
Droz. ``We are there for them and to share their pain with them.''
	   ``Everything is ready to handle the special cases,'' airport
duty officer Daniel Teysseire said. ``It's very bad news but in
such cases I try to be cool and remember what I have to do.''
	   Geneva's last air accident was in 1982, when an Egyptair Boeing
707 went down on the airfield causing three serious injuries,
Teysseire said.
	   For Swissair, it is the first serious accident for almost 20
years.
	   Fourteen people were killed on Oct. 7, 1979, when a DC-8 jet
belonging to the company overshot the runway at Athens during
landing and burst into flames.
	   In the company's worst accident to date, 80 people were killed
when a Caravelle jet crashed at Duerrenaesch, Switzerland, in
September 1963.
	   In February 1970, all 47 people on board were killed when a
plane of the same make crashed at Wuerenlingen in Switzerland. That
crash was caused by the explosion of a terrorist bomb.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Weeping relatives of Swissair crash victims
gathered Thursday at Geneva's Cointrin Airport, where a 50-member
team of police psychologists, counselors and other specialists
offered help in a special area.
	   A tall blonde who appeared to be in her early 30s arrived crying
with an older woman and two men shortly after the midmorning
scheduled arrival time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They appeared to wander aimlessly for a few minutes until
beckoned by airport security staff to the special area. A woman in
a Swissair uniform put her arm around another young woman, head
bowed and crying, and led her to the area. More than 30 relatives
gathered at the airport by midmorning. Swissair set up emergency
phone lines _ two in Switzerland and one in New York _ for
relatives.
	   Airline officials, who declined to release the passenger list
until relatives have been notified, said most of the passengers on
the flight were believed to be residents of western Switzerland.
	   At a Zurich news conference, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said there were 215 passengers on board, including two
babies, and 14 crew members. One crew member was an American from
Swissair partner Delta, said Tschanz who refused to identify him.

Malaysia's sacked deputy prime minister says he'll fight charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with comments from Anwar

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister said Thursday he had been framed in a political conspiracy
and vowed to fight all charges against him.
	   Anwar Ibrahim said allegations of sexual misconduct and of
leaking state secrets were fabricated by the camp of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to undermine any challenge to his leadership.
	   ``This is an unjust administration,'' Anwar, who was also dumped
as finance minister Wednesday, told hundreds of supporters and
journalists at his private residence.
	   ``I ask for justice and demand justice,'' he said. ``If the No.
2 man cannot be sure of justice, then I'm sorry for Malaysia.''
	   Anwar, 51, was fired unceremoniously Wednesday evening after
months of bitter political differences with his one-time mentor,
Mahathir.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Anwar, a conservative Muslim and the father of six children,
said he had undergone DNA testing to prove his innocence in an
apparent paternity suit.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was
under investigation on charges contained in a book that has
widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is alleged in the book to have arranged
Anwar's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are being tried for defamation.
	   Some political observers saw the book as a part of a campaign to
humiliate Anwar and push him to resign, which he reportedly had
resisted for weeks.
	   Anwar, who hugged his wife, Aziza, as she stood next to him
during the news conference, said he expected to be arrested and
would fight to prove his innocence.
	   ``I have enough documentary evidence, tapes, statutory
declarations under oath that would defend and establish my
innocence,'' he said, adding that his associates and family had
been harassed by the police.
	   The Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National
Organization was set to meet later Thursday to discuss Anwar's
position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice president, though it was
likely he would be stripped of the post.
	   It appeared that some of Anwar's allies were abandoning him. The
leader of the UMNO youth wing, once seen as Anwar's power base,
announced Thursday they stood by Mahathir.
	   ``The youth wing of the Barisan National reiterates its
allegiance to the prime minister,'' said Zahid Hamid, president of
the powerful UMNO youth wing. The Barisan National is the ruling
coalition of 14 parties, dominated by UMNO.
	   Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor, had been left out
of economic decisions for months after differing with his boss on
the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   During the UMNO convention in July, many believed Anwar was
behind a push by the youth league to demand curbs on nepotism and
corruption among the country's leadership.
	   Mahathir was furious and immediately crushed the campaign.
	   Anwar said he still held affection for Mahathir, who has ruled
this Southeast Asian nation for 17 years.
	   ``I do regard him as a father, although not all fathers treat
their children fairly.''

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Seeking to end a civil war in the
Congo that has dragged in its neighbors, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday said he was ``very encouraged'' by peace
talks at the Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Annan presided over a breakfast meeting of heads of state from
Zimbabwe and Angola, who have backed Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Congo representitives were at the talks, but Congo delegate
Kikaya bin Karubi said Kabila did not attend and had already flown
back to Congo.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela also attended the
meeting.
	   ``I think we'll be leaving South Africa encouraged with what has
transpired,'' Annan told reporters after the talks. But he could
offer no concrete progress made in the talks.
	   ``The people of Congo have suffered far too long for us not to
bring this to a solution,'' he said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Weeping relatives of Swissair crash victims
gathered Thursday at Geneva's Cointrin Airport, where a 100-member
team of police psychologists, counselors and other specialists
offered help in a special area.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ While still the world's heaviest user of capital
punishment, China has significantly reduced executions in part due
to a new criminal code, human rights monitors reported Thursday.
	   Amnesty International, in a report under preparation, estimates
that last year China executed about 3,000 people _ more than eight
people a day. Although higher than executions in the rest of the
world combined and unconfirmed by the Chinese government, the toll
is a 31 percent drop from 1996's 4,367 executions in China.
	   The figure mirrors comments a senior Supreme People's Court
judge made to a visiting U.S. businessman. John Kamm, who has
lobbied the Chinese government on behalf of political prisoners for
eight years, said Thursday that the judge, whom he did not
identify, told him there had been a ``big drop'' in executions.
	   The slightly more restricted use of the death penalty is a
hopeful portent for the arrival in China Sunday of Mary Robinson,
the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. Both sides want her
weeklong visit, the first by a U.N. human rights chief, to promote
cooperation in a relationship often marked by confrontation.
	   During or before her visit, China is expected to sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a key U.N.
treaty Beijing pledged to accede to six months ago.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told reporters Thursday
that study of the treaty ``has almost been completed.'' He added:
``We will soon sign this convention.''
	   Robinson is scheduled to meet with President Jiang Zemin and
Ministry of Justice officials and attend a forum on U.N. human
rights treaties.
	   Despite moves to sign U.N. treaties and adopt more
internationally accepted legal standards, China's judicial system
is mired in secrecy. Defendants' access to lawyers is often limited
and appeals are largely a sham.
	   Political critics seen to challenge the authority of the ruling
	   Communist Party are still harassed and jailed. Police in two
cities have reportedly detained at least two dissidents this week,
apparently for meeting colleagues.
	   Kamm, the U.S. businessman, said the Chinese judge, a senior
official in the court's research bureau, cited a new criminal code
and sentencing guidelines as the prime reasons for the decline in
executions.
	   The code, which went into effect Oct. 1, 1997, narrowed uses of
the death penalty for theft, which account for nearly a third of
all criminal cases, Kamm said. He added, citing the judge, only
bank robbery and theft of cultural relics now qualify as punishable
by death.
	   But the new sentencing guidelines as well as the total number of
executions are considered state secrets, said Kamm.
	   ``We need more openness on the part of Chinese officials,'' said
Catherine Baver, a China specialist for London-based Amnesty
International. ``What have they got to hide on this matter?''
	   Baver confirmed the Amnesty International estimate of 3,000
executions, due to be released in a report on Saturday, but she
said the figure ``represents only a fraction'' of the total.
	   She said state-run media reports, a major source for the Amnesty
estimate, often do not provide accurate counts of criminals
executed.
	   The death penalty is still used too much and disproportionately
on China's growing underclass, Baver said. Judges were pushed to
apply death penalties more broadly during anti-crime campaigns,
especially in 1996 and the first part of 1997.

Britain, Ireland move on anti-terrorism legislation as Clinton
</HEADLINE>
arrives &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES to add IRA personally warning dissident republicans to
disband &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined to crush IRA
dissidents who killed 28 people in a car-bombing, Britain and
Ireland pushed anti-terrorist legislation toward passage Thursday
as U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Northern Ireland.
	   Clinton was met by Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday morning at
Belfast International Airport, and the two leaders immediately left
for Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland.
	   The president also planned to visit Omagh, scene of the Aug. 15
bombing, during a hectic round of appearances Thursday before
flying on to Dublin.
	   Britain's House of Commons debated past midnight over Prime
Minister Tony Blair's legislation which would make it easier to
lock up the violent opponents of Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   The bill passed the key debate stage in the House of Commons on
a vote 391-17 early Thursday and later cleared the Commons
unopposed in its final reading. The bill was sent to the House of
Lords for consideration later in the day.
	   Critics of the legislation, including some with Blair's
governing Labor Party, protested that Parliament needed more than
two days to consider the bill, which would restrict the right to
silence for suspected members of active terrorist groups, and give
greater weight in court to police testimony that a suspect belonged
to a banned organization.
	   Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, while supporting
the legislation, said it was likely to be imperfect because of the
haste with which it was drafted.
	   ``It is almost bound to have loopholes. It would be a miracle if
it did not have loopholes,'' Major said. He added that the haste
was understandable ``to respond to the public mood for action
following the atrocity at Omagh.''
	   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern won near-unanimous
backing for similar legislation.
	   ``These people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them
to respect the strength of Irish democracy,'' Ahern said, referring
to the so-called Real IRA, which admitted detonating the 500-pound
(225-kg) bomb on a busy shopping day in Omagh.
	   The group has since announced it was suspending its attacks in
Northern Ireland but has not joined the Irish Republican Army in
calling a cease-fire.
	   Ahern warned the dissidents that ``they should not be in any
doubt about this government's determination to crush and dismantle
any organizations that still engage in violence.''
	   The IRA, which has also called on the so-called Real IRA to
disband, delivered that message personally to some 60 dissidents,
the Irish Times newspaper reported Thursday. The newspaper said
senior IRA figures visited the homes of dissidents in both parts of
Ireland warning that ``action will be taken`` if the dissident
group doesn't dissolve.

Hanson's ``Easytax'' ridiculed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IPSWICH, Australia (AP) _ One Nation leader Pauline Hanson
unveiled a tax policy Thursday which critics said was economic
madness and would lead to the collapse of the Australian economy.
	   Hanson, who polling shows has only about 10 percent of voters'
support ahead of the Oct. 3 election, released her so-called
Easytax system which features a flat two percent income and
transaction tax.
	   It would replace income tax, company tax, sales tax, capital
gains tax, provisional tax, fringe benefits tax and withholding
tax, but would not apply to bank deposits or withdrawals.
	   ``The usual knockers have said this system has not worked
anywhere in the world when the fact is this system has not yet been
tried and so actually has not failed anywhere either,'' Hanson said
Thursday.
	   The plan drew immediate criticism from the government and
business groups.
	   ``It's absolute Hansonite economic madness,'' Treasurer Peter
Costello said. ``It's hard to comment on a proposal which is
nonsensical, ill-considered, inexplicable, applies nowhere else in
the world and has been invented by someone who has no experience of
taxation matters.''
	   A spokesman from the Australian Society of Certified Practicing
Accountants said it would lead to the collapse of the Australian
economy.

	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Too terrified to return home,
about 100 ethnic Chinese were holed up Thursday in military offices
in a riot-torn Indonesian town.
	   Army reinforcements patrolled coastal Lhokseumawe, a center of
Indonesia's natural gas and petroleum industry where mobs burned
buildings and looted Chinese-owned stores earlier this week.
	   The riots in northern Sumatra island were set off by bitterness
toward the military but lacked political direction, with mobs
turning on the ethnic Chinese, common scapegoats for the nation's
economic problems.
	   One died and 12 were injured in the mayhem Monday and Tuesday.
	   In a riot in western Sumatra, police Wednesday shot to death a
villager after mobs demanding the release of two suspected thieves
attacked a police post. Protesters hurled rocks at the station on
the edge of the city of Palembang, the Kompas newspaper reported.
	   In Lhokseumawe on Thursday, two groups of 50 Chinese were
staying in offices of the military district commander, sleeping on
borrowed mattresses. Some had fled their houses on Tuesday during
the worst of the rioting.
	   ``They're still scared,'' said army Lt. Col. Giyono, who like
many Indonesians uses only one name. ``It's up to them how long
they want to stay.''
	   Citing security concerns, Indonesia's military commander risked
more tension by reversing a decision to withdraw troops from
northern Aceh province, where the military has been accused of
atrocities while fighting Islamic separatist rebels. Investigators
have found mass graves with alleged victims of the military.
	   Hundreds of students in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, rallied
near a campus Thursday against alleged military wrongdoing in Aceh.
	   There were no reports of violence in Aceh on Thursday, but
ethnic Chinese kept their shop shutters down for fear of unrest.
	   Chinese, who make up 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
people, dominate the economy and have been blamed for a financial
crisis that has unleashed hardship on millions of poor Indonesians.
	   Although President B.J. Habibie is implementing democratic
reforms, there are fears that economic turmoil will trigger more
unrest. After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered
riots around Indonesia over the past week.
	   In several villages in central Java island, thieves have
resorted to looting rice straight from the fields. Some farmers are
camping in their fields to prevent it being harvested overnight,
The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
	   In Jakarta, authorities have started to deploy police and
soldiers to oversee rice distribution to the poor.

Israel, Palestinians disagree over whether they have agreed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new twist to protracted negotiations,
Israel and the Palestinians argued Thursday over whether they have
reached agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel has accepted a 13 percent pullback, with some conditions,
and that it was now up to the Palestinians to meet their security
obligations so a deal can be reached.
	   However, the chief Palestinian negotiator said the Israeli offer
_ full withdrawal from 10 percent, but only a limited one from the
remaining 3 percent _ was rejected.
	   The dispute came as the United States appeared to be stepping up
its involvement in the negotiations after weeks of letting the two
sides fend for themselves.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton called Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday evening, while on a visit to
Moscow. Netanyahu aides quoted Clinton as telling the Israeli
leader that after his return to Washington he would get personally
involved.
	   Israeli newspapers speculated Thursday that the U.S. Mideast
peace envoy, Dennis Ross, or even U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would be dispatched to the region in the next few days.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan and chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said they had no word that Ross or Albright
were coming.
	   The Haaretz daily said Clinton might try to arrange a meeting
with Netanyahu and Arafat around Sept. 23, when both leaders are in
New York for the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Negotiations on the scope of an Israeli troop withdrawal have
dragged on for months. In January, the United States proposed a 13
percent pullback, to be met by Palestinian security gestures.
	   The Palestinians accepted the U.S. plan, while Israel initially
rejected it. However, in recent weeks, Israel has been inching
toward agreeing to a 13 percent withdrawal, albeit with conditions.
	   Under the Israeli offer, Israel would withdraw from 10 percent,
while another 3 percent of the land would be earmarked as a nature
reserve. In that area, Israel would retain full security control.
	   Netanyahu has yet to announce Israel's offer formally, but in an
interview with Israel army radio Thursday, he did not rule out a 13
percent pullback.
	   Both sides said key issues remained unresolved, including
working out a blueprint for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants and better security cooperation.
	   Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officers had worked out
such a plan last December, but it was scrapped by Netanyahu who
insists it be renegotiated.

Some 300,000 public service employees join strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Some 300,00 public sector employees, or about
one-seventh of Israel's work force, went on strike Thursday to push
for higher wages.
	   A teachers' strike, meanwhile, entered a third day Thursday,
keeping nearly 2 million students at home and forcing many working
parents to stay away from their jobs to care for their children.
	   The publice service strike shut down government offices and
disrupted work at seaports, railways, hospitals, public health
clinics and the state-run phone and electric companies.
	   Ben-Gurion International Airport operated on schedule, though
some disruptions were expected as engineers and technicians walked
off the job, said Rachel Turgeman, a spokeswoman for the Histadrut
Trade Union Federation. Banks and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
remained open.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was
irresponsible in light of the crisis in the world's markets and
Israel's need for increased defense spending in the near future.
	   Netanyahu said he would set a personal example by asking for a 5
percent salary cut for the highest-paid public sector employees.
	   ``This is not a trick or a ploy ... It is the responsible thing
to do at this point,'' Netanyahu told Israel army radio.
	   Workers at the prime ministry were also on strike, but Netanyahu
said there was no cause for concern that important phone calls
might be missed. ``I'll answer the phones if necessary,'' he said.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lower house passing resolution condemning missile
firing in 19th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring Tokyo's pleas, North Korea could be
planning a second firing similar to one earlier this week that sent
shock waves through the region, Japanese officials said Thursday.
	   Japanese and South Korean armed forces went on an increased
level of alert to prepare for another launch and Tokyo went on a
diplomatic offensive to dissuade the communist state from going
ahead with the test.
	   But the North _ which has criticized Japan for making ``a fuss''
over the first test launch on Monday _ was apparently brushing off
Tokyo's calls for restraint.
	   ``They are rejecting our protests,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka told reporters.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first test of the new missile and rattled Tokyo by
demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases. Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are
stationed here.
	   Defense Agency spokesman Hiromitsu Kuwano said Thursday that
Japan's military had upgraded its level of alertness against a
second test. He declined to comment on what measures Japan is
taking, or what information Japan had indicating a launch was
planned.
	   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   Yonhap said South Korea's military has also been placed on
coastal alert for signs of heightened North Korean military
activity.
	   Japan's Kyodo News, meanwhile, said military ships were being
dispatched to the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile
launch. Defense Agency officials refused to confirm that report.
	   The United States was also strengthening its presence in the
region. The Pentagon was sending six B-52 and B-2 stealth bombers
to the Pacific island of Guam, though officials said the warplanes
were being moved only for training.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Nonaka said the Japanese government was
concerned the North might conduct a second launch to coincide with
the convening of its national congress on Saturday or the country's
national day celebrations next Wednesday.
	   But Yonhap said that the South Korean government does not
believe the North will be prepared to launch another missile in
time for the Saturday congress, when de facto leader Kim Jong Il is
expected to be formally elected president.
	   South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek returned from a
visit to Japan on Thursday and said the two countries had agreed to
hold joint navy exercises for the purpose of search and rescue
missions in international waters. No time was set for the
exercises.
	   Chun also said in a statement that defense officials of both
countries would hold further talks on the missile issue as soon as
possible and widen contacts between their militaries.
	   A second test is certain to further chill relations between
Tokyo and Pyongyang, which had been on the mend until the first
missile test, at a time when North Korea is increasingly dependent
on outside aid to stave off famine.
	   The first test has already prompted Japan to withdraw an offer
of talks on establishing diplomatic relations, and the government
has ruled out further food aid to the impoverished North. Japan has
also suspended work on an international project to build nuclear
reactors there and canceled all charter flights to and from the
North.
	   On Thursday, Japan's upper house of Parliament unanimously
adopted a resolution condemning North Korea's test launch and
calling for the government to take strong measures against the
country. The lower house adopted a similar measure later in the
day.
	   The missile test has also spurred more talk of Japan of setting
up with the United States an anti-missile defense system.
	   Conservatives in Japan were calling for more drastic measures.
	   ``In order to counter such a threat, we have to establish a
cold, merciless policy of power politics,'' the Sankei newspaper
said in an editorial Thursday. ``We also have to let them know that
we have the option of attacking launch sites in North Korea in
self-defense.''

Former Rwandan prime minister seeks light sentence in genocide

two-year sentence or none, prosecution urges life in prison &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The man who was Rwanda's prime minister
during the slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis sought a
sentence of two years or less on Thursday in exchange for his
guilty plea to genocide and testimony against other alleged
ringleaders.
	   The plea for such a light sentence drew an angry reaction from
Rwandans watching from the gallery.
	   The prosecution said Jean Kambanda, 42 _ the highest-ranking
former political leader in the tribunal's custody _ deserved life
in prison, even though he had recorded 90 hours of testimony about
the 1994 carnage to help build genocide cases against others.
	   In determining Kambanda's sentence, which is to be handed down
on Friday, the tribunal's rules allow it to consider factors
including substantial cooperation with the prosecutor.
	   But the prosecution argued that no amount of testimony against
others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda is accused of
inciting massacres of Tutsis and distributing weapons as his
hard-line Hutu government presided over the bloodbath.
	   ``How can you balance the thousands and hundreds of thousands
killed with the cooperation of the accused?'' Deputy Prosecutor
Bernard Muna asked the court. ``We believe this crime merits
nothing less than life imprisonment.''
	   A life sentence is the maximum the tribunal can impose.
	   Kambanda pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of genocide and
crimes against humanity, including responsibility for the murder
and extermination of civilians, becoming the first person to accept
culpability for genocide before an international court.
	   The crime of genocide was decreed and defined in 1948, after the
postwar Nuremberg trials.
	   During the hourlong session, defense attorney Oliver Michael
Inglis acknowledged that Rwanda's genocide was heinous.
	   But he said the frenzy of killing had already begun by the time
Kambanda took office, and insisted his client played no role in
planning the slaughter.
	   He characterized his client as a reluctant officeholder,
manipulated by a powerful military. Kambanda, he said, was ``a
marionette _ his strings were pulled and he danced.''
	   Inglis drew scornful laughter from Rwandans in the gallery as he
pleaded for a sentence of two years _ or none at all _ ``to enable
the healing to take place.''
	   ``Those people who are waiting...to rebuild their country will
be sorely disappointed if any greater sentence is imposed,'' he
said, while onlookers grimaced and murmured angrily.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, wearing a dark suit and tie _ let
his lawyer speak for him, telling the chief judge: ``I have nothing
further to add.''
	   The indictment said as prime minister, Kambanda controlled the
government ministers and military officers who were carrying out
killings. He was also accused of distributing weapons he knew would
be used in the slayings.
	   In a radio address, Kambanda incited massacres of Tutsis, saying
genocide was ``an indispensable weapon in the fight against the
enemy.''
	   Kambanda took office after the assassination of Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana on April 7, 1994. She was among the first
killed in the bloodbath sparked by the shooting down of President
Juvenal Habyarimana's plane the day before.
	   The slaughter stopped only when Tutsi rebels seized power in
July 1994. Kambanda fled Rwanda that month, and was arrested in
Nairobi three years later with six other high-level officials.
	   Security at Thursday's session was lighter than the previous
day, when the tribunal found former village Mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu
guilty of genocide.
	   The judgment against Akayesu, in addition to being the first
international verdict on genocide, also marked the first time an
international court defined rape as a genocidal crime.
	   His lawyer said Akayesu, who maintained his innocence throughout
his 20-month trial, would appeal.
	   The court _ known formally as the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda _ is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom
are on trial.
	   An elderly Rwandan priest is in custody in Texas. Eight others
have been indicted but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement
in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than
125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions for the slaughter.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hitachi Ltd., one of Japan's biggest electronics
manufacturers, said Thursday that it expects to fall into the red
for the first time ever due to sluggish sales and shrinking profit
margins.
	   The Tokyo-based company said it now forecasts a group net loss
of 250 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 1.81 billion) in the fiscal year
through next March, reversing an earlier estimate for a 40 billion
yen (dlrs 290 million) net profit.
	   Hitachi President Tsutomu Kanai pledged to staunch the flow of
red ink through an extensive cost-cutting effort which will slash
payroll by 4,000 employees to a total of 66,000 workers. The cuts,
to be taken by next March, will come mostly through attrition
instead of layoffs, he said.
	   The company also plans to trim fixed costs by 10 percent over
the next year and a half and will freeze new investment in plants
and equipment. It hopes these steps will allow it to return to the
black in the next fiscal year, which begins April 1.
	   Hitachi blamed its current woes on a deterioration in prices for
computer memory chips, falling demand for consumer electronics and
personal computers and increased restructuring costs.
	   Hitachi lowered its sales forecast to 7.94 trillion yen (dlrs 57
billion), down 5.5 percent from a previous estimate released in
May.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's economic growth should pick up in the
third quarter of this year, officials said Thursday, announcing
statistics showing renewed consumer confidence index.
	   The State Statistical Bureau said consumer sentiment was higher
in August following three straight months of decline, while a new
index on consumer satisfaction remained stable in August.
	   According to a bureau survey, in August 35 percent of
respondents expected their personal economic situation to improve
in the next 12 months. Only 13 percent predicted their situation
would worsen. Thursday's report did not elaborate or account for
the other 52 percent of respondents. Numbers from previous months
were compiled but not released.
	   The bureau also said it was confident that growth in China's
gross domestic product during the third quarter would exceed the
7.0 percent registered in the first half of the year.
	   Qiu Xiaohua, the bureau's chief economist, said a 100 billion
yuan (dlrs 12.11 billion) government bond issue program would help
the country meet its annual growth target of 8.0 percent.
	   The government expects prices to begin to rebound, ending the
current deflationary trend by the end of the year.
	    &UR; _____
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine exports in July rose a
hefty 21 percent from a year earlier to dlrs 2.49 billion as sales
of electronic products surged, the government said Thursday.
	   The sustained growth in electronics exports has kept the
Philippine's export growth rate one of the highest in Asia, Budget
Secretary Benjamin Diokno said.
	   He said Philippine export growth is expected to average 15
percent this year, more than China's forecast of 7.6 percent,
India's 5.2 percent, Thailand's 3.8 percent and South Korea's 2.8
percent forecast.
	   For the first seven months of the year, exports rose 19 percent
from a year earlier to dlrs 16.40 billion, the National Statistics
Office said.
	   Economists welcomed the robust July export growth, but warned
that the trend may not be sustainable, owing to the global economic
slowdown.
	   The sharp fall of the peso against the dollar as a result of the
year-long currency crisis boosted export earnings by making
Philippine products less costly overseas, economists said.
	   Electronics and components topped the list of exports with a 48
percent share of total receipts, or dlrs 1.19 billion, 51 percent
more than the year-earlier level.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Three politicians from Thailand's chief
opposition party have been publicly linked to the collapse of a
bank that started a chain reaction leading to the Asian economic
crisis.
	   The House of Representatives committee on finance announced
Wednesday that the trio from the New Aspiration Party could face
embezzlement charges stemming from 6.4 billion baht (dlrs 160
million) borrowed from the Bangkok Bank of Commerce.
	   The three _ Chuchart Harnsawat, Manote Chaowarat and Chattawat
Mutamara _ were publicly named, in contrast to other politicians
who had taken loans from the bank, because they were not making
serious efforts to repay them, the committee's secretary said.
	   Thai prosecutors have tracked down billions of baht worth of
overseas assets belonging to suspects in the scandal surrounding
the bank and ordered them frozen. Swiss authorities announced
Wednesday that they have frozen dlrs 40 million in suspect
accounts.
	   The Bangkok Bank of Commerce was the center of Thailand's
biggest-ever banking scandal. In 1996, directors revealed that it
had bad debts approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the
time).
	   The bank's troubles triggered a loss of confidence in the Thai
banking system that led to floating the baht a year later, the move
that triggered the Asian economic crisis.
	   So far, no one has been convicted of any wrongdoing in the bank,
though violations of Thai banking regulations were legion. After
being kept alive by the government for the past two years, the bank
was closed as part of recent financial reforms.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 229 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
	   ``We have no survivors. We do have one unfortunate victim so
far,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue
Coordination Center, as rescue efforts continued early Thursday in
the inky darkness off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   Rescue official Andre Ereaut said four bodies had been recovered
so far.
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Local fishing vessels helped comb the waters for possible
survivors. But early Thursday, there were only reports of rescuers
finding bodies and human remains in 16-degree (61-degree
Fahrenheit) waters.
	   Philippe Roy, a Geneva airports spokesman, said the Geneva-bound
Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:17
p.m. (0017 GMT) with 215 passengers _ including two infants _ and
14 crew.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour
into the flight, Chamberlain said.
	   The three-engine plane also dumped fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, an airport worker said.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris believed to be from the aircraft was found off Clam
Island between Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest
of Halifax, and the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Residents told of hearing loud noises from an aircraft passing
overhead.
	   ``We heard the plane go over our home, then my husband and son
heard quite an explosion,'' Blandford resident Audrey Bachman told
The Associated Press. She said she was sleeping at the time of the
crash.
	   Chamberlain said rescue crews were searching for the aircraft
seven miles (11 kilometers) off Peggy's Cove. Local fishermen were
called to the area because they are familiar with the waters.
	   There were four rescue planes and four helicopters in the area,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said. A Canadian navy
ship, the HMSC Preserver, also was on the scene.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday morning, said Inspector Anthony Infante
of the Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   ``Our first priority are the families,'' Infante told reporters
at Kennedy airport. ``I believe about 15 families are here. I'm
sure the number will increase.''
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman
Jamie Finch said the U.S. agency was in consultation with its
counterparts in Canada and has offered any assistance desired. But
he said it had not decided whether a U.S. team would be sent to the
scene.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled in
August and September last year. It had been checked as all are
before takeoff, he added.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``we have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''

Syria opens trade center in sign of growing ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Syria reopened its trade center here
Thursday after a gap of nearly 18 years in the latest sign of
growing ties between the two uneasy neighbors.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and Khaled Raad,
Syria's head of duty free zones, attended a ceremony to open the
center at the Baghdad International Fair grounds.
	   Both briefly toured the center where Syrian-made clothes, brooms
and biscuits were exhibited.
	   An Iraqi trade center is expected to open soon in the Syrian
capital, Damascus under an agreement signed by Saleh and Raad. No
date has been set.
	   Iraq cut ties with Syria in 1981 because of its support of Iran
in the 1980-88 Ira-Iraq war. A thaw in relations began after Syria
sent a trade delegation to Iraq in May 1997.
	   Raad told reporters that the Syrian center ``is an attempt to
lift the suffering of the Iraqi people ... and to open a window
onto Iraq for Syrian products.''
	   ``God willing there will be more cooperation depending on the
progress in (political) bilateral relations,'' said Saleh. He said
Syria exported medicines, clothing and food worth nearly dlrs 150
million to Iraq in 1997 and in the first half of 1998.
	   Thursday's reopening of the center follows an Aug. 20 agreement
between the two countries to re-start a pipeline for Iraqi crude
that was shut 16 years ago.
	   That should, however, be approved first by the United Nations,
which has imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The pipeline links Iraq's Kirkuk to Syria's Banias terminal on
the Mediterranean Sea, but Iraq has said it will not wait for the
permission.
	   Saleh said Iraq is trying to boost trade with more countries and
mentioned Turkey and Jordan as good trade partners during the
eight-year sanctions.

Indians enraged over Mandela's remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Seemingly innocuous remarks from South
African President Nelson Mandela have set off a storm in India,
known for prickliness in foreign affairs.
	   During his speech at the Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday,
Mandela called for peaceful negotiations to resolve the dispute
between India and Pakistan over the divided Himalayan region of
Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan, both Nonaligned members, have fought two
wars over Kashmir. Its status is seen as the crux of the rivalry
that led both to test nuclear weapons in May.
	   ``All of us ... should be willing to lend all the strength we
have to'' resolving the Kashmir dispute, Mandela said in the port
city of Durban.
	   ---
	   United News of India reported Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee personally protested to Mandela during a state banquet
Wednesday night and would add in his own speech in Durban on
Thursday that the Nonaligned summit ``is not the place to air the
differences in some of our positions.''
	   ---
	   Farouk Abdullah, the top elected official in Indian-held
Kashmir, told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday that Mandela was
meddling in an ``integral part of India.''
	   ``Mandela is no one to decide our fate,'' Abdullah said.
	   In India, Mandela's words were taken as an offer of mediation.
Pakistan, fearing itself at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with
its much larger and more powerful neighbor, has called repeatedly
for outside help. India fiercely resists the idea.
	   The Hindustan Times, a national Indian daily, said in a
front-page story Thursday that Mandela took a ``clearly unfriendly
stance'' toward India. Other newspapers said India had been
snubbed, embarrassed and set back.
	   India's reaction to the overture from Mandela, revered around
the world as a statesman, was reminiscent of the response in 1993
when the White House wrote back to the head of a Kashmiri
secessionist group: ``I look forward to working with you and others
to help bring peace to Kashmir.''
	   Indians were shocked that President Bill Clinton would propose
to ``work with'' separatists. U.S. officials responded that the
note was written by a White House aide unfamiliar with South Asian
politics.

King handed responsibility to end stalemate; protests build
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Hun Sen hopes weekend meetings with
king, other parties will break deadlock, protesters target EU &QL;

 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen handed King Norodom
Sihanouk responsibility for breaking Cambodia's political deadlock
Thursday while thousands of people kept up round-the-clock protests
demanding his election victory be overturned.
	   Hun Sen and senior leaders of his Cambodian People's Party met
with the king for two hours in the northern town of Siem Reap, near
the ancient Angkor monuments, to discuss a looming constitutional
crisis.
	   Hun Sen told reporters afterward that a weekend working group of
representatives of the main political parties called by the king
represented the best chance to break the deadlock and decide the
future of the country.
	   Hun Sen said he would attend and hoped other party leaders would
also, rather than send lower-level members. But one opposition
leader, Sam Rainsy, has already indicated he will send a junior
figure.
	   ``It is a meeting to determine the political fate of the
country, which cannot be decided by a low-level representative,''
Hun Sen said. ``It is a meeting where you work with the king, so it
would be impolite.''
	   Sihanouk, whose powers are curbed by the constitution, retains a
moral authority for many Cambodians but it is unclear that he can
persuade the emboldened opposition to accept an election they say
was stolen in massive fraud.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son and leader of the
largest opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and ally Sam Rainsy have urged
the monarch not to suggest a coalition. They have already rejected
a partnership with Hun Sen if their complaints are not addressed.
	   In Phnom Penh, thousands of people joined in a student-led
demonstration as the protests _ unprecedented in size or duration _
entered their 11th day.
	   The students marched to the state-run TVK television offices,
which they complained had not covered the demonstrations, and then
to the offices of the European Union, the largest foreign donor to
the election.
	   They complained to Sven Linder, the EU chief representative,
that the European Union had rubber-stamped the election, and
praised the United States, which has shown greater disapproval.
	   International observers largely endorsed the elections as
credible, but few stayed through the long counting and appeals
process. The pre-election campaign was marred by killings and
intimidation.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a senior Information Ministry official, said
that the rallies were not aired on state television ``because they
are illegal.''
	   Though Hun Sen's party won a slight majority of 64 of the 122
National Assembly seats, he lacks the two-thirds majority needed to
form a government alone. The opposition has threatened to block all
attempts to do so when the new assembly meets Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen outlined three scenarios Thursday: the assembly meets
and a new government is formed; it meets but the current government
will stay as a caretaker; the constitution is changed to permit a
government to form with a simple majority.
	   Hun Sen said that ``we pray to the gods'' for the first option.
	   The opposition's complaints of irregularities in voting and
counting have been rejected by Hun Sen-packed government panels.
	   Sihanouk, 75, said in a statement released Wednesday that the
purpose of the weekend gathering would be ``to discuss different
issues that have created a great political crisis.''
	   The king, who is fond of referring to the Cambodian people as
his children, described it as a ``family meeting.''
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup. Hun Sen hoped the new polls would
help him win back legitimacy and aid.

Lawyers challenge Zimbabwe troop intervention in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A prominent lawyers group has challenged
President Robert Mugabe's dispatch of an estimated 3,000 troops to
Congo.
	   ``By no stretch of the imagination can it be said to be
necessary for the defense of Zimbabwe that our forces should be
used to support a foreign leader to whom Zimbabwe has no treaty or
other obligations,'' said a statement issued by the Legal Resources
Foundation, an association of independent jurists.
	   The troops are backing President Laurent Kabila in a war against
rebels.
	   The constitution does not allow forces to be deployed except in
defense of the country, the foundation said.
	   ``Parliament should have been recalled and the whole matter
publicly debated,'' the lawyers said. ``The taxpayer's money is
being squandered on a foreign adventure instead of being used for
more important matters at home such as health and education.''

Clinton on whirlwind 'peace' tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Clinton addresses new assembly 1045 GMT; will be led &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Boosted by Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams' dramatic declaration that violence must end, President
Bill Clinton launched Thursday a whirlwind tour of Northern
Ireland, hoping to strengthen conciliation and embellish his
peacemaker reputation along the way.
	   Shortly after Air Force One touched down in this storied
province, Clinton went into meetings with one-time foes now
enmeshed in creating a new government under the terms of an accord
he helped broker last April. The most emotional part of the day
promised to be his meetings with victims of 30 years of violence in
Northern Ireland.
	   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, showed off
the day's headline in the Independent, announcing that David
Trimble, the Protestant head of Northern Ireland's embryonic
government, had agreed to meet with Adams, whose Sinn Fein group is
allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Berger called it a breakthrough. ``This is the headline we
wanted to see when we got here,'' he enthused to reporters.
	   One of Northern Ireland's two major highways was shut down at
morning rush hour to allow speedy passage of the presidential
entourage across Belfast to the site for the new cross-community
government, the Stormont office complex atop a hill in the city's
eastern suburbs.
	   Clinton was greeted there by the government's two appointed
leaders, Trimble and Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, an Irish Catholic. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair accompanied them inside Stormont for a briefing
on the status of the shaky peace accord and for meetings with
elected members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
	   The Sinn Fein party, including Adams, was there in force.
	   Adams' declaration, which was encouraged by the Clinton
administration, came closer than ever before to declaring an end to
the violence that has left more than 3,400 people dead over the
past three decades.
	   But several shadowy groups remain opposed to the peace accord.
Artfully ambiguous, it leaves unsettled whether the province will
be wedded to the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland or
maintain strong ties to mostly Protestant Britain.
	   After meeting with Northern Ireland's leaders, Clinton was
participating in a groundbreaking on the new campus for the
University of Ulster in West Belfast, an area of unrest over the
years. Later today, he planned to visit Omagh, where a bombing
killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 on Aug. 13, and address
a peace gathering at Armagh, the most venerated of Irish cities,
which St. Patrick called ``my sweet hill.''
	   James Steinberg, the president's deputy national security
adviser, said Wednesday that even with Adams' statement, there was
no way to rule out more bombs. But, he said, violence-prone groups
were on the run.
	   ``They're defensive. They're unwilling to stand up and defend
the actions they have taken,'' Steinberg said.
	   Adams' statement in advance of Clinton's arrival marked another
step away from the IRA's once unshakable determination to bomb and
shoot until Northern Ireland was abolished.
	   Instead, Adams' Sinn Fein party now is angling to help govern
the 77-year-old state alongside Protestant politicians.
	   Trimble had repeatedly demanded that Sinn Fein declare on behalf
of the IRA that ``their war is over'' before he would talk to Adams
about an IRA role in the new administration.
	   In Washington, former Sen. George Mitchell, who brokered the
peace accord, said anti-terrorist measures that British and Irish
lawmakers were considering would help combat IRA dissidents
destructive of the peace process.
	   Mitchell said Clinton's visit would ``encourage the people who
want this process to succeed.''
	   Arriving a day ahead of her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday called Northern Ireland's women a quiet catalyst for the
peace agreement, but said they must play a bigger role in politics
for real reconciliation to take root.
	   ``It was women whose whispers of `Enough!' became a torrent of
voices that could no longer be ignored,'' she said at a conference
called ``Vital Voices: Women in Democracy.''
	   ``It is up to you, the women of Northern Ireland, speaking out
whenever injustice arises, to point out opportunities, to face up
to challenges, and to speak for those who are still voiceless,''
she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton's speech brought together not only grassroots
Protestant and Catholic activists, but once-deadly opponents in
Northern Ireland's three-decade-old conflict _ virtually all of
them men.

Runaway Canadian weather balloon lands in Finnish islands

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A runaway Canadian weather balloon that
air traffic controllers lost track of and military jets tried to
shoot down has landed on a Finnish island in the Baltic Sea,
officials said Thursday.
	   ``The balloon came down safely in a field near Mariehamn on
Wednesday afternoon,'' said Police Commissioner Bjorn Andersson,
from the Aland islands, off Finland's southwest coast.
	   ``A Canadian company, Scientific Instrumentation Ltd., has
confirmed it is their balloon, and we are guarding it until we
arrange for it to be dismantled,'' Andersson said.
	   Scientific Instrumentation launched the 25-story, helium-filled
balloon near Saskatoon on Aug. 24 to measure ozone levels over
Canada for Environment Canada, the Canadian Space Agency and a
number of universities.
	   But the instrument package on the balloon failed to jettison,
and it began an erratic 9,000-kilometer (5,600-mile) voyage over
the northern hemisphere.
	   Aircraft from Canada, Britain and the U.S. military in Iceland
tracked the runaway balloon, and air traffic controllers diverted
planes from its path.
	   Canadian jet fighters fired more than 1,000 rounds at it, but it
remained aloft.
	   It disappeared off radar screens Saturday night about 200 miles
(320 kms) north of the Arctic Circle.
	   Air traffic controllers in northern Norway said the balloon
entered Norwegian airspace over the Svalbard Islands on Sunday.
Then it went missing again.
	   The balloon reappeared late Tuesday in Finnish airspace from
Russia over Lieksa, some 530 kilometers (330 miles) northeast of
Helsinki.
	   ``We had no idea it was the runaway Canadian balloon,'' said
Col. Pekka Tuunanen from the Finnish Air Force. ``Our jets checked
it out, and we monitored it until it landed in the Aland islands.''
	   The unmanned 100-meter-high (110-yard-high) balloon is used to
observe weather patterns and can be seen from about 70 kilometers
(40 miles) away. It is not equipped with transponders that emit
navigation signals to alert airliners to its presence.
	   It entered Finnish air space at a height of some seven
kilometers (about 23,000 feet), but began to lose height as it
drifted west across Finland to over the Aland islands in the Baltic
Sea between Finland and Sweden.
	   ``At no point did it pose any danger to aircraft over Finland,''
Tuunanen said.
	   Andersson said the balloon's equipment likely was intact, but
that experts were needed to evaluate any possible damage to the
instrument package, reportedly estimated to be worth almost $1
million.
	   Werner Oftwald of Saskatoon-based Scientific Instrumentation
Ltd. said everyone is pleased the balloon is finally down.
	   ``It's a great relief to all of us involved because it was
posing a big concern for air traffic control,'' Oftwald said in a
phone interview from Saskatoon.
	   ``The fact that it's on the ground and not in the ocean
somewhere is also a great bonus.... It's really important for us to
without doubt know what went wrong so we can prevent this from
happening again.''

Motorola sells stake in Thai telecoms company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The sale by U.S. telecommunications
company Motorola of a major stake in Thai telecoms company Ucom may
make it easier fro the Thai company to restructure its debts, one
of its executives was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   Ucom _ United Communication Industry _ announced Monday that
Motorola had sold its 25 percent stake in World Telecom Holding,
holder of a 50.97 percent stake in Ucom, which is listed on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand.
	   The other 75 percent stake of the holding company is controlled
by the local Bencharongkul family.
	   Motorola's stake was purchased for about 420 million baht (dlrs
10 million) by Somers Ltd., a British investment firm, the Bangkok
Post reported earlier this week.
	   Ucom senior vice president Vichai Bencharongkul was quoted by
the newspaper The Nation as saying his company considered
Motorola's pullout ``good timing,'' since it came as the Thai
company was negotiating a restructuring of its debt.
	   It could be easier to conclude a deal without having to consult
with Motorola's head office in the United States, he said.
	   Ucom is attempting to renegotiate about dlrs 530 million worth
of debt with 27 foreign creditors, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   Motorola has had a 30-year-partnership with Ucom, and in
practice the Thai company served as sole distributor for its
cellular phones, the second-biggest selling brand in Thailand after
Finland's Nokia.
	   Although Ucom will remain a distributor for Motorola products,
the U.S. company last month signed a distribution deal with a small
company associated with the Shinawatra group, Ucom's major rival in
the telecommunications sector.
	   Motorola's worldwide sales have slipped this year and in June
the company announced that it would eliminate 10 percent of its
worldwide workforce of 150,000 people. No time frame was given for
the layoffs.
	   ``We did not anticipate the share sell-off by Motorola, but we
understood what had happened,'' the Nation quoted Ucom's Vichai
saying. ``Though it's not a huge chunk of money, cash is king now
for everyone.''

North Korea's missile firing boosts Japan-South Korea military
</HEADLINE>
cooperation &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Japan-NKorea Missile

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In what was seen as a countermeasure
to growing military threats from North Korea, Japan and South Korea
have agreed to hold a joint navy exercise, the Defense Ministry
said Thursday.
	   If realized, it will mark the first joint military exercise
between the two neighboring countries.
	   The ministry said in a news release that the agreement was
reached when the defense ministers of the two countries met in
Tokyo earlier this week to discuss various security issues,
including North Korea's recent missile-firing over Japan.
	   The two countries also agreed to increase military cooperation
and exchanges, it said.
	   Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek, returning from Tokyo Thursday,
told reporters at Kimpo Airport that the agreed-on joint navy
exercise will be for ``peaceful purposes.''
	   Ministry officials said the joint navy exercise will be staged
with focus on ``search and rescue'' in international waters.
	   ``Japan and South Korea agreed to continue to exchange
information about North Korea's missile development and jointly
cope with the issue'' the ministry's news release said.
	   The two sides also agreed to have defense officials from both
nations hold talks as soon as possible, it said.
	   Despite prospering economic ties, Japan and South Korea have had
little military exchanges because of their turbulent history.
	   Japan ruled the Korean peninsula as a colony in 1910-1945.
Distrust and animosity are still deep among both peoples.

Police provide sex details against ousted minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of sexual encounters
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities on Thursday provided a
detailed account of the ousted deputy prime minister's sexual
escapades, a move certain to discredit him in this straight-laced
Muslim society.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was also finance minister, was fired the day
before and officials immediately pounced on him with possible
criminal charges.
	   During a hearing for one of Anwar's close associates, a police
report placed into the record detailed the ousted Cabinet members's
sexual trysts and his contacts with a pimp.
	   The report, submitted by national police chief Rahim Noor, also
detailed how Anwar ``groped and kissed'' women provided by the
associate, businessman S. Nallakaruppan.
	   Anwar told a news conference Thursday the charges were
fabricated and put forward to undermine his perceived challenge to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The associate, generally known as Nalla, is being held on
weapons charges, but investigators are looking into all of his ties
with Anwar.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla is ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   A book entitled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM,'' alleges
that Nalla, as he's popularly known, arranged sexual trysts between
Anwar and women.
	   Anwar, who is married and has six children, has secured an
injunction against the book. The defamation trial of author Khalid
Jafri has been set for October.
	   Mahathir has not yet said why he sacked his deputy Wednesday,
though the two have been at odds of economic policy for months.
	   Police said Anwar, who was also finance minister, was under
investigation for allegations made in the book.
	   Since the book first appeared in July, Nalla has been detained
under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which allows for the
government to hold suspects without trial if they're deemed a
threat to national security.
	   Nalla is being held for illegally holding 125 rounds of
ammunition at his house, a charge that carries a mandatory death
penalty. The ammunition was reportedly uncovered during the police
investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations in the book.
	   Political sources say the real reason Nalla is being held is
that he was found in possession of classified documents which were
traced back to Anwar.

Former Rwandan prime minister seeks light sentence in genocide

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The man who was Rwanda's prime minister
during the slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis sought a
sentence of two years or less on Thursday in exchange for his
guilty plea to genocide and testimony against others.
	   The plea for such a light sentence drew a scornful laughter from
Rwandans in the gallery and a surprised reaction from Rwanda's
justice minister.
	   The prosecution said Jean Kambanda, 42 _ the highest-ranking
former political leader in the tribunal's custody _ deserved life
in prison, even though he had recorded 90 hours of testimony about
the 1994 carnage to help build genocide cases against other alleged
ringleaders.
	   In determining Kambanda's sentence, which is to be handed down
on Friday, the tribunal's rules allow it to consider factors
including substantial cooperation with the prosecutor.
	   But the prosecution argued that no amount of testimony against
others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda is accused of
inciting massacres of Tutsis and distributing weapons for the
slaughter as his hard-line Hutu government presided over the
bloodbath.
	   ``How can you balance the thousands and hundreds of thousands
killed with the cooperation of the accused?'' Deputy Prosecutor
Bernard Muna asked the court. ``We believe this crime merits
nothing less than life imprisonment.''
	   A life sentence is the maximum the tribunal can impose.
	   Kambanda pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of genocide and
crimes against humanity, including responsibility for the murder
and extermination of civilians, becoming the first person to accept
culpability for genocide before an international court.
	   The crime of genocide was decreed and defined in 1948, after the
postwar Nuremberg trials.
	   During the hourlong session, defense attorney Oliver Michael
Inglis acknowledged that Rwanda's genocide was heinous.
	   But he said the three-month frenzy of killing had already begun
by the time Kambanda took office, and insisted the former prime
minister played no role in planning the slaughter.
	   Even though the indictment said Kambanda controlled the
government ministers and military officers who were carrying out
killings, Inglis characterized him as a reluctant officeholder
manipulated by a powerful military.
	   His client, he said, was ``a marionette _ his strings were
pulled and he danced.''
	   Rwandans in the gallery laughed aloud as Inglis pleaded for a
sentence of two years _ or none at all _ ``to enable the healing to
take place.''
	   ``Those people who are waiting...to rebuild their country will
be sorely disappointed if any greater sentence is imposed,'' he
said, while onlookers grimaced.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, wearing a dark suit and tie _ let
his lawyer speak for him, telling the chief judge: ``I have nothing
further to add.''
	   Rwandan Justice Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo, reached by
telephone in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, said he was ``very,
very surprised'' to hear of the defense's sentencing request,
saying such a light punishment would ``not be understandable to our
people.''
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.
	   Security at Thursday's session was lighter than the previous
day, when the tribunal found former village Mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu
guilty of genocide.
	   The judgment against Akayesu, in addition to being the first
international verdict on genocide, also marked the first time an
international court defined rape as a genocidal crime.
	   The court _ known formally as the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda _ is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom
are on trial.
	   An elderly Rwandan priest is in custody in Texas. Eight others
have been indicted but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in proceedings condemned by many foreign
lawyers as unjust _ have tried at least 500 people for involvement
in the genocide, and at least 116 have been sentenced to death.
More than 130,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted
of genocide, the first executions in connection with the slaughter.
	   Since then, about 10,000 prisoners have joined a plea-bargain
program aimed at easing the heavy load on the prisons and courts.

Police hunt Albanian kidnappers of British woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Police launched a manhunt Thursday for
two Albanian men accused of abducting and repeatedly raping a
British tourist near an archaeological site in northern Greece.
	   A third Albanian man, identified as Arian Kiku, 23, was arrested
Wednesday after the woman managed to escape and report the incident
to police, authorities said.
	   The woman, a London resident, told police three Albanians
abducted her Tuesday as she walked to the ancient site of
Aristotle's School near Naoussa, a town about 78 kilometers (48
miles) west of Salonica.
	   She had reportedly arrived in Greece on Aug. 27 on vacation.
	   She told authorities the men forced her into a nearby cave and
raped her repeatedly.
	   They also allegedly stole her bank card, beating her until she
revealed her personal identification number that would allow them
to withdraw cash, she said.
	   Two of the men left the cave, apparently to use the card, and
the woman managed to escape after Kiku, who was guarding her, fell
asleep, she told authorities.
	   Police arrested Kiku while he was still asleep. During
questioning, he identified the other two men as Ren Rina, 27, and
Regim Rina, 25, media reports said. It was not immediately clear
whether the two were related.
	   The woman was transported to a hospital, where she was still
being treated Thursday, authorities said.
	   Kiku was scheduled to appear before a prosecutor to be formally
charged later Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's militia ally on Thursday
released one of Lebanon's most prominent prisoners, a communist
woman who shot and seriously wounded the group's leader 10 years
ago.
	   Soha Bishara, 31, was released at the order of her victim, Gen.
Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia, the SLA said.
	   A statement by the group in the southern Israeli-occupied zone
said Lahd, a retired Lebanese army general who is Israel's only
remaining ally in Lebanon, ordered her freed for ``pure
humanitarian reasons.''
	   But Lebanese government sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said France played a key role in negotiations with
Lahd's masters in Israel for Bishara's release.
	   France had played a role in a swap in which Israel and the SLA
freed 55 Lebanese prisoners in return for the remains of an Israeli
commando in June.
	   Bishara walked out of the Khiam detention camp in the occupied
zone at 10 a.m. (0700GMT). She was driven to the capital, Beirut,
for a meeting with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   ``I am elated, like every father who has a son or daughter held
by Israel for a long time,'' Bishara's father, Fawaz, said as he
prepared to leave his Beirut apartment for a reunion with his
daughter at the prime minister's office.
	   ``But joy will only be full once all the prisoners are released
and our land liberated,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Bishara, a communist activist, shot Lahd on Nov. 7, 1988, at his
house in Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
	   She had gained access to his secure house by befriending his
wife. On that day, she pulled a pistol and shot Lahd three times.
	   Lebanon's Communist Party is part of a coalition waging a
guerrilla war against Israel and its allies in southern Lebanon.
	   In her assassination attempt, Bishara reportedly used a 5.5 mm
pistol that was reported to have been a gift to Lebanese communist
leaders from Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   Lahd, 67, survived with serious injuries and was transferred to
Israel for treatment. Bishara was captured and had been held at the
SLA-run detention center in Khiam without charges or trial.
	   She was among the prisoners most sought for release by Lebanese
guerrillas who had swapped prisoners and bodies with Israel and the
SLA in the past.
	   A total of 125 Lebanese remain in southern Lebanon with the SLA
and 42 in Israel.
	   Lahd commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese militia
that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its troops patrol
the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in absentia for
treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.

Tour of Spain riders hungry after France fiasco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In cycling's biggest race since the Tour de
France was marred by a drug scandal, the Tour of Spain kicks off
Saturday with riders itching to make up for lost credibility.
	   Organizers and team officials say this year's Vuelta a Espana is
attracting a wealth of talent _ including top-rated Festina, which
was kicked out of the Tour de France after admitting to systematic
drug use _ in large part because of July's Tour de France fiasco.
	   Racing's premier event almost fell apart because of French
authorities' probes into use of performance-enhancing drugs by
riders.
	   After Festina's expulsion, six other teams quit out of disgust
with police tactics that included raids on riders' hotels. One leg
was annulled when protesting racers held hands as they crossed the
finish line. Out of 189 who began the race, fewer than 100
finished.
	   Four of the teams to drop out were Spanish _ Banesto, Vitalicio
Seguros, ONCE and KELME. Riding on home turf, they now have a
special stake in the three-week marathon that begins in the
southern city of Cordoba and ends September 27 in Madrid.
	   ``Because of the Tour de France, people are hungry,'' said a
senior official of one of the teams, who asked not to be named.
	   ``It is going to be a very competitive race,'' said another,
Javier Minguez, director of the Vitalicio Seguros team. Of the Tour
de France, he added: ``What happened, happened. It is an anecdote.
Now we focus on the Tour of Spain.''
	   The race gets underway with 198 riders from 22 teams.
	   The organization running it, Unipublic, said the nine riders
Festina has registered include the stars Alex Zuelle, Richard
Virenque, Laurent Dufaux and Laurent Brochard.
	   Zuelle and Dufaux have admitted that in the Tour de France they
used the banned substance EPO, which boosts the number of
oxygen-carrying red cells in blood.
	   Festina's new director, former Spanish cyclist Juan Fernandez,
told the newspaper Diario 16 he did not think the team was
stigmatized by its expulsion from the tour. But he suggested morale
was low.
	   ``I want to restore the spirit that was robbed from Festina by
the Tour,'' Fernandez said.
	   Officials say that, measured in terms of riders' International
Cycling Union rating points _ some 37,000 _ this year's race is
drawing much more talent than those of the last two years in Spain.
	   However, big names will be missing. Tour de France winner Marco
Pantani of Italy and runner-up Jan Ullrich of Germany are sitting
this one out.
	   And with memories of the scandal still fresh, Spanish race
organizers are taking no chances. They scratched plans for the
riders to cross the border into France, saying they could not risk
disruptions like those that marred the Tour de France.

during the slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis sought a
sentence of two years or less on Thursday in exchange for his

Japan's Hitachi to post first loss since end of World War II
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES 7th graf with Moody's reaction, closing share
price in 8th graf; no pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One of Japan's biggest electronics manufacturers,
Hitachi Ltd., said Thursday that it expects to fall into the red
for the first time since the end of World War II due to sluggish
sales.
	   Hitachi President Tsutomu Kanai pledged to carry out extensive
cost-cutting by slashing 4,000 employees to a total of 66,000
workers.
	   The cuts, to be taken by next March, will come mostly through
attrition instead of layoffs, he said.
	   The Tokyo-based company said it now forecasts a group net loss
of 250 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 1.81 billion) in the fiscal year
through next March, reversing an earlier estimate for a 40 billion
yen (dlrs 290 million) net profit.
	   Hitachi blamed deterioration in prices for computer memory
chips, falling demand for consumer electronics and personal
computers and increased restructuring costs.
	   The company plans to trim fixed costs by 10 percent over the
next year and a half and will freeze new investment in plants and
equipment. It hopes these steps will allow it to return to the
black in the next fiscal year, which begins April 1.
	   Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service reacted swiftly
to the news, placing the debt rating of Hitachi and its
subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade.
	   The revised earnings sent Hitachi shares tumbling 7 percent to
706 yen (dlrs 5.15) in Tokyo.
	   The company's fortunes appear to have worsened considerably
since May when it announced the initial profit projection and
posted a group net profit of 3.47 billion yen (dlrs 25 million) for
the fiscal year ended in March.
	   Hitachi lowered its sales forecast Thursday to 7.94 trillion yen
(dlrs 57 billion), down 5.5 percent from a previous estimate
released in May.

Businessmen rally in Indonesian capital, demand ouster of president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of white-collar workers
demonstrated Thursday for the ouster of President B.J. Habibie and
urged Indonesians to temporarily stop paying taxes.
	   The self-proclaimed Professional Society for Democracy said
Habibie, who succeeded former autocratic President Suharto in May,
had failed to meet the people's aspirations.
	   Riots and student protests helped force Suharto from power, and
Habibie, once his protege, is implementing democratic reforms and
has scheduled general elections next year.
	   Critics say Habibie is not moving fast enough on reform and has
done little to solve Indonesia's economic crisis, which has pushed
millions of people below the poverty line.
	   In the protest Thursday, about 50 demonstrators marched along a
main thoroughfare in the capital, Jakarta. Some wore ties and
carried cellular telephones.
	   They said Indonesians should give their tax money to the poor
rather than the Habibie government, saying it has failed to follow
the people's mandate and reflects the old order under Suharto.
	   Habibie has rejected allegations that he is a shadow of his
autocratic predecessor.
	   Protesters also criticized the Indonesian military, which has
been accused of doing little to stop riots in Jakarta in May that
left about 1,200 people dead.
	   The demonstrators unfurled banners that read, ``We pay for your
uniform, where were you in the middle of May?'' and ``Our taxes are
not for subsidizing the wealthy.''

Athlete's appeal dismissed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with sprinters racing each other later Thursday,
trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone
had her court appeal to run in the 100-meter event at this month's
Commonwealth Games rejected Thursday.
	   Peris-Kneebone, 27, took her case to the Court of Arbitration
for Sport (CAS) in Sydney on Tuesday after Athletics Australia
overlooked her for one of the three berths available in the
100-meter event.
	   She was chosen in the 400-meter relay and the 200-meter events.
	   Peris-Kneebone was hoping to replace Tania Van Heer in the event
after recording a better time than her rival during the season. Van
Heer had a better placing at the selection trials.
	   Later Thursday in Darwin, Peris-Kneebone beat Van Heer over 100
meters at a Commonwealth Games warmup meet.
	   Peris-Kneebone won the race in sultry conditions in 11.31
seconds and Van Heer was second in 11.36, with both clocking
personal bests.
	   After the race, the sprinters put aside the recent tension
between them, hugging each other and smiling.
	   ``I have had a rough last few days, I had to come through,''
said Peris-Kneebone. ``I am extremely happy.''
	   Van Heer said she was glad the situation had been resolved.
	   ``I just don't like holding a grudge and I'm really glad we are
friends again,'' she said.
	   Peris-Kneebone may still get to run the 100 meters _ if Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor is unable to run due to an injured knee.

Hanson's `Easytax' ridiculed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IPSWICH, Australia (AP) _ One Nation leader Pauline Hanson
unveiled a tax policy Thursday which critics said was economic
madness and would lead to the collapse of the Australian economy.
	   Hanson, who polling shows has only about 10 percent of voters'
support ahead of the Oct. 3 election, released her so-called
Easytax system which features a flat two percent income and
transaction tax.
	   It would replace income tax, company tax, sales tax, capital
gains tax, provisional tax, fringe benefits tax and withholding
tax, but would not apply to bank deposits or withdrawals.
	   ``The usual knockers have said this system has not worked
anywhere in the world when the fact is this system has not yet been
tried and so actually has not failed anywhere either,'' Hanson said
Thursday.
	   The plan drew immediate criticism from the government and
business groups.
	   ``It's absolute Hansonite economic madness,'' Treasurer Peter
Costello said.
	   ``It's hard to comment on a proposal which is nonsensical,
ill-considered, inexplicable, applies nowhere else in the world and
has been invented by someone who has no experience of taxation
matters.''
	   A spokesman from the Australian Society of Certified Practicing
Accountants said it would lead to the collapse of the Australian
economy.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's four-day-old election
campaign has struck trouble in cyberspace, with two Labor staffers
fired over allegations that they advised hackers on how to alter
the Liberal party's Web site.
	   Last week, hackers targeted the Internet site, changing
Australian leader John Howard's title to ``Prime Minister for Pain,
Suffering and Inequity.''
	   The Liberal party's coalition with the National Party forms the
Australian government which is going to the polls on Oct. 3.
	   The pranksters also altered Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello's portfolio to ``Minister for the Rich, Stomping the Poor
and Wrecking the Economy.''
	   Labor opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that he
had fired a new paid staffer who had been accused of giving hackers
advice on how to defile the site.
	   Later Thursday, he said a volunteer working on the Labor
campaign had also been fired.
	   ``It was totally inappropriate.'' Beazley said. ``The person who
was offering that advice, or may well have been offering that
advice _ we're not absolutely certain _ has been dismissed.
	   ``I, above all, don't want to run a campaign which is in any way
tainted.''

Bangladesh appeals for urgent shipment of food grains
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP)_ Bangladesh asked the international
community to step up shipments of food aid Thursday in response to
nearly two months of flooding.
	   Flooding has already lingered longer than ever in this basin at
the foot of the Himalayas. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center
predicted Thursday that flooding would continue until month's end.
The waters have claimed more than 700 lives and affected more than
30 million people in 44 of the country's 64 districts.
	   Bangladesh appealed for dlrs 880 million in relief aid and
post-flood rehabilitation. In a message to donor nations
represented by the United Nations in Dhaka this week, the
government called for food grains requested under that earlier
appeal to be sent as soon as possible.
	   Donors have so far committed aid worth dlrs 82 million in cash
and kind.
	   Flooding has snapped road links between the capital and the
southern port city of Chittagong and the tea producing center of
Sylhet. A large part of an embankment protecting northern Rangpur
town was washed away, inundating fresh areas in the region.
	   An official at Rangpur, 248 kilometers (155 miles) north of
Dhaka, said officials and local people have been struggling since
Wednesday morning to repair the embankment and save the town from
serious flooding.

Philippine peso, stocks fall on Malaysian political concerns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell sharply
against the U.S. dollar Thursday, pressured by worries over
Malaysia's political situation.
	   Traders said the dismissal late Wednesday of Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim triggered renewed
dollar buying in the Philippines and other regional markets.
	   The dollar averaged 43.506 pesos for the day, up from
Wednesday's 43.067 pesos. It was last traded at 43.430 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said sentiment toward regional
currencies remained predominantly negative, with developments in
Malaysia only the latest in a string of negative developments in
the region.
	   Anwar's dismissal came after Malaysia imposed restrictions on
the conversion of its currency, the ringgit, into dollars.
	   In contrast, several Philippine officials underscored plans to
deepen economic reforms and pledged not to follow Malaysia's lead
in imposing capital controls to quell currency volatility.
	   Stocks sagged, meanwhile, in step with the weaker peso and Wall
Street's overnight losses, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 4.82 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 1,192.95, following a 6.01-point uptick
Wednesday.
	   Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone topped the list of
most actively traded issues following a company notice saying it is
moving to preempt a possible hostile takeover. PLDT's shares closed
unchanged.
	   Investors in the Manila market continued to exercise caution
amid the volatility on Wall Street, said Fitzgerald Aklan,
assistant vice president for institutional sales at Orion-Squire
Securities Inc.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 45.06-point decline to
7,782.37 reflected investor jitters over the fate of global
economies due to the crisis in Asia, he said.
	   ``The U.S. market is still vulnerable, so investors are
reluctant to position in the local market,'' Aklan said.
	   Global financial markets have looked to Wall Street for
direction since the United States remains one of the few economies
boasting steady fundamentals. But a prolonged weakness in the U.S.
stock market could ignite fears its economy is finally succumbing
to the global malaise.
	   Aklan said that while Philippine fundamentals remain generally
better than those of its Asian neighbors, its stock market is still
vulnerable to negative investor sentiment as overseas markets are
battered.

Twenty-seven Tamil rebels killed in northern fighting, military
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ At least 27 Tamil Tiger guerrillas
were killed and 20 wounded in fighting with government troops in
northern Sri Lanka, the military said Thursday
	   There were no casualties on the government side in the clashes
Wednesday, the military said in a statement.
	   The rebels did not immediately comment. Independent confirmation
is impossible since the government does not allow reporters into
the area, and civilians fled the region months ago.
	   Twenty of the guerrillas were killed and 10 wounded when troops
backed by battle tanks and artillery attacked guerrilla bunkers
near the northern frontier town of Kilinochchi, 275 kilometers (170
miles) north of the capital, Colombo, the military said.
	   The other seven were killed and 10 wounded near the town of
Mankulam, 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the south, which the military
has been besieging for 10 months.
	   The two towns, deserted of civilians, sit astride the main
south-north highway, which the military has been trying to capture
for 16 months. Rebels have slowed the advance to a crawl.
	   The rebels are fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils, who
claim they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who
dominate the government and military. More than 54,000 people have
been killed since the war began in 1983.

Diplomat: Kim Jong Il to formally become N. Korean leader this
</HEADLINE>
month &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kim Jong Il will assume full, formal power of
North Korea before Sept. 9, the 50th anniversary of the country's
founding, a senior North Korean diplomat was quoted as saying.
	   ``North Korea will celebrate its 50th anniversary, already
having Kim Jong Il as head of state,'' said Kim Tae Hyong, the
country's acting charge d'affaires to Russia.
	   Kim Tae Hyong spoke at a meeting in Moscow devoted to North
Korea's anniversary and the 53rd anniversary of Japan's defeat in
World War II. His remarks were reported by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Kim Jong Il has been running communist North Korea as the
supreme military commander and head of the ruling Workers' Party
since his father, Kim Il Sung, died in 1994 at age 82. The
presidency was the only title left vacant.
	   North Korea's newly elected parliament is scheduled to convene
on Friday and may proclaim Kim Jong Il president as early as
Saturday.
	   ``His nomination for this post is a manifestation of absolute
trust of the people, with him we have the possibility to make our
society independent,'' Kim Tae Hyong said.
	   Kim Jong Il's election as president would mark communism's first
hereditary power succession.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea in 1945.

Another victim dies after Cape Town bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A man injured in the bombing of a
Planet Hollywood restaurant last month died in the hospital
Thursday, raising the death toll to two.
	   Police spokesman Superintendent Wicus Holtzhausen identified the
dead man as Brian Duddy, 55, of Fish Hoek, South Africa.
	   Duddy, a senior manager for Standard Bank, was among about 20
bank employees at a goodbye party for a colleague when the bomb
exploded Aug. 25.
	   Duddy had remained in critical condition in intensive care at
City Park Hospital with internal injuries.
	   ``His injuries were so severe he couldn't survive them,'' said
the hospital's general manager, Selwyn Sharon.
	   Another bank employee died the night of the bombing. Twenty-six
other people were injured.
	   Police have made no arrests in the case.

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia Politics
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar saying he was victim of conspiracy, denying
charges. &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The day after he was sacked as
Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim is finding himself
with few friends.
	   The youth wing of the governing United National Malays
Organization (UMNO), once seen as Anwar's power base, met Thursday
and announced they were backing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar, 51, countered by saying he was the victim of a
conspiracy, even as his power base appeared to crumble beneath him.
	   ``The youth wing of the Barisan National reiterates its
allegiance to the prime minister,'' said Zahid Hamid, president of
the powerful UMNO youth wing. The Barisan National is the ruling
government coalition of 14 parties, dominated by UMNO.
	   Zahid, who also visited Anwar's residence on Thursday, rocked
the party's annual convention two months ago by raising the issue
of internal reform and corruption. He is still seen by many as a
close ally of Anwar, the party's youth leader from 1982 to 1987.
	   Zahid's campaign against cronyism and nepotism, including
allegations that party leaders had misused their positions to
enrich relatives and friends, was quickly crushed by Mahathir.
Zahid fell silent.
	   Anwar himself also praised Mahathir in July and swore loyalty to
the man who has led Malaysia for 17 years. But it was obviously too
late for him to mend fences with the boss with whom he had differed
on economic policy.
	   ``The youth wing requests everyone to remain calm at this
time,'' Zahid said Thursday, in an indication that Anwar's
supporters were unlikely to hold public demonstrations.
	   Former Cabinet colleagues of Anwar, who was deputy prime
minister for five years, met and endorsed Mahathir's dramatic move.
	   Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz, who
had often worked closely with her colleague in the finance
ministry, described it as ``very sad of turn of events'' but did
not support Anwar.
	   ``Today, I read in the newspapers that people say leaders come
(and) leaders go. That is very true. No one is indispensable,'' she
said.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid said:
``I feel sad because this is happening at a time when the country
is facing an economic slowdown.''
	   But no tear was publicly shed for Anwar, even by those who had
spend decades with him in politics.
	   ``The history of UMNO has shown that every test can be
overcome,'' said Ibrahim Ali, a senior party leader who was Anwar's
partner in radical student politics in the 1970s.
	   Both men were imprisoned together for two years under the
Internal Security Act for inciting a peasant protest a
quarter-century ago.
	   As it became increasingly clear that Anwar was going to be
charged once again, and perhaps arrested, under the same security
law, party colleagues said they had confidence in the judiciary.
	   ``We believe in the wisdom of the leadership and the Malaysian
legal system to decide the situation,'' said Zulfiki bin Mohamed
Alwi, another senior UMNO leader.
	   The security law allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   ``Actually it goes to show that nobody is above the law, that
where the law applies does not matter, be it a small or a big
man,'' said Rafidah, the trade minister.
	   Anwar told reporters he was expecting to be charged for sexual
misconduct and for leaking Malaysian secrets, allegations he
described as ``fabricated'' and part of a conspiracy to destroy his
political career.
	   Authorities chose Thursday to make public details of the alleged
sexual escapes, during a hearing in a Kuala Lumpur courtroom.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ More than 100 relatives of Swissair crash victims
gathered Thursday at Geneva's Cointrin Airport, where a team of
police psychologists, counselors and other specialists offered help
in a special area.
	   A tall blonde who appeared to be in her early 30s arrived crying
with an older woman and two men shortly after the midmorning
scheduled arrival time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They appeared to wander aimlessly for a few minutes until
beckoned by airport security staff to the special area. A woman in
a Swissair uniform put her arm around another young woman, head
bowed and crying, and led her to the area.
	   Swissair set up emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland and
one in New York _ for relatives.
	   Airline officials, who declined to release the passenger list
until relatives have been notified, said most of the passengers on
the flight were believed to be residents of western Switzerland.
	   At a Zurich news conference, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said there were 215 passengers on board, including two
babies, and 14 crew members. One crew member was an American from
Swissair partner Delta, said Tschanz who refused to identify him.
The airline didn't give any further information on those on board.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   Georges Schorderet, the chief financial officer of parent
company SAirGroup, said an emergency team was attempting to contact
relatives.
	   ``It could well take some time to reach all the people,'' and no
further details will be given before that, Schorderet said. The
flight operated with three classes.
	   Swissair Chief Executive Officer Philippe Bruggisser told a news
conference in Zurich that the flight had started off without
problems. He said the pilot was 50-year-old Urs Zimmermann and the
co-pilot was Stefan Low, 36. Both were Swiss.
	   After a normal takeoff, they reported problems on board and
decided to turn back to boston, he said.
	   ``We have to suppose that there are no survivors,'' Bruggisser
said.
	   The airline's chief MD-11 pilot, Christian Sussi, confirmed the
pilot had apparently tried to make an emergency landing in Halifax,
Nova Scotia. Tschanz confirmed the pilot reported smoke in the
plane's cockpit south of Halifax.
	   Attached to the Geneva airport's arrivals board, which at first
said the flight was ``delayed,'' was a piece of paper directing all
those concerned with the flight to the information desk.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people. Many work for
international organization such as the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   ``For all of us this is a day of mourning,'' President Flavio
Cotti said in Bern, where he called a special meeting of the
country's ruling coalition Cabinet. The government ordered all
flags to be flown at half-staff.
	   Schorderet said the plane was put into service in August 1991
and was overhauled in August and September last year. It had been
checked before takeoff, he said.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   Geneva's last air accident was in 1982, when an Egyptair Boeing
707 went down on the airfield, causing three serious injuries,
airport duty officer Daniel Teysseire said.
	   For Swissair, it is the first serious accident for almost 20
years. Fourteen people were killed on Oct. 7, 1979, when a DC-8 jet
overshot the runway at Athens during landing and burst into flames.
	   In the company's worst accident to date, 80 people were killed
when a Caravelle jet crashed at Duerrenaesch, Switzerland, in
September 1963.
	   In February 1970, all 47 people on board were killed when a
plane of the same make crashed at Wuerenlingen in Switzerland. That
crash was caused by the explosion of a terrorist bomb.

Prosecutors arrest politicians on corruption charges

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested a key aide to
President Kim Dae-jung and an opposition legislator on corruption
charges Thursday as the president vowed a broad-ranging anti-graft
campaign.
	   ``The government will sweep corruption from every corner of the
country,'' President Kim was quoted as saying by his spokesman Park
Jie-won.
	   Chyung Dai-chul, vice president of Kim's ruling National
Congress for New Politics, was accused of taking 40 million won
(dlrs 30,000) in bribes from a real estate development company in
1995. Chyung denied the charges.
	   Prosecutors also arrested opposition lawmaker Lee Shin-hang,
accused of raising an 18.3 billion won (dlrs 13.7 million)
political slush fund between 1994 and 1996 while working as head of
a construction company owned by now bankrupt Kia Motor Co. He, too,
denied the accusations.
	   Armed with a court-issued arrest warrant, prosecutors also were
seeking another opposition legislator accused of taking bribes from
a construction company.
	   Opposition legislators accused the president of using the
anti-corruption campaign to break up their Grand National Party,
which controls the 299-seat single-chamber National Assembly.
	   Aides to Kim denied the arrests were politically motivated.
	   The president's minority ruling party has been trying to woo
opposition legislators to forge a parliamentary majority, deemed
crucial to passing economic reform bills.
	   Kim accused the opposition of blocking those bills and thus
delaying economic reforms the International Monetary Fund demanded
in return for its record dlrs 58 billion bailout package for the
country's battered economy.
	   Kim's National Congress and its coalition partner, the United
Liberal Democrats, control 146 seats in parliament, four seats
short of a simple majority.

Malaysia's sacked deputy PM says he'll fight charges

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister said Thursday he had been framed in a ``larger political
conspiracy'' and vowed to fight all charges against him.
	   Anwar Ibrahim said allegations of sexual misconduct and leaking
state secrets were fabricated by the camp of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to undermine any challenge to his 17-year
leadership of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``This is an unjust administration,'' Anwar, who was also dumped
as finance minister Wednesday, told hundreds of supporters and
journalists at his private residence.
	   ``If the No. 2 cannot be sure of justice, then I'm sorry for
Malaysia.''
	   He called the allegations against him _ including corruption,
spying for foreign powers, even sodomy and murder _ part of a
``larger political conspiracy.''
	   Anwar, 51, was fired unceremoniously Wednesday evening after
months of bitter political differences with his one-time mentor,
Mahathir.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Anwar, a conservative Muslim and the father of six children,
said he had undergone DNA testing to prove his innocence in an
apparent paternity suit.
	   He said Mahathir threatened to get prostitutes to testify
against him.
	   ``I told him, `If that's the game you want to play, I can also
line up prostitutes,''' who would make the same allegations against
other ministers, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was
under investigation on charges contained in a book that has
widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are being tried for defamation.
	   Anwar, who hugged his wife, Aziza, as she stood next to him
during the news conference, said he expected to be arrested and
would fight to prove his innocence.
	   ``I have enough documentary evidence, tapes, statutory
declarations under oath that would defend and establish my
innocence,'' he said, adding that his associates and family had
been harassed by the police.
	   The Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National
Organization was set to meet Thursday night to discuss Anwar's
position in the party. Anwar is UMNO vice president, though it was
likely he would be stripped of the post.
	   It appeared that some of Anwar's allies were abandoning him. The
leader of the UMNO youth wing, once seen as Anwar's power base,
announced Thursday they stood by Mahathir.
	   Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor, had been left out
of economic decisions for months after differing with his boss on
the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Mahathir on Tuesday announced an unprecedented ban on the
trading of the ringgit outside Malaysia and on Wednesday fixed the
ringgit at 3.8 against the U.S. dollar.
	   Anwar said he still held affection for Mahathir.
	   ``I do regard him as a father, although not all fathers treat
their children fairly.''

Kurdish rebel commander dismisses lawyers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish guerilla commander told a
state security court Thursday that he was dismissing two of his
four lawyers to protect them from possible attacks.
	   Semdin Sakik, the No. 2 commander of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party, said the lawyers were receiving death threats for
taking on his case.
	   ``I am responsible for making so many children orphans. I said
to them, `I do not want your children to be left orphans,''' Sakik
told a panel of judges.
	   Sakik appeared before the court with his brother Arif. Both face
charges of murder and Kurdish separatism. If convicted, they could
be sentenced to death. They were captured by Turkish soldiers in
northern Iraq in April.
	   Sakik said he was also dismissing a third lawyer who failed to
appear in court Thursday but was keeping a fourth. However,
newspapers said the three lawyers no longer wanted to defend Sakik.
	   The rebel leader submitted a 48-page written testimony and told
the court he had unwillingly joined the guerrilla movement because
of poor economic conditions in the region and because he thought it
was necessary to protect the Kurdish culture he said was being
threatened by Ankara.
	   The trial in Diyarbakir, the main city in southeastern Turkey
where the guerrilla war has raged, was adjourned.
	   Sakik masterminded the Kurdistan Workers Party's operations in
Turkey. He is accused of killing 113 local Kurds and 125 soldiers.
	   Close to 37,000 people have died in the war since 1984.

Morale plunging in Namibian army in face of Congo intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Morale among Namibian troops is wilting
in the face of the country's intervention in Congo, newspapers said
Thursday.
	   Unusually large numbers of soldiers have reported sick, applied
for funeral leave or simply gone absent without leave over the last
week, the reports said.
	   Made up of former colonial and liberation soldiers, the Namibian
force has about 10,000 professional soldiers in this southwestern
African country of 1.7 million people.
	   The government has refused to provide details of the operation
to support Congo President Laurent Kabila in his war against
rebels. News reports say the troop presence is between 600 and 1000
soldiers.

Thailand proposes takeover of scaled-down train-road project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government will examine taking
over a failed infrastructure project that came to symbolize the
excesses of the now-bust economic boom, an elevated train and road
system.
	   The government terminated the dlrs 3.2 billion contract with
Hopewell Holdings Ltd. for the project in January. After five years
of work, only 12 percent of the construction had been completed and
the project was seen as hopelessly unworkable.
	   The system, carrying car and rail traffic on different decks
built on massive concrete pilings above surface streets, was to
have been a transportation centerpiece of this December's Asian
Games.
	   Pradit Phataraprasit, deputy transport minister, told Dow Jones
Newswires on Thursday that his ministry has proposed the government
build the necessary infrastructure for the rails but allow the
private sector to operate the system.
	   The elevated tollway would be scrapped. Pradit said the ministry
expected the Cabinet to consider the proposal later this month.
	   The ministry also suggested concentrating on the rail route that
would will run from central Bangkok to the north and east of the
city while discarding routes to the south and west.
	   The central-to-north route was the portion that Hopewell had
made most progress on, finishing about a quarter of the work.
	   Pradit said that for the proposed scaled-down version, the
government would need to spend an estimated 30 billion baht to 40
billion baht (dlrs 750 million to dlrs 1 billion).
	   The private sector would probably need to invest another 10
billion baht (dlrs 250 million) to install necessary equipment and
trains to run the system.

Rating company says deterioration of Philippine bank assets
</HEADLINE>
`alarming' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The level of non-performing loans
held by Philippine banks is rising ``at an alarming rate'' as the
country's economy weakens, a credit rating agency said Thursday.
	   Standard and Poor's also lowered its ratings of nine Philippine
banks while maintaining those of five other institutions with
relatively large capitalization.
	   The weaker peso, which has fallen about 40 percent against the
dollar since July 1997, high interest rates and a slowdown in the
economy caused by the regional crisis and a severe drought have
combined to weaken the asset quality of the Philippine banking
system.
	   The credit rating agency said increased charges for bad and
doubtful debts and lower profitability will reduce the available
capital of Philippine banks.
	   The increased charges are due to rising problem loans and the
need to meet tighter regulatory standards imposed after the start
of the regional financial crisis.
	   Standard and Poor's noted that non-performing loans of
Philippine banks reached 10.1 percent of total outstanding loans at
the end of May, higher than the 5.3 percent posted at the end of
1997.
	   The banking system's loan growth in the four years to 1997 more
than trebled to 1.7 trillion pesos (dlrs 39.5 billion) from 552
billion pesos (dlrs 12.8 billion) in 1993. Standard and Poor's said
it expects the bad-loan ratio to ``easily exceed'' 20 percent in
1999.
	   Past downgrades of Philippine banks by credit rating agencies
have hurt sentiment for listed banks on the Philippine Stock
Exchange. Thursday's downgrades were announced after the market
closed.
	   The government has emphasized that the Philippine banking system
is still in better shape than many of its harder-hit neighbors in
Asia.
	   The sector's bad-loan ratio averaged 10.2 percent between March
and August, according to the latest data. This compares with 18
percent for Malaysia, 25 percent for South Korea and 46 percent in
Indonesia in the same period.

Russian currency sinks; Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details on ruble's fall, comments from
Zhirinovsky, hard currency reserves lower. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday, but
Viktor Chernomyrdin insisted he would remain a candidate for prime
minister despite opposition demands that he withdraw in favor of a
compromise figure.
	   Russia's financial crisis went from bad to worse Thursday, a day
after the government acknowledged it was powerless to stop the
collapse of the Russian ruble.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 13.5 rubles to the dollar (7.4
cents for each ruble), but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to
the dollar (5.7 cents.)
	   At currency exchange booths in central Moscow, operators lowered
the ruble rate on their billboards several times Thursday in an
effort to keep up with the crashing currency. Just last month, the
ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents each) before it
began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
	   Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians not to panic and to leave
their money in banks, where he assured them it would be safe. But
the plummeting currency was certain to make depositors nervous and
increase demand for dollars and other foreign currencies.
	   ``You have about three weeks to assess the situation and take a
correct decision,'' he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting.
	   There have been lines at some banks and currency exchange booths
in recent days, but there has not been any unrest in the streets.
	   Meanwhile, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated that his
party will vote against Chernomyrdin when parliament holds a second
round of voting on Friday. Communists and their allies blame
President Boris Yeltsin's government for landing Russia in the
current economic mess. Chernomyrdin was overwhelmingly rejected
Monday in a first round of voting.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 and named Chernomyrdin
acting prime minister.
	   The political turmoil has left the interim government unable to
devote its attention to the mounting economic crisis. Most of the
debate has been focused on forming the new government instead of
solving the economic problems.
	   The State Duma plans a second vote on Chernomyrdin on Friday,
although some lawmakers have called for Chernomyrdin to withdraw
and others are seeking another candidate.
	   Chernomyrdin rejected lawmakers' suggestions that he was using
the prime minister's job as a springboard to a presidential bid in
2000 _ even though he is widely considered to be a leading
contender.
	   ``I would like to see the nut who would call this a good
starting point for presidential elections,'' he told the Interfax
news agency.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to dissolve the
parliament.
	   However, as Russia's ruble slipped again and the International
Monetary Fund signaled it might delay a loan payment to Russia this
month, the ranks of those opposing Chernomyrdin began to thin a
bit.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said his 50-member
faction, third largest in the Duma, would support Chernomyrdin
after having abstained from the first vote.
	   Zhirinovsky said he had no faith in Chernomyrdin as a leader,
but at least he was a known quantity, and rejecting him could lead
to greater political turmoil.
	   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Of course we have pity for the 200
victims, but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''
	   The Duma sent a letter to Chernomyrdin on Wednesday urging him
to step aside. The Communists want a compromise candidate such as
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov or acting Industry Minister Yuri
Maslyukov.
	   Maslyukov, a former Soviet bureaucrat, was the only Communist in
the Cabinet, appointed by Yeltsin earlier this year to appease
parliament. But he resigned Thursday, citing differences with
Chernomyrdin, among other reasons.
	   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said the Duma could be ready to
debate an impeachment motion against Yeltsin next week. The motion,
like previous attempts, stands little chance of passing, given the
president's strong constitutional powers.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The Central Bank said its
gold foreign currency reserves fell by dlrs 700 million in the last
week of August to dlrs 12.7 billion. The bank has spent billions in
recent months in a futile effort to prop up the ruble.

Extremist party owes hundreds of thousands in back taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The nationalist Republican Party
that for years has accused the government of fraud and embezzlement
owes more than dlrs 700,000 in back taxes, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said tax authorities are
investigating the party's records on the suspicion it failed to pay
more than 23.8 million koruna (dlrs 767,740) in taxes over the last
four years.
	   As a result, the Republicans will be ineligible to receive the
21 million koruna (dlrs 677,400) in state subsidies granted to all
political parties that earn more than 3 percent of the vote.
	   In early parliamentary elections last June, the extremists fell
short of the 5 percent threshold needed for representation in the
lower house, earning 3.9 percent of the vote.
	   The newspaper also said party leader, Miroslav Sladek, is
suspected of having used most of his party's 1996 state subsidy,
worth 56 million koruna (dlrs 1.8 million), for personal purposes.
	   Director of the tax office, Jiri Roubicek, refused to comment on
the issue, saying the law forbids from providing any information.
	   First reports on financial machinations within the party
surfaced before this year's elections, when several former party
members alleged that Sladek and his aide Jan Vik used party funds
to build two villas and buy luxury cars.
	   Sladek and Vik have been unavailable to the press since June,
but Tomas Vandas, a party official told the Associated Press that
reports on the unpaid taxes were ``completely ungrounded.''
	   ``It's just a political attempt to paralyze the activities of
our party,'' Vandas said. ``All this is done with a single aim: to
destroy us.''

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A runaway Canadian weather balloon that
air traffic controllers lost track of and military jets tried to
shoot down has landed on a Finnish island in the Baltic Sea,
officials said Thursday.
	   ``The balloon came down safely in a field near Mariehamn on
Wednesday afternoon,'' said Police Commissioner Bjorn Andersson,
from the Aland islands, off Finland's southwest coast.
	   ``A Canadian company, Scientific Instrumentation Ltd., has
confirmed it is their balloon, and we are guarding it until we
arrange for it to be dismantled,'' Andersson said.
	   Scientific Instrumentation launched the 25-story, helium-filled
balloon near Saskatoon on Aug. 24 to measure ozone levels over
Canada for Environment Canada, the Canadian Space Agency and a
number of universities.
	   But the instrument package on the balloon failed to jettison,
and it began an erratic 9,000-kilometer (5,600-mile) voyage over
the northern hemisphere.
	   Aircraft from Canada, Britain and the U.S. military in Iceland
tracked the runaway balloon, and air traffic controllers diverted
planes from its path.
	   Canadian jet fighters fired more than 1,000 rounds at it, but it
remained aloft.
	   It disappeared off radar screens Saturday night about 200 miles
(320 kms) north of the Arctic Circle.
	   Air traffic controllers in northern Norway said the balloon
entered Norwegian airspace over the Svalbard Islands on Sunday.
Then it went missing again.
	   The balloon reappeared late Tuesday in Finnish airspace from
Russia over Lieksa, some 530 kilometers (330 miles) northeast of
Helsinki.
	   ``We had no idea it was the runaway Canadian balloon,'' said
Col. Pekka Tuunanen from the Finnish Air Force. ``Our jets checked
it out, and we monitored it until it landed in the Aland islands.''
	   The unmanned 100-meter-high (110-yard-high) balloon is used to
observe weather patterns and can be seen from about 70 kilometers
(40 miles) away. It is not equipped with transponders that emit
navigation signals to alert airliners to its presence.
	   It entered Finnish air space at a height of some seven
kilometers (about 23,000 feet), but began to lose height as it
drifted west across Finland to over the Aland islands in the Baltic
Sea between Finland and Sweden.
	   ``At no point did it pose any danger to aircraft over Finland,''
Tuunanen said.
	   Andersson said the balloon's equipment likely was intact, but
that experts were needed to evaluate any possible damage to the
instrument package, reportedly estimated to be worth almost dlrs 1
million.
	   Werner Oftwald of Saskatoon-based Scientific Instrumentation
Ltd. said everyone is pleased the balloon is finally down.
	   ``It's a great relief to all of us involved because it was
posing a big concern for air traffic control,'' Oftwald said in a
phone interview from Saskatoon. ``The fact that it's on the ground
and not in the ocean somewhere is also a great bonus ... It's
really important for us to without doubt know what went wrong so we
can prevent this from happening again.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner with 229 people
aboard crashed off Nova Scotia after the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport. ``We have no survivors,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Glenn Chamberlain of the Halifax Rescue Coordination Center, as
rescue efforts continued early Thursday. Philippe Roy, a Geneva
airports spokesman, said the Geneva-bound Flight 111 left New
York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT) with
215 passengers, including two infants, and 14 crew. Witnesses
reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from the downed
aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers, and local
fishing vessels helped comb the waters for possible survivors. But
early Thursday, there were only reports of rescuers finding bodies
and human remains in 16-degree (61-degree Fahrenheit) waters. The
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour into
the flight, Chamberlain said. (CANADA-PLANE CRASH)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ignoring Tokyo's pleas, North Korea could be
planning a second firing similar to one earlier this week that sent
shock waves through the region, Japanese officials said Thursday.
Japanese and South Korean armed forces went on an increased level
of alert to prepare for another launch and Tokyo went on a
diplomatic offensive to dissuade the communist state from going
ahead with the test. But the North _ which has criticized Japan for
making ``a fuss'' over the first test launch on Monday _ was
apparently brushing off Tokyo's calls for restraint. North Korea
test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on Monday that flew
across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. It was
the first test of the new missile and rattled Tokyo by
demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases. (JAPAN-NKOREA MISSILE)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ While still the world's heaviest user of capital
punishment, China has significantly reduced executions in part due
to a new criminal code, human rights monitors reported Thursday.
Amnesty International, in a report under preparation, estimates
that last year China executed about 3,000 people _ more than eight
people a day. Although higher than executions in the rest of the
world combined and unconfirmed by the Chinese government, the toll
is a 31 percent drop from 1996's 4,367 executions in China. The
slightly more restricted use of the death penalty is a hopeful
portent for the arrival in China Sunday of Mary Robinson, the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights. During or before her visit,
China is expected to sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, a key U.N. treaty Beijing pledged to accede to
six months ago. (CHINA-EXECUTIONS)
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Too terrified to return home,
about 100 ethnic Chinese were holed up Thursday in military offices
in a riot-torn Indonesian town. Army reinforcements patrolled
coastal Lhokseumawe, a center of Indonesia's natural gas and
petroleum industry where mobs burned buildings and looted
Chinese-owned stores earlier this week. The riots in northern
Sumatra island were set off by bitterness toward the military but
lacked political direction, with mobs turning on the ethnic
Chinese, common scapegoats for the nation's economic problems. One
died and 12 were injured in the mayhem Monday and Tuesday. In
Lhokseumawe on Thursday, two groups of 50 Chinese were staying in
offices of the military district commander, sleeping on borrowed
mattresses. Some had fled their houses on Tuesday during the worst
of the rioting. (INDONESIA-RIOTS)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined to crush IRA
dissidents who killed 28 people in a car-bombing, Britain and
Ireland pushed anti-terrorist legislation toward passage Thursday
as U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Northern Ireland.
Britain's House of Commons debated past midnight over Prime
Minister Tony Blair's legislation, which would make it easier to
lock up violent opponents of Northern Ireland's peace process. The
bill passed the key debate stage in the House of Commons on a vote
391-17 early Thursday and later cleared the Commons unopposed in
its final reading. The bill was sent to the House of Lords for
consideration later in the day. In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern won near-unanimous backing for similar legislation. The moves
come in response to the Aug. 15 bombing in Omagh by the so-called
Real IRA. (NORTHERN IRELAND)

Iraq planning to replace veteran U.N. envoy

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's high-profile ambassador to the United
Nations is leaving his post for a more senior job in Baghdad,
officials said Thursday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, one of President Saddam Hussein's most trusted
aides, will likely leave at the end of the year after more than
seven years at the United Nations, Iraqi officials in Amman,
Jordan, told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   His job could go to the deputy foreign minister, Riyadh
al-Qaisi, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They declined to say what post Hamdoon could get.
	   Hamdoon's transfer is the latest in a recent reshuffle of
diplomatic missions, the biggest that Saddam has ordered since the
end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Some 30 ambassadors and other diplomats have been recalled since
July to be replaced by prominent journalists and officials from the
ruling Baath Party. Saddam reportedly hopes that the new officials
will be able to improve Iraq's image that has been tarnished since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   However, Hamdoon's recall is not considered a demotion.
	   A former deputy foreign minister, Hamdoon was made ambassador in
1991 after the war, and has frequently led Iraq's negotiations with
U.N weapons inspectors who are entrusted with dismantling the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Fluent in English, Hamdoon was the first Iraqi ambassador to the
United States after the two countries restored diplomatic relations
in 1974 ending a nearly 20-year break.
	   He is a senior official of the Baath Party and during his nearly
30 years in government has served as deputy information and foreign
minister.
	   Hamdoon studied architecture in the United States but spent most
of his career as a Baath activist when one of his job was to
oversee the party's covert operations in Arab countries.
	   One of the ambassadors to lose their jobs in the July reshuffle
was Saddam's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, at the United Nations
in Geneva.
	   But the Iraqi officials in Jordan said he is not expected to
return to Baghdad and will remain abroad to supervise Saddam's
family's business.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Boosted by Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams' dramatic declaration that violence must end, President
Bill Clinton launched Thursday a whirlwind tour of Northern
Ireland, hoping to strengthen conciliation and embellish his
peacemaker reputation along the way.
	   Shortly after Air Force One touched down in this storied
province, Clinton went into meetings with one-time foes now
enmeshed in creating a new government under the terms of an accord
he helped broker last April.
	   ``What can I do to help?'' Clinton asked in opening a private
briefing on the shaky peace accord with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and the two appointed leaders of Northern Ireland's embryonic
government, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.
	   The most emotional part of the day promised to be his meetings
with victims of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
	   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, showed off
the day's headline in the Independent, announcing that Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist leader, had agreed to meet with Adams, whose Sinn
Fein group is allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Berger called it a breakthrough. ``This is the headline we
wanted to see when we got here,'' he enthused to reporters.
	   One of Northern Ireland's two major highways was shut down at
morning rush hour to allow Clinton's speedy passage across Belfast
to the seat of the new cross-community government, the Stormont
office complex atop a hill in the city's eastern suburbs.
	   Clinton, in what press secretary Mike McCurry likened to a
``college mixer,'' worked Stormont's Long Hall, where elected
members of Northern Ireland's assembly stood grouped by parties to
greet the president.
	   The Sinn Fein party, including Adams, was there in force.
	   Adams' declaration, which was encouraged by the Clinton
administration, came closer than ever before to declaring an end to
the violence that has left more than 3,400 people dead over the
past three decades.
	   But several shadowy groups remain opposed to the peace accord,
which creates new links with the predominantly Catholic Republic of
Ireland but also maintain old ties to mostly Protestant Britain.
	   Clinton was also participating in a groundbreaking on the new
campus for the University of Ulster in West Belfast, an area of
unrest over the years. Later Thursday, he planned to visit Omagh,
where a bombing killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 on Aug.
15, and address a peace gathering at Armagh, the most venerated of
Irish cities, which St. Patrick called ``my sweet hill.''
	   James Steinberg, the president's deputy national security
adviser, said Wednesday that even with Adams' statement, there was
no way to rule out more bombs. But, he said, violence-prone groups
were on the run.
	   ``They're defensive. They're unwilling to stand up and defend
the actions they have taken,'' Steinberg said.
	   Adams' statement in advance of Clinton's arrival marked another
step away from the IRA's once unshakable determination to bomb and
shoot until Northern Ireland was abolished.
	   Instead, Adams' Sinn Fein party now is angling to help govern
the 77-year-old state alongside Protestant politicians.
	   Trimble had repeatedly demanded that Sinn Fein declare on behalf
of the IRA that ``their war is over'' before he would talk to Adams
about a Sinn Fein role in the new administration.
	   In Washington, former Sen. George Mitchell, who brokered the
peace accord, said anti-terrorist measures that British and Irish
lawmakers were considering would help combat IRA dissidents
destructive of the peace process.
	   Mitchell said Clinton's visit would ``encourage the people who
want this process to succeed.''
	   Arriving a day ahead of her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday called Northern Ireland's women a quiet catalyst for the
peace agreement, but said they must play a bigger role in politics
for real reconciliation to take root.
	   ``It was women whose whispers of `Enough!' became a torrent of
voices that could no longer be ignored,'' she said at a conference
called ``Vital Voices: Women in Democracy.''
	   ``It is up to you, the women of Northern Ireland, speaking out
whenever injustice arises, to point out opportunities, to face up
to challenges, and to speak for those who are still voiceless,''
she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton's speech brought together not only grassroots
Protestant and Catholic activists, but once-deadly opponents in
Northern Ireland's three-decade-old conflict _ virtually all of
them men.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's militia ally on Thursday
released one of Lebanon's most prominent prisoners, a communist
activist who shot and seriously wounded the group's leader 10 years
ago.
	   Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia, ordered the release of Soha Bishara, 31, for ``pure
humanitarian reasons,'' according to a statement by the group in
the southern Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Lahd, 67, a retired Lebanese army general, is Israel's only
remaining ally in Lebanon.
	   Lebanese government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said France played a key role in negotiations for Bishara's
release. In June, France also played a role in a swap in which
Israel and the SLA freed 55 Lebanese prisoners in return for the
remains of an Israeli commando.
	   Bishara walked out of the Khiam detention camp in the occupied
zone at 10 a.m. (0700GMT). She was driven to the capital, Beirut,
for a meeting with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   ``I am elated, like every father who has a son or daughter held
by Israel for a long time,'' Bishara's father, Fawaz, said as he
prepared to leave his Beirut apartment for a reunion with his
daughter at Hariri's office. ``But joy will only be full once all
the prisoners are released and our land liberated.''
	   Bishara, shot Lahd on Nov. 7, 1988, at his house in Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone. She had gained access to his
secure house by befriending his wife. Bishara was captured and had
been held at the SLA-run detention center in Khiam without charges
or trial.
	   In her assassination attempt, Bishara reportedly used a 5.5 mm
pistol reportedly to have been a gift to Lebanese communist leaders
from Cuban President Fidel Castro. Lebanon's Communist Party is
part of a coalition waging a guerrilla war against Israel and its
allies in southern Lebanon.
	   Bisharawas among the prisoners most sought for release by
Lebanese guerrillas who had swapped prisoners and bodies with
Israel and the SLA in the past.
	   A total of 125 Lebanese remain in southern Lebanon with the SLA
and 42 in Israel.
	   Lahd commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese militia
that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its troops patrol
the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in absentia for
treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.

Iraq planning to replace veteran U.N. envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's high-profile ambassador to the United
Nations is leaving his post for a more senior job in Baghdad,
officials said Thursday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, one of President Saddam Hussein's most trusted
aides, will likely leave at the end of the year after more than
seven years at the United Nations, Iraqi officials in Amman,
Jordan, told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   His job could go to the deputy foreign minister, Riyadh
al-Qaisi, said officials speaking on condition of anonymity. They
declined to say what post Hamdoon could get.
	   Hamdoon's transfer is the latest in a recent reshuffle of
diplomatic missions, the biggest ordered by Saddam since the end of
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Some 30 ambassadors and other diplomats have been recalled since
July to be replaced by prominent journalists and officials from the
ruling Baath Party. Saddam reportedly hopes the new officials will
be able to improve Iraq's image that has been tarnished since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   However, Hamdoon's recall is not considered a demotion.
	   A former deputy foreign minister, Hamdoon was made ambassador in
1991 after the war, and has frequently led Iraq's negotiations with
U.N weapons inspectors who are entrusted with dismantling the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Fluent in English, Hamdoon was the first Iraqi ambassador to the
United States after the two countries restored diplomatic relations
in 1974 ending a nearly 20-year break.
	   He is a senior official of the Baath Party and during his nearly
30 years in government has served as deputy information and foreign
minister.
	   Hamdoon studied architecture in the United States but spent most
of his career as a Baath activist when one of his job was to
oversee the party's covert operations in Arab countries.
	   One of the ambassadors to lose their jobs in the July reshuffle
was Saddam's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, at the United Nations
in Geneva.
	   But the Iraqi officials in Jordan said he is not expected to
return to Baghdad and will remain abroad to supervise Saddam's
family's business.

	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris from the aircraft was found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax, and
the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Local fishermen were called to the area of the crash to help
with the rescue operation.
	   There were four rescue planes and four helicopters in the area,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said. A Canadian navy
ship, the HMSC Preserver, also was on the scene.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday morning, said Inspector Anthony Infante
of the Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   ``Our first priority are the families,'' Infante told reporters
at Kennedy airport. ``I believe about 15 families are here. I'm
sure the number will increase.''
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman
Jamie Finch said the U.S. agency was in consultation with its
counterparts in Canada and has offered any assistance desired. But
he said it had not decided whether a U.S. team would be sent to the
scene.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled in
August and September last year. It had been checked as all are
before takeoff, he added.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``we have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''

Korea's conglomerates strike deals on merging subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with analysts comments in 14-18 grafs

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two top South Korean computer chip
makers agreed to merge Thursday in an industry shakeup that forced
the nation's bloated conglomerates to reorganize some of their key,
overlapping subsidiaries.
	   The marriage between Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. and LG
Semicon will create the world's second largest computer memory-chip
maker with a combined 17-percent market share. Samsung, also from
South Korea, leads the market with a 19 percent share.
	   The Hyundai-LG merger was the highlight of a package agreement
unveiled Thursday, in which the nation's top five conglomerates
merged 17 of their key subsidiaries.
	   ``The deals will relieve some of the burden of the excessive,
overlapping investments,'' said Sohn Byung-doo, vice chairman of
the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobby of big businesses.
	   ``The restructuring drive will spread further in the future and
will help reclaim international confidence for the country's
economy,'' he added.
	   The agreement also included:
	   _Samsung, Daewoo and Hyundai will merge their aircraft
components subsidiaries.
	   _The rolling stock arms of Hyundai and Daewoo will merge. A
smaller rolling stock builder, Hanjin, will join the merger later.
	   _Samsung and Hyundai will merge their petrochemical companies.
	   _Hyundai will take over the oil refinery and gas-station chain
owned by Hanwha.
	   _Samsung will sell its ship engine plant to Hanjoong, a
state-owned heavy industries company.
	   _Hyundai and Hanjoong will merge their power plant-building
operations.
	   Officials still have to work out details of what Sohn repeatedly
called ``voluntary deals.''
	   But analysts noted the government's heavy-handed intervention
and said the marriages could be short-lived.
	   ``The business groups were forced to cooperate (with the
government) because of the business slump now,'' said Yoo
Seong-min, a researcher at the state-funded Korea Development
Institute. ``The merger pacts could fall apart once the economy
turns around.''
	   Big businesses have survived repeated government attempts to
reduce their size. They had often announced restructuring plans but
seldom followed through.
	   Militant labor unions also could derail the mergers that could
entail layoffs, said Lim Ji-won, an economist at investment bank JP
Morgan in Hong Kong.
	   A new South Korean labor law gives companies the right to lay
off workers. But accustomed to lifetime employment, Korean workers
have been fighting back with a spate of strikes this year.
	   Conspicuously absent in Thursday's industry shakeup was
automobile companies, whose sprawling facilities have come to
symbolize South Korea's industrial overexpansion.
	   South Korean car makers are operating at half their combined
annual capacity of 4 million vehicles.
	   The auto industry restructuring was stalling pending the fate of
bankrupt Kia Motor Co., the country's No. 2 carmaker, now up for an
international auction.
	   Mostly family-run enterprises known as ``chaebol,'' South Korean
conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and over
diversifying during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for
the country's current financial crisis.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has been insisting on their
restructuring, promising tax breaks and other benefits. Kim has
said he would withhold loans from state-controlled banks unless the
debt-ridden conglomerates restructured themselves.
	   The International Monetary Fund demanded a reorganization of
Korean conglomerates as a condition for a record dlrs 58 billion
bailout in December.
	   Major South Korean businesses have been reeling under sluggish
sales at home and falling prices abroad, which critics attributed
partly to oversupply by South Korean firms.
	   South Korean computer chip makers, for example, have cut their
monthly production by up to 25 percent this year in an attempt to
boost prices in a glutted market.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 cross-funded
subsidiaries.
	   At least eight of them collapsed under heavy debt last year,
saddling banks with billions of dollars in bad loans and fueling
the financial turmoil still besetting the nation.

	   An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
flight. In Geneva, a 100-strong crisis center was attempting to
counsel those worried about relatives. Counseling teams were also
set up in Zurich, Swissair said.
	   Donzel said he had no information on the nationalities of the
passengers. The airline had been ``swamped with calls,'' he said.
	   ``Airlines don't have the nationalities of the passengers,'' he
said. ``You show your passport getting on to the plane for
immigration but you don't have to give your nationality when you
make a reservation.''
	   ``Now it will be kind a putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   Many people who weren't involved had called the airline because
of confusion over the flight number, Donzel said. The plane was
initially thought to be on a Zurich-bound flight.
	   The spokesman had arrived from Zurich on a special flight
bringing some 30 reinforcements for the Geneva crisis center.
	   A Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, was
preparing to take off as normal at 12.30 local time (1030 GMT)
Thursday.

Students resume classes following big protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; ADDS commentary from state press in grafs 4-9;
EDITS to conform

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The capital was calm Thursday as
university students resumed studies for exams following the largest
protest so far amid recent stepped-up agitation against the
military regime.
	   Gates to the campus of the Yangon Institute of Technology,
locked during Wednesday's protest, were open and riot police were
no longer deployed on nearby roads. Traffic moved freely.
	   The protest by some 500 students Wednesday centered on exams
scheduled for Saturday, nearly two years overdue since universities
were closed during the last bout of student unrest in 1996.
	   A commentary in the state-controlled press Thursday meanwhile
accused some Western countries and foreign press of interfering in
Myanmar's affairs.
	   The commentary, by the pseudonymous author Su Wei Mon, was
published a day after a meeting between foreign diplomats and
opposition leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the embattled head
of the National League for Democracy.
	   No details were available about the talks, but a U.S. embassy
spokesman said beforehand it was a routine meeting to discuss
political developments.
	   Thursday's newspaper commentary said, ``Western countries and
their media are interfering in the internal affairs by covert and
overt means and some under the guise of diplomats.
	   ``We are a sovereign nation and have the right to choose our
fate. We will not tolerate any pressure or threat.''
	   The commentary also accused foreign radio stations such as the
BBC and two U.S. government-funded stations, the Voice of America
and Radio Free Asia, of broadcasting biased and exaggerated reports
about Myanmar and ignoring the positive work undertaken by the
government. Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   The institute where Wednesday's protest took place recently
reopened classes for crash courses to study for the exams, but
students did not feel they had adequate time to prepare. They
marched about the campus and demanded a postponement.
	   The authorities, already confronted with a renewed campaign for
more democracy led by Suu Kyi, reacted quickly and deployed
hundreds of police in the area and sealed off roads.
	   After a day of negotiations with their teachers, the students
were finally allowed to leave the campus. The government indicated
that there would be no arrests. The demands for exam postponement
appeared not to have been met.
	   The institute has been a hotbed of student unrest in the past
and authorities are keeping a close eye on the universities as they
grapple with Suu Kyi's latest campaign. About 200 students staged a
protest at an intersection Aug. 24.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has demanded that
a parliament elected in 1990 finally be allowed to convene.
	   The elections were overwhelmingly won by her National League for
Democracy, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962,
never allowed the legislature to meet.
	   The stepped-up campaign coincides with the 10th anniversary of
an uprising against military rule that was crushed by the army,
leaving an estimated 3,000 people dead.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, whose activities are severely restricted, appears
to have recovered from a recent 13-day roadside standoff on a
bridge outside Yangon with authorities. They had refused to let her
van travel to the provinces to meet supporters.
	   On Tuesday, she was interviewed by foreign journalists and
appeared fit.
	   She said it was ``quite possible'' the government would carry
through with threats to arrest opposition leaders and ban her party
if she tries to convene the parliament.
	   The government accuses Suu Kyi and the NLD of working with
foreign nations to destabilize the country.

Five Algerian soldiers killed in ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Five Algerian soldiers were killed in a
roadside ambush by Islamic militants near the capital, Algerian
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The killings occurred on Wednesday near Tigzirt, 60 kilometers
(37.5 miles) east of Algiers, the reports said.
	   Although there was no official confirmation of the attack, the
Le Matin and Liberte dailies said three small bombs exploded by the
troops' parked vehicle. They were then shot dead during an
hour-long gunfight.
	   Witnesses said the assailants then fled with the troops'
weapons.
	   It was the second such ambush in four months against troops in
the region, which is considered an Islamic stronghold.
	   In other violence nearby, local authorities said two Islamic
militants were killed by Algeria's security forces on Wednesday.
	   Massacres and bombings during Algeria's 6-year-old Islamic
insurgency have left some 75,000 people dead. The violence began
after the army canceled legislative elections the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Albanian sources reported
fresh attacks Thursday in strife-torn Kosovo province, amid hopes
for a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts for a political solution.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
said Serb forces launched a ``strong attack'' on three villages
outside of Orahovac, 55 kilometers (34 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Thousands of refugees who fled Orahovac when Serb forces
overran it in July, had been camped in the villages.
	   The ethnic Albanian center also reported attacks early Thursday
on four villages south of Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from
Pristina, as well as in the border region off Prizren where
fighting erupted three days ago.
	   No reports of casualties were immediately available.
	   On the other hand, Serb sources claimed Thursday ethnic Albanian
militants coordinated attacks on police forces patrolling the main
Kosovo roads.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said armed Albanians launched
simultaneous attacks on Serb security forces near Iglarevo village,
40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina on the east-west road
running to Pec, and near Drenovac, 15 kilometers (9 miles) further
west towards the border town of Djakovica. No casualties were
reported.
	   The reports come as U.S. diplomats continue to push for a
political agreement between the Serb-led Yugoslav government and
Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   On Wednesday, diplomats working towards an agreement in the
region were hopeful an ``interim accord'' that would stop the
fighting and restore a self-rule to the Albanians over a three-year
period would be possible within months.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy
in 1989 and has since ruled with virtual marital law. In March,
Serb and Yugoslav security forces launched a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian militants, who are fighting for independence.
	   The United States and European countries have called for
``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-one, but fear full independence would cause further
conflicts with Albanian populations in neighboring countries.
	   Serb authorities in Prizren, another village near the border
with Albania, reported at least 20 members of the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army were killed in clashes Wednesday. The report
could not be independently confirmed.
	   Continuing the U.S. efforts in the region, John Shattuck,
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina Friday, according to sources at the U.S.
embassy in Belgrade. Former Senator Robert Dole was also expected
in the region over the weekend.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair jetliner has crashed off
Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on board after its pilot
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax International Airport.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. The Geneva-bound Flight 111 left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   A flotilla of coast guard and fishing boats searching in the
darkness early Thursday found only bodies and human remains at the
crash site in the ocean.
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Canadian rescue official Dan Bedell said 18 bodies had been
recovered as dawn approached.
	   Sixteen of the dead were brought aboard a navy supply vessel,
HCMS Perserver, which was co-ordinating the operation. Fishermen in
small fishing boats brought the two others to shore at Peggy's
Cove.
	   Area hospitals, which had been alerted to prepare for victims,
sent their extra staff home early Thursday morning as hopes for
survivors diminished.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 declared an emergency about an hour
into the flight, Chamberlain said.
	   The three-engine plane also dumped fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, an airport worker said.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris from the aircraft was found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax, and
the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Local fishermen were called to the area of the crash to help
with the rescue operation.
	   Four rescue planes and four helicopters were in the area as well
as the navy supply ship, Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau
said.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   She said civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of
the crash.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday morning, said Inspector Anthony Infante
of the Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   ``Our first priority are the families,'' Infante told reporters
at Kennedy airport. ``I believe about 15 families are here. I'm
sure the number will increase.''
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman
Jamie Finch said the U.S. agency was in consultation with its
counterparts in Canada and has offered any assistance desired. But
he said it had not decided whether a U.S. team would be sent to the
scene.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled in
August and September last year. It had been checked as all are
before takeoff, he added.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``we have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''

Maruyama, Watts, 14 others advance to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOMAKOMAI, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama and
American Brian Watts were among 16 winners Thursday in the opening
round of the Japan PGA Matchplay Championship Promise Cup.
	   Among those joining the two in Friday's second round will be
Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, Frankie Minoza of the Philippines,
Australian Peter McWhinney, Burmese Zaw Moe and Eduardo Herrera of
Colombia.
	   Casualties in the 18-hole first round included Taiwan's Chen
Tse-chung, American David Ishii, Carlos Franco of Paraguay and 1991
champion Satoshi Higashi.
	   The field for the 100 million yen (dlrs 746,000) event included
the defending champion and the top 31 on the Japan tour's money
earnings list for the 12 months through last week.
	   But Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, winner of the Hisamitsu KBC Augusta
last week, is sitting out the tournament, one of the Japan PGA's
major events. The 51-year-old Jumbo, the eldest of three Ozaki
brothers on the Japan tour, is the nation's winningest golfer, with
108 career victories.
	   Maruyama, winner of the PGA Philanthropy in July, another major
tournament of Japan, beat Tsuneyoshi Yoneyama 3 and 2.
	   Watts, the Japan-based golfer who finished runner-up in a
playoff with American Mark O'Meara in the British Open, beat
Masayuki Kawamura 1-up in 19 holes.
	   Watts of Group Two and Maruyama in Group One will not meet
unless they advance to the final Sunday.
	   Watts has said he will continue to base himself in Japan for the
rest of the season rather than enter U.S. tour events. Since his
second-place finish at Royal Birkdale in July, he has received
invitations to some U.S. tournaments.
	   The winner Sunday earns 30 million yen (dlrs 223,600) and a
five-year exempt status on the Japan tour.

Swissair says all passengers, crew died on crash flight

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Some nine hours after Swissair flight
SR111 from New York to Geneva crashed off the coast of Canada, the
airline said midday Thursday all 229 people on board were killed.
	   The plane was carrying 215 passengers, two of them babies and 14
crew members.
	   crew members. The airline said in a statement that four bodies
had so far been recovered from the crash site.
	   Swissair said that for legal reasons it could not give details
of passengers' names.
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Swissair spokesman
Jean-Claude Donzel said the airline has no plans at present to
ground its fleet of 16 MD-11s.
	   An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
flight. In Geneva, a 100-strong crisis center was attempting to
counsel those worried about relatives. Counseling teams were also
set up in Zurich, Swissair said.
	   Donzel said he had no information on the nationalities of the
passengers. The airline had been ``swamped with calls,'' he said.
	   ``Airlines don't have the nationalities of the passengers,'' he
said. ``You show your passport getting on to the plane for
immigration but you don't have to give your nationality when you
make a reservation.''
	   ``Now it will be kind a putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   Speaking earlier in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz
	   Many people who weren't involved had called the airline because
of confusion over the flight number, Donzel said. The plane was
initially thought to be on a Zurich-bound flight.
	   The spokesman had arrived from Zurich on a special flight
bringing some 30 reinforcements for the Geneva crisis center.
	   A Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, was
preparing to take off as normal at 12.30 local time (1030 GMT)
Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Albanian sources reported
fresh attacks Thursday in strife-torn Kosovo province amid hopes
for a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts for a political solution.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
said Serb forces launched a ``strong attack'' on three villages
outside of Orahovac, 55 kilometers (34 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina. Thousands of refugees who fled
Orahovac when Serb forces overran it in July had been camped in the
villages.
	   The ethnic Albanian center also reported attacks early Thursday
on four villages south of Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from
Pristina, as well as in the border region off Prizren where
fighting erupted three days ago.
	   No reports of casualties were immediately available.
	   Meantime, Serb sources claimed Thursday ethnic Albanian
militants coordinated attacks on police forces patrolling the main
Kosovo roads.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said armed Albanians launched
simultaneous attacks on Serb security forces near Iglarevo village,
40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina on the east-west road
running to Pec, and near Drenovac, 15 kilometers (9 miles) further
west toward the border town of Djakovica. No casualties were
reported.
	   The reports come as U.S. diplomats continue to push for a
political agreement between the Serb-led Yugoslav government and
Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   On Wednesday, diplomats working toward an agreement hoped an
``interim accord'' that would stop the fighting and restore a
self-rule to the Albanians over a three-year period would be
possible within months.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy
in 1989 and has since ruled with virtual martial law. In March,
Serb and Yugoslav security forces launched a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian militants, who are fighting for independence.
	   The United States and European countries have called for
``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-1, but fear full independence would cause further
conflicts with Albanian populations in neighboring countries.
	   Serb authorities in Prizren, another village near the border
with Albania, reported at least 20 members of the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army were killed in clashes Wednesday. The report
could not be independently confirmed.
	   Continuing the U.S. efforts in the region, John Shattuck,
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina on Friday, according to sources at the U.S.
embassy in Belgrade. Former Sen. Bob Dole was also expected in the
region over the weekend.

Suharto associate says he'll pay back central bank money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A former trade minister and long-time
associate of former President Suharto testified Thursday that he
used central bank funds to finance part of a paper-making company
he owns.
	   The admission by Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan came as government
prosecutors investigate widespread allegations of corruption by
Suharto's clan and associates during his 32 years in power.
	   The autocratic Suharto quit in May after riots and student
protests and his successor and onetime protege, B.J. Habibie, has
pledged to curb graft and push through democratic reforms.
	   Hasan, a golfing buddy of Suharto, testified at the attorney
general's office that he used Bank Indonesia funds to finance part
of his paper industry, PT Kiani Kertas.
	   ``God willing, I will repay all the money,'' Hasan said after
the six-hour interrogation.
	   He said he would willingly hand over his wealth if the assets of
his closed bank, Bank Umum Nasional, aren't sufficient to cover the
liquidity assistance that it received from Bank Indonesia.
	   Part of that assistance was used to finance a pulp project,
which will yield some dlrs 10 million a month, Hasan said.
	   Hasan, along with other tycoons who head closed or nationalized
banks, has to repay the liquidity assistance to the government by
Sept. 21 or risk having other assets seized by the government.
	   Amir Sjamsudin, Bob Hasan's lawyer, said his client was
questioned about whether he can return the central bank's
liquidity.
	   ``We were just negotiating the deal (to return the funds),'' the
lawyer said.
	   Hasan's bank was one of three troubled banks closed by the
Indonesian government on Aug. 21 as part of reforms to the banking
system required by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is
leading a multibillion-dollar aid package for Indonesia, which is
enduring the worst economic turmoil since the 1960s.
	   Finance minister Bambang Subianto said some 70 percent of funds
pumped into Hasan's bank went to the shareholders or their
affiliates.
	   Earlier this week, the government said evidence indicates
charities set up and controlled by Suharto misused their funds.
Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by the Suharto family.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets were lower in early trading
Thursday as investors dumped regional stocks amid political and
economic uncertainty in Malaysia, where the reform-minded finance
minister was sacked. The 0.5 percent fall in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average on Wednesday also added to the gloom in Asia,
analysts said. Wall Street's fall pulled share prices in Taiwan to
a near two-year low. The technology-heavy Weighted Price Index,
which is sensitive to U.S. market movements, slumped 3.4 percent to
close at 6,251.38, its fourth biggest drop this year. Elsewhere,
the dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim, the market-friendly finance
minister, by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, hit
neighboring Singapore the hardest. Its key Straits Time Index
plunged 2.1 percent by midday to 810.19 points. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday, but
Viktor Chernomyrdin insisted he would remain a candidate for prime
minister despite opposition demands that he withdraw in favor of a
compromise figure. Russia's financial crisis went from bad to worse
Thursday, a day after the government acknowledged it was powerless
to stop the collapse of the Russian ruble. The official ruble rate
fell to 13.5 rubles to the dollar (7.4 cents for each ruble), but
traders said it was as low as 17.4 to the dollar (5.7 cents). Just
last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents
each) before it began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians not to panic and to leave their
money in banks, where he assured them it would be safe. But the
plummeting currency was certain to make depositors nervous and
increase demand for dollars and other foreign currencies. (RUSSIA
POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ American factories in July saw the biggest
increase in orders for their products since last fall, but signs
persist that financial troubles in Asia are hitting home. Factory
orders jumped 1.2 percent in July, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday. It was the best showing since last November. Orders
totaled a seasonally adjusted dlrs 335.2 billion, with growth led
by a rebound in demand for electronics and industrial machinery.
July was the second month of recovery in factory orders from a 2.2
percent May drop that was the biggest in three years. In June,
orders rose 0.3 percent _ slightly more than originally reported.
But even with the two-month recovery, economists say U.S.
manufacturers are feeling the effects of economic turmoil in Asia.
Exports are plummeting, and imports, made cheaper by currency
devaluations in Asia, are becoming more attractive to American
consumers. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department is accusing
Microsoft Corp. of refusing to hand over possibly incriminating
documents, while the company says the government wants
inappropriately to broaden its case just weeks before an antitrust
trial. The government asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson Wednesday to force Microsoft to turn over within 24 hours
documents that it says show a pattern of illegal behavior by the
software giant toward rivals industry rivals. But already close to
the Sept. 23 trial date, Microsoft asked the same judge Wednesday
to prohibit the government from broadening its case to include new
allegations. If the judge allows the new evidence, Microsoft said,
he should also delay the trial at least six months. The Justice
Department and 20 states suing Microsoft contend they are not
broadening their lawsuit but are trying to illustrate how Microsoft
operates across the industry, using examples from a number of
companies. (MICROSOFT)
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ Women may soon get two new options in
the war on breast cancer, but the U.S. government's top scientific
advisers warn that doctors aren't yet sure how best to use them.
One of the drugs could be a breakthrough _ a genetically engineered
therapy called Herceptin that treats an especially aggressive type
of breast cancer. The other drug, tamoxifen, is designed to be used
by certain healthy women to possibly reduce their chances of
getting breast cancer later in life. Scientific advisers to the
Food and Drug Administration recommended Wednesday that both drugs
be approved. The FDA usually follows its advisers' recommendations
and should make a final decision on both Herceptin and tamoxifen by
November. However, the decisions are getting mixed reviews. (BREAST

Annan holds Congo peace talks at Nonaligned summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with speeches by presidents of Zimbabwe, Uganda; ADDS
background, context &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Zimbabwe, the main military ally of
Congo President Laurent Kabila, all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from the capital Kinshasa and were knifing
eastward into rebel territory in the vast central African nation.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared at
a summit of the Nonaligned Movement in this Indian Ocean city. ``We
have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain it cannot fall
and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Taking the podium minutes later, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni complained that the summit was being diverted by the
divisive Congo issue but then complained that foreign troops were
propping up a government which ``has not been elected.''
	   Kabila led a rebellion last year that ousted long-time dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko last year
	   For the first time, Museveni also acknowledged Ugandan troops
are in rebel-held territory in eastern Congo. He did not respond to
Kabila's allegations that Ugandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   If allied government forces keep moving eastward toward the
Ugandan and Rwandan borders, that increases chances a major battle
will be fought between Ugandan and Rwandan troops against those of
Congo, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. Rwanda denies having troops in
Congo.
	   Annan on Thursday said he was ``very encouraged'' by peace talks
he has held at the summit with Kabila, Mugabe, Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and South African President Nelson Mandela.
Annan planned to meet later Thursday with the presidents of Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   ``I think we'll be leaving South Africa encouraged with what has
transpired. The people of Congo have suffered far too long for us
not to bring this to a solution,'' Annan told reporters Thursday.
	   But he could offer no concrete progress. And with the rebellion
reeling, events on the battlefield were overtaking peace
initiatives.
	   Defense chiefs from Kabila's military allies agreed in a meeting
in Angola Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the Congolese
war.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military power-grab. This first
step was completed successfully,'' Angolan armed forces chief Gen.
Joao de Matos told reporters in Angola's capital, Luanda.
	   Kabila made a surprise appearence at the summit Wednesday, using
the opportunity to blast Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded
his vast central African country. He left hours later.
	   The Nonaligned Movement, in a draft resolution obtained by The
Associated Press, didn't take sides in the conflict. The heads of
state expressed ``deep concern'' over the war, saying it threatened
regional peace, and called for a cease-fire, to create a
``conducive environment for negotiations.''
	   The conflict has dominated the summit of developing countries,
which is striving to move away from its Cold War origins and carve
out a new political and economic role for the world's poorer
nations.
	   It also has contributed to a growing rift between South Africa
and neighboring Zimbabwe, the two regional powers. Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki wrote Mugabe an angry letter accusing him of not
cooperating in peace efforts, The Star of Johannesburg reported
Thursday.

Israeli bank group finances Kazak satellite network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Israel's Bank Leumi Le-Israel group
signed an agreement with Kazakstan's telephone monopoly on Thursday
to provide credit for a new satellite communications system in the
former Soviet republic.
	   The dlrs 6 million satellite system, to be built by Israel's
Gilat Satellite Network, will link 250 rural and remote regions of
the Central Asian nation, according to Bank Leumi.
	   The bank has agreed to finance 85 percent of the total, said
Liorah Tadhar, manager of the bank's international financing
department. He said the transaction is backed by the Israeli
Foreign Risk Insurance Group without Kazak government guarantees.
	   Bank Leumi and the insurance agency ``are very satisfied with
the financial (status) of Kazaktelecom, and that is the reason a
government guarantee was waived,'' Tadhar said.
	   Bank Leumi is 60 percent owned by the government of Israel.

Report: Poor potato crop forecast for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A dry spring and early summer followed by heavy
August rains could result in a poor harvest of potatoes, a Russian
staple, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``This year is going to be very bad, very tight,'' Sergei
Solenkov, head of the Agriculture Ministry's crop department, told
The Moscow Times. ``And the people survive on potatoes.''
	   Solenkov had no figures for the forecasted potato harvest, which
begins in September. About 90 percent of the country's potatoes are
grown by individuals at their summer cottages or on private plots
of land.
	   Potatoes are a mainstay of the Russian diet, providing 10
percent of the country's caloric intake, the Times said. Russians
eat six times as many potatoes as Americans _ an average 127
kilograms (279 pounds) per person per year _ it said.
	   Following a dry spring, European Russia _ from the Volga River
valley to the Moscow and St. Petersburg regions _ has been drenched
by rain for a month.
	   ``It's impossible to enter a field with a combine, everything is
soaked,'' Solenkov said.
	   Potatoes that spend too much time in cold, wet soil are
susceptible to a fungus that rots the tubers, the Times said.

Police hunt Albanian kidnappers of British woman

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Police launched a manhunt Thursday for
two Albanian men accused of abducting and repeatedly raping a
British tourist near an archaeological site in northern Greece.
	   A third Albanian man, identified as Arian Kiku, 23, was arrested
Wednesday after the woman managed to escape and report the incident
to police, authorities said.
	   The woman, a 46-year old London resident employed by the British
Home Office, told police three Albanians abducted her Tuesday as
she walked to the ancient site of Aristotle's School near Naoussa,
a town about 78 kilometers (48 miles) west of Salonica.
	   She had reportedly arrived in Greece on Aug. 27 on vacation, and
intended to spend just two days in Naoussa.
	   She told authorities the men forced her into a nearby cave and
raped her repeatedly.
	   ``She is in a generally good condition,'' said Nikolas
Voutsinos, doctor in the Naoussa hospital where the woman was
treated Wednesday night. She was released from hospital Thursday
morning.
	   The woman told police the three men also allegedly stole her
bank card, beating her until she revealed her personal
identification number that would allow them to withdraw cash.
	   Two of the men left the cave, apparently to use the card, and
the woman managed to escape after Kiku, who was guarding her, fell
asleep, she told authorities.
	   Police arrested Kiku while he was still asleep. During
questioning, he identified the other two men as Ren Rina, 27, and
Regim Rina, 25, media reports said. It was not immediately clear
whether the two were related.
	   The woman was transported to a hospital, where she was still
being treated Thursday, authorities said.
	   Kiku was scheduled to appear before a prosecutor to be formally
charged later Thursday.

Philippine police investigating bomb threat at U.S. Embassy

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine police are investigating a
bomb threat at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, but believe there is
little cause for alarm, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
Thursday.
	   Police blocked off a lane of the boulevard which passes in front
of the seaside embassy and added more men to guard the area
following the threat.
	   Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Wednesday that a handwritten
note was found on a plane that arrived from Dubai warning of a bomb
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Manila on Friday.
	   Philippine diplomats said three Indian passengers are the
primary suspects, and that the Kuwaiti government is confident that
one of three was the author of the note.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Tom Skipper said security at the Manila
embassy has been heightened following the bomb threat and the Aug.
7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Mercado said there was no immediate danger from the bomb threat,
but did not elaborate.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada's spokesman, Fernando
Barican, said the government is ``taking all proper security
measures'' to ensure the safety of foreigners and Filipinos.
	   Police had previously tightened security at the embassy after
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   Cars parked near the embassy are being randomly checked, two
police assault teams have been posted nearby, and patrol cars are
scouring the area, police said. Security was also tightened at
other U.S. facilities, including the residence of U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Hubbard.
	   At Manila's international airport, officials said they have
tightened screenings of passengers, baggage and planes. Airline
officials said all baggage arriving at the airport is being
X-rayed.
	   The threat of a bomb attack on the embassy Friday coincides with
a planned protest by a newly formed group of Filipino Muslims
called the Philippine Task Force Against U.S. Aggression.
	   Firdausi Abbas, a leader of the group, said it will demonstrate
in front of the embassy to condemn the U.S. missile attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan that followed the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies.
	   Abbas said the group will ask the U.N. Security Council to
investigate the U.S. attacks.
	   Following the African embassy attacks, U.S. President Clinton
ordered missile strikes on several sites in Sudan and Afghanistan
in what U.S. officials said was an attempt to weaken the terrorist
network of Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, suspected of plotting
the attacks.

Hong Kong shares closed lower as investors cashed in on recent
</HEADLINE>
gains &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares closed lower Thursday, as
investors sold to cash in on the market's recent gains.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue chips _
ended down 37.08 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 7,318.59.
	   Prior to the afternoon's sell-off, investors had been scrambling
to cover short positions, built up in the last two weeks as
government intervention in the market propped up the index.
	   They expected the market to fall when the government pulled out
this week, traders said.
	   Tightened regulations on short selling introduced this week
intensified short covering Wednesday afternoon and Thursday
morning.
	   Short-covering is the buying back of borrowed stock. An investor
who short-sells sells borrowed stock, hoping it will decline in
value before it is returned, allowing a profit to be made.
	   When short-covering slowed down, investors sold off shares
hoping to profit from the brief rise in share prices, traders said.
	   The Hong Kong government has come under fire for spending an
estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in foreign
reserves in a massive buying spree to deter speculators and
stabilize the market.
	   Traders say the government has generally stood by the wayside
this week.
	   Volume was thin as the Hong Kong government and speculators
``took a break after the fierce battle Friday,'' said Kenny Tang,
research manager at Tung Tai Securities Co.
	   Trading volume was worth billion 6.3 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 808 million), compared to 5.80 billion (U.S. dlrs 743
million) in the morning session.
	   Massive selling of HSBC Holdings _ the largest capitalized stock
in the Hang Seng index _ drove share prices down at the market's
close, said analyst Francis Lun of Pacific Challenge Securities
Ltd.
	   Among the losers were HSBC Holdings and Hong Kong Telecom, two
of the three companies which the stock exchange banned short
selling of their stocks on Wednesday.
	   HSBC Holdings shed 5.50 to close at 157.50 and Hong Kong Telecom
was down 0.25 to close at 13.90. HSBC affiliate Hang Seng Bank also
fell 0.10 to close at 43.70.
	   Cheung Kong Infrastructure, an arm of property conglomerate
Cheung Kong Holdings closed 1.50 Hong Kong dollars higher at 14.10.
Wharf Holdings gained 0.30 dollars to close at 7.90.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific gained 0.20 to close at
5.95.

Strong aftershock shakes China's northwest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong aftershock with a magnitude of 5.1 shook
a remote part of northwest China on Thursday, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties or damage, the State Seismological
Bureau said.
	   The shock in Jiashi, about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) west
of Beijing in the Xinjiang region, followed an earthquake with a
magnitude of 6.6 last Thursday that killed three people and injured
seven.
	   Jiashi has suffered three strong quakes in the past two years
that have killed 36 people. Nine earthquakes stronger than
magnitude 6 have hit the area since Jan. 21.

Interior Minister Chevenement suffers heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
was in a coma on Thursday after suffering a heart attack during
surgery, officials said.
	   The 59-year-old minister, in charge of the nation's police and
security forces, suffered the heart attack during a gall blader
operation on Wednesday.
	   The government announced that Jean-Jack Queyranne, France's
deputy minister for overseas territorial affairs, would temporarily
take over Chevenement's duties.
	   Chevenement did not appear ill before he was hospitalized, and
he held meetings on schedule Tuesday before entering the
Val-de-Grace military hospital. Originally, he was scheduled to
leave the hospital early next week.
	   Government officials said his heart attack appeared to be caused
by a reaction to an anaesthetic. There were no further details on
his condition.
	   Chevenement has held a number of other ministry portfolios
during his political career, including defense, industry,
education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

Rating company says deterioration of Philippine bank assets
</HEADLINE>
`alarming' &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS banking associaton comment in new 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The level of non-performing loans
held by Philippine banks is rising ``at an alarming rate'' as the
country's economy weakens, a credit rating agency said Thursday.
	   Standard and Poor's also lowered its ratings of nine Philippine
banks while maintaining those of five other institutions with
relatively large capitalization.
	   The weaker peso, which has fallen about 40 percent against the
dollar since July 1997, high interest rates and a slowdown in the
economy caused by the regional crisis and a severe drought have
combined to weaken the asset quality of the Philippine banking
system.
	   The credit rating agency said increased charges for bad and
doubtful debts and lower profitability will reduce the available
capital of Philippine banks.
	   The increased charges are due to rising problem loans and the
need to meet tighter regulatory standards imposed after the start
of the regional financial crisis.
	   Standard and Poor's noted that non-performing loans of
Philippine banks reached 10.1 percent of total outstanding loans at
the end of May, higher than the 5.3 percent posted at the end of
1997.
	   The banking system's loan growth in the four years to 1997 more
than trebled to 1.7 trillion pesos (dlrs 39.5 billion) from 552
billion pesos (dlrs 12.8 billion) in 1993. Standard and Poor's said
it expects the bad-loan ratio to ``easily exceed'' 20 percent in
1999.
	   The Bankers Association of the Philippines, however, said
Thursday it believes the level of non-performing loans will not
rise further in coming months because banks have restructured loans
and extended credit to ease the burden of debt repayments for
borrowers.
	   Past downgrades of Philippine banks by credit rating agencies
have hurt sentiment for listed banks on the Philippine Stock
Exchange. Thursday's downgrades were announced after the market
closed.
	   The government has emphasized that the Philippine banking system
is still in better shape than many of its harder-hit neighbors in
Asia.
	   The sector's bad-loan ratio averaged 10.2 percent between March
and August, according to the latest data. This compares with 18
percent for Malaysia, 25 percent for South Korea and 46 percent in
Indonesia in the same period.

Former tennis start accused of financial machination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Former tennis
star-turned-businessman Milan Srejber is suspected of abusing
inside information and illegally transfering money from a
privatization fund, which he administered to one of his companies,
officials said Thursday
	   Srejber, a former Top 30 player on the ATP tour, is being
investigated for using inside information to illegaly enrich his
Srejber Tennis Investing company by 14 million koruna (dlrs.
450,000) in the years 1995 and 1996, police investigator Zdenek
Pichlik said.
	   Srejber has denied the accusations, saying in an interview with
the public Czech TV Wednesday that he has ``never done any harm''
to any of the privtization funds he administers.
	   Pichlik refused to say what information Srejber has abused or
how he did it, as the matter is still under investigation. If
charged and convicted, Srejber could face up to 12 years in jail.
	   Last November, Srejber triggered Premier Vaclav Klaus' cabinet
to collapse when he admitted secretly donating 7.5 million koruna
(dlrs 220,000) to the ruling party, after acquiring a large stake
in a recently privatized steel concern.
	   Srejber hid his true identity behind the name of a Hungarian who
had been dead for 13 years, and a Mauritian who had never heard of
Klaus' party.

French president pledges support to Ukraine during visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac voiced his
strong support Thursday for Ukraine's efforts to reform its economy
and pledged to increase economic cooperation with the former Soviet
republic.
	   Chirac arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday on the first official
visit by a French president to the country.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma hailed the visit as being ``of
particular political importance'' to Ukraine.
	   ``We are happy to receive the head of the state that plays such
an important role in Europe,'' Kuchma said at a news conference
after meeting with Chirac.
	   Chirac told the same news conference: ``We are very similar
countries and we must develop economic ties. We want to
significantly increase French investment in Ukraine.''
	   Chirac was accompanied on his visit by officials from about a
dozen large French companies.
	   Ukraine, which is about the same size as France and has a
similar number of people, has until recently been shunned by French
investors who were wary about numerous bureaucratic hurdles.
	   For example, the French construction giant Lafarge has been
going through court battles since the spring to defend a stake in a
large Ukrainian cement plant it purchased.
	   Chirac said the Ukrainian government's recent economic reform
measures are bound to change the investment climate.
	   ``Ukraine has done a lot to win the trust of foreign
investors,'' he said. ``And we trust Ukraine, and believe in its
future.''
	   Of the more than dlrs 2 billion in foreign investment Ukraine
has received since independence in 1991, France accounted for dlrs
50 million, according to Ukrainian government statistics.
	   ``Unfortunately, our economic cooperation at present is far from
what it should be,'' Kuchma said. ``But the interest large French
companies are starting to express in Ukraine makes us feel
optimistic.''
	   The two sides signed four agreements on the peaceful use of
nuclear energy, nuclear safety and energy cooperation, and on
cooperation between the Ukrainian and French law enforcement
bodies.
	   The two presidents also discussed new efforts to help Ukraine
close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000, Kuchma said.
	   Ukraine has stressed repeatedly that it would not close the
plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, until it
receives financing to complete two new nuclear reactors.
	   Chirac said he and Kuchma agreed to ask Britain, the current
spokesman for the Group of Seven industrialized countries, to call
a special meeting to raise funds to build the reactors.
	   ``We agree absolutely that the reactors must be completed in
order to close Chernobyl by 2000,'' Chirac said.

Former bank chief indicted for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A county court indicted a former director
of one of Croatia's leading banks Thursday for his role in the
nation's biggest financial scandal.
	   Last March, Neven Barac, 66, was fired as the head of Dubrovacka
Banka and arrested following allegations of corruption and fraud.
The bank was the country's fifth-largest, before the discovery in
late February that it was wallowing in more than 1.5 billion kuna
(dlrs 238 million) of debt.
	   Barac stands accused of ``abusing his position and powers'' and
causing severe liquidity problems for the bank. The indictment also
charged the former banker of embezzling more than 70 million kuna _
about 11.2 million dollars _ with another suspect, Mirko Obrvan,
also indicted on Thursday.
	   The scandal seriously shook confidence in the nation's fledgling
banking sector and rattled the financial system.
	   Many details of the bank's two-year downfall remain secret, but
media reports have linked it to top political figures, laying bare
what most Croats consider a typical alliance between politicians
and business.
	   Barac maintains he is innocent and merely a scapegoat for ruling
officials. He enjoys the support of thousands of residents in
Dubrovnik, southern Croatia, where he is running as a candidate in
upcoming county elections October 11.
	   If elected, he will be unable to take his post as the
constitution bars suspected or convicted felons of campaigning and
holding office in government.
	   A trial date has yet to be set and a court decision on whether
Barac will be allowed to await trial outside prison is also
pending.

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's top China negotiator will visit
Beijing and Shanghai in mid-October for contacts that Taipei badly
hopes will steer long-stalled talks back on track.
	   Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation, said Thursday his primary goal will be to meet mainland
counterparts to discuss restoring the structure for negotiations
suspended three years ago.
	   ``Contacts need to be systematic to allow us to react to and
deal with events,'' Koo told a news conference.
	   ``We need to begin by establishing mutual trust, accepting
realities.''
	   Koo will visit Oct. 14-19, beginning in Beijing. China had also
offered Taiwan earlier dates, but the foundation asked for more
time for preparation, foundation officials said.
	   Taiwan hopes Koo's visit will produce an agreement paving the
way for a return to negotiations between the foundation and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits.
	   Koo said he would also raise the issue of a second round of
top-level negotiations with association Chairman Wang Daohan.
	   The sides had signed off on a meeting between the two men when
China severed talks in June 1995 in anger over a campaign by Taiwan
to assert itself internationally.
	   While Koo's trip will mark a watershed in contacts between the
sides, China has so far indicated it has low expectations for the
visit.
	   Beijing has snubbed Taiwanese calls for preliminary talks to
arrange an agenda for discussions between Koo and ARATS officials.
	   Hopes for Koo's trip dimmed further after an ARATS deputy
secretary general all but shunned SEF officials during a visit to
Taipei in July _ fueling speculation that China was trying to
sideline the foundation in favor of groups here more amenable to
its positions.
	   Koo again urged China to meet with SEF Secretary General Shi
Hwei-yow in mid-September to set the visit's agenda.
	   ``This is a matter of mutual respect. It is also an issue of the
value of (Koo's) meeting,'' Koo said.
	   The chairmen of the SEF and ARATS last met in 1993 in Singapore
for talks that marked the first formal contact between the sides
since the communists tossed Taiwan's ruling Nationalists out of
China in 1949.
	   China still considers Taiwan a breakaway province with no right
to international recognition on its own.
	   The sides agreed at the Singapore meeting to a framework for
negotiations on practical issues, including resolution of fishing
disputes and repatriation of Chinese hijackers.
	   But since talks were broken, China has demanded Taiwan give
tacit recognition of Beijing's sovereignty over the island, and
agree to discuss political issues related to reunification between
the sides.
	   Taiwan wants to avoid questions of sovereignty and pick up
negotiations where they left off.
	   Koo urged China to drop its rigid insistence on political talks,
saying all discussions would naturally touch on political issues in
one way or another.
	   Respecting the initial agreement signed in Singapore was crucial
for ensuring the credibility of future pacts the sides might broker
later, Koo said.

Asian markets turn mostly lower

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Thursday as
investors dumped regional stocks amid political and economic
uncertainty in Malaysia, where the reform-minded finance minister
was sacked.
	   The 0.5 percent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on
Wednesday also added to bearish sentiment in Asia, analysts said.
	   In Japan, share prices closed lower amid worries about
deteriorating Japanese corporate earnings, unstable global stock
markets and news that a steelmaker is looking to liquidate itself.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average was down 115.38
points, or 0.80 percent, to close at 14,261.24 points.
	   The much-watched Japanese currency also rose against the U.S.
dollar on concern over speculation that foreign funds were dumping
the dollar and on yen-bullish comments from Japanese officials.
	   The dollar was trading at 135.65 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market late Thursday, down 1.90 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo, and below its late New York level of 137.77 yen overnight.
	   The dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim, the market-friendly finance
minister, by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, hit
neighboring Singapore the hardest. Singapore's Straits Times Index
closed down 1.8 percent, or 18.48 points, to 313.07.
	   But in Malaysia, where Mahathir has often criticized speculators
who prey on open markets, share prices rallied as local retail
investors ignored the firing and instead gambled on a flood of easy
money.
	   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index rose
18.48 points, or 6.3 percent, to close at 313.07.
	   Dealers said that local buying spurred by new central bank
measures that were announced before trading began Thursday had
mitigated the political uncertainty. The measures will effectively
add liquidity to the financial system as well as make money
cheaper.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   TAIPEI: Wall Street's fall and margin calls pulled share prices
in Taiwan to a near two-year low. The Weighted Price Index slumped
3.4 percent to close at 6,251.38, its fourth biggest drop this
year.
	   HONG KONG: Shares closed lower as investors sold to cash in on
the market's recent gains. The Hang Seng Index ended down 37.08
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 7,318.59.
	   BANGKOK: Share prices ended down on continued concerns over the
economy. The SET index slipped 0.19 points, or .09 percent, to
close at 207.40
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher on news of government
liberalization of import duties for some basic commodities. The JSX
composite index was up 5.163 points, or 1.6 percent, to end at
334.788.
	   MANILA: Shares closed lower in line with the Wall Street fall
and a weaker peso. The PSE index was down 4.82 points, or 0.4
percent, to 1,192.95.
	   SEOUL: Shares were up on the back of an agreement by the
country's five largest conglomerates on economic reforms. The
benchmark KOSPI ended up 0.38 points, or 0.12 percent, to close at
314.78
	   SYDNEY: Share prices eased slightly, but selected issues were
well supported as investors cautiously made their return following
the recent volatility. The All Ordinaries index closed down 2.7
points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,513.3.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares closed lower, with brokers saying stocks
exposed to depressed world commodity prices helped push down the
local market. The NZSE-40 capital index closed at 1,775.67, down
26.87 or 1.5 percent.

Japan calls Cambodian elections fair, offers increased aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has called the recent elections in Cambodia
``free and fair'' and offered increased aid if political parties
there resolved a dispute over election results.
	   Cambodia's opposition parties have bitterly opposed the results
of the July election, which gave the ruling Cambodian People's
Party a slim majority in the National Assembly, Cambodia's
parliament.
	   In a statement Wednesday, Japan's Foreign Affairs Ministry urged
the parties to talk out there differences over the results and
quickly form a coalition government.
	   Japan will step up humanitarian and economic aid once a new
government is formed, the statement said.
	   ``Our country views this election as reflecting the opinion of
the Cambodian people and as having been carried out in a
sufficiently free and fair manner,'' it said.

Shell, Texaco plan European fuel alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giants Shell and Texaco said Thursday they
want to combine their European refining and retail operations in a
joint venture that will cut jobs and save money.
	   The companies signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding
on a deal that they believe would save dlrs 200 million per year in
a European refining and fuel market that long has been plagued by
overcapacity.
	   Shell and Texaco said they could offer few specifics about their
plans, which are not yet final.
	   They could not say, for example, how many of the 29,300 jobs in
their combined refining and marketing work forces will be
eliminated.
	   ``It's too early to say exactly how many and where those will
be,'' Shell spokesman Eric Nickson said.
	   It was also not immediately certain whether any refineries would
be closed as part of the venture, which the companies hope to
launch by mid 1999.
	   ``Those are issues that need to be discussed,'' Texaco spokesman
Paul Bray said.
	   Shell had recently said it might close its Haven refinery east
of London _ but Nickson said this was not part of the Texaco deal.
	   The alliance comes at a time when oil companies in Europe have
been fighting to raise profit margins in a heavily saturated fuel
market. Over the past few years, some major oil companies have
closed older, inefficient refineries in hopes of eliminating the
supply glut.
	   Shell and Texaco said they began discussing the joint venture
last year.
	   The companies said they will continue using both brand names on
service stations, although some of their 2,524 European retail
outlets may be closed as part of the deal.
	   The joint venture would be held 88 percent by Shell Europe Oil
Products and 12 percent by Texaco.

Linda McCartney's solo album to be released posthumously
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney wants to fulfill one of his
late wife's longtime dreams _ releasing her own record.
	   Linda McCartney had been working for the last 20 years on a
album, which she finished shortly before her death on April 17 from
breast cancer, according to the family's spokesman, Geoff Baker.
	   The album, called ``Wide Prairie,'' will be released worldwide
by early November, Baker said Thursday.
	   It includes 16 songs _ three cover versions and 13 originals
written by Mrs. McCartney. She sings lead vocals and her husband,
the former Beatle, plays a variety of instruments. The album also
features their son, James, 21, playing the guitar.
	   ``It is one of the things that Linda wanted to do and I think
she would have been very proud of it,'' Baker said.
	   Earlier this summer, in another bow to his wife's memory,
McCartney allowed her photographs of rock icons and family members
to be exhibited in his hometown of Liverpool. That exhibition ends
Sunday.

ASEAN countries agree on actions against forest fires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries have agreed
to take specific measures to stop forest fires that blanketed the
region with haze last year, officials said Thursday.
	   Malaysia is to take the lead in prevention, Singapore in
monitoring, and Indonesia in fire-fighting, said Effendy Sumardja,
Indonesia's assistant minister for environment.
	   Sumardja and other environment officials from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations participated in a regional workshop this
week on ways to combat forest fires, haze and pollution.
	   The workshop, which ended Wednesday, was sponsored by the
Manila-based Asian Development Bank.
	   Sumardja, chairman of the ASEAN haze technical task force, said
the United States has committed dlrs 4 million to fund the effort.
The U.N. Environment Program pledged dlrs 10 million; Australia,
dlrs 600,000; and Canada, dlrs 2.5 million.
	   According to a regional haze action plan, all ASEAN members are
to individually adopt measures to prevent, monitor and mitigate
forest fires.
	   The regional bloc is comprised of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
	   The measures will include setting up early warning systems,
aerial surveillance of areas most at risk of forest fires,
strengthening firefighting capability, detecting wildfires and
determining haze's effects on health.
	   Uncontrolled wildfires in Indonesia last year wiped out more
than 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest and sent smoke
over neighboring countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and the
Philippines.
	   The blazes were exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon,
which halted regional rains and led to the worst drought in half a
century in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines earlier
this year.
	   ``Nobody before could have imagined that a tropical forest could
be on fire,'' said Cheah Kong Wai of Malaysia. ``There are no
guarantees in what we are planning but we want to be prepared to
put them out as best we can.''
	   An ASEAN study of forest fires and haze events in the region
over the past two decades said that nearly all of them were caused
by ``direct human intervention.''
	   ``The economic cost of the fires has extended far beyond
destruction of large tracts of forest land,'' the study said.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A flotilla of coast guard and
fishing boats searching the sea early Thursday found only bodies
and debris floating in an oil slick at the site where a Swissair
jetliner went down off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. Geneva-bound Flight 111 had left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   Witnesses reported a wide area of ocean littered by debris from
the downed aircraft, including an oil slick and life preservers _
all illuminated by searchlights from coast guard cutters,
helicopters and overflying aircraft.
	   Canadian rescue official Dan Bedell said 18 bodies had been
recovered as dawn approached.
	   Sixteen of the dead were brought aboard a navy supply vessel,
HCMS Preserver, which was co-ordinating the operation. Fishermen in
small boats brought the two others to shore at Peggy's Cove.
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat. ``You could tell by some of the things
that floated by that it didn't look real good.''
	   Civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of the crash,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   The Geneva-New York route is regularly used by officials of the
United Nations and other international agencies based in Geneva _
the world body's European headquarters.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``we have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''
	   The three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 dumped fuel over nearby
St. Margaret's Bay before crashing, an airport worker said.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris from the aircraft was found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax and
the popular tourist destination of Peggy's Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Four rescue planes and four helicopters were in the area as well
as the navy supply ship, Tracy Simoneau said.
	   ``They are reporting that they have located debris, but they are
unsure if it's from the aircraft. They also report an oil slick and
a strong smell of oil. They have not found the fuselage,'' Simoneau
said.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday, said Inspector Anthony Infante of the
Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers yet.
	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Matt Furman said
the agency sent a 10-person team Canada from Washington, D.C, to
support the work of their Canadian counterparts.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and overhauled in August
and September last year. It had been checked, as all are, before
takeoff, he added.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Pastor Jim Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket,
said Thursday he has a special identification with the families of
people killed on Swissair flight SR111 from New York.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, N.Y., who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join some 100 counselors _ including
clergy and psychologists _ in consoling relatives and friends of
the 229 people who died in the crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   All major religions are represented, he said. ``Only a few are
Jews, but we have come for everyone.''
	   Longhurst, senior pastor of the interdenominational Crossroads
Church in suburban Ferney-Voltaire, next to the airport runway and
over the border in France, said he was available to talk to other
Americans or anyone else.
	   ``The first thing is to express how many people feel with
them,'' he said. ``I want them to feel the support and the
heartfelt care of all the people in Geneva.''
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking. There's shock
over the pain and devastation.''
	   He said he had spoken to a number of businessmen who feared they
had friends on the flight and to a woman whose scientist husband
will be on the same flight taking off from New York Thursday
evening.
	   ``It's a routine flight. It's a ferry with lots of people flying
in and out so everyone can feel it,'' Longhurst said.
	   He said he was ready to share Bible passages about death ``so
that they know that God is there and he doesn't abandon people. God
comes to people in death.''
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Tour of Spain riders hungry after France fiasco
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In cycling's biggest race since the Tour de
France was marred by a drug scandal, the Tour of Spain starts
Saturday with riders itching to make up for lost credibility.
	   Organizers and team officials say this year's Vuelta a Espana is
attracting a wealth of talent _ including top-rated Festina, which
was kicked out of the Tour de France after admitting to systematic
drug use _ in large part because of July's Tour de France fiasco.
	   Racing's premier event almost fell apart because of French
authorities' probes into use of performance-enhancing drugs by
riders.
	   After Festina's expulsion, six other teams quit out of disgust
with police tactics that included raids on riders' hotels. One leg
of the race was annulled when protesting cyclists held hands as
they crossed the finish line. Out of 189 who began the race, fewer
than 100 finished.
	   Four of the teams to drop out were Spanish _ Banesto, Vitalicio
Seguros, ONCE and KELME. Riding on home turf, they now have a
special stake in the three-week marathon that begins in the
southern city of Cordoba and ends September 27 in Madrid.
	   ``Because of the Tour de France, people are hungry,'' said a
senior official of one of the teams, who asked not to be named.
	   ``It is going to be a very competitive race,'' said another,
Javier Minguez, director of the Vitalicio Seguros team. Of the Tour
de France, he added: ``What happened, happened. It is an anecdote.
Now we focus on the Tour of Spain.''
	   The race gets underway with 198 riders from 22 teams.
	   The organization running it, Unipublic, said the nine riders
Festina has registered include the stars Alex Zuelle, Richard
Virenque, Laurent Dufaux and Laurent Brochard.
	   Zuelle and Dufaux have admitted that in the Tour de France they
used the banned substance EPO, which boosts the number of
oxygen-carrying red cells in blood.
	   Festina's new director, former Spanish cyclist Juan Fernandez,
told the newspaper Diario 16 he did not think the team was
stigmatized by its expulsion from the tour. But he suggested morale
was low.
	   ``I want to restore the spirit that was robbed from Festina by
the Tour,'' Fernandez said.
	   Measured in terms of riders' International Cycling Union rating
points _ some 37,000 _ this year's race is drawing much more talent
than those of the last two years in Spain, officials say.
	   However, big names will be missing. Tour de France winner Marco
Pantani of Italy and runner-up Jan Ullrich of Germany are sitting
this one out.
	   And with memories of the scandal still fresh, Spanish race
organizers are taking no chances. They scratched plans for the
riders to cross the border into France, saying they could not risk
disruptions like those that marred the Tour de France.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine police are investigating a
bomb threat at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, but believe there is
little cause for alarm, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
Thursday.
	   Police blocked off a lane of the boulevard which passes in front
of the seaside embassy and added more men to guard the area
following the threat.
	   Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Wednesday that a handwritten
note was found on a plane that arrived from Dubai warning of a bomb
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Manila on Friday.
	   Philippine diplomats said three Indian passengers are the
primary suspects, and that the Kuwaiti government is confident that
one of them was the author of the note.
	   Mercado said there was no immediate danger from the bomb threat
but did not elaborate.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada's spokesman, Fernando
Barican, said the government is ``taking all proper security
measures'' to ensure the safety of foreigners and Filipinos.
	   Police had previously tightened security at the embassy after
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Cars parked near the embassy are being randomly checked, two
police assault teams have been posted nearby, and patrol cars are
scouring the area, police said.
	   Security was also tightened at other U.S. facilities, including
the residence of U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said he has asked authorities
to also provide protection to the hundreds of applicants for U.S.
visas who line up outside the embassy each day.
	   Siazon said he also told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright recently of his concern over the embassy's location close
to the boulevard.
	   ``I told her I'm worried about their embassy because it's right
on the road,'' Siazon told reporters.
	   At Manila's international airport, officials said they have
tightened screenings of passengers, baggage and planes. Airline
officials said all baggage arriving at the airport is being
X-rayed.
	   The threat of a bomb attack on the embassy Friday coincides with
a planned protest by a newly formed group of Filipino Muslims
called the Philippine Task Force Against U.S. Aggression.
	   Firdausi Abbas, a leader of the group, said it will demonstrate
in front of the embassy to condemn the U.S. missile attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan that followed the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies.
	   Abbas said the group will ask the U.N. Security Council to
investigate the U.S. attacks.
	   Following the African embassy attacks, U.S. President Clinton
ordered missile strikes on several sites in Sudan and Afghanistan
in what U.S. officials said was an attempt to weaken the terrorist
network of Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, suspected of plotting
the attacks.

Police hunt Albanian kidnappers of British woman

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Police launched a manhunt Thursday for
two Albanian men accused of abducting and repeatedly raping a
British tourist near an archaeological site in northern Greece.
	   A third Albanian man, identified as Arian Kiku, 23, was arrested
Wednesday after the woman managed to escape and report the incident
to police, authorities said.
	   The woman, a 46-year old London resident employed by the British
Home Office, told police three Albanians abducted her Tuesday as
she walked to the ancient site of Aristotle's School near Naoussa,
a town about 78 kilometers (48 miles) west of Salonica.
	   She had reportedly arrived in Greece on Aug. 27 on vacation, and
intended to spend just two days in Naoussa.
	   She told authorities the men forced her into a nearby cave and
raped her repeatedly.
	   ``She is in a generally good condition,'' said Nikolas
Voutsinos, doctor in the Naoussa hospital where the woman was
treated Wednesday night. She was released from hospital Thursday
morning.
	   The woman told police the three men also allegedly stole her
bank card, beating her until she revealed her personal
identification number that would allow them to withdraw cash.
	   Two of the men left the cave, apparently to use the card, and
the woman managed to escape after Kiku, who was guarding her, fell
asleep, she told authorities.
	   Police arrested Kiku while he was still asleep. During
questioning, he identified the other two men as Ren Rina, 27, and
Regim Rina, 25, media reports said. It was not immediately clear
whether the two were related.
	   Kiku was scheduled to appear before a prosecutor to be formally
charged later Thursday.

Kurdish rebel commander dismisses lawyers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from testimony, ADDS details,

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish guerrilla commander told a
state security court Thursday that he was dismissing two of his
four lawyers to protect them from possible attacks.
	   Semdin Sakik, the No. 2 commander of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party, PKK, also denied responsibility for some of the
deadly assaults he has been accused of having ordered and said he
regretted joining the organization.
	   ``I was not captured fighting on the mountains. I abandoned my
arms and the PKK. If I had no regrets, I would not have left
them,'' Sakik told the court.
	   He denied a charge that he commanded a 1993 attack which killed
37 people, including 33 unarmed soldiers.
	   ``I only learned of the attack a week later,'' he said.
	   Sakik, who appeared before the court with his brother Arif, said
two of his lawyers were receiving death threats for taking on his
case. He said he was dismissing a third lawyer who failed to appear
in court Thursday but was keeping a fourth.
	   ``I am responsible for making so many children orphans. I said
to them, `I do not want your children to be left orphans,''' Sakik
told a panel of judges.
	   The brothers face charges of murder and Kurdish separatism. If
convicted, the could be sentenced to death. They were captured in
April by Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq where the two had sought
refuge after falling out with the PKK's leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
	   As well as his spoken testimony, the rebel leader submitted 48
pages detailing his rise to the position of commander as well as
attacks he had ordered.
	   Arif Sakik denied two of the charges against him, saying he had
no part in a murder case and in an attack on a boarding house for
teachers in southeastern Turkey.
	   The trial in Diyarbakir, the main city in southeastern Turkey
where the guerrilla war has raged, was adjourned to a later date.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have died in the war since 1984.

Indians enraged over Mandela's remarks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: The embargo on material in graf 5 has expired. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Seemingly innocuous remarks from South
African President Nelson Mandela have set off a storm in India,
known for prickliness in foreign affairs.
	   During his speech at the Nonaligned Movement summit Wednesday,
Mandela called for peaceful negotiations to resolve the dispute
between India and Pakistan over the divided Himalayan region of
Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan, both Nonaligned members, have fought two
wars over Kashmir. Its status is seen as the crux of the rivalry
that led both to test nuclear weapons in May.
	   ``All of us ... should be willing to lend all the strength we
have to'' resolving the Kashmir dispute, Mandela said in the port
city of Durban.
	   United News of India reported Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee personally protested to Mandela during a state banquet
Wednesday night and would add in his own speech in Durban on
Thursday that the Nonaligned summit ``is not the place to air the
differences in some of our positions.''
	   Farouk Abdullah, the top elected official in Indian-held
Kashmir, told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday that Mandela was
meddling in an ``integral part of India.''
	   ``Mandela is no one to decide our fate,'' Abdullah said.
	   In India, Mandela's words were taken as an offer of mediation.
Pakistan, fearing itself at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with
its much larger and more powerful neighbor, has called repeatedly
for outside help. India fiercely resists the idea.
	   The Hindustan Times, a national Indian daily, said in a
front-page story Thursday that Mandela took a ``clearly unfriendly
stance'' toward India. Other newspapers said India had been
snubbed, embarrassed and set back.
	   India's reaction to the overture from Mandela, revered around
the world as a statesman, was reminiscent of the response in 1993
when the White House wrote back to the head of a Kashmiri
secessionist group: ``I look forward to working with you and others
to help bring peace to Kashmir.''
	   Indians were shocked that President Bill Clinton would propose
to ``work with'' separatists. U.S. officials responded that the
note was written by a White House aide unfamiliar with South Asian
politics.

IMF, World Bank team due in Pakistan to review ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A global banking team is expected in
Pakistan next week to review an economic crisis brought on by the
nation's dlrs 32 billion foreign debt, a desperate foreign currency
shortage and international sanctions, an IMF official said
Thursday.
	   The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, and World Bank team was
to discuss economic policy with the government as part of
considering credits and loans to the troubled nation, Ahsan Mansur,
the IMF's resident director in Pakistan said.
	   ``We hope (the team) will arrive, latest, by the second week of
September,'' Mansur told The Associated Press.
	   The already hard-pressed economy of this country of more than
130 million people was shaken further by economic sanctions imposed
by the United States, Japan and other economic powers in response
to Pakistan conducting a series of nuclear tests in May.
	   The third phase of a dlrs 1.56 billion IMF credit package was
stalled by the sanctions, although the United States last month
said it would not block the credits, seen as essential for
preventing an even deeper slide in the Pakistani economy.
	   Mansur, of the IMF, said it was not clear whether the team would
discuss resumption of the old package, or possibly a new one.
	   Economic analysts say the IMF loan, negotiated last October, was
vital because the country's foreign exchange reserves have plunged
to roughly dlrs 600 million _ barely enough to cover a few weeks of
imports. They said Pakistan needs an immediate bailout package to
stabilize economy.

Suharto associate says he'll pay back central bank money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES figure of bank's lending in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A former trade minister and longtime
associate of former President Suharto testified Thursday that he
used central bank funds to finance part of a paper-making company
he owns.
	   The admission by Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan came as government
prosecutors investigate widespread allegations of corruption by
Suharto's clan and associates during his 32 years in power.
	   The autocratic Suharto quit in May after riots and student
protests. His successor and onetime protege, B.J. Habibie, has
pledged to curb graft and push through democratic reforms.
	   Hasan, a golfing buddy of Suharto, testified at the attorney
general's office that he used Bank Indonesia funds to finance part
of his paper industry, PT Kiani Kertas.
	   ``God willing, I will repay all the money,'' Hasan said after
the six-hour interrogation.
	   He said he would willingly hand over his wealth if the assets of
his closed bank, Bank Umum Nasional, aren't sufficient to cover the
liquidity assistance that it received from Bank Indonesia.
	   Part of that assistance was used to finance a pulp project,
which will yield some dlrs 10 million a month, Hasan said.
	   Hasan, along with other tycoons who head closed or nationalized
banks, has to repay the liquidity assistance to the government by
Sept. 21 or risk having other assets seized by the government. The
bank received 9.2 trillion rupiahs (dlrs 844.03 million) in central
bank assistance.
	   Amir Sjamsudin, Bob Hasan's lawyer, said his client was
questioned about whether he can return the central bank's
liquidity.
	   ``We were just negotiating the deal (to return the funds),'' the
lawyer said.
	   Hasan's bank was one of three troubled banks closed by the
Indonesian government on Aug. 21 as part of reforms to the banking
system required by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF is leading a multibillion-dollar aid package for
Indonesia, which is enduring the worst economic turmoil since the
1960s.
	   Finance minister Bambang Subianto said some 70 percent of funds
pumped into Hasan's bank went to the shareholders or their
affiliates.
	   Earlier this week, the government said evidence indicates
charities set up and controlled by Suharto misused their funds.
Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by the Suharto family.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of
Public Health and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was
among the 229 people killed in the crash of Swissair flight SR111,
a spokesman for the World Health Organization said.
	   Mann, the outspoken head of the U.N. Global Program on AIDS
during the 1980s, resigned in 1990 following a bitter disagreement
with Hiroshi Nakajima, then WHO director-general
	   Richard Leclair, WHO spokesman, said he had just received a memo
from Peter Piot, head of the successor UNAIDS, the joint U.N.
program to combat the disease.
	   Piot said he had confirmed that Mann and his wife, Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann, were among the victims. Swissair officials have said
all aboard the MD-11 jetliner were killed in the crash off Nova
Scotia on Wednesday evening.
	   WHO was holding a memorial observance Thursday afternoon,

Stoichkov to lead Bulgaria in first Euro qualifier against Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Soccer star Hristo Stoichkov will lead
Bulgaria against Poland Sunday in Burgas in their opening qualifier
for the European Championship in 2000.
	   The two teams are in Group 5, together with England, Sweden and
Luxembourg.
	   After several successful seasons with Barcelona, Stoichkov
signed with Kashiva Reysol from the Japanese J-league after the
World Cup.
	   Stoichkov, Daniel Borimirov and Ivailo Yordanov are the only
players left from the team that reached the semifinals at World Cup
1994, but performed poorly at the last World Cup in France, where
it failed to get past the first round.
	   ``I decided to invite these three `old' players because the team
needs somebody to lead the youngsters,'' said coach Hristo Bonev.
	   After the fiasco in France, Bonev first said he was quitting,

AIDS-fighting pioneer among victims of Swissair crash, WHO says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of
Public Health and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was
among the 229 people killed in the crash of Swissair flight SR111,
a spokesman for the World Health Organization said.
	   Mann, the outspoken head of the U.N. Global Program on AIDS
during the 1980s, resigned in 1990 following a bitter disagreement
with Hiroshi Nakajima, then WHO director-general
	   Richard Leclair, WHO spokesman, said he had just received a memo
from Peter Piot, head of the successor UNAIDS, the joint U.N.
program to combat the disease.
	   Piot said he had confirmed that Mann and his wife, Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann, were among the victims. Swissair officials have said
all aboard the MD-11 jetliner were killed in the crash off Nova
Scotia on Wednesday evening.
	   WHO was holding a memorial observance Thursday afternoon,
Leclair said.
	   A number of current U.N. officials were also believed aboard the
flight.
	   The organization's European headquarters issued a statement
offering its condolences to the victims' relatives and the Swiss
government.
	   It said all U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at half-staff
Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N. staff on board.

Parliament commission sheds doubt on mining company's benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A parliament commission said Thursday
that PT Freeport Indonesia which operates a huge gold and copper
mine in Indonesia's western New Guinea, has not proved enough of a
benefit to the local people.
	   A study by the group, following a visit to the remote region
last month, recommended that the government should study whether it
was worth having the company in the country.
	   It accused the U.S.-Indonesian joint venture of exploiting the
gold and copper resources of the country for 25 years but leaving
the people around the area poor.
	   The commission said people were dissatisfied and want some type
of profit-sharing in the giant mining company.
	   A study in 1996, by Labat and Anderson, an international
auditor, found that Freeport was not responsive to the social needs
of neighboring tribes in the remote Indonesian province of Irian
Jaya.
	   In March the same year, rioting by tribes people in Timika and
the mining town of Tembagapura, killed three people. The rioters
were demanding more economic benefits and job opportunities from
the mine.
	   It said Freeport has met ``both the letter and spirit of
Indonesian law'' concerning local people's land rights, but it
should do more to understand and work with the local indigenous
leaders because of their markedly different cultures.
	   Freeport has spent dlrs 100 million in the last seven years on
community development and social programs and contributes hundreds
of millions of dollars annually in taxes and royalties to the
government of Indonesia, the report said.
	   Freeport Indonesia, which began operation in the 1960s, is a
joint venture company, whose 81.28 percent share is controlled by
the New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   The Indonesian government owns 9.36 percent, while a minority
stake in the company controlled by a charitable foundation headed
by former President Suharto.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The scene is being played out daily: Anxious
customers try to withdraw their money from bank branches or teller
machines, a process that often takes hours, and sometimes ends in
failure.
	   Most Russians do eventually get their money, but more serious
problems could be in store for bank customers as Russia's Central
Bank moves to restructure commercial banks amid the nation's
financial turmoil.
	   The situation is even worse for bank workers. Russia's Interfax
news agency quoted top Moscow employment agencies Thursday as
estimating that tens of thousands of employees of banks and
financial and investment companies will be laid off in the next two
months.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Basking in a warm welcome and
hailed as a peacemaker, President Bill Clinton urged Catholics and
Protestants to pull together with ``courage and reconciliation'' to
build a new Northern Ireland. ``America will continue to walk the
road of renewal with you,'' he declared.
	   Speaking to the 108-member assembly that will make fateful
decisions, Clinton said the line between peace and those who would
destroy it was being erased. ``So much more unites you than divides
you,'' Clinton said to an assemblage that gave him a standing
ovation.
	   ``The American people know from our own experience about bigotry
and violence,'' Clinton said, ``We know we are wiser, stronger and
happier when we stand on common ground and we know you will be
too.''

	   PEGGYS COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A flotilla of coast guard and
fishing boats searching the sea early Thursday found only bodies
and debris floating in an oil slick at the site where a Swissair
jetliner went down off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. Geneva-bound Flight 111 had left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat. ``You could tell by some of the things
that floated by that it didn't look real good.''
	   Canadian rescue official Dan Bedell said 18 bodies had been
recovered as dawn approached.
	   Maj. Michel Brisebois of the rescue center said rough weather
was working against searchers off the scenic fishing village of
Peggys Cove. Emergency headquarters was set up in a restaurant
overlooking the community's picturesque lighthouse.
	   Sixteen of the dead were brought aboard a navy supply vessel,
HCMS Preserver, which was co-ordinating the operation. Fishermen in
small boats brought the two others to shore at Peggy's Cove.
	   Civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of the crash,
Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   The Geneva-New York route is regularly used by officials of the
United Nations and other international agencies based in Geneva _
the world body's European headquarters.
	   Those aboard included Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard
School of Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, a
spokesman for the World Health Organization said in Geneva.
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``we have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''
	   The three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 dumped fuel over nearby
St. Margaret's Bay before crashing, an airport worker said.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Debris from the aircraft was found off Clam Island between
Blandford, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Halifax and
the popular tourist destination of Peggys Cove, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Four rescue planes and four helicopters were in the area as well
as the navy supply ship, Tracy Simoneau said. They have not found
the fuselage, she said.
	   U.S. government officials were going over the flight manifest
with Swissair and Delta officials and notifying the families of
passengers early Thursday, said Inspector Anthony Infante of the
Port Authority Police Department. The Port Authority manages
Kennedy airport.
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the

	   A lounge was set up in the Delta Terminal, where Red Cross
people were on hand to help families deal with the situation.
	   In Geneva, a crisis center was set up at the airport for
victims' relatives.
	   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Matt Furman said
the agency sent a 10-person team Canada from Washington, D.C, to
support the work of their Canadian counterparts.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and overhauled in August
and September last year. It had been checked, as all are, before
takeoff, he added.

AIDS-fighting pioneer among victims of Swissair crash, WHO says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of
Public Health and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was
among the 229 people killed in the crash of Swissair flight SR111,
a spokesman for the World Health Organization said.
	   Mann, the outspoken head of the U.N. Global Program on AIDS
during the 1980s, resigned in 1990 following a bitter disagreement
with Hiroshi Nakajima, then WHO director-general
	   Richard Leclair, WHO spokesman, said he had just received a memo
from Peter Piot, head of the successor UNAIDS, the joint U.N.
program to combat the disease.
	   Piot said he had confirmed that Mann and his wife, Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann, were among the victims. Swissair officials have said
all aboard the MD-11 jetliner were killed in the crash off Nova
Scotia on Wednesday evening.
	   WHO was holding a memorial observance Thursday afternoon,
Leclair said.
	   A number of current U.N. officials were also believed aboard the
flight.
	   The organization's European headquarters issued a statement
offering its condolences to the victims' relatives and the Swiss
government.
	   It said all U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at half-staff
Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N. staff on board.

Russian currency sinks; Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday as
Boris Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament headed for a showdown
vote over the president's candidate to lead a new government.
	   Amid the political wrangling, Russia's financial crisis went
from bad to worse Thursday, a day after the government acknowledged
it was powerless to stop the collapse of the Russian ruble.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 13.5 rubles to the dollar (7.4
cents for each ruble), but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to
the dollar (5.7 cents).
	   At currency exchange booths in central Moscow, operators lowered
the ruble rate on their billboards several times Thursday in an
effort to keep up with the crashing currency. Just last month, the
ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents each) before it
began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians
not to panic and to leave their money in banks, where he assured
them it would be safe. But the plummeting currency was certain to
make depositors nervous and increase demand for dollars and other
foreign currencies.
	   ``You have about three weeks to assess the situation and take a
correct decision,'' he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting.
	   There have been lines at some banks and currency exchange booths
in recent days, but there has not been any unrest in the streets.
	   Meanwhile, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated that his
party will vote against Chernomyrdin when parliament holds a second
round of voting Friday on the prime minister's post.
	   Communists and their allies blame President Boris Yeltsin's
government for landing Russia in the current economic mess, and
Chernomyrdin was overwhelmingly rejected Monday in a first round of
voting.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 and named Chernomyrdin
acting premier.
	   The political turmoil has left the interim government unable to
devote its attention to the mounting economic crisis. Most of the
debate has been focused on forming the new government instead of
solving the economic problems.
	   With Chernomyrdin facing an uphill battle to win confirmation on
Friday, some lawmakers have called on him to withdraw in favor of a
compromise candidate.
	   The horse-trading continued Thursday, with Yeltsin's spokesman
saying the president had proposed some changes to a political
agreement all sides had reached over the weekend before the
Communists tore it up.
	   The agreement would have given the Duma more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy, but left Yeltsin with
substantial power. The opposition had been demanding the agreement
in exchange for confirming Chernomyrdin.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the revised
deal would be sent to the Duma later Thursday. No details were
released, but the presidential press service said the new proposal
contained mostly ``minor adjustments.''
	   Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin rejected lawmakers' suggestions that he
was using the prime minister's job as a springboard to a
presidential bid in 2000 _ even though he is widely considered to
be a leading contender.
	   ``I would like to see the nut who would call this a good
starting point for presidential elections,'' he told the Interfax
news agency.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to dissolve the
parliament.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said his 50-member
faction, third largest in the Duma, would support Chernomyrdin
after having abstained from the first vote.
	   Zhirinovsky said he had no faith in Chernomyrdin as a leader,
but at least he was a known quantity, and rejecting him could lead
to greater political turmoil.
	   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Of course we have pity for the 200
victims, but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''
	   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said the Duma could be ready to
debate an impeachment motion against Yeltsin next week. The motion,
like previous attempts, stands little chance of passing, given the
president's strong constitutional powers.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The Central Bank said its
gold foreign currency reserves fell by dlrs 700 million in the last
week of August to dlrs 12.7 billion. The bank has spent billions in
recent months in a futile effort to prop up the ruble.

Claydon's first win pushes him into top 20
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ England's Russell Claydon,
nicknamed the ``Bridesmaid'' after a series of runners-up finishes,
moved into the top 20 on the European Tour after winning the BMW
International Open at Munich last Sunday.
	   Claydon, with seven second-place finishes in his 10-year career,
won the 850,000 pound (dlrs 1.39 million) event by one stroke at
18-under 270 to claim the 140,366 pound (dlrs 230,200) first prize
and move into 18th spot on the tour with dlrs 344,057.
	   The top eight places on the European Tour money list remained
unchanged after the BMW International, with England's Lee Westwood
still leading from Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke and Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie.
	   Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez moved into No. 9 position from No.
11 after the BMW Open, pushing Australia's Stephen Leaney into No.
10 spot and Phillip Price out of the top ten.
	   Westwood leads the tour with 590,385 pounds (dlrs 970,593), from
Clarke with 547,777 pounds (dlrs 898,354) and Montgomerie with
442,057 pounds (dlrs 724,973).
	   Denmark's Thomas Bjorn still holds No. 4 spot with 413,624
pounds (dlrs 678,343) and South Africa's Ernie Els retains No. 5
with 386,759 (dlrs 635,832).

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Some 1,300 Somali militiamen have
disarmed in Mogadishu and are being trained as policemen, their
commander said Thursday.
	   The disarming is under the auspices of faction leaders Hussein
Aidid, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, said Col. Abdi
Hassan Awaleh Qeybdid.
	   Also Thursday, Hussein Ali Ahmed, Mogadishu's governor, arrived
to a tumultuous welcome and promised the town's clean-up as his
priority. Ahmed was in London when he was named governor.
	   In July, the former rivals from north and south Mogadishu agreed
to set up the first inclusive administration in the war-torn
capital since Somalia's central government was overthrown more than
seven years ago.
	   Qeybdid said the militiamen will be paid 300,000 shillings (dlrs
30) while in training for three months and 800,000 shillings (dlrs
100) a month as policemen.
	   Plans are under way to train an additional 800 militiamen and
900 former police officers, Qeybdid said.
	   He said Somali businessmen have contributed the money to pay for
the new force.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefdoms protected by clan militias.
	   -----
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Five senior officials from the former
rebel group UNITA said they were breaking away from the movement's
leadership and setting up a rival hierarchy in the capital.
	   Jorge Valentim, Minister for Tourism in the government of
national unity and reconciliation, announced late Wednesday that he
and four other UNITA-appointed deputy ministers would no longer
follow UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who lives in the group's central
highland stronghold Andulo.
	   Valentim accused Savimbi of failing to honor UNITA's
undertakings in the 1994 peace pact with the ruling MPLA that ended
two decades of civil war. Savimbi is ``an obstacle to peace,'' he
said.
	   UNITA secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato rejected the move,
saying the Andulo-based leadership would continue its work.
	   The United Nations has blamed UNITA for the delay in
implementing the peace accord which is running more than a year
behind schedule.
	   -----
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The president's office
said parliamentary elections have been scheduled for Nov. 8 in this
Atlantic archipelago off the West African coast.
	   The elections, announced Wednesday, are the third since the
country adopted a multiparty system and held its first democratic
ballot in 1991.
	   The former Portuguese colony has had a coalition government
since 1995, when disenchanted soldiers dismissed the democratically
elected parliament in a coup. The instalation of a coalition
government was part of the negotiated solution to the coup.
	   The troops also imprisoned President Miguel Trovoada who had
been elected in 1991 and was returned to office in a ballot a month
before the coup occurred. Presidential elections are due in the
fall of 1999.
	   During Trovoada's two-term mandate, the agriculture-based
economy has slumped in this twin-island nation, located about 200
kilometers (125 miles) off the West coast of Gabon.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela will pay
a state visit to Mauritius Sept. 10-12, before the two-day Southern
African Development Community summit there, the department of
foreign affairs said on Thursday.
	   During the visit he will sign agreements on sport and arts, and
a declaration of intent on science and technology co-operation.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Parliament of Lesotho is
considering a motion demanding the return of land by South Africa
to the tiny mountain kingdom, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The British and Boers in the 19th century seized the land in
what is now the Free State.
	   The proposal in Parliament did not specify how much land was
involved, Business Day reported.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The parliamentary commission working
on a new draft of the Mozambican constitution is proposing that,
for the first time, dual nationality should be permitted.
	   This is a radical change in the attitude of the ruling Frelimo
Party towards Mozambican nationality, which has previously been
regarded in a quasi-reverential manner.
	   The 1990 constitution states that any citizen who voluntarily
acquires a foreign nationality, automatically loses his or her
Mozambican one.
	   The chairman of the parliamentary ad-hoc commission on the
constitution, Hermenegildo Gamito, was quoted by the Maputo daily
paper Noticias as saying the move took into consideration the fact
that Mozambican emigrants living abroad may wish to acquire other
nationalities without losing their Mozambican citizenship.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Seven people were killed when a gasoline
tanker exploded as it was pumping fuel into a gas station's storage
tank, the Lagos Daily Times reported Thursday.
	   The explosion happened Tuesday in the northern city of Minna
when gasoline leaking from the tanker was set ablaze by sparks from
a nearby tea stand.
	   The entire station was destroyed in the explosion, killing the
seven people and injuring 18 more, many of them with severe burns,
the newspaper said.
	   --
	   LAGOS Nigeria (AP) _ The minimum monthly wage for federal civil
servants was to increase by more than 600 percent, according to a
government directive.
	   Effective Sept. 1, the minimum monthly wage was to go from dlrs
9 to dlrs 61, according to a circular sent to bureaucrats from the
office of Nigeria's military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Nigeria has some 800,000 federal civil servants, though it was
not immediately clear how many receive the minimum wage and whether
people making more than the minimum wage would also get pay raise.
	   Salaries for Nigeria's 4.2 million state civil servants will be
negotiated state-by-state, the statement said.
	   Workers in the capital Abuja hailed the news with jubilation,
gathering in groups to shout and sing after the news broke, the
Lagos-based Vanguard newspaper reported Thursday.
	   For years, Nigerian civil servants have had to live on abysmal
salaries in an economy which had crumbled under years of corruption
and mismanagement.
	   One of Abubakar's first promises after coming to power in June
was to review salaries for civil servants and soldiers.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Forty-four Eritreans forced to flee
Ethiopia to neighboring Kenya were flown home by their government
Thursday, an Eritrean Embassy official said.
	   Most of the 29 men and 15 women had camped at Nairobi's Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport's transit lounge since Aug. 27, said
First Secretary Kidane Woldeyesus.
	   ``Although they have Ethiopian passports, they are Eritreans and
we have no option other than to take them home,'' Woldeyesus said.
	   He said some of whom have never been to Eritrea, but left
Ethiopia due to official harassment.
	   ``We understand Kenyan authorities did not want to let them in
the country,'' Woldeyesus said. ``We have no problem with that.''
	   Eritrea has been accusing Ethiopia of expelling its citizens
since hostilities began in May over borders set by Italian
colonizers in the early 20th century.
	   Brief battles erupted after Eritreans moved into areas claimed
by Ethiopia. Both sides bombed each other over the weekend of June
5-7, causing at least 100 casualties on the Ethiopian side.

	   Shortly after Air Force One touched down in this storied
province, Clinton went into private meetings with one-time foes now
enmeshed in creating a new government under the terms of an accord
he helped broker last April.
	   ``What can I do to help?'' Clinton asked in opening a briefing
on the shaky peace accord with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and the two appointed leaders of Northern Ireland's embryonic
government, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.
	   The most emotional part of the day promised to be his meetings
with victims of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, most
recently in Omagh where a bombing killed 28 people and wounded more
than 330 on Aug. 15.
	   ``The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the troubles; it
was the opening shot of a vicious attack on the peace. The question
is not whether there will be more bombs and atempts to undo with
violence the verdict of the ballot box. There well may be,'' he
told assembly members.
	   But optimism was the day's overarching theme. Earlier, Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, showed off the day's
headline in the Independent, announcing that Trimble, the Ulster
Unionist leader, had agreed to meet with Adams, whose Sinn Fein
group is allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Berger called it a breakthrough. ``This is the headline we
wanted to see when we got here,'' he enthused to reporters.

Pilots warn of danger of proposed new airport in the sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch pilots warned the government
Thursday that plans to build a new airport on a manmade island in
the North Sea would create difficult conditions for aircraft
landing there.
	   The Dutch government is currently exploring ways of easing the
pressure on Amsterdam's busy Schiphol Airport, and a new runway and
terminal in the North Sea are among the options under serious
consideration.
	   But in a press statement, the Association of Dutch Pilots said
that weather conditions over the North Sea would create tricky
conditions for pilots landing on an island.
	   ``Mist and low-hanging clouds _ extremely undesirable for
landing aircraft _ are particularly difficult to predict on the
North Sea,'' the association warned.
	   ``Wind is also much more powerful over the sea than on land,
pushing it over the limit sooner. Flying in bad conditions on the
limit is not dangerous but should be avoided as much as possible,''
the statement said.
	   The association, which represents the majority of Dutch civil
pilots, urged Cabinet ministers to put security at the top of their
list of considerations when reaching a decision on a new airport.
	   Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest air hubs, is fast approaching
government-set noise pollution levels. The Dutch government hopes
to make a decision by the end of this year on the location of a new
airport to ease the load.

Croats weakened but confident of good start to Euro 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia left Thursday for its opening
Euro 2000 qualifier against Ireland without top World Cup striker
Davor Suker and several other stars.
	   Despite the absence of Suker, the Croatian team still feels
buoyed by its stunning success at the World Cup, where it finished
third.
	   ``I'm sure that whoever runs out onto the pitch on Saturday will
give their best for a good start of this new qualifying cycle,''
said coach Miroslav Blazevic before the team's trip to Dublin.
	   The team will have to make do without five regular stars _
Suker, forwards Alen Boksic and Goran Vlaovic and defender Slaven
Bilic _ who are out with injuries.
	   Erratic midfielder Robert Prosinecki, who has had a history of
bad blood with coach Blazevic, has refused to line up for the
national side after a new series of squabbles.
	   But Blazevic, who guided Croatia to the quarterfinals of the
last European Championship in England in 1996 and to third place at
the World Cup in France this year, had no time to delve on the
setbacks.
	   ``Our short preparations are over and the form of those
available is encouraging,'' Blazevic said. ``I have no complaints
and that's the main thing.''
	   The optimism rubbed onto the players too.
	   ``The Irish will run like mad and fight to the bone,'' said Igor
Pamic of Hansa Rostock in Germany's Bundesliga, who was called in
to fill in for the absentees in the attack. ``But it goes without
saying, so will we.''

EU pledges support for Russia, but little money
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union pledged political
support but little else Monday for Russia, caught up in a growing
economic crisis.
	   ``The international community must express its solidarity with
the Russian people, who are at risk of becoming the victims of the
situation,'' Jacques Santer, head of the EU Commission, told a news
conference.
	   Pouring funds into Russia, however, will only make sense once
Russia has tackled its structural problems, he said.
	   Hans Van den Broek, the EU's commissioner for foreign affairs,
added that Russia must put its political house in order before the
EU can consider extra funding.
	   ``Anything we would discuss on giving assistance to Russia
cannot yield any results unless the political problems are
addressed,'' Van den Broek said.
	   ``If such a potentially rich country runs into such financial
and economic disarray then there is something political that is
fundamentally wrong,'' he said.
	   He acknowledged the ``terrific tension'' in the current
stand-off between the Russian parliament, and President Boris
Yeltsin, but added, ``this is something the international community
cannot solve for Russia.''
	   On Monday the lower house of Russian parliament, the Duma,
overwhelmingly rejected President Boris Yeltsin's appointment of
Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister after firing Sergei Kiriyenko
earlier this month.
	   The Duma, mainly composed of Communists and their allies who
blame Yeltsin's government for Russia's economic woes, plans a
second round of voting on Friday.
	   Both Van den Broek and Santer said the impact of the crisis on
the 15-nation EU would be limited.
	   ``All the economic fundamentals of Europe are sound and stable.
There is no cause to question the future economic developments in
the EU,'' Santer said.
	   He noted that trade with Russia represents only 3.5 percent of
the EU's total exports, and 4 percent of its imports.
	   Also, the impact on European banks should be limited, although
they are more involved in Russia than U.S. banks, he said.
	   Van den Broek predicted the impact of the crisis on the
economies of central and eastern European countries will also be
minimal, mainly because they have reoriented their trade toward the
EU, and away from Russia.
	   ``The basic fundamentals of those economies, that can be largely
considered as market economies, are sound,'' Van den Broek said.
``There is no reason for foreign investors to diminish their
interest in those economies.''
	   Earlier this week Van den Broek's spokeswoman Lousewies van der
Laan said the EU would not spend large amounts of funds to help
Russia but rather develop legal and technical assistance for the
country.
	   She said funds will probably be spent more on sending experts to
the region, and less on projects where it's more difficult to
control where the money goes.

Arafat discusses peace process with Clinton

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Thursday said he had discussed the faltering Middle East peace
process in a phone call with United States President Bill Clinton.
	   Speaking at a news conference at the 12th summit of the
Nonaligned Movement, Arafat said he had spoken to Clinton on
Wednesday about an American plan accepted by Palestinians but not
yet by the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Arafat did not provide details of the conversation.
	   The U.S. offered a proposal in January for an Israeli withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian
security gestures.
	   ``We spoke frankly about the peace process and the American
initiative and how to protect the peace process,'' he said,
accusing Netanyahu of trying to prevent the success of peace talks.
	   In negotiations with Israel, Arafat hopes to gain a state on the
West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem. If bargaining does not
achieve his goal, the Palestinian leader has said he would declare
statehood unilaterally next year.
	   Asked if the 113-member Nonaligned Movement of developing
countries would recognize his government if it declared itself a
full-fledged nation, Arafat said he was certain of its support.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday as
Boris Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament headed for a showdown
vote over the president's candidate to lead a new government.
	   Amid the political wrangling, Russia's financial crisis went
from bad to worse Thursday, a day after the government acknowledged
it was powerless to stop the collapse of the Russian ruble.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 13.5 rubles to the dollar (7.4
cents for each ruble), but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to
the dollar (5.7 cents).
	   At currency exchange booths in central Moscow, operators lowered
the ruble rate on their billboards several times Thursday in an
effort to keep up with the crashing currency. Just last month, the
ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents each) before it
began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians
not to panic and to leave their money in banks, where he assured
them it would be safe. But the plummeting currency was certain to
make depositors nervous and increase demand for dollars and other
foreign currencies.
	   ``You have about three weeks to assess the situation and take a
correct decision,'' he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting.
	   There have been lines at some banks and currency exchange booths
in recent days, but there has not been any unrest in the streets.
The Defense Ministry denied rumors that troops had been ordered in
to Moscow.

Hong Kong chief executive: Currency link won't go
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on Thursday
reaffirmed his commitment to maintain the territory's currency link
to the U.S. dollar, and appealed for U.S. leadership to help Asia
out of its financial turmoil.
	   Tung spoke during an hourlong conversation with current and
former members of the Board of Directors of The Associated Press
and senior AP news executives, led by Chairman of the Board Donald
E. Newhouse and Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive
officer of the AP.
	   Tung touched on many topics, including the government's recent
controversial intervention in the financial markets, the
territory's economic health, democracy and human rights.
	   The former shipping tycoon painted a gloomy economic picture of
Hong Kong, which is struggling in its first recession in 13 years.
	   He said unemployment, already at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent,
will rise further. The economy, having shrunk 5 percent in the
second quarter, will be lean next year, too, he said.
	   But Tung reiterated the government has ``no plans whatsover to
delink our currency from the U.S. dollar.''
	   ``We have the need to keep the link, we have the means to keep
the link, and we will keep the link,'' he said. ``It is in our
fundamental interest to do so.''
	   Hong Kong's 14-year currency link to the U.S. dollar, which
speculators seem determined to break, has been a major focus in the
14-month Asian financial crisis.
	   Many fear that doing away with the link would set off a fresh _
and more potent _ round of regional currency devaluations
	   The Hong Kong dollar is the only convertible Asian currency not
to have devalued. Other regional currencies have lost up to 70
percent of value.
	   But the territory, which had enjoyed an economic boom until late
1997, has been paying dearly for the currency link.
	   Persistently high interest rates, a main tactic to protect the
peg, have been choking the territory's once robust property market
and stock market.
	   Businesses find it increasingly difficult to get loans. And many
worry the healthy banking sector may crumble if the free fall in
property value continues. Property value has been halved since
October.
	   To fend off speculators in both the foreign exchange and stock
markets, the government in mid-August launched a bloody battle with
them to the dismay of many critics.
	   The government spent about 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion reserves buying blue-chip stocks so that speculators
betting against the market would lose money.
	   The expensive move successfully propped up the main Hang Seng
Index by about 1,200 points in two weeks but has left many to
wonder whether Hong Kong is swaying from the long-standing free
market policy.
	   ``I would think we have achieved our initial objective,'' Tung
said.
	   The speculators' market manipulation ``is very damaging to the
free market economy in Hong Kong, so we intervened. We made our
point,'' he added.
	   ``People ask me, `Will you do it again?' My answer is yes so
long as we see market distortions (that) need to be corrected.''
	   Tung also appealed for stronger U.S. leadership in Asia before
regional ills spread further. He urged the United States to help
Japan speed up its economic recovery.
	   He said, ``We're all holding our breath'' ahead of U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin's meeting in San Francisco this weekend with
Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   ``I really think this is the area where the American leadership
is very, very important,'' he said.
	   ``I'm sure America is doing a whole lot of things, and I would
really like to see America doing a whole lot more, in terms of
exerting leadership in this really difficult time.''
	   On Hong Kong's democratic development, Tung said the territory
still needs time to mature politically before opening the
legislature further for open, direct elections.
	   Only a third of seats of the 60-seat legislature were elected in
open, direct elections in May. The others _ mostly conservative and
Beijing-friendly elites _ were chosen by members of a handful of
professions, labor groups and business groups.
	   The Democrats, Hong Kong's biggest opposition, have been pushing
for an amendment to the constitution, under which Hong Kong can
choose its own election system only after 2007. But it says most of
the seats will not be directly elected before then.

Pilots warn of danger of proposed new airport in the sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch pilots warned the government
Thursday that plans to build a new airport on a manmade island in
the North Sea would create difficult conditions for aircraft
landing there.
	   The Dutch government is currently exploring ways of easing the
pressure on Amsterdam's busy Schiphol Airport, and a new runway and
terminal in the North Sea are among the options under serious
consideration.
	   But in a press statement, the Association of Dutch Pilots said
that weather conditions over the North Sea would create tricky
conditions for pilots landing on an island.
	   ``Mist and low-hanging clouds _ extremely undesirable for
landing aircraft _ are particularly difficult to predict on the
North Sea,'' the association warned.
	   ``Wind is also much more powerful over the sea than on land,
pushing it over the limit sooner. Flying in bad conditions on the
limit is not dangerous but should be avoided as much as possible,''
the statement said.
	   The association, which represents the majority of Dutch civil
pilots, urged Cabinet ministers to put security at the top of their
list of considerations when reaching a decision on a new airport.
	   Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest air hubs, is fast approaching
government-set noise pollution levels. The Dutch government hopes
to make a decision by the end of this year on the location of a new
airport to ease the load.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland: to reporters.

	   Before his formal address, Clinton, in what press secretary Mike
McCurry likened to a ``college mixer,'' worked Stormont's Long
Hall, where elected members of Northern Ireland's assembly stood
grouped by parties to greet the president.
	   The Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein party, including
president Gerry Adams, was there in force.
	   In advance of Clinton's arrival Adams, at the Clinton
administration's urging, won a meeting with Trimble by issuing a
statement that came closer than ever before to declaring an end to
the violence that has left more than 3,400 people dead over the
past three decades.
	   Blair, preceding Clinton in a speech at Waterfront Hall, hailed
the move as one sign that ``possibilities do exist for a genuine
and lasting peace if we can reach out and grasp it.''
	   ``Those who still hanker after terror have no face ... that is a
big and fundamental change,'' the prime minister said.
	   At Blair's request, Clinton agreed to do what he could to
isolate and eliminate any private American financial support to
splinter groups trying to undermine peace, White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said.
	   As Clinton launched his fast-paced tour, Britain and Ireland,
determined to crush IRA dissidents who killed 28 people in a car
bombing, pushed anti-terrorist legislation toward passage.
	   In his speech, Clinton pressed both sides to meet conditions of
the peace accord: decommissioning ``the weapons of war,'' forming
an executive council, adapting the police forces, ending street
violence and pursuing the early release of prisoners whose
organizations have renounced violence.
	   ``Courage and reconciliation must drive this assembly in very
specific ways. ... These must be the benchmarks of the new Northern
Ireland,'' he said.
	   Clinton was also participating in a groundbreaking on the new
campus for the University of Ulster in West Belfast, an area of
unrest over the years.
	   James Steinberg, the president's deputy national security
adviser, said Wednesday that even with Adams' statement, there was
no way to rule out more bombs. But, he said, violence-prone groups
were on the run.
	   Adams' statement marked another step away from the IRA's once
unshakable determination to bomb and shoot until Northern Ireland
was abolished.
	   Instead, Adams' Sinn Fein party now is angling to help govern
the 77-year-old state alongside Protestant politicians.
	   Trimble had repeatedly demanded that Sinn Fein declare on behalf
of the IRA that ``their war is over'' before he would talk to Adams
about a Sinn Fein role in the new administration.

Lendl to play his first exhibition match in years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Former tennis champion Ivan Lendl
will come out of retirement to play his first exhibition match in
three years later this month in the town where he started his
career, a tennis official said Thursday.
	   Lendl, winner of eight Grand Slam titles and former No. 1 in the
world, will play in the town of Prerov, 300 kilometers (187 miles)
east of Prague, on Sept. 12.
	   He will play a 45-minute singles match, followed by doubles
alongside the 1988 Olympic champion Miloslav Mecir of Slovakia
against former Czechoslovak Davis Cup players Petr Hutka and Jiri
Hrebec, Dagmar Knotkova of the Prerov Tennis Club said.
	   ``Mr. Lendl accepted our invitation because he likes it here,''
Knotkova told the AP over the phone. ``He started his tennis career
in Prerov and he wanted to return.''
	   Proceeds from the matches will go to tennis clubs in the eastern
part of Czech Republic that were destroyed in the 1997 flooding,
Knotkova said.
	   Born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1960, Lendl defected from
his homeland in 1985 to eventually become an American citizen in
1992.
	   He has been back in his native country several times on tennis-
and golf- related trips after the 1989 anti-communist revolution
made his return possible.
	   After retiring from active tennis in 1994, Lendl has become a
passionate golfer, even taking part in professional tournaments.

that Malaysia's imposition of strict currency controls may have on
efforts to promote the use of regional currencies in trade in
Southeast Asia.
	   Thailand is also worried about what kind of impact the measure
may have on cross-border trade and tourism and will seek a
clarification from the Malaysian government, Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Thursday.
	   Thailand's southern provinces bordering Malaysia benefit greatly
from trade and tourists, with about 1 million Malaysians visiting
each year, said Kobsak.
	   After the regional economic crisis last year caused mounting
foreign debt burdens for Southeast Asian companies, support grew
for conducting trade within the region with regional currencies
rather than the U.S. dollar.
	   Malaysia was a major booster of the idea among its fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but it
remains in the planning stage. Currency controls would make it
almost impossible to implement.
	   Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday announced
that the government was banning trading of the national currency,
the ringgit, outside the country and halting the trade of Malaysian
shares overseas.
	   The measure was meant to isolate Malaysia from currency and
share manipulation and fluctuation.
	   The restrictions prohibit people from leaving Malaysia with more
then 1,000 ringgit (dlrs 263.16).
	   Foreign currency outflow for residents is limited to the
equivalent of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2631.60), while nonresidents are
limited to the same amount that they brought into the country.
There is no restriction as to how much foreign currency can be
brought into the country.
	   Jurin Laksanavisit, a Minister of the Prime Minister's Office
overseeing tourism, was reported in The Nation newspaper Thursday
as dismissing the currency restrictions as having a psychological
impact but not enough to deter Malaysians from visiting Thailand.
	   Trade between Thailand and Malaysia in the first six months of
this year stood at almost 86 billion baht (dlrs 2.1 billion).

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Basking in a warm welcome and
hailed as a peacemaker, President Bill Clinton urged Catholics and
Protestants to pull together with ``courage and reconciliation'' to
build a new Northern Ireland. ``America will continue to walk the
road of renewal with you,'' he declared.
	   Speaking to the 108-member assembly that will make fateful
decisions, Clinton said the line between peace and those who would
destroy it was being erased. ``So much more unites you than divides
you,'' Clinton said to an assemblage that gave him a standing
ovation.
	   ``The American people know from our own experience about bigotry
and violence,'' Clinton said, ``We know we are wiser, stronger and
happier when we stand on common ground and we know you will be
too.''
	   Shortly after Air Force One touched down in this storied
province, Clinton went into private meetings with one-time foes now
enmeshed in creating a new government under the terms of an accord
he helped broker last April.
	   ``What can I do to help?'' Clinton asked in opening a briefing
on the shaky peace accord with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and the two appointed leaders of Northern Ireland's embryonic
government, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.
	   The most emotional part of the day promised to be his meetings
with victims of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, most
recently in Omagh where a bombing killed 28 people and wounded more
than 330 on Aug. 15.
	   ``The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the troubles; it
was the opening shot of a vicious attack on the peace. The question
is not whether there will be more bombs and atempts to undo with
violence the verdict of the ballot box. There well may be,'' he
told assembly members.
	   But optimism was the day's overarching theme. Earlier, Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, showed off the day's
headline in the Independent, announcing that Trimble, the Ulster
Unionist leader, had agreed to meet with Adams, whose Sinn Fein
group is allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Berger called it a breakthrough. ``This is the headline we
wanted to see when we got here,'' he enthused to reporters.
	   Before his formal address, Clinton, in what press secretary Mike
McCurry likened to a ``college mixer,'' worked Stormont's Long
Hall, where elected members of Northern Ireland's assembly stood
grouped by parties to greet the president.
	   The Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein party, including
president Gerry Adams, was there in force.
	   In advance of Clinton's arrival Adams, at the Clinton
administration's urging, won a meeting with Trimble by issuing a
statement that came closer than ever before to declaring an end to
the violence that has left more than 3,400 people dead over the
past three decades.
	   Blair, preceding Clinton in a speech at Waterfront Hall, hailed
the move as one sign that ``possibilities do exist for a genuine
and lasting peace if we can reach out and grasp it.''
	   ``Those who still hanker after terror have no face ... that is a
big and fundamental change,'' the prime minister said.
	   At Blair's request, Clinton agreed to do what he could to
isolate and eliminate any private American financial support to
splinter groups trying to undermine peace, White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said.
	   As Clinton launched his fast-paced tour, Britain and Ireland,
determined to crush IRA dissidents who killed 28 people in a car
bombing, pushed anti-terrorist legislation toward passage.
	   In his speech, Clinton pressed both sides to meet conditions of
the peace accord: decommissioning ``the weapons of war,'' forming
an executive council, adapting the police forces, ending street
violence and pursuing the early release of prisoners whose
organizations have renounced violence.
	   ``Courage and reconciliation must drive this assembly in very
specific ways. ... These must be the benchmarks of the new Northern
Ireland,'' he said.
	   Clinton was also participating in a groundbreaking on the new
campus for the University of Ulster in West Belfast, an area of
unrest over the years.
	   James Steinberg, the president's deputy national security
adviser, said Wednesday that even with Adams' statement, there was
no way to rule out more bombs. But, he said, violence-prone groups
were on the run.
	   Adams' statement marked another step away from the IRA's once
unshakable determination to bomb and shoot until Northern Ireland
was abolished.
	   Instead, Adams' Sinn Fein party now is angling to help govern
the 77-year-old state alongside Protestant politicians.
	   Trimble had repeatedly demanded that Sinn Fein declare on behalf
of the IRA that ``their war is over'' before he would talk to Adams
about a Sinn Fein role in the new administration.

Palestinians says Israel has no right to dig for artifacts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ In a new dispute over authority in
divided Hebron, the Palestinian Authority on Thursday accused
Israel of violating agreements by conducting an archaeological dig
near a Jewish enclave in the center of town.
	   Archaeologists have been digging just outside the Tel Romeida
enclave where last month a Jewish settler was killed in his
trailer, apparently by Palestinian militants.
	   The Israeli army is planning to fortify Tel Romeida, a cluster
of several mobile homes and a military outpost, and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said the trailers would be replaced by
permanent buildings. Under Israeli law, construction can only begin
once archaeologists have searched the building site.
	   Tel Romeida is in the Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron, a
city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers. The
Palestinian Authority has complete control in 80 percent of the
city. In the remainder, Israel is in charge of security, while the
Palestinians are responsible for municipal affairs.
	   Mahmoud Jabarin, a Palestinian Authority official overseeing
archaeological digs in the Hebron area, said Israel had no right to
begin digging at Tel Romeida and demanded that the work be stopped.
	   Lt. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military
government in the West Bank, said the dig was linked to the
construction of a military structure and thus a security matter.
	   Jabarin said Israel had taken advantage of a 10-day curfew
imposed after the killing of the settler to start the excavations.
	   ``We could not go out and stop them because of the curfew. We
stopped them twice before in July and in the beginning of August,''
Jabarin said.
	   Lerner said the excavations began before the curfew was imposed.
	   The excavations have yielded various artifacts from the Bronze
Age, including pots, as well as bones. Lerner said it was not clear
yet whether the bones were human.

Singapore ousts Indonesia 2-1

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Nazri bin Nasir scored one goal and set up
the other as Singapore beat Indonesia 2-1 Thursday in the
semifinals of the Tiger Cup, ousting one of the teams that had
tainted the eight-nation soccer competition.
	   Singapore will play the winner of the later match between
Thailand and Vietnam in Saturday's final, with a dlrs 80,000
first-place prize at stake. Indonesia will play the loser in the
consolation game.
	   It was the first match since Indonesia and Thailand played
Monday in a game neither wanted to win. The winner would have had
to play host Vietnam in Hanoi on National Day.
	   Indonesia kicked the ball into its own net with time running
out, handing Thailand victory.
	   The Vietnam-Thailand semifinal was postponed from Wednesday to
Thursday as officials decided what to do.
	   Indonesia and Thailand are to be fined when the ASEAN Football
Federation meets Friday. Tournament organizers have recommended the
maximum of dlrs 40,000.
	   Further penalties are possible when the Asian Football
Confederation meets Sept. 11. The manager of Thailand's national
team already has resigned in disgrace.
	   Earlier in the tournament, the Vietnamese fans, while clearly
favoring a couple of underdogs, had shown appreciation of spirited
play by any team. Turnout had been good overall, though better in
Hanoi, where the stadium has been packed.
	   But Ho Chi Minh City's 22,000-seat Thong Nhat Stadium was only
about a third-full Thursday, and those who did show up made their
sentiments clear: They wanted Indonesia to lose.
	   Many sat during the Indonesian national anthem. One fan hung a
sign that read: ``Singapore 10, Indonesia 0.''
	   When the match started, they cheered every time Singapore
touched the ball. They cheered even louder whenever Indonesia made
a mistake.
	   And they went crazy when Singapore scored in the 13th minute as
Nasir fired a perfect free kick from the sideline and Mohammed Rafi
Mohammed Ali broke free to beat the keeper with a crisp header
right in front of the goal.
	   Nasir himself was the beneficiary of a good pass in the 30th
minute, gathering himself in front, turning and firing into the
corner to make it 2-0.
	   Indonesia's Mirobaldo Bento quieted the crowd when he got one
back in the 34th minute on an opportunistic rebound shot. Both
teams had opportunities in the second half, but the goalies were up
to the task.
	   When it was all over, the fans stood and cheered as if the
Vietnamese team had won.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with Austrian officials Thursday to discuss the crises
in Russia and Kosovo, as well as increased cooperation between the
United States and the European Union.
	   In separate meetings with her Austrian counterpart Wolfgang
Schuessel and President Thomas Klestil, Albright stressed the need
to achieve a degree of self-rule in the southern Serb province of
Kosovo. She also warned a ``humanitarian catastrophe'' with the
onset of winter in Kosovo and tens of thousands of refugees on the
run.
	   Later, Albright was scheduled to meet again with Schuessel, who
is representing the EU during Austria's turn at its rotating
presidency, to discuss increased transatlantic cooperation between
the EU and the United States.
	   Before traveling to Austria, Albright toured Croatia and Bosnia,
and attended the summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow.
	   Later Thursday she was to address diplomats from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   She is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit the Austrian
capital for bilateral talks since 1945.

Markets mixed in nervous trading after Wall Street dip, but eyes
</HEADLINE>
focused on Moscow &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Opening markets were nervous in Central
Europe early Thursday as traders watched for signals from Wall
Street and for developments in Russia's economic crisis.
	   The zloty weakened against the dollar, opening at 3.65 to the
dollar compared to Wednesday's 3.62, and against the mark, opening
at 2.10 compared to 2.06.
	   Traders said the zloty was 2.4 percent above mid-point against
its basket of five key hard currencies _ the dollar, the mark, the
Swiss and French francs, and the British pound _ down from around
3.7 percent at the close of trading Wednesday.
	   Still, the Polish currency was stronger than last week, when the
zloty hit its lowest point this year at 3.82 to the dollar.
	   The Hungarian forint held steady at 1.87 percent below mid-point
on its trading band, with few expectations for significant movement
during the day. The Czech koruna rose against the dollar but
dropped slightly against the mark.
	   Across the region, traders said sharp moves and small
transactions showed continued nervousness over the uncertain
political and economic situation in Russia. Stock markets were
largely mixed and seen as vulnerable to negative news from other
markets.
	   Indexes in Warsaw and Prague were up 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent
respectively, while prices fell in Budapest by 5.85 percent,
closing at a record low of the year: 5.098 points, same as January
1997.
	   Tomasz Wlad, dealer at AmerBank in Warsaw, said the slight
weakening of the zloty meant an end of the correction that drove up
the Polish currency earlier this week. At the same time, drops on
Western stock exchanges also were pulling down the zloty.
	   Earlier this week, the zloty and other Central European
currencies had strengthened as investors returned to markets hoping
for medium- and long-term gains.

Syria opens trade center in sign of growing ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi deputy oil minister's comments in new grafs
11-14 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Syria reopened its trade center here
Thursday after a gap of nearly 18 years in the latest sign of
growing ties between the two uneasy neighbors.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and Khaled Raad,
Syria's head of duty free zones, attended a ceremony to open the
center at the Baghdad International Fair grounds.
	   Both briefly toured the center where Syrian-made clothes, brooms
and biscuits were exhibited.
	   An Iraqi trade center is expected to open soon in the Syrian
capital, Damascus under an agreement signed by Saleh and Raad. No
date has been set.
	   Iraq cut ties with Syria in 1981 because of its support of Iran
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. A thaw in relations began after Syria
sent a trade delegation to Iraq in May 1997.
	   Raad told reporters that the Syrian center ``is an attempt to
lift the suffering of the Iraqi people ... and to open a window
onto Iraq for Syrian products.''
	   ``God willing there will be more cooperation depending on the
progress in (political) bilateral relations,'' said Saleh. He said
Syria exported medicines, clothing and food worth nearly dlrs 150
million to Iraq in 1997 and in the first half of 1998.
	   Thursday's reopening of the center follows an Aug. 20 agreement
between the two countries to re-start a pipeline for Iraqi crude
that was shut 16 years ago.
	   That should, however, be approved first by the United Nations,
which has imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The pipeline links Iraq's Kirkuk to Syria's Banias terminal on
the Mediterranean Sea, but Iraq has said it will not wait for the
permission.
	   In comments published Thursday, the deputy oil minister, Taha
Hamoud Mousa, said Iraq will only go so far as to ``inform the
United Nations'' when it starts pumping the oil through the
pipeline.
	   He also criticized the United States for reportedly objecting to
the reopening of the pipeline.
	   ``Exporting oil though Syrian territory is a decision taken
jointly with Syria. America has no right to object to this
arrangement,'' Mousa was quoted as saying by the al-Zawra weekly
newspaper.
	   The pipeline was also closed when relations were severed.

Official: Russia to participate in civilian projects in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may participate in civilian projects in
Kosovo but remains strongly opposed to the use of force to end
fighting in the southern Serbian province, an official said
Thursday.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed
launching an international civilian project in Kosovo during their
summit, which ended Wednesday.
	   ``A pilot mechanism must be launched without delay to create
favorable conditions in populated areas that have suffered the
most,'' Rakhmanin said.
	   He refused to elaborate on the plan, however, saying the details
were still being worked out. And he insisted that the project would
be purely civilian.
	   ``Russia's position was again confirmed yesterday by the Russian
president, when he said ... that Russia rejects the solution of
regional conflicts by force as a matter of principle, and that
today's conflicts cannot be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin said.
	   Yeltsin and Clinton signed a joint statement Wednesday saying
the conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo was
causing ``great alarm'' around the world.
	   Russia supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not its secession
from Serb-led Yugoslavia, a longtime ally. Moscow has adamantly
opposed any NATO plans to use force to end the fighting in Kosovo.
	   Russia has voiced concern over previous NATO air maneuvers in
the Balkans that were intended to pressure Serbia to stop its
crackdown on ethnic Albanians.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A flotilla of coast guard and
fishing boats searching the sea early Thursday found only bodies
and debris floating in an oil slick at the site where a Swissair
jetliner went down off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. Geneva-bound Flight 111 had left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat. ``You could tell by some of the things
that floated by that it didn't look real good.''
	   Canadian rescue official Dan Bedell said 18 bodies had been
recovered as dawn approached. Later in the morning, ships and
helicopters searching for debris were visible from shore as the sun
began to break through the light mist following the night's rain.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Pastor Jim Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket,
said Thursday he has a special identification with the families of
people killed on Swissair flight SR111 from New York.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, an Albany, New York, native
who has lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst raced to Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join some 100
counselors _ including clergy and psychologists _ in consoling
relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the crash off
Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   All major religions are represented, he said. ``Only a few are
Jews, but we have come for everyone.''
	   Longhurst, senior pastor of the interdenominational Crossroads
Church in suburban Ferney-Voltaire, said he was available to talk
to anyone.
	   ``The first thing is to express how many people feel with
them,'' he said. ``I want them to feel the support and the
heartfelt care of all the people in Geneva.''
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking. There's shock
over the pain and devastation.''
	   He said he had spoken to a number of businessmen who feared they
had friends on the flight and to a woman whose scientist husband
will be on the same flight taking off from New York Thursday
evening.
	   ``It's a routine flight. It's a ferry with lots of people flying
in and out so everyone can feel it,'' Longhurst said.
	   A Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name only as
Nathalie appeared shaken but relieved in the reception area. She
had just found her father, who had flown in from New York on a
different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Queen invites English, Scottish, Jamaican soccer teams to palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ So what did you think of that penalty, ma'am?
	   Queen Elizabeth II, whose sporting tastes would appear to run
more to horse racing and polo, has invited the English, Scottish
and Jamaican World Cup soccer teams to a Buckingham Palace
reception Oct. 29, the palace announced Thursday.
	   Some observers remarked that perhaps the queen is striving to
emulate the late Princess Diana's ``common touch'' by taking a
greater interest in Britain's favorite sport.
	   But palace officials said the monarch has a long-standing
interest in soccer.
	   ``This is not a sudden display of football fervor by the
queen,'' said a spokesman, with customary anonymity. ``She has
given similar receptions before and is patron of the Football
Association and Scottish Football Association _ and, of course, is
queen of Jamaica.''
	   The England and Scotland squads, plus coaching staff and
officials, and British-based Jamaican players _ known as the
``Reggae Boys'' _ will be served drinks and canapes at the evening
reception, the palace said.
	   But wives and partners are not expected to attend _ so there is
no chance of Her Majesty running into pregnant Spice Girl Victoria
Adams, fiancee of England and Manchester United soccer star David
Beckham.
	   In remarks to members of the public during the World Cup this
summer, the queen let it be known she was watching key games. Her
views on England's departure after a nail-biting penalty shootout,
however, are unrecorded.

Swissair says all passengers, crew died on crash flight

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Names of two prominent passengers killed in the
crash of Swissair flight SR111 were disclosed Thursday, but the
airline refused to disclose the full list of all 229 who died until
relatives could be informed.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health
and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, and his wife,
Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, were among the victims, said a spokesman
for the World Health Organization.
	   Some nine hours after the flight from New York to Geneva crashed
off the coast of Canada, the airline confirmed that the MD-11
jetliner's 215 passengers, two of them babies, and 14 crew members
had died.
	   Swissair said that for legal reasons it couldn't give details of
passengers' names before all the next of kin have been informed.
But spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz told a news conference in Zurich
most were thought to have been Swiss.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said later that some 50
passengers were to fly on to other European airports, but he said
he had no information on the nationalities of the passengers.
	   Swissair set up three emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland
and one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the
flight.
	   ``Now it will be kind of putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   There was no indication when the passenger list would be made
available. One of the crew members was an American from Swissair
partner Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   The plane made a ``normal takeoff with regular radio contact''
from New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 8.18 p.m. local time
(00.18 GMT), Swissair said in a statement.
	   It was captained by pilot Urs Zimmermann, 50, and the co-pilot
was 36-year-old Stephan Loew _ ``both MD-11 instructors with
considerable experience on the type,'' Swissair said.
	   After reporting smoke in the cockpit, the pilots ``set course
for Boston, but then decided to divert to Halifax,'' the statement
continued.
	   An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
flight. In Geneva, a 100-strong crisis center was attempting to
counsel those worried about relatives. Counseling teams were also
set up in Zurich and New York.
	   The airline said that four bodies were recovered in the initial
hours of searches at the crash site.
	   In Bern, President Flavio Cotti, who called a special meeting of
the country's ruling coalition cabinet, said the government was
``devastated'' by the crash. The accident was the worst in Swiss
aviation history.
	   Swiss authorities have no indications that the plane was the
victim of a terrorist attack or other criminal action, Cotti added.
	   ``For all of us this is a day of mourning,'' he said. The
government ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organization like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   The United Nations said U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at
half-staff Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N.
workers on board the plane.
	   Officials at U.N. offices in Geneva said about 10 U.N. employees
were believed to be on the flight.
	   WHO spokesman Richard Leclair said that Thursday afternoon the
agency held a memorial gathering for Mann, the outspoken head of
the U.N. campaign against AIDS during the 1980s.
	   Parent company SAirGroup's chief financial officer, Georges
Schorderet, insisted that ``this airplane was in perfect working
order.''
	   The MD-11, one of a Swissair fleet of 16, was put into service
in August 1991 and was overhauled in August and September last
year. As with all airplanes, it had been checked before takeoff, he
added.
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Swissair spokesman
Donzel said the airline has no plans to ground its MD-11s.
	   A Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, took
off as normal at 12.30 local time (1030 GMT) Thursday.
	   It was the first fatal crash for the airline in nearly 20 years.
	   ``You always think it happens to others, but today it was us,''
Donzel said, fighting back tears.

Montgomerie, Faldo start Ryder Cup campaigns with luke-warm rounds

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Struggling Colin
Montgomerie and Nick Faldo started their campaigns for Ryder Cup
team berths with uninspiring first rounds Thursday at the European
Masters.
	   Montgomerie, a five-time European No. 1 who has missed his last
two cuts, started with a 1-under 70 on a Crans-sur-Sierre course
expected to produce low scores and was four strokes behind the
early leaders. Faldo, going through a disastrous period of form on
the U.S. Tour, was one stroke further behind after an even-par 71.
	   Early leaders on a rain-affected first day were Argentina's
Eduardo Romero, who won the event in 1994, and Sweden's Olle
Karlsson, both at 5-under 66.
	   Reigning champion Costantino Rocca was one stroke behind at
4-under, along with Spain's Miguel Angel Jiminez and Jean Van de
Velde of France.
	   The European Masters is the first qualifying event for the 1999
European Ryder Cup team.
	   Faldo, without a win in 18 months, carded four birdies and four
bogeys on his brief return to the European tour before he returns
to the U.S.
	   ``I made a couple of bad swings and missed a couple of short
putts,'' said Faldo, winner of three British Opens and three
Masters. ``I've just got to keep working.''
	   Montgomerie also had four birdies but three bogeys.
	   ``A 70 is not acceptable round here unfortunately. The course is
tougher by a couple of shots this year but I didn't hit it as I
wanted and I didn't putt very well,'' he said.
	   England's Lee Westwood, current leader on the European tour
money list, was Montgomerie's playing partner and also carded a 70.
	   Westwood missed last week's BMW International in Munich after
withdrawing from the European Open in Ireland with a hip injury and
was not disappointed with his first round back from injury.
	   ``I didn't play very well and I'm still a bit rusty but there's
not a lot you can do about it and one under to me does not feel
that bad,'' he said.

Government officials propose new law to fight pedophiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Government officials on Thursday proposed
tougher laws to fight child pornography and curb child sex tourism
in the region.
	   Security officials told legislators in a meeting the government
wants to outlaw child sex, the territory's first such attempt to
curb pornography, prostitution and sex tourism involving children.
	   Unlike many of its Asian neighbors, child pornography or
prostitution is not prevalent in Hong Kong.
	   But Raymond Wong, deputy secretary for secretary, said
legislation was necessary ``to prevent the issue from
deteriorating.''
	   ``We regard it as a very serious offense that needs separate
legislation,'' he said.
	   The proposed law would offer jail terms of up to 10 years for
employing children for pornographic movies and magazines, eight
years for the distribution and five years for possessing child
pornography, he said.
	   Wong also proposed allowing Hong Kong police to prosecute child
sex offenders living in or passing through the territory for crimes
committed abroad, regardless of their offenders' nationalities.
	   Many Asian countries, including Thailand, the Philippines and
Indonesia, are known for sex tourism. Some Asian sex tourists pass
through Hong Kong to escape stiff anti-child sex legislations in
other countries.
	   Legislators generally supported the proposal.
	   ``We accept the spirit of the law,'' said legislator Andrew
Cheng of Democrats, the main opposition.
	   In March, a 24-year old Japanese living in Hong Kong was
sentenced to more than one year in prison for posting pornographic
pictures of children on the Internet. Some of the children appeared
to be as young as 8.
	   There have been no other convictions this year.

Albright reports progress on Kosovo, Austrian minister speaks of
</HEADLINE>
first ``glimmer of hope'' &QL;

 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- U.S. diplomacy has produced a good first
step toward ending the Kosovo crisis, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Thursday. Austria's foreign minister spoke of a
``glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful solution.
	   Albright stopped here on her way home from the U.S.-Russian
summit in Moscow for the first bilateral visit to Vienna by a U.S.
secretary of state.
	   She briefed Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on the summit and diplomatic efforts in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from
Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia.
	   Albright said that during the U.S.-Russian talks, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was ``very much in charge during the
meetings and directing the process'' but she added there was an
``increasing strength'' of Communist members in the Russian Duma,
or parliament.
	   ``It is up to countries with market economies and democracy to
continue those (democratic) forces within Russia and to make very
clear there is no going backwards'' to a planned economy and
authoritarian rule.
	   On Kosovo, both Albright and the Austrians expressed
encouragement over efforts by U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill,
who won an agreement in principle this week from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the main Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, for an interim accord granting self-rule to Kosovo's
Albanian majority.
	   The accord, which is yet to be finalized, falls short of the
Albanian demand for full independence but would be reviewed after
about three years.
	   ``We see this as a good procedural step forward,'' Albright told
reporters. ``We want to make sure that the violence is ended and
that there is action to let the humanitarian workers to be able to
get in to deal with the over now 250,000 displaced people.''
	   Albright also said that if force is required ``the nations that
agree must be ready to act.'' She said the Russians as well as the
Americans believed it was critical now for Milosevic ``to halt the
violence.''
	   Speaking to reporters along with Albright, Schuessel said ``for
the first time there is a glimmer of hope'' in Kosovo but
cautioned, ``Don't think that the solution is there. This is a
small hope but it is part of a diplomatic process.''
	   During the summit, Albright said she and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov had discussed the possibility of sending
additional international monitors to Kosovo ``who by their numbers
would be able to resist some of the pressures'' imposed on
international aid workers by Serb security forces.
	   But she said she and Primakov did not specifically discuss
Moscow's participation in a military ``stabilization force''
similar to the one that is enforcing the 1995 Dayton accords which
ended the Bosnian War.
	   ``We're very concerned about the fact that winter is six weeks
away and that what is already a very bad humanitarian situation
will be exacerbated by the weather,'' she said.
	   Later, in a speech to delegates from the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Albright described the
Kosovo crisis as ``by far the biggest challenge we face in the
Balkans today.''
	   She said the Clinton Administration was preparing to provide an
additional dlrs 20 million in aid to Kosovo Albanians displaced by
the fighting.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Names of two prominent passengers killed in the
crash of Swissair flight SR111 were disclosed Thursday, but the
airline refused to disclose the full list of all 229 who died until
relatives could be informed.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health
and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, and his wife,
Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, were among the victims, said a spokesman
for the World Health Organization.
	   Some nine hours after the flight from New York to Geneva crashed
off the coast of Canada, the airline confirmed that the MD-11
jetliner's 215 passengers, two of them babies, and 14 crew members
had died.
	   Swissair said that for legal reasons it couldn't give details of
passengers' names before all the next of kin have been informed.
But spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz told a news conference in Zurich
most were thought to have been Swiss.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said later that some 50
passengers were to fly on to other European airports, but he said
he had no information on the nationalities of the passengers.
	   Swissair set up three emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland
and one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the
flight.
	   ``Now it will be kind of putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   There was no indication when the passenger list would be made
available. One of the crew members was an American from Swissair
partner Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   The plane made a ``normal takeoff with regular radio contact''
from New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 8.18 p.m. local time
(00.18 GMT), Swissair said in a statement.
	   It was captained by pilot Urs Zimmermann, 50, and the co-pilot
was 36-year-old Stephan Loew _ ``both MD-11 instructors with
considerable experience on the type,'' Swissair said.
	   After reporting smoke in the cockpit, the pilots ``set course
for Boston, but then decided to divert to Halifax,'' the statement
continued.
	   An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
flight. In Geneva, a 100-strong crisis center was attempting to
counsel those worried about relatives. Counseling teams were also
set up in Zurich and New York.
	   The airline said that four bodies were recovered in the initial
hours of searches at the crash site.
	   In Bern, President Flavio Cotti, who called a special meeting of
the country's ruling coalition cabinet, said the government was
``devastated'' by the crash. The accident was the worst in Swiss
aviation history.
	   Swiss authorities have no indications that the plane was the
victim of a terrorist attack or other criminal action, Cotti added.
	   ``For all of us this is a day of mourning,'' he said. The
government ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organization like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   The United Nations said U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at
half-staff Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N.
workers on board the plane.
	   Officials at U.N. offices in Geneva said about 10 U.N. employees
were believed to be on the flight.
	   WHO spokesman Richard Leclair said that Thursday afternoon the
agency held a memorial gathering for Mann, the outspoken head of
the U.N. campaign against AIDS during the 1980s.
	   Parent company SAirGroup's chief financial officer, Georges
Schorderet, insisted that ``this airplane was in perfect working
order.''
	   The MD-11, one of a Swissair fleet of 16, was put into service
in August 1991 and was overhauled in August and September last
year. As with all airplanes, it had been checked before takeoff, he
added.
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Swissair spokesman
Donzel said the airline has no plans to ground its MD-11s.
	   A Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, took
off as normal at 12.30 local time (1030 GMT) Thursday.
	   It was the first fatal crash for the airline in nearly 20 years.
	   ``You always think it happens to others, but today it was us,''
Donzel said, fighting back tears.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Pastor Jim Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket,
said Thursday he has a special identification with the families of
people killed on Swissair flight SR111 from New York.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, an Albany, New York, native
who has lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst raced to Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join some 100
counselors _ including clergy and psychologists _ in consoling
relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the crash off
Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   All major religions are represented, he said. ``Only a few are
Jews, but we have come for everyone.''
	   Longhurst, senior pastor of the interdenominational Crossroads
Church in suburban Ferney-Voltaire, said he was available to talk
to anyone.
	   ``The first thing is to express how many people feel with
them,'' he said. ``I want them to feel the support and the
heartfelt care of all the people in Geneva.''
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking. There's shock
over the pain and devastation.''
	   He said he had spoken to a number of businessmen who feared they
had friends on the flight and to a woman whose scientist husband
will be on the same flight taking off from New York Thursday
evening.
	   ``It's a routine flight. It's a ferry with lots of people flying
in and out so everyone can feel it,'' Longhurst said.
	   A Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name only as
Nathalie appeared shaken but relieved in the reception area. She
had just found her father, who had flown in from New York on a
different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Italy's Communist leader threatens to withdraw support for
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hardline Communist leader renewed his threat
Thursday to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
government unless it does more to stimulate job creation.
	   ``We want to raise the stakes because the government has not
maintained its promises,'' said Fausto Bertinotti, leader of
Communist Refoundation, which Prodi counts on for a majority in the
Chamber of Deputies.
	   Bertinotti has repeatedly accused the government of failing to
focus enough resources on cutting Italy's 12.5 percent unemployment
rate. It now wants the 1999 budget to include hefty investments for
Italy's lesser developed south, and a 35-hour workweek.
	   ``Either there's an about-face or it's the end of the
coalition,'' Bertinotti said.
	   Discussion on the budget will start later this month.
	   Refoundation's No. 2, however, has taken his distance from
Bertinotti.
	   Armando Cossuta, the party's president, said abandoning the
government would not help the party attain its employment goals.
	   The two leaders have called for a special party congress to
discuss the next move.
	   In June, the Communists nearly caused the government to fall by
refusing to vote for NATO's eastward expansion.

Strong quake shakes northern Japan, 10 hurt

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with at least 10 injured, ADDS aftershocks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook northern Japan Thursday,
slightly injuring at least 10 people. There were no immediate
reports of serious casualties or damage.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck at 4:58
p.m. (0758 GMT). It was centered close to ground level near the
rural town of Shizukuishi in Iwate Prefecture (state), roughly 510
kilometers (320 miles) north of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency
said.
	   Several aftershocks later rocked the area, including one with a
preliminary magnitude of 4.1 at 9:25 p.m. (1225 GMT), the agency
said.
	   Ten people suffered minor injuries from falling objects in the
earlier quake, and eight of them were treated at local hospitals,
said Hiroshi Nyui of the Iwate prefectural police.
	   Three of those sent to the hospital were junior high school
students from elsewhere in Iwate visiting the area on a school
field trip, Nyui said.
	   Two local roads were blocked by rock-slides, and service was
temporarily suspended on the bullet train, he said.
	   The quake was centered near Mt. Iwate, a volcano where
seismologists have recently recorded increasing activity.
	   After the earthquake, the Meteorological Agency issued a warning
that a further increase of volcanic activity may be coming. But it
said it had observed no changes at the mountain.
	   The agency also said there was no fear of tsunami, undersea
waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   A quake of magnitude 6 is capable of causing moderate damage.
Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations.

Woman who shot pro-Israeli leader freed from detention

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's militia ally on Thursday
released one of Lebanon's most prominent prisoners, a communist
woman who shot and seriously wounded the group's leader 10 years
ago.
	   Hours after her release, Soha Bishara, 31, told reporters that
she did not regret trying to kill Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
	   ``It was our duty to liberate our land ... from the start I did
not consider it a crime. I don't consider him (Lahd) a Lebanese. I
considered him a Jew and continue to do so,'' she told a news
conference.
	   Despite 10 years in custody, six of them in solitary
confinement, Bishara appeared fit. She smiled and waved ``V'' for
victory signs to supporters and reporters.
	   The circumstances of her release were unclear.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said French President Jacques Chirac
played a key role in securing Bishara's freedom.
	   But the SLA said she was ordered freed on ``pure humanitarian
reasons'' by Lahd, a retired Lebanese army general who is Israel's
only remaining ally in Lebanon.
	   In June, France had played a role in a swap in which Israel and
the SLA freed 55 Lebanese prisoners in return for the remains of an
Israeli commando.
	   Bishara walked out of the Khiam detention camp in the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon at 10 a.m. (0700GMT).
From there she was driven to Beirut to meet with Hariri.
	   ``You have raised Lebanon's head high,'' Hariri said, adding
that she was free to stay in Lebanon or go to France, Lebanon's
former colonial ruler where thousands of Lebanese of various
political and religious affiliations have sought asylum.
	   State-run television linked Bishara's fate to France's reported
granting of citizenship to Lahd and senior SLA officers when or if
Israel withdraws its army from Lebanon.
	   Bishara, a communist activist, shot Lahd on Nov. 7, 1988, at his
house in Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
	   She reportedly used a 5.5 mm pistol that was said to have been a
gift to Lebanese communist leaders from Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
	   Lahd, 67, survived with serious injuries and was treated in
Israel. Bishara was captured and was held at the SLA-run detention
center in Khiam without charges or trial all this time.
	   Lebanon's Communist Party is part of a coalition waging a
guerrilla war against Israel and its allies in southern Lebanon.
	   She was among the prisoners most sought for release by Lebanese
guerrillas who had swapped prisoners and bodies with Israel and the
SLA in the past.
	   A total of 125 Lebanese remain in southern Lebanon with the SLA
and 42 in Israel.
	   Lahd commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese militia
that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its troops patrol
the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in absentia for
treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.

Queen invites English, Scottish, Jamaican soccer teams to palace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: item has also moved on news wires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ So what did you think of that penalty, ma'am?
	   Queen Elizabeth II, whose sporting tastes would appear to run
more to horse racing and polo, has invited the English, Scottish
and Jamaican World Cup soccer teams to a Buckingham Palace
reception Oct. 29, the palace announced Thursday.
	   Some observers remarked that perhaps the queen is striving to
emulate the late Princess Diana's ``common touch'' by taking a
greater interest in Britain's favorite sport.
	   But palace officials said the monarch has a long-standing
interest in soccer.
	   ``This is not a sudden display of football fervor by the
queen,'' said a spokesman, with customary anonymity. ``She has
given similar receptions before and is patron of the Football
Association and Scottish Football Association _ and, of course, is
queen of Jamaica.''
	   The England and Scotland squads, plus coaching staff and
officials, and British-based Jamaican players _ known as the
``Reggae Boyz'' _ will be served drinks and canapes at the evening
reception, the palace said.
	   But wives and partners are not expected to attend _ so there is
no chance of Her Majesty running into pregnant Spice Girl Victoria
Adams, fiancee of England and Manchester United soccer star David
Beckham.
	   In remarks to members of the public during the World Cup this
summer, the queen let it be known she was watching key games. Her
views on England's departure after a nail-biting penalty shootout,
however, are unrecorded.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Pastor Jim Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket,
said Thursday he has a special identification with the families of
people killed on Swissair flight SR111 from New York.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, N.Y., who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join some 100 counselors _ including
clergy and psychologists _ in consoling relatives and friends of
the 229 people who died in the crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   All major religions are represented, he said. ``Only a few are
Jews, but we have come for everyone.''
	   Longhurst, senior pastor of the interdenominational Crossroads
Church in suburban Ferney-Voltaire, next to the airport runway and
over the border in France, said he was available to talk to other
Americans or anyone else.
	   ``The first thing is to express how many people feel with
them,'' he said. ``I want them to feel the support and the
heartfelt care of all the people in Geneva.''
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking. There's shock
over the pain and devastation.''
	   He said he had spoken to a number of businessmen who feared they
had friends on the flight and to a woman whose scientist husband
will be on the same flight taking off from New York Thursday
evening.
	   ``It's a routine flight. It's a ferry with lots of people flying
in and out so everyone can feel it,'' Longhurst said.
	   He said he was ready to share Bible passages about death ``so
that they know that God is there and he doesn't abandon people. God
comes to people in death.''
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Kohl, challenger clash head-on as German election race heats up
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, the front runner in
Germany's election race, branded Chancellor Helmut Kohl unfit for
the future Thursday in one of the sharpest personal attacks on his
opponent so far.
	   Less than a month before the Sept. 27 national vote, the two
candidates faced off in parliament in their only direct
confrontation before Election Day.
	   Neither campaigner presented new ideas, but Kohl touted his
experience as a statesman at a time of global uncertainty while his
younger, slicker rival presented himself as a force for moderate
change and a fairer society.
	   Schroeder seemed bored as he sat impassively through Kohl's
rambling 80-minute speech that focused heavily on his historic
achievements such as German unification.
	   When he took the floor after the 68-year-old chancellor, the
Social Democrat hit hard.
	   ``That was a speech about the past,'' he declared. ``You are
incapable of handling the future.''
	   Pointing to Germany's 4.1 million jobless, he accused Kohl of
breaking his promise to unemployment when he first took power 16
years ago.
	   He lashed out at cuts in social and health programs passed by
Kohl's center-right coalition. He accused the chancellor's
Christian Democrats of presiding over a widening gap between rich
and poor _ a gap that Schroeder vowed his Social Democrats would
redress.
	   ``No one denies your achievements,'' Schroeder said. ``But your
policies have led to a split in German society.''
	   As Schroeder blasted his record, Kohl talked on a mobile
telephone, autographed a book and occasionally smiled.
	   Thursday's nationally televised duel of words was the closest
Germany will come to a TV debate between the candidates in the
final weeks of campaigning. Officially, the parliament session was
scheduled to discuss next year's budget.
	   In his speech, Kohl played up his role as the father of German
unity and accused Schroeder of lacking solidarity with people in
former communist East Germany, which remains economically depressed
eight years after unification.
	   ``Of course people had expectations there that could not be
fulfilled in such a short time,'' Kohl said. ``But just as clearly,
the picture has been improving.''
	   He said latest job market figures showed a ``clear turnaround''
in the fight against unemployment, and he claimed credit for low
inflation and a revival of economic growth.
	   Kohl promised continued reforms to preserve Germany's welfare
state and accused the Social Democrats of promising new funding for
social programs that the country couldn't afford.
	   But his strongest message: Voters should trust him more than
Schroeder, a 54-year-old centrist Social Democrat who has governed
Lower Saxony state since 1990.
	   ``The country needs clear, stable policies in these times,''
Kohl said. ``All experiments have risks. That's why we tell people
that you can't have the future for free.''

Parliament commission sheds doubt on mining company's benefits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with company comment in new 5th-7th grafs bgng:
``Freeport Indonesia ...' No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A parliament commission said Thursday
that PT Freeport Indonesia which operates a huge gold and copper
mine in Indonesia's western New Guinea, has not proved enough of a
benefit to the local people.
	   A study by the group, following a visit to the remote region
last month, recommended that the government should study whether it
was worth having the company in the country.
	   It accused the U.S.-Indonesian joint venture of exploiting the
gold and copper resources of the country for 25 years but leaving
the people around the area poor.
	   The commission said people were dissatisfied and want some type
of profit-sharing in the giant mining company.
	   Freeport Indonesia denied the report, saying it spent more than
25 billion rupiahs (dlrs 2.3 million) to help the local community
last year.
	   The aid, which includes housing, roads, schools, fishing and
farm projects, has been increased to 35 billion rupiahs (dlrs 3.2
million) this year, it said.
	   Some 300 students from tribes in the area have also received
scholarships from the company, it said.
	   A study in 1996, by Labat and Anderson, an international
auditor, found that Freeport was not responsive to the social needs
of neighboring tribes in the remote Indonesian province of Irian
Jaya.
	   In March the same year, rioting by tribes people in Timika and
the mining town of Tembagapura, killed three people. The rioters
were demanding more economic benefits and job opportunities from
the mine.
	   It said Freeport has met ``both the letter and spirit of
Indonesian law'' concerning local people's land rights, but it
should do more to understand and work with the local indigenous
leaders because of their markedly different cultures.
	   Freeport has spent dlrs 100 million in the last seven years on
community development and social programs and contributes hundreds
of millions of dollars annually in taxes and royalties to the
government of Indonesia, the report said.
	   Freeport Indonesia, which began operation in the 1960s, is a
joint venture company, whose 81.28 percent share is controlled by
the New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   The Indonesian government owns 9.36 percent, while a minority
stake in the company controlled by a charitable foundation headed
by former President Suharto.

Russian vendors fear the crisis back home

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Business at the Russian market was slow,
so Vladimir Uriakov sprayed cheap jasmine air freshener to attract
customers to his folding table laden with cosmetics.
	   It did little good. Customers filing past makeshift booths in
the old sports stadium sometimes stopped to look, but rarely
reached in their pockets.
	   For the hundreds of Russian traders who set up shop daily at
Warsaw's busiest bazaar, times are tough everywhere.
	   Back home in Russia, the government has devalued the ruble,
setting off an economic crisis the traders can't comprehend. And
here in Poland, the Russian crisis has caused the devaluation of
the zloty. That means market vendors accustomed to attracting
bargain-hunters cannot make money unless they raise prices.
	   Uriakov, a 23-year-old carpenter from Smolensk, Russia, who
can't find work back home, said his total earnings Wednesday were
just 20 zlotys (dlrs 5.33). ``That's very little,'' he said, ``just
enough to pay for food and accommodation, but not to save.''
	   Just two months ago, Uriakov was making as much as 100 zloty
(dlrs 26.66) a day here at what reputedly is Europe's largest
open-air international market. He buys his supplies in Poland,
avoiding higher costs from the ruble devaluation.
	   Now, few customers show interest in his wares, even though his
hair spray sells for six zloty (dlrs 1.6) and his air freshener
sells for five zloty (dlrs 1.3), roughly half the prices in Polish
stores.
	   The market is known as ``The Stadium.'' Vendors who set up shop
in the old sports venue _ some with shaded booths, others just
spreading cardboard on the asphalt _ offer a range of goods:
military medals, tools, Russian fur hats, toys, electronic
equipment, cheap clothes and computer games.
	   The stadium was built in 1955 to celebrate 10 years of communist
rule in Poland. Now, it serves post-communist transformations
toward a free market.
	   Last year, turnover in the Stadium was estimated at 1.9 billion
zloty (dlrs 558 million). But with fewer Russians coming since the
crisis began in Moscow two weeks ago, the figure will probably be
lower this year.
	   But no matter how bad it is in Warsaw for the Russians, things
sound worse back home.
	   ``When I call my family, they say it is terrible there _ shops
closed down, shop owners are afraid to sell because tomorrow the
dollar may cost 20, 30 or even 50 rubles, crowds in banks buying
foreign currency,'' Uriakov says.
	   His parents and two younger brothers want him to stay in Poland,
buy dollars and send them home. But Uriakov has bolder plans.
	   ``I want to go to Western Europe or Canada forever,'' he said.
``There is no future in Russia, the crisis is only beginning.''
	   Others who regularly shuttle between Russian and Warsaw don't
believe they have a choice.
	   ``Whatever is happening there, that's my home,'' said Tanya
Verush, 50, of St. Petersburg. She planned to marry and live in
Warsaw, but things went wrong. No she needs money for a return
ticket to Russia, but no one is buying the religious icons and
watches she offers for 150 to 350 zloty (dlrs 40 to 93).
	   She bought her supplies before the Russian crisis. But new
supplies will cost more, and therefore carry higher price tags that
can only discourage Polish buyers even more.
	   ``We don't feel the crisis yet,'' Verush said, ``but prospects
are bad.''

Swissair says all passengers, crew died on crash flight

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Names of two prominent passengers killed in the
crash of Swissair flight SR111 were disclosed Thursday, but the
airline refused to disclose the full list of all 229 who died until
relatives could be informed.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health
and an early pioneer in the fight against AIDS, and his wife,
Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, were among the victims, said a spokesman
for the World Health Organization.
	   Some nine hours after the flight from New York to Geneva crashed
off the coast of Canada, the airline confirmed that the MD-11
jetliner's 215 passengers, two of them babies, and 14 crew members
had died.
	   Swissair said that for legal reasons it couldn't give details of
passengers' names before all the next of kin have been informed.
But spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz told a news conference in Zurich
that most were thought to have been Swiss.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said later that some 50 of
the passengers were to have flown on to other European airports,
but he said he had no information on the passengers' nationalities.
	   Swissair set up three emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland
and one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the
flight.
	   ``Now it will be kind of putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   There was no indication of when the passenger list would be made
available. One of the crew members was an American from Swissair
partner Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him.
	   The flight was operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement
with Delta, meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was
its own plane.
	   The plane made a ``normal takeoff with regular radio contact''
from New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 8.18 p.m. local time
(0018 GMT), Swissair said in a statement.
	   The pilot was Urs Zimmermann, 50, and the co-pilot was
36-year-old Stephan Loew _ ``both MD-11 instructors with
considerable experience on the type,'' Swissair said.
	   After reporting smoke in the cockpit, the pilots ``set course
for Boston, but then decided to divert to Halifax,'' the statement
continued.
	   An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
flight. In Geneva, 100 staff at a crisis center were trying to
counsel people worried about relatives. Counseling teams were also
set up in Zurich and New York.
	   In Bern, President Flavio Cotti, who called a special meeting of
the country's ruling coalition cabinet, said the government was
``devastated'' by the crash. The accident was the worst in Swiss
aviation history.
	   Swiss authorities have no indications that the plane was the
target of a terrorist attack or other criminal action, Cotti added.
	   ``For all of us this is a day of mourning,'' he said. The
government ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff.
	   Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer for the airlines'
parent company _ SAirGroup _ insisted that ``this airplane was in
perfect working order.''
	   The MD-11, one of a Swissair fleet of 16, entered service in
August 1991 and was overhauled in August and September last year.
As with all airplanes, it had been checked before takeoff, he
added.
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Swissair spokesman
Donzel said the airline has no plans to ground its other MD-11s. A
Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, took off as
normal at 12:30 local time (1030 GMT) Thursday.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organizations like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   The United Nations said U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at
half-staff Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N.
workers on board the plane. Officials at U.N. offices in Geneva
said about 10 U.N. employees were believed to be on the flight.
	   WHO spokesman Richard Leclair said that Thursday afternoon his
agency held a memorial gathering for Mann, the outspoken head of
the U.N. campaign against AIDS during the 1980s.
	   It was the first fatal crash for the airline in nearly 20 years.
	   ``You always think it happens to others, but today it was us,''
Donzel said, fighting back tears.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister said Thursday he had been framed in a ``larger political
conspiracy'' and vowed to fight all charges against him.
	   Anwar Ibrahim said allegations of sexual misconduct and leaking
state secrets were fabricated by the camp of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to undermine any challenge to his 17-year
leadership of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``This is an unjust administration,'' Anwar, who was also dumped
as finance minister Wednesday, told hundreds of supporters and
journalists at his private residence.
	   ``If the No. 2 man cannot be sure of justice, then I'm sorry for
Malaysia.''
	   He called the allegations against him _ which include
corruption, spying for foreign powers, even sodomy and murder _
part of a ``larger political conspiracy.''
	   Anwar, 51, was fired unceremoniously Wednesday evening after
months of bitter political differences with his one-time mentor,
Mahathir.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Anwar, a conservative Muslim and the father of six children,
said he had undergone DNA testing to prove his innocence in an
apparent paternity suit.
	   He said Mahathir threatened to get prostitutes to testify
against him.
	   ``I told him, `If that's the game you want to play, I can also
line up prostitutes,''' who would make the same allegations against
other ministers, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was
under investigation on charges contained in a book that has
widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar could jeopardize national security.
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are being tried for defamation.
	   Anwar, who hugged his wife, Aziza, as she stood next to him
during the news conference, said he expected to be arrested and
would fight to prove his innocence.
	   ``I have enough documentary evidence, tapes, statutory
declarations under oath that would defend and establish my
innocence,'' he said, adding that his associates and family had
been harassed by the police.
	   The Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National
Organization met Thursday night to discuss Anwar's position in the
party. Anwar is UMNO vice president, though it was likely he would
be stripped of the post.
	   It appeared that some of Anwar's allies were abandoning him. The
leader of the UMNO youth wing, once seen as Anwar's power base,
announced Thursday they stood by Mahathir.
	   Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor, had been left out
of economic decisions for months after differing with his boss on
the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997.
	   The country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last
decade, formally went into recession last week after its economy
shrank another 6.8 percent.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency. Mahathir
and his chief economic aide, Daim Zainuddin, have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy.
	   Anwar said he still held affection for Mahathir.
	   ``I do regard him as a father, although not all fathers treat
their children fairly,'' he said.

Russian currency sinks; Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin presenting anti-crisis measures to

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday as
President Boris Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament headed for a
showdown vote over the president's candidate to lead a new
government.
	   Amid the political wrangling, Russia's financial crisis went
from bad to worse Thursday, a day after the government acknowledged
it was powerless to stop the collapse of the Russian ruble.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 13.5 rubles to the dollar (7.4
cents for each ruble), but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to
the dollar (5.7 cents).
	   At currency exchange booths in central Moscow, operators lowered
the ruble rate on their billboards several times Thursday in an
effort to keep up with the crashing currency. Just last month, the
ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents each) before it
began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians
not to panic and to leave their money in banks, where he assured
them it would be safe. But the plummeting currency was certain to
make depositors nervous and increase demand for dollars and other
foreign currencies.
	   Chernomyrdin presented a series of measures to a group of
officials headed by chief tax collector Boris Fyodorov, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. The group is trying to hammer out
solutions to the crisis.
	   ``The country has once again been pushed into economic
turmoil,'' Chernomyrdin said at the start of a meeting with
regional governors. ``We are to establish what we must do to ward
off and avoid tremors.''

Russian visas will no longer restrict cities to be visited
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Starting next month, Russian visas will no longer
list the cities that foreigners are allowed to visit, an official
said Thursday.
	   Until now, Russian visas included a line called ``points of
visit,'' which listed the cities _ typically between one and six _
that the holder of the visa was allowed to visit. Visitors had to
get special permission to travel to a city not listed on the visa.
	   ``The practice was inherited from the time of the Cold War and
reflected past ideas about the procedures of foreigners' entry and
stay in our country,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said.
	   Last year, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree saying
foreigners could move freely around the country, regardless of
which cities were listed on their visas. But many airport officials
remained unaware of the new regulation, and continued to block
foreigners from traveling around.
	   All Russian visas issued after Oct. 1 will say ``any'' in the
``points of visit'' line, Rakhmanin said. Russia will eventually
change the visa format to scrap the item altogether, he said.
	   Foreigners will still have to identify the cities they want to
visit on their visa applications, but they will not be limited to
those cities.
	   Foreigners may still have to register with the local visa office
in each city they visit, Rakhmanin said.

Report: VW to introduce a three-liter car this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen will introduce its
gas-saving ``three-liter'' car on Sept. 29 at a Paris auto show, a
German newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The small, lightweight car will use three liters of gas (about
three-quarters of a gallon) per 100 kilometers (60 miles), compared
to between six and 12 liters for other European-made cars.
	   A Volkswagen AG spokesman refused to comment on the
Braunschweiger Zeitung report. But at the presentation of VW's new
Lupo model in Geneva earlier this week, VW director Ferdinand Piech
said the Lupo was ``the base model for our three-liter car.''
	   The ``three-liter'' car is expected to save gas, in part,
because of its lightweight, aluminum motor. But it will only
achieve its economical peak during optimum driving conditions: 90
kph (55 mph), on a straight road with no braking.
	   The Lupo _ just 3.5 meters (about 11 feet) long _ costs 17,990
marks (dlrs 10,100). The ``three-liter'' car will be pricier, at
24,000 marks (dlrs 13,483), the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland visited Geneva
airport Thursday to offer her sympathy to relatives of those killed
when a Swissair plane crashed off the coast of Canada.
	   ``This is a time of great grief and sorrow,'' Madeleine May
Kunin said told reporters visiting a crisis center set up at the
airport to help counsel next-of-kin.
	   A number of families and a number of Americans were at the
center, Kunin said, but declined to give more details. The flight
originated in New York.
	   The ambassador said she had ``terrific sympathy for the family
and friends of those who perished.''
	   ``It is the kind of situation that leaves you at a loss for
words,'' Kunin said, adding that outsiders could help ``with our
humanity.''
	   The nationality of all of the victims remained unclear. Pierre
Froidevaux, chief of the airport's emergency medical team, said
conversation in the crisis center was mostly in French, the local
language of western Switzerland.

first 'glimmer of hope' &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- American diplomacy has produced a good
first step toward ending the crisis in Kosovo, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Thursday. Austria's foreign minister
spoke of a ``glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful solution to violence
in the Serbian province.
	   Albright stopped here on her way home from the U.S.-Russian
summit in Moscow for the first bilateral visit to Vienna by a U.S.
secretary of state.
	   She briefed Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on the summit and diplomatic efforts in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from
Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in
Kosovo, but Serbs consider the province their historic heartland.
	   Albright said that during the U.S.-Russian talks, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was ``very much in charge during the
meetings and directing the process'' but added that Communist
members of the Russian Duma, or parliament, were increasing their
strength.
	   ``It is up to countries with market economies and democracy to
continue those (democratic) forces within Russia and to make very
clear there is no going backwards'' to a planned economy and
authoritarian rule.
	   On Kosovo, both Albright and the Austrians expressed
encouragement over efforts by U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill,
who won an agreement in principle this week from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the main Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, for an interim accord granting self-rule to Kosovo's
Albanian majority.
	   The accord, which has not yet been made final, falls short of
the Albanian demand for full independence but would be reviewed
after about three years.
	   ``We see this as a good procedural step forward,'' Albright told
reporters. ``We want to make sure that the violence is ended and
that there is action to let the humanitarian workers to be able to
get in to deal with the over now 250,000 displaced people.''
	   Albright also said that if force is required, ``the nations that
agree must be ready to act.'' She said Russians and Americans both
believed it was critical now for Milosevic to halt the fighting.
	   Speaking to reporters along with Albright, Schuessel said that
``for the first time there is a glimmer of hope'' in Kosovo. But he
cautioned: ``Don't think that the solution is there. This is a
small hope, but it is part of a diplomatic process.''
	   During the Moscow summit, Albright said she and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov had discussed the possibility of sending
to Kosovo additional international monitors ``who by their numbers
would be able to resist some of the pressures'' that Serb security
forces have imposed on international aid workers.
	   But she said she and Primakov did not specifically discuss
Moscow's participation in a military ``stabilization force''
similar to the one enforcing the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the
Bosnian War.
	   ``We're very concerned about the fact that winter is six weeks
away and that what is already a very bad humanitarian situation
will be exacerbated by the weather,'' she said.
	   Later, in a speech to delegates from the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Albright described the
Kosovo crisis as ``by far the biggest challenge we face in the
Balkans today.''

Annan holds Congo peace talks at nonaligned summit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mugabe saying peace parley to be held in three

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila's
main military ally _ Zimbabwe _ all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from the capital Kinshasa and were knifing
eastward into rebel territory in the vast central African nation.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared at
a summit of the Nonaligned Movement in this Indian Ocean city. ``We
have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain it cannot fall
and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Taking the podium minutes later, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni complained that foreign troops were propping up a
government which ``has not been elected.'' Kabila led a rebellion
last year that ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   For the first time, Museveni also acknowledged Ugandan troops
are in rebel-held territory in eastern Congo. He did not respond to
Kabila's allegations that Ugandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   The talks here have led to a shift in South Africa's position on
intervention by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
	   Before he had sought to promote diplomacy and negotiations to
stop the fighting, but on Thursday he told reporters it was
``reasonable'' for outside countries to give the military aid
Kabila had requested.
	   Mugabe told a news conference that all factions involved in the
party planned to meet in three days at an as-yet undetermined site.
There was no immediate confirmation from other delegations that
they would participate in the talks.
	   Noteably absent from any of the talks has been the rebels.
Kabila has ruled out a cease-fire, saying Rwandan and Ugandan
troops must first leave Congo.
	   Annan on Thursday said he was ``very encouraged'' by peace talks
he has held at the summit with Kabila, Mugabe, Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and South African President Nelson Mandela.
Annan planned to meet later Thursday with the presidents of Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   ``I think we'll be leaving South Africa encouraged with what has
transpired. The people of Congo have suffered far too long for us
not to bring this to a solution,'' Annan told reporters Thursday.
	   But he could offer no concrete progress. And with the rebellion
reeling, events on the battlefield were overtaking peace
initiatives.
	   Defense chiefs from Kabila's military allies agreed in a meeting
in Angola Wednesday to end their involvement soon in the Congolese
war.
	   ``We intervened to prevent a military power-grab. This first
step was completed successfully,'' Angolan armed forces chief Gen.
Joao de Matos told reporters in Angola's capital, Luanda.
	   Kabila made a surprise appearence at the summit Wednesday, using
the opportunity to blast Rwanda and Uganda, saying they had invaded
his vast central African country. He left hours later.
	   The Nonaligned Movement, in a draft resolution obtained by The
Associated Press, didn't take sides in the conflict. The heads of
state expressed ``deep concern'' over the war, saying it threatened
regional peace, and called for a cease-fire, to create a
``conducive environment for negotiations.''
	   The conflict has dominated the summit of developing countries,
which is striving to move away from its Cold War origins and carve
out a new political and economic role for the world's poorer
nations.
	   Mugabe, meanwhile, denied there was a rift between himself and
South African leaders. The Star of Johannesburg reported Thursday
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki wrote Mugabe an angry letter accusing
him of not cooperating in peace efforts, but Mugabe said he never
received such a letter and called Zimbabwean-South African
relations ``very good.''

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Basking in a warm welcome and
hailed as a peacemaker, President Bill Clinton urged Catholics and
Protestants to pull together with ``courage and reconciliation'' to
build a new Northern Ireland. ``America will continue to walk the
road of renewal with you,'' he declared.
	   Speaking to the 108-member assembly that will make fateful
decisions, Clinton said the line between peace and those who would
destroy it was being erased.
	   ``So much more unites you than divides you,'' Clinton told the
assemblage of lawmakers and citizens at Waterfront Hall.
	   ``The American people know from our own experience about bigotry
and violence,'' Clinton said, ``We know we are wiser, stronger and
happier when we stand on common ground and we know you will be
too.''
	   Shortly after Air Force One touched down in this storied
province, Clinton went into private meetings with one-time foes now
enmeshed in creating a new government under the terms of an accord
he helped broker last April.
	   ``What can I do to help?'' he asked in opening a briefing on the
shaky peace accord with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the
two appointed leaders of Northern Ireland's embryonic government,
David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.
	   The most emotional part of the day promised to be Clinton's
meetings with victims of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland,
most recently in Omagh where a bombing killed 28 people and wounded
more than 330 on Aug. 15.
	   ``The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the troubles; it
was the opening shot of a vicious attack on the peace. The question
is not whether there will be more bombs and atempts to undo with
violence the verdict of the ballot box. There well may be,'' he
said.
	   Still, optimism was the day's overarching theme. Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, showed off the day's
headline in the Independent, announcing that Trimble, the Ulster
Unionist leader, had agreed to meet with Gerry Adams, whose Sinn
Fein group is allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Berger called it a breakthrough. ``This is the headline we
wanted to see when we got here,'' he enthused to reporters.
	   Leading Catholic and Protestant assembly members spoke warmly of
brotherhood. Mallon, the Catholic deputy first minister, paid
tribute to Clinton's central role in the peace process and said
``we firmly believe that a bright tomorrow dawns for all of us.''
	   Trimble, a Protestant who is first minister of the assembly,
pledged unionists and nationalists would work together. ``If we do
not take this opportunity, our children and our children's
children, will not understand,'' he said.
	   At stop after stop here, praise was heaped on Clinton for
shepherding the peace accord.
	   Before his formal address, Clinton, in what press secretary Mike
McCurry likened to a ``college mixer,'' worked Stormont's Long
Hall, where elected members of Northern Ireland's assembly stood
grouped by parties to greet the president.
	   The Sinn Fein party, including Adams, was there in force. At a
later ground-breaking for the Springvale Educational Village in
West Belfast, Clinton made a special point of thanking Adams.
	   In advance of the president's arrival, the Sinn Fein leader won
a meeting with Trimble by issuing a dramatic declaration that
violence must end. That statement came closer than ever before to
declaring a stop to the violence that has left more than 3,400
people dead over the past three decades.
	   Blair hailed the move as one sign that ``possibilities do exist
for a genuine and lasting peace if we can reach out and grasp it.''
	   ``Those who still hanker after terror have no face ... that is a
big and fundamental change,'' the prime minister said.
	   Clinton agreed to do what he could to isolate and eliminate any
private American financial support to splinter groups trying to
undermine peace, McCurry said.
	   As Clinton launched his fast-paced tour, Britain and Ireland,
determined to crush violent IRA dissidents, pushed anti-terrorist
legislation toward passage.
	   In his speech, Clinton pressed both sides to meet conditions of
the peace accord: decommissioning ``the weapons of war,'' forming
an executive council, adapting the police forces, ending street
violence and pursuing the early release of prisoners whose
organizations have renounced violence.
	   ``Courage and reconciliation must drive this assembly in very
specific ways. ... These must be the benchmarks of the new Northern
Ireland,'' he said.
	   From the Omagh bombing site, Clinton was also venturing to
Armagh, the most venerated of Irish cities, which St. Patrick
called ``my sweet hill.''
	   James Steinberg, the president's deputy national security
adviser, said Wednesday that with Adams' statement violence-prone
groups were on the run.
	   ``They're defensive. They're unwilling to stand up and defend
the actions they have taken,'' Steinberg said.
	   Adams' declaration marked another step away from the IRA's once
unshakable determination to bomb and shoot until Northern Ireland
was abolished.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- U.S. diplomacy has produced a good first
step toward ending the Kosovo crisis, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Thursday. Austria's foreign minister spoke of a
``glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful solution.
	   Albright stopped here on her way home from the U.S.-Russian
summit in Moscow for the first bilateral visit to Vienna by a U.S.
secretary of state.
	   She briefed Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on the summit and diplomatic efforts in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from
Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia.
	   Albright said that during the U.S.-Russian talks, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was ``very much in charge during the
meetings and directing the process'' but she added there was an
``increasing strength'' of Communist members in the Russian Duma,
or parliament.
	   ``It is up to countries with market economies and democracy to
continue those (democratic) forces within Russia and to make very
clear there is no going backwards'' to a planned economy and
authoritarian rule.
	   On Kosovo, both Albright and the Austrians expressed
encouragement over efforts by U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill,
who won an agreement in principle this week from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the main Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, for an interim accord granting self-rule to Kosovo's
Albanian majority.
	   The accord, which is yet to be finalized, falls short of the
Albanian demand for full independence but would be reviewed after
about three years.
	   ``We see this as a good procedural step forward,'' Albright told
reporters. ``We want to make sure that the violence is ended and
that there is action to let the humanitarian workers to be able to
get in to deal with the over now 250,000 displaced people.''
	   Albright also said that if force is required ``the nations that
agree must be ready to act.'' She said the Russians as well as the
Americans believed it was critical now for Milosevic ``to halt the
violence.''
	   Speaking to reporters along with Albright, Schuessel said ``for
the first time there is a glimmer of hope'' in Kosovo but
cautioned, ``Don't think that the solution is there. This is a
small hope but it is part of a diplomatic process.''
	   During the summit, Albright said she and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov had discussed the possibility of sending
additional international monitors to Kosovo ``who by their numbers
would be able to resist some of the pressures'' imposed on
international aid workers by Serb security forces.
	   But she said she and Primakov did not specifically discuss
Moscow's participation in a military ``stabilization force''
similar to the one that is enforcing the 1995 Dayton accords which
ended the Bosnian War.
	   ``We're very concerned about the fact that winter is six weeks
away and that what is already a very bad humanitarian situation
will be exacerbated by the weather,'' she said.
	   Later, in a speech to delegates from the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Albright described the
Kosovo crisis as ``by far the biggest challenge we face in the
Balkans today.''
	   She said the Clinton Administration was preparing to provide an
additional dlrs 20 million in aid to Kosovo Albanians displaced by
the fighting.

Basque party linked to ETA changes initials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The political party linked to the armed ETA
Basque separatist group is changing its name to ward off government
attempts to outlaw the party, its spokesman said Thursday.
	   Herri Batasuna, which means ``Our Country'' in the Euskera
(Basque)language, will field candidates for the Oct. 25 regional
elections under the new name, Euskal Herritarrok, or EH, meaning
``Basque People Party.'' It has 15 days to formally register the
new name in time for the elections.
	   ``It's a fact that the Spanish state wants to outlaw Herri
Batasuna,'' said Arnaldo Otegi, the party spokesman.
	   He said the party's 20-year support for an independent Basque
nation in northern Spain and southern France will continue.
	   Herri Batasuna holds two seats in the national Parliament and 11
in the Basque regional legislature and is strongly represented in
many Basque city and town councils. It has never condemned any of
the attacks carried out by ETA commandos. ETA has killed nearly 800
people over the last 30 years.
	   A more conservative Basque party questioned the real motives of
the name change.
	   ``It corresponds more to a change of image,'' said Inaxio
Oliveri, of the Basque party Eusko Alkartasuna. ``HB is searching
for a more friendly image and to (appear)less involved in the world
of ETA,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the government said it was now up to the new party
prove it is willing to change more than its name.
	   ``The important thing Herri Batasuna must do is to ask ETA to
lay down its arms,'' said the government's parliamentary spokesman
Jose Maria Michavila.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out any contact with
Herri Batasuna unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA stops
killing.
	   According to the private news agency Europa Press, Herri
Batasuna has feared being outlawed since June, when National Court
Judge Baltasar Garzon shut down Egin, a Basque separatist newspaper
the government claims took orders directly from ETA.

Woman who shot pro-Israeli leader freed from detention

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's militia ally on Thursday
released one of Lebanon's most prominent prisoners, a female
communist who shot and seriously wounded the group's leader 10
years ago.
	   Hours after her release, Soha Bishara, 31, told reporters that
she did not regret trying to kill Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
	   ``It was our duty to liberate our land ... from the start I did
not consider it a crime. I don't consider him (Lahd) a Lebanese. I
considered him a Jew and continue to do so,'' she told a news
conference.
	   Despite 10 years in custody, six of them in solitary
confinement, Bishara appeared fit. She smiled and waved ``V'' for
victory signs to supporters and reporters.
	   The circumstances of her release were unclear.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said French President Jacques Chirac
played a key role in securing Bishara's freedom.
	   But the SLA said she was ordered freed on ``pure humanitarian
reasons'' by Lahd, a retired Lebanese army general who is
neighboring Israel's only remaining ally in Lebanon.
	   In June, France played a role in a swap in which Israel and the
SLA freed 55 Lebanese prisoners in return for the remains of an
Israeli commando.
	   Bishara walked out of the Khiam detention camp in the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT).
From there she was driven to Beirut to meet with Hariri.
	   ``You have raised Lebanon's head high,'' Hariri said, adding
that she was free to stay in Lebanon or go to France, Lebanon's
former colonial ruler where thousands of Lebanese of various
political and religious affiliations have sought asylum.
	   State-run television linked Bishara's fate to France's reported
granting of citizenship to Lahd and senior SLA officers when or if
Israel withdraws its army from southern Lebanon. The Israelis keep
troops there in an effort to prevent guerrilla incursions against
northern Israel.
	   Lahd commands the 2,500-strong SLA, the local Lebanese militia
that is armed, trained and paid by Israel to help its troops patrol
the occupied zone. He has been sentenced to death in absentia for
treason by the Lebanese Military Tribunal in Beirut.
	   Bishara, a communist activist, shot Lahd on Nov. 7, 1988, at his
house in Marjayoun, the main town in the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   She reportedly used a 5.5 mm pistol that was said to have been a
gift to Lebanese communist leaders from Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
	   Lahd, 67, survived with serious injuries and was treated in
Israel. Bishara was captured and was held at the SLA-run detention
center in Khiam without being charged or put on trial the whole
time.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila's
main military ally _ Zimbabwe _ all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from the capital Kinshasa and were knifing
eastward into rebel territory in the vast central African nation.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared at
a summit of the Nonaligned Movement in this Indian Ocean city. ``We
have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain it cannot fall
and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Taking the podium minutes later, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni complained that foreign troops were propping up a
government which ``has not been elected.'' Kabila led a rebellion
last year that ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   For the first time, Museveni also acknowledged Ugandan troops
are in rebel-held territory in eastern Congo. He did not respond to
Kabila's allegations that Ugandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   The talks here have led to a shift in South Africa's position on
intervention by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
	   Before, President Nelson Mandela had sought to promote diplomacy
and negotiations to stop the fighting, but on Thursday he told
reporters it was ``reasonable'' for outside countries to give the
military aid Kabila had requested.
	   Mugabe told a news conference that all factions involved in the
party planned to meet in three days at an as-yet undetermined site.
There was no immediate confirmation from other delegations that
they would participate in the talks.
	   Noteably absent from any of the talks has been the rebels.
Kabila has ruled out a cease-fire, saying Rwandan and Ugandan
troops must first leave Congo.
	   Annan on Thursday said he was ``very encouraged'' by peace talks
he has held at the summit with Kabila, Mugabe, Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mandela. Annan planned to meet later
Thursday with the presidents of Rwanda and Uganda.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea placed their forces on
increased alert Thursday and pledged stronger military cooperation
after signs emerged that North Korea was preparing for another
ballistic missile test.
	   The Japanese Parliament passed resolutions condemning North
Korea for a missile test earlier this week, and Tokyo went on a
diplomatic offensive to persuade Pyongyang to abandon possible
plans for a second launch.
	   Japan ``needs to further strengthen its precaution and
defense,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted as
telling reporters by Kyodo News agency.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura met Thursday in Tokyo
with his Korean counterpart, Hong Soon-young. The two agreed to
seek high-level meetings between their countries and the United
States later this month in New York to coordinate a response to the
North's growing missile threat, news reports said.
	   Japan's military had upgraded its level of alertness after
receiving unspecified information Thursday that North Korea was
preparing for a second test. Officials refused to say what actions
Japan was taking.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first test of the new missile and rattled Tokyo by
demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases. Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are
stationed here.
	   The North _ which has criticized Japan for making ``a fuss''
over the first test launch on Monday _ was apparently brushing off
Tokyo's calls for restraint.
	   ``They are rejecting our protests,'' Nonaka said.
	   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   Yonhap said South Korea's military has also been placed on
coastal alert. Kyodo said Japanese military ships were being
dispatched to the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile
launch.
	   The United States was also strengthening its presence in the
region. The Pentagon was sending six B-52 and B-2 stealth bombers
to the Pacific island of Guam, though officials said the warplanes
were being moved only for training.
	   Nonaka said the Japanese government was concerned the North
might conduct a second launch to coincide with the convening of its
national congress on Saturday or the country's national day
celebrations next Wednesday.
	   But Yonhap said that the South Korean government does not
believe the North will be prepared to launch another missile in
time for the Saturday congress, when de facto leader Kim Jong Il is
expected to be formally elected president.
	   Tokyo and Seoul also pledged closer military cooperation in
response to the heightened threat from the reclusive North.
	   South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek returned from a
visit to Japan on Thursday and said the two countries had agreed to
hold joint navy exercises for the purpose of search and rescue
missions in international waters. No time was set for the
exercises.
	   A second test is certain to further chill relations between
Tokyo and Pyongyang at a time when North Korea is increasingly
dependent on outside aid to stave off famine.
	   The first test has already prompted Japan to withdraw an offer
of talks on establishing diplomatic relations, and the government
has ruled out further food aid to the impoverished North.
	   Japan on Thursday refused a request from the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, to reconsider a decision
to suspend funding for an international project to build nuclear
reactors in North Korea, Kyodo reported.
	   Japan Monday suspended its dlrs 1 billion contribution to the
dlrs 4.6 billion project, which KEDO administers, in retaliation
for the missile launch.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland visited Geneva
airport Thursday to offer her sympathy to relatives of those killed
when a Swissair plane crashed off the coast of Canada.
	   ``This is a time of great grief and sorrow,'' Madeleine May
Kunin said told reporters visiting a crisis center set up at the
airport to help counsel next-of-kin.
	   A number of families were at the center, Kunin said, but she
declined to give more details. The plane, Geneva-bound Flight 111,
originated in New York.
	   ``It is the kind of situation that leaves you at a loss for
words,'' Kunin said, adding that outsiders could help ``with our
humanity.''
	   The nationality of all of the victims remained unclear. Pierre
Froidevaux, chief of the airport's emergency medical team, said
conversation in the crisis center was mostly in French, the local
language of western Switzerland.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A flotilla of coast guard and
fishing boats searching the sea early Thursday found only bodies
and debris floating in an oil slick at the site where a Swissair
jetliner went down off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. Geneva-bound Flight 111 had left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''
	   Civilian rescuers were at the scene within minutes of the crash
of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy
Simoneau said.
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat. ``You could tell by some of the things
that floated by that it didn't look real good.''
	   Maj. Michel Brisebois of the rescue center said rough weather
was working against searchers off the scenic fishing village of
Peggy's Cove. Emergency headquarters was set up in a restaurant
overlooking the community's picturesque lighthouse.
	   Ships and helicopters searching for debris 6 miles (10
kilometers) offshore were visible as broke through the light mist
following the night's rain. Dozens of police, rescue workers and
residents stood on the rocky granite coast watching the rescue
effort.
	   Searchers had not yet recovered the flight and data recorders,
aviation safety investigator Roy Bears said. Divers were using
sonar to map the debris field, which spreads over 10 kilometers,
and to search for the so-called black boxes in 150 feet (46 meters)
of water.
	   Canadian rescue official Dan Bedell said 18 bodies had been
recovered as dawn approached.
	   Sixteen of the dead were brought aboard a navy supply vessel,
HCMS Preserver, which was co-ordinating the operation. Fishermen in
small boats brought the two others to shore at Peggy's Cove.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice
Tschanz said the passengers were thought to be mostly Swiss, many
from the French-speaking west of the country. One of the crew
members was an American from Swissair partner Delta, Tschanz said.
	   Those aboard included Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at
the Harvard School of Public Health and a pioneer in the fight
against AIDS, said Dr. Peter Piot of the U.N. World Health
Organization.
	   About 10 U.N. workers returning to headquarters in Geneva were
also believed to be aboard, the United Nations said.
	   The Geneva-New York route is regularly used by officials of the
United Nations and other international agencies based in Geneva _
the world body's European headquarters.
	   Witnesses reported hearing sputtering sounds before a thunderous
crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   The flight headed out over the Atlantic, but the Swiss pilot and
co-pilot decided to turn back after reporting problems, Philippe
Bruggisser, the airline's chief executive, said in Zurich.
	   The pilot asked for permission to land in Boston, then decided
to go on to Halifax, said Walter Vollenweider, a Swissair official
in New York. Vollenweider said he had no indication of why the
pilot made that choice.
	   ``The flight deck crew reported smoke in the cockpit and
attempted an emergency landing at Halifax Airport. About 30 miles
(48 kilometers) south of the airport, the aircraft disappeared from
radar screens,'' Tschanz said.
	   The three-engine plane dumped fuel over nearby St. Margaret's
Bay before crashing, an airport worker said.
	   Four rescue planes and four helicopters were in the area as well
as the navy supply ship, navy spokeswoman Simoneau said.
	   Officials were going over the flight manifest with Swissair and
Delta officials and notifying the families of passengers early
Thursday, said Inspector Anthony Infante of the Port Authority
Police Department. The Port Authority manages Kennedy airport.
	   Infante said authorities were not releasing the names of the
passengers yet.
	   At the airports in New York and Geneva, grief counselors were on
hand for relatives of the victims. Rabbi Mendel Pevzner said more
than 100 relatives and friends had gathered at the Geneva airport.
Kennedy officials reported only a handful of relatives had shown up
there.
	   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Matt Furman said
the agency sent a 10-person team Canada from Washington, D.C.
	   It was Swissair's first crash since Oct. 7, 1979, when a
Swissair DC-8 overshot the runway in Athens while attempting to
land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were killed.
	   Speaking to reporters at the Geneva airport, Georges Schorderet,
the chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup, said the
plane was put into service in August 1991 and overhauled in August
and September last year. It had been checked, as all are, before
takeoff, he added.
	   The MD-11 is known for its reliability, even though its
manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to discontinue the model
in 2000.

Report: old airport to be transformed into new city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government unveiled Thursday a
multi-billion dollar plan to develop the old airport into a new
city by the year 2016.
	   The government will spend 36 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 4.6 billion) to transform the old Kai Tak airport into a new
city that will include housing and community facilities, two main
roads, and a 50-hectare metropolitan park, government-run Radio
Hong Kong reported.
	   The city is expected to have a population of 320,000 and provide
90,000 jobs, it added.
	   On-site preparation work will begin next month and will create
14,000 jobs during the construction phase, the report added.
	   Kai Tak was replaced in July by the new dlr-20 billion airport,
built on reclaimed land off a remote outlying island.

French president praises Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac voiced
support Thursday for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saying he is
the person who can lead Russia out of its present crisis.
	   ``Russia has to realize that it needs to reform itself to adapt
to the modern world and has to support forces that want to move
forward,'' Chirac told a news conference in Kiev during his
official visit to Ukraine.
	   ``Boris Yeltsin is a symbol of this movement,'' Chirac said.
	   Chirac said the international community is ready to help Russia
out of its financial crisis if the country starts implementing
reforms to promote the market economy and develop democracy.
	   ``The main thing is that Russia must exercise a modern approach
to economic development and promote a democratic view of society,''
Chirac said.
	   ``We support such policies and are ready to support the person
who will implement them,'' the French president said of Yeltsin.

Purchase of dlrs 40 million painting triggers an uproar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMS101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Art experts praise the painting as
the pinnacle of abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian's career, but
critics see only a dlrs 40 million white elephant.
	   Jolting the usually tranquil Dutch art world, auditors opened a
preliminary probe as complaints mounted Thursday that taxpayers'
money may have been squandered acquiring ``Victory Boogie Woogie''
for a museum.
	   As with most high-priced art megapurchases, people are asking
whether the 127-by-127-centimeter (50.8-by-50.8-inch) unfinished
painting is worth that kind of pricetag.
	   ``This is outrageous,'' declared art historian Bob van den
Boogert at Amsterdam's Rembrandt House Museum.
	   ``I think the majority of Dutch people actually hate Mondrian,''
he said, noting that entire galleries were deserted during a big
Mondrian exhibit in 1994.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' a diamond-shaped collage of small
squares in bold blues, reds and yellows, was done in oil and black
crayon with pieces of paper and plastic. The Dutch master created
it in New York between 1942 and his death in 1944.
	   The private National Art Collection Funds purchased the work
last week with part of a donation of 110 million guilders (dlrs 55
million) from the Dutch Central Bank, which said the money was part
of its profits in 1998.
	   The highly publicized buy, the most expensive art purchase ever
by the Dutch state, has aroused the curiosity of the national Court
of Audit, an independent body that investigates government
expenditures.
	   A preliminary investigation is already under way, and court
spokeswoman Marijke Ram said a full-scale probe could ensue to
determine whether public money was used ``prudently.''
	   Another work by Mondrian fetched dlrs 8 million at auction in
1990.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' which belonged to American magazine
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. and hung in an apartment in
New York, will be added to the permanent collection of The Hague
Municipal Museum, already home to the largest Mondrian collection
in the world. It goes on display there on Oct. 29.
	   In a brochure describing Mondrian's works, museum director Hans
Locher said ``Boogie Woogie'' emerged out of the gloomy years of
World War II and was a ``triumphant response'' to the war.
	   It is ``the image of the victory of the joy of life and
freedom,'' Locher said. The art fund that bought it calls it one of
the most important artworks of the 20th century.
	   The purchase was significant because Dutch collections were
still missing works from the final years of Mondrian's career, said
museum spokesman Gerrit de Rook.
	   Although it certainly has its detractors _ one man even told a
newspaper, ``Return that thing. I almost threw up'' _ others say
it's a masterpiece worth every penny.
	   ``It costs what it costs,'' Joop Joosten, a former curator of
Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, told the daily De
Volkskrant. ``You won't get it for anything less. And the longer
you wait, the more expensive it gets.''

South African officials promising safe athletics World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After a fatal restaurant
bombing last month prompted safety concerns, local officials
Thursday told athletes coming to the track and field World Cup not
to worry.
	   ``Measures are being taken to ensure the safety all those
attending the World Cup and the participants,'' Paul Mashatile, the
top provincial security official, told reporters.
	   ``No athlete need worry about his or her security,'' he said.
	   Some American athletes expressed concern about taking part in
the Sept. 11-13 meet following the Aug. 25 bombing of a Planet
Hollywood in Cape Town.
	   The blast killed two people and injured 26. Police have not
determined who was responsible, but government officials had linked
it to the U.S. anti-terror attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan five
days before.
	   The holding of future big sporting events in South Africa is on
the line.
	   ``The events next week will influence other sporting
institutions which may be looking at staging major international
tournaments in South Africa, such as the World Cup soccer,'' said
Danie Malan, chairman of the track event.
	   The finals-only event will feature eight teams: the United
States, Africa, The Americas, Asia, Oceania (Australia and New
Zealand), Europe and the two national teams from the recent
European Championships. In men's competition, the winners were
Germany and Great Britain. The women's champions were Germany and
Russia.
	   The spotlight will be on American Marion Jones, who is expected
to take part in the 100 and 200 meters, the long jump and the
400-meter relay. She is undefeated in 28 consecutive finals in five
different events over the past six months.

Six new sports as Commonwealth Games fights for survival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jonah Lomu vs. David Campese.
Curtly Ambrose vs. Sachin Tendulkar.
	   Commonwealth Games fans will see clashes such as these for the
first time as the sports meeting of a long lost empire fights for
relevance in a packed calendar.
	   Facing a decline in interest and competition from grands prix,
World Cups and world championships, Commonwealth Games organizers
needed something new to spice up their event and this year's host
provided the answer.
	   When the 1998 Games open Sept. 11 in Kuala Lumpur, they will
welcome six new sports to the program, a move which has inflated
the number of participants from 3,200 four years ago to 6,000.
	   Limited overs cricket, sevens rugby, men's and women's field
hockey, netball, squash, and tenpin bowling are on the schedule in
Malaysia.
	   ``The future of the Commonwealth Games was threatened if it
stayed the same size because it has a difficult time competing with
a crowded sports calendar,'' Australian Commonwealth Games
Association general manager Perry Crosswhite said. ``There was a
need for the Games to be able to compete on a world scale and not
get swallowed up at the end of the day.''
	   When Malaysia lodged its initial bid, against Australian city
Adelaide, both were based on a 10-sport program. But the Malaysians
have embraced the expansion of the Commonwealth Games to a point
far outstripping the Commonwealth's spiritual leader, England.
	   While the All Blacks giant winger Lomu will play alongside the
world's most exciting fullback Christian Cullen for New Zealand's
rugby team, and Australia's record try-scorer Campese leads out an
inexperienced outfit, the English have thrown up a side devoid of
stars.
	   England's decision to miss the cricket altogether has been
called an ``absolute disgrace'' by former Australian test captain
Ian Chappell.
	   England's players decided not to go because they will not be
paid, while in contrast the Australians are looking forward to
getting out of their fishbowl and getting into the athletes
village.
	   ``Kicking back with (Olympic swimming champion) Kieren
Perkins,'' is how Australian paceman Mike Kasprowicz pictures it.
	   So while the Games will benefit from the new sports, the
sportsmen and women will benefit in return.
	   Players from all the test countries except England will play in
the 16-team cricket competition, including Jamaica, Barbados and
Antigua.
	   For these West Indian countries the cricket competition will be
a source of great pride. Ambrose will meet both Australian rival
Steve Waugh and Indian maestro Tendulkar in the first-round pool
games. If he, and teammate Richie Richardson, can work a few
miracles, they may even get to play against Sri Lankan heroes
Sanath Jayasuriya and Muttiah Muralitharan for a gold medal.
	   While Australia will have its top cricket team in Kuala Lampur,
its rugby side has been robbed of Wallabies because of this month's
World Cup qualifying games. Still, coach Mark Ella believes they
can overcome world sevens champions Fiji and a strong New Zealand
team.
	   ``They realize that they are not Wallabies, they are nobodies
really, but they can make something of a name for themselves in
Kuala Lumpur,'' Ella said of his players.
	   Squash is another event featuring the world's best in a sport
dominated by Commonwealth players. Scotland's Peter Nicol is gold
medal favorite in the men's draw, based on his world No.1 ranking,
while it is uncertain if Jansher Khan will turn up because of
private problems in Malaysia.
	   Australians Michelle Martin and Sarah Fitz-Gerald are seeded to
contest the women's final while national coach Geoff Hunt believes
the sport's arrival at the Games is crucial for its continuing
popularity.
	   Australia also has the world's No. 1 netball team, which has won
73 of its past 75 tests and is considered an unbeatable gold medal
favorite.
	   Even tenpin bowling, seen as a good way to occupy the
10-year-olds on a rare rainy day Down Under, has entered the
newspapers. Australian Cara Honeychurch is the world amateur
champion and the leading player in Australia, man or woman.
	   Australia won a record 87 gold medals four years ago in
Victoria, 47 ahead of its nearest rival Canada, and the new sports
are likely to help widen the gap rather than narrow it.
	   The country is the favorite to win the men's and women's field
hockey events, although the men are notoriously poor at claiming
titles they are favored for.
	   The decision to expand can also be linked to television rights.
More athletes in more exciting team sports helps extract more money
from the broadcasters which means more for the hosts.
	   Australian rights holders paid about (U.S.) dlrs 600,000 to show
the 1990 Games in Auckland. Kuala Lumpur has cost the same outlet
(U.S.) dlrs 15 million and the ratings are expected to be far
higher than the Atlanta Olympics. That's because Australians love
watching Australians win gold, and watching Campo take on Lomu.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A flotilla of coast guard and
fishing boats searching the sea early Thursday found only bodies
and debris floating in an oil slick at the site where a Swissair
jetliner went down off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Swissair said Thursday that the plane's 215 passengers _ two of
them babies _ and 14 crew members were killed in Wednesday night's
crash. Geneva-bound Flight 111 had left New York's Kennedy
International Airport at 8:17 p.m. (0017 GMT).
	   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We have no indication
that terrorism was involved.''
	   In Geneva, Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive officer of
Swissair's parent group, told a press conference Thursday that 136
Americans were on board _ the largest single group.
	   The other passengers included some 30 French and 28 Swiss
citizens; six British citizens; three Germans; three Italians two
Greeks. One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia.
	   Bruggisser said passengers' names will be released only when all
the victims' relatives have been informed.

	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Actress Sophia Loren couldn't make it, so
her producer husband Carlo Ponti filled in to accept a career award
at the opening ceremony Thursday at the Venice Film Festival.
	   The Italian-born actress, 63, was hospitalized in New York last
month and examined for an arrhythmia, a variation in the normal
rhythm of the heartbeat, which can be fatal. She was released after
a few days.
	   Ponti said Loren is doing fine, and only needs a period of rest.
	   Also on the opening day of the festival was Steven Spielberg's
World War II epic movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' showing out of
competition.
	   Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who stars in the movie, were in Venice
to attend the screening of the film, already a hit in the United
States.
	   The competition for Golden Lion award starts on Friday and
features 19 movies, including Abel Ferrara's ``New Rose Hotel,''
Emir Kusturica's ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' and ``Rounders,''
featuring Hollywood's latest star Matt Damon.
	   The 55th edition of the festival runs hrough Sept. 13.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,127.4 points at the end of the trading week, down 63.6
points, or 2.90 percent, from the previous week, the National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   The fall was due to selling for profit-taking and for avoiding
possible future losses, a weekly report released by the company
said.
	   Trading volume fell considerably this week to 429.72 million
shares, a 48 percent decline from last week, the report said. The
value of these shares followed suit with a 46 percent drop reaching
75.59 million dinars (dlrs 247.02 million).
	   Out of the 76 companies listed, the stocks of 52 were traded,
the report said. Twenty-two companies closed higher, 9 closed lower
and 21 were unchanged.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Central Bank of Jordan is offering
additional credit to two state-run financial institutions to enable
them to provide long-term and medium-term loans for new projects.
	   A CBJ official said Thursday that up to 40 million dinars (dlrs
56.3 million), 10 million dinars (dlrs 14 million) more than last
year, will be available to the Industrial Development Bank.
	   The Central Bank will charge 6.5 percent annual interest on the
credit facility to the industrial bank, one of the 10 largest
financial institutions in Jordan, the official said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Agricultural Credit Corp. will get 20 million dinars (dlrs
28 million), 10 million dinars (dlrs 14 million) more than in 1997.
The interest rate is 5.25 percent.
	   The credit facilities will allow the development bank to expand
its projects in Jordan and the agricultural corporation to offer
more loans to farmers, the official told The Associated Press.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover slipped on the

	   Shares of industrial firms dropped by 4.43 percent, commercial
banks by 2.82 percent, the services sector by 0.60 percent and the

	   It said stocks of 102 firms were traded during the week.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Investcorp E.C., the Bahrain-based

Hurricane Isis reaches Mexican mainland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ With winds of 75 mph (120 kph),
Hurricane Isis hit the Mexican mainland, drenching the state of
Sinaloa early Thursday. It was expected to weaken as it slogs north
over land toward the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona.
	   Winds overnight blasted out windows, knocked out electricity and
littered this city with downed street posts and tree limbs. The
roof at a local gas station collapsed atop a compact car, which was
apparently unoccupied.
	   Rescue workers said there were reports of some injuries, but no
details were immediately available in this city of 300,000 some 400
miles southeast of the U.S. border at Arizona.
	   Isis _ downgraded to a tropical storm _ continued to dump heavy
rains, but it was losing force Thursday morning, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
	   At 1200 GMT, the center of Isis was about 80 miles (129
kilometers) north of Los Mochis, the center said. It was moving
north about 10 mph (16 kph) .
	   Maria Florencia Pedroza, one of about 500 people who fled
low-lying neighborhoods, said she went to a Red Cross shelter at a
school when ``the water started coming into my house.''
	   ``I wasn't afraid for myself, but for my mother,'' she said. The
two were among three dozen people who slept on blankets on the
concrete floor of a school.
	   Carlos Alberto Villegas used a bucket inside his concrete-block
house in a seemingly vain attempt to bail out the lake of water
that stood just below seat level of his newly purchased sofa.
	   But early reports indicated that the storm was less disastrous
than 1995's Hurricane Ismael, which caught fishing fleets at sea
and killed more than 90 people. Local radio stations said most
boats were in harbor because the shrimp season, a mainstay of the
local economy, had not yet begun.
	   Further south in the port city of Mazatlan, flooding was
reported in 15 neighborhoods and the army helped residents
evacuate. Waves pushed some boats onto the rocks.
	   On Wednesday, Isis belted the tip of the Baja California
peninsula, cutting phones and electricity, forcing thousands of
residents from their homes and trapping tourists in storm-battered
seaside hotels.
	   One woman was killed and her husband was missing after they
tried to cross a stream in Los Cabos, said Emigdio Suarez Aguilar,
a civil protection official in Baja California Sur state. The body
of Josefina Espinosa Agundez, 48, has been recovered. Her husband
is presumed dead.
	   Notimex also reported one man was missing after being swept away
by floodwaters in Jalisco state.

Russian prices jump; still little sign of panic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prices for staple goods rose significantly
Thursday in reaction to the steady fall of the ruble, but there was
still little sign of panic buying, Russian shop owners and
consumers said.
	   ``From vodka to water, everything's going up,'' said Marina
Suruyagina, sitting behind the counter at a supermarket. ``Our
vodka is twice as expensive as it was a week ago, and cigarettes
are also up.''
	   Like the ruble rate, which varied wildly between currency
exchanges, prices were low at stores that still had old stocks,
while other sellers boosted their prices after suppliers delivered
new goods at the start of the month.
	   Prices are only likely to get worse. The ruble crashed further
on Thursday, trading on the streets at around 17 to the dollar. At
the beginning of the week it was trading close to eight.
	   At one of Moscow's main open air markets, where turnover tends
to be quick, prices varied from place to place, but were invariably
up.
	   ``Food is 50 to 60 percent higher,'' said Sonya Aleyeva from
behind a small kiosk. ``The government isn't controlling prices,
and around here they've been let loose completely.''
	   Aleyeva said bread and milk prices were up about 10 percent, and
the cost for a kilogram of some types of sausage had leapt from 22
to 40 rubles, a jump that matches the ruble's devaluation by about
half in the last week.
	   Those who will be hit hardest by the ruble's fall were painfully
aware of how much the new prices would chip away at their meager
earnings.
	   ``A package of sugar now costs five rubles instead of four,''
said pensioner Yevgeniya Afanasyeva, who lives on 400 rubles (dlrs
23 by Thursday's exchange rate) a month. ``Flour is up at least 15
percent. Oil I once got for 9 rubles is now 19 to 20 rubles,'' a
rise of more than 100 percent.
	   Afanasyeva said her fear that prices would continue upward led
her to buy as much as she could with her small pension now.
Pensions, unlike prices, are not expected to adjust to the ruble's
slide because the government is so short on cash.
	   ``Without a doubt, I'm buying more. Everybody's buying more,''
she said. ``In any case, what people can buy, they buy.''
	   Still, some store employees said business was actually down, and
shelves were full in central Moscow.
	   ``I personally am not buying any more,'' said Suruyagina, the
supermarket clerk. ``I don't think there will be a shortage of
goods because people can't buy at these prices.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man in central Japan who died after drinking
canned tea at home likely was poisoned, adding to the string of
poisonings gripping the country, police said Thursday.
	   Also Thursday, a 21-year-old worker at a convenience store in
Nagoya, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of Tokyo, was rushed to the
hospital after drinking canned apple juice from the store freezer,
police said.
	   Her illness was not critical, said a police official who gave
only his surname Ogawa.
	   In the other poisoning, Ichijuro Nakazawa, 58, collapsed after
drinking the tea at breakfast on Monday. He died at a hospital in
Obusecho, 180 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Tokyo,
prefectural police spokesman Shigehiro Ozaki said.
	   Nakazawa's wife Tsugiko reported his death to police Thursday,
the day after she heard on the news that cyanide-laced tea had been
discovered at a nearby supermarket.
	   Police quoted Tsugiko Nakazawa as saying that the can had a tiny
hole in the bottom that had been later covered up, like the one
discovered Tuesday at a nearby supermarket.
	   In that case, the supermarket manager took the can off the shelf
because it was dented, drank from it but spat out the foul-tasting
liquid. Police suspect poison might have been inserted from the
hole.
	   The tainted drinks were the latest in a series of poisoning
cases in Japan.
	   In July, four people died and dozens fell ill after eating curry
tainted with arsenic served at a community festival in Wakayama,
western Japan.
	   Last month, poisoned tea served at an office in northern Japan
made 10 people ill. Then a fake diet drink mailed to some Tokyo
homes sent a teen-ager to the hospital.
	   Insecticide was found Wednesday in a bottled drink from a
vending machine in Nara, 380 kilometers (240 miles) west of Tokyo,
but the man who took a sip quickly spat it out and was unharmed.
	   There have been no arrests in those cases.

Two suspects arrested in killing of British aid worker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to CORRECT that British woman NOT raped. Rape charge
involves earlier case, only Sho charged in that case. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELIZE CITY, Belize (AP) _ Two men were charged Wednesday in the
murder of a British aid worker killed in this Central American
country last week.
	   Ana Lightfoot, 27, was one of nine Raleigh International
volunteers helping to build a school in San Pablo, about 100 miles
(160 kilometers) from Belize City. Her body was found last Thursday
in a jungle near a village she had visited three days earlier.
	   Estevan Sho, 21, and Alan Cal, 20, both of the southern village
of Red Bank, were arraigned before a judge on charges of murder and
robbery of the British woman. Sho also was charged with an earlier
rape, whose victim alerted police to the suspects.
	   They were arrested Sunday while getting their hair cut.
	   Police say both men have confessed to killing Lightfoot.
	   At a news conference, government pathologist Mario Estadrabran
said Lightfoot apparently struggled with her attackers before she
was stabbed in the neck.
	   ``She died right away. And after she died right away, the
assailants were trying to make sure that she died and they made
repeated, superficial injuries to different parts of her body,'' he
said.
	   Police say the murder weapon, a 4-inch (10-centimeter) knife,
has been recovered.
	   The two suspects are being held without bail.
	   Raleigh International has recalled its entire 17-member team
building classrooms at San Pablo.

Israel to release Soviet spy to house arrest after 14 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court decided Thursday to release
into house arrest an elderly, ailing Israeli scientist jailed 15
years ago for spying for the former Soviet Union.
	   The state has 15 days to appeal the decision.
	   Polish-born Marcus Klingberg was sentenced to 18 years for
passing information on biological warfare. Klingberg, 80, has
suffered several strokes in prison but previous requests for early
release on health grounds were all rejected.
	   The Beersheva District Court in southern Israel, where Klingberg
is jailed, ruled Thursday in his favor however and said he could be
released under restricted conditions.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said Klingberg will only be allowed to
leave his home for medical treatment. Police surveillance will be
placed at his home, his telephone will be taped and the Shin Bet
internal security agency will decide who can visit Klingberg's
home.
	   In 1996, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Klingberg for
early release. In its decision, the court wrote that Klingberg may
still remember information that ``if exposed, could cause
unimaginable damage to national security.''
	   Klingberg was arrested and secretly sentenced in 1983. His case
was made public in British media reports in 1987 and again in
German reports in 1989 amid unsuccessful efforts to arrange an
East-West spy swap.
	   While an Israeli news blackout was lifted in 1993, mystery still
surrounds much of the case, including how Klingberg was captured.
At the time of his arrest he reportedly headed an important
research facility south of Tel Aviv.
	   Israeli newspapers have reported that Klingberg immigrated to
Israel in 1948 _ possibly as a Soviet spy _ and was last seen in
January 1983 en route to a scientific convention in western Europe.
	   His daughter Sylvia, who now lives in Paris, France told Channel
2 that she was elated by the news but sorry that the courts had
waited so long for the release.
	   ``It's too late, it's very late but I'm happy its happened,''
she said.

Former East German spymaster: No information for forecast on
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Asked to imagine himself back in his secret office
and offer a forecast on how the Russian crisis will unfurl, former
East German spymaster Marcus Wolf just shrugged his shoulders.
	   ``As an intelligence officer, I always used to base my analysis
on reliable information. I absolutely don't have such information
now,'' he told reporters Thursday. ``Those who have more
information are not offering any prognosis, either.''
	   Wolf, who presented the Russian translation of his new book in
Moscow on Thursday, said he still believes in Russia's future.
	   ``The nation has all the natural and human resources to overcome
this terribly difficult crisis,'' said the 75-year-old retired
general.
	   Wolf's memoir, ``Man Without a Face,'' was published in the
United States in 1997 before being translated into Russian as
``Game on an Alien Field.'' The book spans 30 years of his
espionage career.
	   The elusive and legendary Wolf was East Germany's spymaster from
1953 through 1986, when he retired as head of the so-called Chief
Department A and manager of some 4,000 agents.
	   During the Cold War, Wolf's agents infiltrated West German
businesses, government ministries and even the chancellor's office.
In the years when the Soviet bloc began collapsing, Wolf sought
refuge in the Soviet Union, but in 1991 he felt his days in Moscow
``were coming to an end.''
	   Wolf was arrested in Germany in 1991 for spying and charged with
treason. But a 1993 conviction and six-year prison sentence was
overturned in 1995 by an appeals court, which ruled that he was
acting on behalf of a sovereign country and could not be tried for
treason against West Germany.
	   In another trial, Wolf was given a two-year suspended sentence
for four kidnappings carried out by his agents during the Cold War.
	   At the news conference, Wolf recalled how he was contacted by
the CIA in 1990 but dismissed the U.S. agency's advances.
	   ``They made some flattering remarks, offered me a villa in
California under the eternal sun, and other conditions,'' he said.
``I understood that the CIA was looking for a Soviet mole.''
	   That mole turned out to be Aldrich Ames, the most damaging
turncoat in the CIA's history, blamed for the loss of at least a
dozen Soviet bloc officials spying for the West. Seized in 1994,
Ames pleaded guilty to selling secrets to the Soviets for more than
dlrs 2.5 million, beginning in 1985, and was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
	   ``I did not know the name Ames then. Our colleagues did not
reveal such information,'' said Wolf.
	   The former spymaster, still alert, tanned and looking much
younger than his age, denied suggestions that some of his former
agents were working for Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service now,
and said most of his moles in the West have been exposed.
	   Wolf said his main achievement was outside his exploits as a
spymaster.
	   ``I have 11 grandchildren now,'' he said. ``The state I've
served has collapsed, so I'm often asked if my life was spent in
vain. At least because of them, I haven't lived in vain.''

Dollar down on rumored Soros selling, gold down

 &UR; EDs: LEADS with rumors about Soros selling dollars versus marks,
fresh dollar rates against other currencies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The U.S. dollar plunged against other major
currencies Thursday, hitting fresh lows against the German mark
amid speculation that investor George Soros was aggressively
selling the greenback.
	   Gold prices were also lower.
	   As the dollar dropped to 1.7229 marks, from 1.7520 on Wednesday,
Dow Jones Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying Soros was
selling dollars for marks in New York.
	   Soros would not say whether or not he was involved in the
selloff that pushed the dollar to levels unseen against the mark
since November.
	   ``It's the policy of Soros Fund Management not to comment on the
rumors of the marketplace,'' said Soros spokesman Shawn Pattison.
	   Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
	   _ 134.33 Japanese yen, down from 137.72
	   _ 1.4160 Swiss francs, down from 1.4398
	   _ 5.7753 French francs, down from 5.8646
	   _ 1.9447 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9757
	   _ 1,701.99 Italian lire, down from 1,727.96
	   _ 1.5345 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5517
	   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.6818, up from dlrs
1.6681.
	   London dealers fixed a recommended gold price of dlrs 279.65 bid
per troy ounce at midmorning, down from the closing price of dlrs
279.90 bid Wednesday.
	   In Zurich the bid price was dlrs 279.15, down from dlrs 280.20
late Wednesday.
	   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell dlrs 1.50 to close at dlrs
278.95 bid.
	   Silver opened in London at dlrs 4.77 bid troy ounce, down from
dlrs 4.82 bid Wednesday.

Swissair: 136 Americans on crash flight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, adds further details, restores

 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swissair said late Thursday 136 U.S. citizens were
among those killed in the crash of an MD-11 jet traveling from New
York to Geneva.
	   Americans far outnumbered victims of other nationalities,
Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive officer of Swissair's parent
group SAirGroup, told a press conference in Zurich.
	   There were 30 French and 28 Swiss citizens were on board,
Bruggisser said.
	   He restated the airline's position that details of passengers'
names will be released only when all the victims' relatives have
been informed.
	   Six passengers were British, three each came from Germany and
Italy and two were from Greece, he continued.
	   One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia.
	   Bruggisser said the pilots put out an emergency ``Pan, pan,
pan'' call seven minutes before the jetliner crashed.
	   Hearing such a call, all other planes in the area would have
known that SR111 was in serious trouble.
	   Bruggisser said there was no indication of problems with the
plane that crashed. The two pilots, who had flown in the same jet
in the days preceding the accident, had reported no irregularities.
	   Its last checkup was carried out on Aug. 10. The plane, put into
service in August 1991, was given a full overhaul between Aug. 21
and Sept.. 10 last year. This February, new figures were fitted.

Purchase of dlrs 40 million painting triggers an uproar

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Art experts praise the painting as
the pinnacle of abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian's career, but
critics see only a dlrs 40 million white elephant.
	   Jolting the usually tranquil Dutch art world, auditors opened a
preliminary probe as complaints mounted Thursday that taxpayers'
money may have been squandered acquiring ``Victory Boogie Woogie''
for a museum.
	   As with most costly art megapurchases, people are asking whether
the 127-by-127-centimeter (50.8-by-50.8-inch) unfinished painting
is worth that kind of pricetag.
	   ``This is outrageous,'' declared art historian Bob van den
Boogert at Amsterdam's Rembrandt House Museum.
	   ``I think the majority of Dutch people actually hate Mondrian,''
he said, noting that entire galleries were deserted during a big
Mondrian exhibit in 1994.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' a diamond-shaped collage of small
squares in bold blues, reds and yellows, was done in oil and black
crayon with pieces of paper and plastic. The Dutch master created
it in New York between 1942 and his death in 1944.
	   The private National Art Collection Funds purchased the work
last week with part of a donation of 110 million guilders (dlrs 55
million) from the Dutch Central Bank, which said the money was part
of its profits in 1998.
	   The highly publicized buy, the most expensive art purchase ever
by the Dutch government, has aroused the curiosity of the national
Court of Audit, an independent body that investigates state
expenditures.
	   A preliminary investigation is already under way, and court
spokeswoman Marijke Ram said a full-scale probe could ensue to
determine whether public money was used ``prudently.''
	   Another work by Mondrian fetched dlrs 8 million at auction in
1990.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' which belonged to American magazine
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. and hung in an apartment in
New York, will be added to the permanent collection of The Hague
Municipal Museum, already home to the largest Mondrian collection
in the world. It goes on display there on Oct. 29.
	   In a brochure describing Mondrian's works, museum director Hans
Locher said ``Boogie Woogie'' emerged out of the gloomy years of
World War II and was a ``triumphant response'' to the war.
	   It is ``the image of the victory of the joy of life and
freedom,'' Locher said. The art fund that bought it calls it one of
the most important artworks of the 20th century.
	   Although it certainly has its detractors _ one man even told a
newspaper, ``Return that thing. I almost threw up'' _ others say
it's a masterpiece worth every penny.
	   ``It costs what it costs,'' Joop Joosten, a former curator of
Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, told the daily De
Volkskrant. ``You won't get it for anything less. And the longer
you wait, the more expensive it gets.''

Review could lead to another independent counsel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETE YOST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Attorney General Janet Reno is considering
whether President Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign tried to evade
spending limits by using so-called issue advertisements, legal
sources said Thursday.
	   Under the independent counsel law, Reno must decide by early
next week if enough information exists to open a 90-day preliminary
inquiry that could lead to appointment of a special prosecutor.
	   The Washington Post reported the president's private attorney,
David Kendall, met with Justice Department officials Wednesday in
an attempt to convince them no further investigation is warranted.
	   The newspaper said Kendall told the Justice Department that if a
formal inquiry moves forward, however, it should be directed at the
1996 campaign organization rather than at Clinton himself.
	   In another newspaper report, The Wall Street Journal said Reno
ordered the review after examining a memo subpoenaed from the
Federal Election Commission. According to the Journal, FEC auditors
strongly suggest in the memo that because the president and his top
campaign advisers were so involved in creating campaign-like TV ads
financed by the Democratic National Committee that they should be
considered campaign expenditures.
	   ``The use of issue ads was entirely legal and appropriate,''
White House spokesman James Kennedy said in a statement. ``The ads
focused on real issues before Congress and the American people, and
they made clear the differences between Democrats and Republicans
on balancing the budget, Medicare, welfare and other policy
concerns. They were cleared by legal counsel. There was no
violation of campaign spending limits. We are confident that, at
the end of its review, the Justice Department will arrive at a fair
conclusion based on the facts and the law.''
	   In federal U.S. elections, candidates are restricted in the
amount of money they can raise and spend. Political parties can
raise and spend unlimited amounts, to be used for building the
party but not for electing any specific candidate.

Sri Lanka cricketers unphased by Lloyd's criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England cricket coach David Lloyd came under
renewed fire Thursday over his remarks about an opponent's bowling
action.
	   Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga criticized him for making the
remarks about match-winning spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan and
said he didn't care if Lloyd was fired.
	   The Sri Lanka team left England Thursday, fresh from a one-off
test victory over England at the Oval last week and a triangular
limited-overs series win.
	   But Ranatunga spared a few parting words for Lloyd, who
criticized the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan but only
succeeded in spurring the champion spinner on to take 16 wickets in
Sri Lanka's 10-wicket win.
	   The England Cricket Board has demanded an explanation from Lloyd
over his criticism of Muraltharan and a public altercation with
television commentator and former test star Geoffrey Boycott after
his team's loss.
	   Lloyd, who has been reprimanded by the ECB over his behavior in
the past, could lose his job or at least face another reprimand
when he appears before the board again.
	   Ranatunga said he didn't care if Lloyd lost his job.
	   ``No coach should make comments like that about their rivals,''
he said Thursday.
	   ``I feel that when a side loses they should look at their own
problems rather than what's wrong with their opponents.
	   ``We didn't take him seriously, in fact it's just made us more
determined to go out and win.
	   ``We knew (Muralitharan) had been cleared by the International
Cricket Council and that's all that matters. The same happened when
we toured Australia (in 1995-96) and again it just made us play
better.''
	   Muralitharan, the leading international bowler this year with 68
wickets, said he did not take Lloyd's criticism seriously and the
England coach's predicament was not his problem.
	   Sri Lanka will return to England in May next year to defend its
World Cup title, while Sri Lanka's officials have also welcomed an
invitation for a three test series early in the new Millennium.

French president pledges support to Ukraine during visit

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac voiced
strong support Thursday for Ukraine's efforts to reform its economy
and pledged to increase economic cooperation with the former Soviet
republic.
	   ``We are very similar countries and we must develop economic
ties. We want to significantly increase French investment in
Ukraine,'' Chirac told reporters after meeting with his Ukrainian
counterpart Leonid Kuchma.
	   Ukraine, which is about the same size as France and has a
similar number of people, has until recently been shunned by French
investors, who are wary of bureaucratic hurdles.
	   Chirac, who was accompanied by officials from about a dozen
large French companies, said the Ukrainian government's recent
economic reform measures are bound to change the investment
climate.
	   ``Ukraine has done a lot to win the trust of foreign
investors,'' he said. ``We trust Ukraine, and believe in its
future.''
	   Of the more than dlrs 2 billion in foreign investment Ukraine
has received since independence in 1991, France accounts for dlrs
50 million, according to Ukrainian government statistics.
	   ``Unfortunately, our economic cooperation at present is far from
what it should be,'' Kuchma said. ``But the interest large French
companies are starting to express in Ukraine makes us feel
optimistic.''
	   Chirac said the sides discussed completion of Ukraine's An-70
military transport plane. France and Germany have expressed
interest in the plane, and Chirac said the project's future would
be decided by spring.
	   The two sides signed four agreements on the peaceful uses of
nuclear energy, nuclear safety and energy cooperation, and on
cooperation between Ukrainian and French law enforcement bodies.
	   The two presidents also discussed new efforts to help Ukraine
close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000. Ukraine has
stressed repeatedly that it would not close the plant, site of the
world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, until it receives financing
to complete two new nuclear reactors.
	   Chirac and Kuchma agreed to ask Britain, the current spokesman
for the Group of Seven industrialized countries, to call a special
meeting to raise funds to build the reactors.
	   ``We agree absolutely that the reactors must be completed in
order to close Chernobyl by 2000,'' Chirac said.

Germany's interest rates steady amid weakened global economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As Germany waits to see if Russia's
crisis saps its own economic growth, its central bank announced
Thursday it would not change key interest rates.
	   The decision by the Bundesbank had been expected since Russia's
economy began to unravel two weeks ago.
	   Germany's key interest rate has been fixed at 3.3 percent since
October 1997. And raising interest rates, which generally dampens
economic growth, would have been ``crazy,'' said Kai Wildfoerster,
a senior analyst at West LB in Duesseldorf.
	   ``Our economists are thinking about reducing the growth
forecast. They are waiting to see if there is any contagion'' from
Russia, Wildfoerster said.
	   The government has predicted growth for 1998 will be between 2.5
and 3 percent. But some economists say Germany should cut rates to
stimulate growth across Europe, threatened by Asia's 14-month slump
and Russia's imploding economy.
	   The issue is important because in less than four months 11
European countries will merge in one monetary zone with one central
bank, the European Central Bank, and one currency, the euro.
	   For that to happen, Europe's varying interest rates must be
merged into one uniform rate.
	   Germany's interest rates are among the lowest of the 11
countries in so-called Euroland, as the future euro-zone is known,
and expectations before Russia's economic crisis had been that
rates would be raised to help the merging process.
	   The 11 participating countries have until the end of the year to
merge their interest rates. The euro will be launched on Jan. 1.

Measles deaths dropped 60 percent in Africa, WHO says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Africa could wipe out measles as a
public health problem within the next three to five years, the
World Health Organization said Thursday.
	   The prediction was based on a drastic 60 percent drop in the
continent's death rate from measles between 1980 to 1996, according
to a statement released by WHO in the Zimbabwean capital, where
regional health leaders met.
	   Despite the success, half a million Africans continued to die
every year from the disease, representing 60 percent of worldwide
deaths from measles.
	   West Africa lags behind the rest of the continent with less than
a 50 percent immunization rate and up to a 15 percent mortality
rate for people who contract the disease, WHO said.
	   That compares with mortality rates below 4 percent in east and
southern Africa, where more than 50 percent are immunized.
	   Southern African countries pay for most measles immunizations,
unlike elsewhere in Africa.
	   The outlook is less rosy for other vaccine-preventable diseases,
especially Hepatitis B, with one sixth of the world's 360 million
Hepatitis B carriers in Africa.
	   While a polio-free zone was expanding in east and southern
Africa, four countries _ Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Angola _ are
considered reservoirs for the disease.
	   Political instability in Congo cancelled plans for immunization
clinics since last year, WHO said.

Kohl defends friendship with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-The Duel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl defended his
friendship with Boris Yeltsin on Thursday against opposition
critics who say the Russian president is part of Russia's problems.
	   In a speech to parliament, Kohl cited Yeltsin's decision to
complete the pullout of Russian troops from former communist East
Germany in the early 1990s as an example of the value of ``good
contacts with friends and partners.''
	   ``Above all, Russia is our most powerful neighbor,'' Kohl said
in a parliamentary debate marked by campaign rhetoric for Germany's
Sept. 27 elections.
	   But Gerhard Schroeder, the opposition Social Democrat who leads
in opinion polls, renewed opposition criticism of Kohl and his
``sauna friend'' _ a reference to Kohl's meetings with Yeltsin in
the steam baths of the Russian leader's estate.
	   As the West pumped in money to help nurture capitalism under
Yeltsin's rule, a few people got rich ``while the working people in
Russia have to wait for their wages and pensioners live on the
verge of starvation,'' Schroeder said.
	   Germany's opposition has focused on Kohl's ties with Yeltsin
since the Russian financial crisis erupted last month, suggesting
that the West had backed a leader unable to solve Russia's
problems.

Albright says Western democracies have responsibility to stand by
</HEADLINE>
Russian reformers &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Returning from a critical U.S.-Russia
summit, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
democracies with market economies must encourage like-minded forces
in Russia and make clear there is ``no going backwards.''
	   ``They are at a crossroads,'' Albright said after meetings with
Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
``If they are going to part of the global economy, they are going
to have to take certain steps.''
	   Albright paid a brief stop at this former imperial capital to
give Austrian and European Union officials a first-hand report on
the two-day summit, which took place amidst a Russian political and
economic crisis which has shaken global financial markets and
raised concern about the course of Moscow's reform program.
	   During a speech to representatives of the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Albright said the ``problem
right now is that the Russian people are hurting.''
	   ``Many believe that democracy has not empowered them to improve
their lives,'' she told the representatives. ``This is dangerous
because Russia cannot emerge from its difficulties unless its
people take responsibility for shaping their country's future.''
	   Appearing with the Austrian foreign minister at a joint press
conference, Albright said Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``was
very much in charge during the meetings and he's directing the
process.''
	   She acknowledged ``increasing strength'' among Communist members
of the Russian parliament, who have been blocking confirmation of
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   ``What I think is very important ... is basically that it is up
to countries with market economies and democracy to continue to
encourage those (like-minded) forces within Russia and to make it
very clear that there is no going backwards,'' she said. ``To be
part of the global economy, there are certain rules that need to be
followed.''
	   During his talks with Albright, Klima also encouraged Russia in
the name of the European Union to stick by its reform program
despite its current economic crisis.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency,
said continuing with the reform program was a firm condition for
Moscow to receive economic help from the Europeans.
	   On other issues, Albright said she was encouraged by U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia, a part of
Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill won an agreement in
principle this week from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
the main Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, for an interim
accord granting self-rule to Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The accord, which is yet to be finalized, falls short of the
Albanian demand for full independence but would be reviewed after
about three years.
	   ``We see this as a good procedural step forward,'' Albright told
reporters. ``We want to make sure that the violence is ended and
that there is action to let the humanitarian workers to be able to
get in to deal with the over now 250,000 displaced people.''
	   Schuessel said American efforts had for the first time produced
``a glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful settlement in the majority
Albanian province.
	   Albright also repeated calls for ``free and fair elections'' in
Bosnia, which she visited last week on her way to Moscow. Members
of Bosnia's three ethnic communities vote in national next week.

Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher likes the look of herself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Her husband thought it was a tad severe. But to
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the three-quarter-length
portrait did the impossible _ it made her look exactly as she sees
herself.
	   ``She's quite a formidable woman,'' Lady Thatcher said Thursday
as she gazed up at her new portrait. ``She's formidable because the
things she stood for are enduring.''
	   The oil painting, by artist James Gillick, was commissioned by
the University of Buckingham to commemorate Thatcher's six years as
the chancellor of Britain's only private university, which are
drawing to a close.
	   In the painting, Thatcher is dressed in a blue-and-gold robe,
seated in front of a background of red drapes. She wears a pearl
necklace and clutches a piece of paper.
	   ``Can I thank the artist for doing the impossible _ a kind of
portrait of me in a way I would like to be remembered,'' said
Thatcher, 72, who stepped down as Britain's first woman prime
minister nearly eight years ago after a leadership challenge.
	   Her husband, Sir Denis, 83, seemed a little less certain about
the depiction, however.
	   ``Of course, it looks like her. It's a very good likeness,'' he
said. ``Though I'm not sure she always looks quite so severe as
that.''

Church offers every tribute to Calcutta's nun-except speeded-up
</HEADLINE>
sainthood &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Mother Teresa's church announced a lavish
public tribute Thursday for the first anniversary of her death,
including a memorial Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, a TV spectacular
from the Vatican and a homage from Pope John Paul II.
	   The Roman Catholic Church's tribute Saturday _ including the
Italian TV special from a Vatican hall draped in the blue and white
of her saris _ offers everything but the speeded-up sainthood that
her followers say the extraordinary nun of Calcutta deserves.
	   Even for Mother Teresa, the Vatican made clear again Thursday,
the mandatory five-year waiting period stands.
	   ``Rome has got its rules,'' sighed Calcutta Archbishop Ivan
Dias, at the Vatican for Thursday's news conference outlining the
tributes.
	   Mother Teresa died Sept. 5, 1997 in Calcutta at 87, after a life
spent aiding the poor and wretched through her Missionaries of
Charity order and other good works.
	   Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi will preside at Saturday morning's
memorial Mass in St. Peter's.
	   Saturday night's television tribute will feature everyone from
Kofi Annan to Yassir Arafat to singers, celebrities and an Italian
model, paying her respects to Mother Teresa's own ``beauty.''
	   The program will open with remarks from the pope.
	   In October, John Paul quashed speculation that the church might
expedite sainthood for Mother Teresa. Rules signed by the pope
himself in 1983 mandate a five-year wait after death before the
process of canonization can begin.
	   ``I think it is necessary to follow the normal way,'' the pope
said then.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Thursday the pope's
position is unchanged, despite growing calls from India _ where
nuns have begun collecting supporting evidence of miracles _ and
elsewhere for an exception.
	   ``He prefers to apply to everyone the same rules,''
Navarro-Valls said, and offered solace for the wait.
	   ``Once the whole process begins, maybe the whole thing will be
very quick.''
	   Even those devoted to Mother Teresa are divided about sainthood,
with some saying the nun wouldn't want the fuss.
	   The Calcutta archbishop said the most appropriate tribute is a
hospital being built in her honor in Tirana, Albania, Mother
Teresa's homeland. Supporters hope to get enough donations to open
the hospital in 2000, the church's Jubilee Year.
	   Dias himself sees the calls to sanctify Mother Teresa as ``the
living voice of the people,'' similar to the movements of the early
saints, before there were rules and waiting periods.
	   But Mother Teresa's followers are content to wait, if need be,
Calcutta's archbishop said.
	   ``She has been venerated, even without a title,'' he said.

FBI agents look for possible Comorian connection

<TEXT>
	   MAYOTTE, Comoros (AP)_ FBI agents were in this archipelago off
Africa's eastern coast Thursday, investigating a possible Comorian
connection to the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last
month, police said.
	   About 20 FBI agents arrived on the island of Moroni on Sunday
and Monday and were believed to be tracking the origin of materials
used to make the bombs that exploded in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
said a police source on condition of anonymity.
	   The Comoros Islands lie off Tanzania, whose coastal capital is
Dar es Salaam.
	   U.S. authorities have obtained the extradition of several
suspects linked to the Aug. 7 bombings that killed 258 people,
including 12 Americans. More than 5,500 people were injured.
	   The suspects were linked to fugitive Islamic militant Osama bin
Laden, who was believed to be behind the bombings.

Israel furious over Mandela comments at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel said Thursday it is furious over
comments made by South African President Nelson Mandela in which he
blamed Israel and its prime minister for blocking efforts to
advance Mideast peace.
	   Mandela said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's
administration had ``narrow, chauvinistic interests.''
	   A foreign ministry statement called the comments ``unpleasant
and unhelpful.''
	   ``Israel expresses its displeasure with the speech of President
Mandela and his accusations against the government of Israel and
its leader,'' the press statement said.
	   At the Wednesday opening of the Nonaligned Movement summit in
Durban, South Africa, Mandela said Netanyahu's hardline positions
had ``blocked progress toward a just and peaceful solution.''
	   The Israeli foreign ministry statement also criticized as
one-sided, Mandela's open support for a Palestinian state.
	   Mandela's African national Congress has been a long-time
supporter of Palestinian national aspirations.

German author campaigns for Kohl's rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEIMAR, Germany (AP) _ Guenther Grass, Germany's best-known
author and a harsh critic of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, campaigned
Wednesday for Kohl's challenger in national elections Sept. 27.
	   Grass, in a speech to 800 people in this former communist east
German city, called Kohl a ``colossus, who for 16 years has
accustomed the country and people to crippling mediocrity.''
	   Kohl, in power since 1982, is Europe's longest-serving leader.
	   The author was one of the few Germans to speak against
unification in 1990, when Kohl oversaw the merging of East Germany
with the capitalist West. Grass argued that the nation that
committed the Holocaust could not trust itself again to be united
and powerful.
	   On Wednesday, he complained that Kohl failed to deliver on
promises that the east would prosper under unification.
Unemployment in the east is currently 17.4 percent, about twice
that of the more prosperous west.
	   Grass, 70, is campaigning for a coalition of the liberal Green
party and left-leaning Social Democrats to replace Kohl's
conservatives-centrist government. The Social Democrat candidate
for chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, is leading Kohl in the polls.
	   Grass's most famous work is ``The Tin Drum,'' a wartime novel
about a boy who shatters glass with his scream. His next campaign
stops were in Jena and Erfurt on Thursday and Friday.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Most of those killed in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 traveling from New York to Geneva were American, French
or Swiss citizens, the airline said Thursday.
	   More than half of the dead were Americans _ 136 of the total
death toll of 229, said Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of
Swissair's parent group SAirGroup.
	   Thirty French and 28 Swiss were also on board, Bruggisser told a
press conference in Zurich.
	   He restated the airline's position that passengers' names will
be released only when all the victims' relatives have been
informed.
	   Six passengers were British, three each came from Germany and
Italy and two were from Greece, Bruggisser said. One passenger each
came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Spain,
Russia and St. Kitts and Nevis.
	   Bruggisser said the pilots put out an emergency ``Pan, pan,
pan'' call seven minutes before the jetliner crashed.
	   Hearing such a call, all other planes in the area would have
known that SR111 was in serious trouble.
	   Bruggisser said there was no indication of problems with the
plane that crashed. The two pilots, who had flown in the same jet
in the days preceding the accident, had reported no irregularities.
	   Its last checkup was done on Aug. 10. The plane, which entered
service in August 1991, was fully overhauled between Aug. 21 and
Sept. 10 last year.
	   Swissair set up three emergency phone lines _ two in Switzerland
and one in New York _ for relatives worried about people on the
flight. An emergency team was contacting relatives of those on the
plane.
	   ``Now it will be kind of putting a puzzle together, matching the
ticket stubs and the names of the passengers to notify the
family,'' Donzel added.
	   One of the crew members was an American from Swissair partner
Delta, Tschanz said. She didn't identify him. The flight was
operated by Swissair in a code-sharing agreement with Delta,
meaning Delta sold some of the seats as though it was its own
plane.
	   The plane made a ``normal takeoff with regular radio contact''
from New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 8:18 p.m. local time
(0018 GMT), Swissair said in a statement.
	   The pilot was Urs Zimmermann, 50, and the co-pilot was
36-year-old Stephan Loew _ ``both MD-11 instructors with
considerable experience on the type,'' Swissair said.
	   In Bern, President Flavio Cotti, who called a special meeting of
the country's ruling coalition cabinet, said the government was
``devastated'' by the crash. The accident was the worst in Swiss
aviation history.
	   Swiss authorities have no indications that the plane was the
target of a terrorist attack or other criminal action, Cotti added.
	   ``For all of us this is a day of mourning,'' he said. The
government ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff.
	   Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer for the airlines'
parent company _ SAirGroup _ insisted that ``this airplane was in
perfect working order.''
	   Speaking to reporters at Geneva airport, Swissair spokesman
Donzel said the airline has no plans to ground its other 15 MD-11s.
A Swissair flight from Geneva to New York, also an MD-11, took off
as normal at 12:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) Thursday.
	   Geneva is a city of about 180,000 people, many of whom work for
international organizations like the United Nations or major
corporations and live either in the city or in neighboring France.
	   The United Nations said U.N. flags in Geneva would be flown at
half-staff Friday as a sign of mourning for ``several'' U.N.
workers on board the plane. Officials at U.N. offices in Geneva
said about 10 U.N. employees were believed to be on the flight.

Russian currency sinks; Chernomyrdin says he won't step aside
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble down 32 percent against dollar, analyst
quote; combines previous, trims &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble fell hard and fast Thursday as
President Boris Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament headed for a
showdown vote over the president's candidate to lead a new
government.
	   Amid the political wrangling, Russia's financial crisis went
from bad to worse, a day after the government acknowledged it was
powerless to stop the collapse of the ruble.
	   The Central Bank set the official exchange rate at 16.93 to the
dollar, up 32 percent from 12.82 rubles per dollar on Wednesday.
That means a ruble is now worth about 6 U.S. cents; in mid-August
it was worth 16 cents.
	   ``I see three main reasons to drive the ruble down: no
government, no policy and a lack of confidence in the ruble among
the public,'' said Eric Fine, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in London.
	   At currency exchange booths in central Moscow, operators lowered
the ruble rate on their billboards several times Thursday in an
effort to keep up with the crashing currency. Just last month, the
ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar (16 cents each) before it
began a slide that has sent prices soaring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians
not to panic and to leave their money in banks, where he assured
them it would be safe. But the plummeting currency was certain to
make depositors nervous and increase demand for dollars and other
foreign currencies.
	   Chernomyrdin presented a series of measures to a group of
officials headed by chief tax collector Boris Fyodorov, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. The group is trying to hammer out
solutions to the crisis.
	   ``The country has once again been pushed into economic
turmoil,'' Chernomyrdin said at the start of a meeting with
regional governors who sit in the upper house of parliament, known
as the Federation Council. ``We are to establish what we must do to
ward off and avoid tremors.''
	   After the meeting, Krasnoyarsk governor and presidential
favorite Alexander Lebed said that the Federation Council would
support Chernomyrdin.
	   There have been lines at some banks and currency exchange booths
in recent days, but there has not been any unrest in the streets.
	   Meanwhile, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated that his
party will vote against Chernomyrdin when parliament holds a second
round of voting Friday on the prime minister's post.
	   Communists and their allies blame President Boris Yeltsin's
government for landing Russia in the current economic mess, and
Chernomyrdin was overwhelmingly rejected Monday in a first round of
voting.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 and named Chernomyrdin
acting premier.
	   The political turmoil has left the interim government unable to
devote its attention to the mounting economic crisis.
	   With Chernomyrdin facing an uphill battle to win confirmation on
Friday, some lawmakers have called on him to withdraw in favor of a
compromise candidate.
	   The horse-trading continued Thursday, with Yeltsin's spokesman
saying the president had proposed some changes to a political
agreement all sides had reached over the weekend before the
Communists tore it up.
	   The agreement would have given the Duma more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy, but left Yeltsin with
substantial power. The opposition had been demanding the agreement
in exchange for confirming Chernomyrdin.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the revised
deal would be sent to the Duma later Thursday. No details were
released, but the presidential press service said the new proposal
contained mostly ``minor adjustments.''
	   Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin rejected lawmakers' suggestions that he
was using the prime minister's job as a springboard to a
presidential bid in 2000.
	   ``I would like to see the nut who would call this a good
starting point for presidential elections,'' he told the Interfax
news agency.
	   If Chernomyrdin fails to win confirmation a second and third
time, Yeltsin is constitutionally empowered to dissolve the
parliament.
	   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said his 50-member
faction, third largest in the Duma, would support Chernomyrdin
because he is a known quantity, after having abstained from the
first vote.
	   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Of course we have pity for the 200
victims, but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''
	   Zyuganov said the Duma could be ready to debate an impeachment
motion against Yeltsin next week. The motion, like previous
attempts, stands little chance of passing, given the president's
strong constitutional powers.
	   Economic pressure was also increasing. The Central Bank said its
gold foreign currency reserves fell by dlrs 700 million in the last
week of August to dlrs 12.7 billion. The bank has spent billions in
recent months in a futile effort to prop up the ruble.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
said Thursday that for two weeks beginning Sunday, it will halt
production of computer chips because of continuing oversupply in
the market.
	   Samsung, the world's largest chip maker, will temporarily cease
production of its 16-megabit and 64-megabit DRAMs, or dynamic
random access memory chips, for one week until Sept. 13, it said.
DRAMs are low-end chips that provide memory for personal computers,
	   It will also halt output of its non-memory chips for one week
from Sept. 13 to Sept. 20.
	   It is the fourth time since June that Samsung, a unit of Samsung
Group, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, will be
suspending its semiconductor operations in an attempt to ease the
glut in the world market and thus raise prices on the chips.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit, dumped tons of fuel and attempted an emergency
landing before his jetliner crashed into the ocean off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard, including 136 Americans.
	   Flight SR111 from New York to Geneva plunged into the Atlantic
late Wednesday night after leaving Kennedy International Airport at
8:17 p.m. It carried 215 passengers _ including two infants _ and
14 crew.
	   By Thursday morning, 36 bodies had been found.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 reported problems at 33,000 feet
(10,000 meters), then descended to roughly 8,000 feet (2,500
meters) before disappearing from radar about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Halifax International Airport, said Philippe
Bruggisser, chief executive officer of Swissair's parent group.
	   The crash occurred between seven and 10 minutes before the plane
would have reached Halifax, he said at a news conference in Zurich.
	   The passengers had been prepared for an emergency landing and
many were wearing lifevests, he said, adding that the 136 Americans
killed were the largest single group aboard the plane.
	   The other passengers included some 30 French and 28 Swiss
citizens; six British citizens; three Germans; three Italians two
Greeks. One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia.
	   Roy Bears, a Canadian aviation safety investigator, said he
understood the pilot had talked to Logan International Airport in
Boston and was not allowed to land there because Halifax was
closer.
	   But officials at Logan said they had received no notification of
any plane in serious trouble.
	   ``We were not put on alert here of any flight coming this way,''
said airport spokesman Phil Orlandella.
	   A U.S. aviation source said that shortly after being switched
from the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority radar in Nashua, New
Hampshire, to the Canadian system in Moncton, New Brunswick, the
pilot radioed that he had a problem.
	   The pilot asked Canadian air traffic controllers whether he
should be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston. Air
traffic controllers told him he was 192 miles (309 kilometers) from
Logan and 42 miles (68 kilometers) from Halifax, the source said.
	   ``He said 'Fine' and continued on to Halifax,'' the source said.
	   Bruggisser identified the pilot as Urs Zimmermann, 50, and
co-pilot Stefan Low, 36. Both were Swiss.
	   Witnesses on the ground reported hearing sputtering noises from
an aircraft passing overhead and then a thundering crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said witness Claudia
Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships immediately headed
out in driving rain to the crash site, about six miles (ten
kilometers) off the coast of Peggy's Cove, a picturesque fishing
village popular with tourists. Debris was found about an hour after
the plane was reported missing.
	   ``We knew it was an explosion, there was a silence for two
seconds after the explosion, then my ears popped,'' said Darrell
Fralick, 26, a resident of Peggy's Cove. ``At that split second, I
looked at my watch it was 10:35, I don't know why I looked at my
watch, I just did.''
	   Wreckage from the crash spread out over six miles (ten
kilometers), and fishermen helping with the rescue effort said the
smell of fuel was overwhelming.
	   Bears said divers were using sonar to map the debris field and
try to locate the black box _ which gives technical data on the
flight _ in about 150 feet (50 meters) of water.
	   The White House and the FBI said terrorism likely was not a
factor in the crash. President Bill Clinton, who was visiting
Northern Ireland Thursday, was being regularly briefed.
	   ``Preliminary indications show absolutely no sign of a criminal
act,'' saud FBI spokesman Jim Margolin, adding it is standard for
the FBI to monitor air disaster investigations.
	   Swissair said the passenger list will not be released until
family members are notified.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was among
the dead, along with his wife, according to the World Health
Organization.
	   The United Nations said seven U.N. workers returning to
headquarters in Geneva were on board the plane.
	   Debris from the aircraft was found off Clam Island and other
islets between Peggy's Cove and Blandford, 20 miles (30 kilometers)
southwest of Halifax.
	   Searchlights from coast guard cutters, fishing boats,
helicopters and planes illuminated the area for most of the night.
Heavy surf _ a remnant of Hurricane Bonnie _ hampered the first
hours of the rescue effort. Drenching rains continued all night,
easing at dawn.
	   ``It's real ugly,'' said Craig Sanford, operator of a
whale-watching boat that was one of the first vessels on the scene.
``You see Styrofoam floating, chunks of wood, panels, the odd body
here and there. It's not a nice scene.''
	   The three-engine plane dumped tons of fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, The Canadian Press quoted an
airport worker as saying.
	   Canadian navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau said civilian rescuers
were at the scene within minutes of the crash. Four rescue planes
and four helicopters, as well as a Canadian navy ship, were also
searching through the debris.
	   At the airports in New York and Geneva, grief counselors were on
hand for relatives of the crash victims. A special lounge was set
up in the Delta Air Lines terminal at Kennedy Airport.

	   More than 100 relatives and friends had gathered at the Geneva
airport. Kennedy officials reported only a handful of relatives had
shown up there overnight.
	   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington sent a
team of 10 people to Canada Thursday morning.
	   It was the first crash of a Swissair plane since Oct. 7, 1979,
when one of its DC-8s overshot the runway in Athens, Greece, while
attempting to land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were
killed.
	   The plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled
in August and September last year, said Georges Schorderet, the
chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup. It had been
checked as all are before takeoff, he added.
	   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,'' Schorderet said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a jet known for its reliability,
even though its manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to
discontinue the model in the year 2000.
	   ``Both the aircraft and the airline have extremely good safety
records, among the very best in the industry,'' Daly said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Most of those killed in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 traveling from New York to Geneva were American, Swiss
or French citizens, the airline said Thursday.
	   More than half of the dead were Americans _ 137 of the total
death toll of 229, said Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of
Swissair's parent group SAirGroup.
	   Forty-one Swiss and 30 French were also on board, Bruggisser
told a press conference in Zurich.
	   He restated the airline's position that passengers' names will
be released only when all the victims' relatives have been
informed.
	   Six passengers were British, three each came from Germany and
Italy and two were from Greece, Bruggisser said. One passenger each
came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Spain,
Russia and St. Kitts and Nevis.

FIFA medical chief calls for shorter season to stave off drug lure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FIFA's medical chief said Thursday the
world soccer federation should forsake its search for more
television profits and shorten the season if it wants to keep
players away from doping.
	   Dr. Michel D'Hooghe said in an interview certain soccer injuries
had increased dramatically since top-level soccer became an almost
year-round sport. That has increased the appeal of illegal drugs
for players wanting to stay fit longer or get healthy quicker.
	   ``The physical pressure on soccer players has become just too
much,'' D'Hooghe said. ``That's why people could be tempted to use
artificial means.''
	   He said that, so far, doping was not a big problem yet in
soccer. It could become one.
	   He said only a few days separated the July 12 World Cup final
and the first European Cup matches, putting near-constant pressure
on the muscles and joints of the world's greatest players.
	   ``Specifically, cartilidge injuries have increased
dramatically,'' he said.
	   D'Hooghe has no illusions, however. Medical arguments are
nothing in the face of big money.
	   ``It's the law of television,'' he said. ``There is one bigger
power than the power of medical science and that is the power of
money,'' he said.
	   The world federation has already been warned about the dangers
of such a long season, but he said other interests prevail.
	   In Europe, where the richest leagues lure the world's best
players, the proliferation of broadcast rights have added fortunes
to the coffers of soccer clubs and has resulted in a top-heavy
schedule.
	   ``There is no turning back,'' said D'Hooghe.
	   Even though soccer has been rocked by allegations of widespread
drug use in Italy, D'Hooghe remained convinced doping cases in
soccer were isolated incidents. D'Hooghe supervised 264 tests at
the World Cup and all were negative.
	   Soccer has not yet tested for synthetic EPO, which is used to
enhance red blood cell production and improve physical resistence.
EPO was at the center of the drug scandal that tainted the Tour de
France bicycle race this summer.
	   ``I'm convinced EPO is not systematically used in soccer,'' he
said, although he admitted individual cases probably existed.
	   He said reseach had shown synthetic EPO to boost performances by
16 percent. It could be effective in soccer too, especially at the
end of the season when natural levels of EPO are low. EPO is banned
on health grounds.
	   D'Hooghe's comments came just ahead of the announcement of an
international sports medicine congress in his hometown next month.
	   The doctor tried to play down the soccer doping scandal in
Italy, where AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman has questioned the muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   ``It appears to be about creatine,'' said D'Hooghe, referring to
the legal muscle builder. ``That's not doping. It's a natural
product.''
	   D'Hooghe has had to deal with only one major case of doping as
head of FIFA's medical committee.
	   He excluded Argentina's Diego Maradona after he tested positive
for a ``coctail'' of illegal drugs at the 1994 World Cup.

Russian prices jump; still little sign of panic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with central bank trying to prevent capital flight &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prices for staple goods rose significantly
Thursday in reaction to the steady fall of the ruble, but there was
still little sign of panic buying, Russian shop owners and
consumers said.
	   ``From vodka to water, everything's going up,'' said Marina
Suruyagina, sitting behind the counter at a supermarket. ``Our
vodka is twice as expensive as it was a week ago, and cigarettes
are also up.''
	   Like the ruble rate, which varied wildly between currency
exchanges, prices were low at stores that still had old stocks,
while other sellers boosted their prices after suppliers delivered
new goods at the start of the month.
	   Prices are only likely to get worse. The ruble crashed further
on Thursday, trading on the streets at around 17 to the dollar. At
the beginning of the week it was trading close to eight.
	   Fearing the price hikes will drive more and more capital out of
the Russia, the country's central bank announced a number of new
foreign currency controls on payments of exports and imports. The
new rules, which concern Russian-based entities, take effect
Friday.
	   At one of Moscow's main open air markets, where turnover tends
to be quick, prices varied from place to place, but were invariably
up.
	   ``Food is 50 to 60 percent higher,'' said Sonya Aleyeva from
behind a small kiosk. ``The government isn't controlling prices,
and around here they've been let loose completely.''
	   Aleyeva said bread and milk prices were up about 10 percent, and
the cost for a kilogram of some types of sausage had leapt from 22
to 40 rubles, a jump that matches the ruble's devaluation by about
half in the last week.
	   Those who will be hit hardest by the ruble's fall were painfully
aware of how much the new prices would chip away at their meager
earnings.
	   ``A package of sugar now costs five rubles instead of four,''
said pensioner Yevgeniya Afanasyeva, who lives on 400 rubles (dlrs
23 by Thursday's exchange rate) a month. ``Flour is up at least 15
percent'' and cooking oil has more than doubled, she said.
	   Afanasyeva said her fear that prices would continue upward led
her to buy as much as she could with her small pension now.
Pensions, unlike prices, are not expected to adjust to the ruble's
slide because the government is so short on cash.
	   ``Without a doubt, I'm buying more. Everybody's buying more,''
she said. ``In any case, what people can buy, they buy.''
	   Still, some store employees said business was actually down, and
shelves were full in central Moscow.
	   ``I personally am not buying any more,'' said Suruyagina, the
supermarket clerk. ``I don't think there will be a shortage of
goods because people can't buy at these prices.''

World Cup titlist France has to reshape defense against Iceland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two months after his two headed goals fired France
to its famous World Cup final triumph over Brazil in Paris,
Zinedine Zidane faces up to a less glamorous trip to Iceland
Saturday as the long road begins to the 2000 European Championship.
	   The Iceland-France game in Reykjavik is one of 21 matchups this
weekend and the Juventus star, who scored twice in the first half
of the 3-0 triumph in Paris, knows his team now has to carry the
burden of extra pressure.
	   ``In Iceland we have to justify our status as champions of the
world,'' he said. ``It will be hard and we will have to be ready.
	   ``There will be no more friendly matches. The world champions do
not have those games.''
	   The team's two toughest opponents in Group 4, Ukraine and
Russia, meet in Kiev Saturday and the French nation expects to
start with a victory over an opponent which has never qualified for
a major international championship. But the world champion has
problems to deal with.
	   With central defenders Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly serving
suspensions carried over from their World Cup expulsions, new coach
Roger Lemerre, who has taken over from Aime Jacquet, has to
reshuffle his defense.
	   Lilian Thuram, whose two semifinal goals against Croatia
propelled France into the World Cup final, may have to partner
Frank Leboeuf in the center of defense.
	   Emmanuel Petit, who scored the third French goal in the World
Cup final, will miss the game because of a sinus operation. Lemerre
likely will field Alan Boghossian alongside captain Didier
Deschamps in the center of midfield, though he raised the
possibility of playing Zidane in a deeper role than normal,
alongside Deschamps.
	   First-choice goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who was sidelined for
last month's 2-2 exhibition tie with Austria because of a knee
injury, returns to play in Reykjavik.
	   Up front Lillian Laslandes, the Bordeaux striker who scored a
fine headed goal against Austria in only his second match for
France, is expected to lead the attack.
	   Lemerre is aware that, after the glorious World Cup triumph in
Paris, the French players might struggle to gain the same
motivation for the first step towards the European finals.
	   ``The challenge is to find other motivations with players that
still want to give their best,'' he said.
	   Iceland will probably be without its captain and most
experienced defender, Sigurdur Jonsson, who injured a right thigh
last weekend playing for Dundee United.
	   Croatia, which surprisingly gained third place in the World Cup
at its first attempt, has a tricky Group 8 opener against Ireland
in Dublin.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic will have to make do without five
regular stars _ the World Cup's leading scorer, Davor Suker,
frontmen Alen Boksic and Goran Vlaovic, and defender Slaven Bilic _
who are out with injuries.
	   Erratic midfielder Robert Prosinecki, who has had a history of
bad blood with coach Blazevic, has refused to line up for the
national side after a new series of irreconcilable squabbles.
	   ``The Irish will run like mad and fight to the bone,'' said Igor
Pamic of Hansa Rostock in Germany's Bundesliga, who was called in
to fill the loss of bite in attack. ``But it goes without saying,
so will we.''
	   Italy, now with Dino Zoff in charge, goes to Liverpool to meet
Wales. The game in being played in England because Cardiff's
National stadium is being rebuilt.
	   Zoff also has some rebuilding to do after Italy, then guided by
defense-minded Cesare Maldini, slipped tamely out of the World Cup
in the quarterfinals. Yet he's thinking of fielding Roberto Baggio
on the starting lineup instead of Alessandro Del Piero which some
observers feel is a backward step.
	   Denmark, which reached the quarterfinal of the World Cup before
losing to Brazil, goes to Belarus for another Group 1 game.
	   England's preparations for a tough Group 5 game against Sweden
in Stockholm have been overshadowed by a public disagreement
involving coach Glenn Hoddle and former team captain Tony Adams.
	   It wasn't what they said but what they wrote in their
biographies, Adams saying that he should have been England's World
Cup captain rather than Alan Shearer.
	   The media was quick to jump on any sign of disharmony and the
papers have been full of speculation that Hoddle's job is on the
line. Against that, he has to decide what changes to make to the
lineup after a World Cup campaign which promised much but produced
little.
	   The Alan Shearer-Michael Owen strikeforce should give the Swedes
plenty of trouble in Stockholm and the host nation will be without
both the experienced Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin for the
first time since the early 1990s. Both are injured.
	   Bulgaria and Poland, two more contenders from a tough Group 5,
meet on Sunday with Hristo Stoichkov again expected to lead the
host attack despite his threats to quit the team.
	   The Group 2 games are Georgia vs. Albania on Saturday and Greece
vs. Slovenia and Norway vs. Latvia on Sunday.
	   In Group 3, Finland hosts Moldova and Northern Ireland visits
Turkey on Saturday
	   Group 6 has Austria vs. Israel and Cyprus vs. Spain on Saturday.
Slovakia meets Azerbaijan in Group 7 on Saturday, the day before
Hungary hosts Portugal.
	   The Czech Republic, surprise runner up to Germany in the last
European Championship in 1996 but a non-qualifier for the World
Cup, has a fairly easy start with a visit to the Faeroe Islands
Sunday.
	   The other Group 9 games are Lithuania vs. Scotland and Bosnia
vs. Estonia on Saturday.

Three Serbs plead innocent to broadened war crimes indictment

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Three Bosnian Serbs pleaded
innocent Thursday to U.N. charges that they orchestrated a campaign
of terror and persecution against Muslims and Croats in 1992 and
1993.
	   Simo Zaric, Miroslav Tadic and Milan Simic were called before
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal to enter pleas to a new indictment
which has been broadened since their arraignments in February to
include more detail of their alleged crimes.
	   The three Serbs face maximum life sentences if convicted. A
trial date was not immediately set.
	   Simic had to return to The Hague for the hearing after judges
released him from pretrial custody because he is confined to a
wheelchair following a 1993 attempt on his life. The other two
suspects are in custody in The Hague. All three turned themselves
in voluntarily in February, saying they wanted to clear their
names.
	   According to the indictment, only 300 of 17,000 non-Serbs
remained in their homes following the brutal ethnic purge of
Bosanski Samac in northwest Bosnia. Muslims and Croats were forced
to flee were or rounded up and held in camps where inmates were
tortured and beaten, prosecutors allege.
	   The same pattern of persecution was repeated in nearby Odzak,
from which almost all 22,500 non-Serb residents were forced to
flee.
	   The suspects allegedly all were ranking members of Serb
institutions set up to organize the purges.
	   Tadic and Zaric each pleaded innocent to two crimes against
humanity charges and a further charge of committing a grave breach
of the Geneva conventions. Simic pleaded innocent to five crimes
against humanity charges, four grave breach counts and two war
crimes charges.
	   Simic faces more charges because, in addition to a general
persecution count, he is charged with personal involvement in the
beatings and torture of five Muslim prisoners.
	   Set up in 1993 to prosecute those accused of atrocities during
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the tribunal has indicted 60
suspects and has 25 in custody. Its most wanted suspects, former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military
chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

US defends call for withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The United States on Thursday repeated
its call for a cease-fire in Congo and the withdrawal of all
foreign troops from the conflict.
	   Speaking on a satellite hookup from Washington, D.C., assistant
secretary for African affairs Susan Rice said the United States
will continue to push for dialogue toward a cease-fire and press
the Congolese to ``deal with the very real political issues
dividing Congo.''
	   ``All our energies ought to be in that direction at this
point,'' Rice told Zimbabwe state television.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila has since July been fighting
a rebel insurrection that he claims is backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels from the capital Kinshasa
and were knifing eastward into rebel territory in the vast central
African nation.
	   Attempts to resolve the conflict have dominated the Nonaligned
Movement summit in South Africa, where U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has been trying to mediate.
	   Rice said Angola, Rwanda and Uganda had strategic interests to
protect because rebels opposing their governments had sanctuary in
Congo and the sanctity of borders was not observed.
	   ``It doesn't make it right but it makes it real,'' she said.
	   Rice said the U.S. government was also worried by reports of
violence directed at ethnic minorities in the conflict.
	   Speaking on the same hookup, former U.S. diplomat Herman Cohen
said he believed the United States had no role in the Great Lakes
conflict as long as peace talks were being brokered by Africans
themselves.
	   Cohen is a senior negotiation consultant with the U.S.-based
Global Coalition for Africa.
	   He accused Kabila of being ``intransigent'' over peace
negotiations and the pace of political reform.

Israel furious over Mandela comments at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel said Thursday it is furious over
comments made by South African President Nelson Mandela in which he
accused Israel and its prime minister of blocking efforts to
advance Mideast peace.
	   Mandela said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's
administration had ``narrow, chauvinistic interests.''
	   A foreign ministry statement called the comments ``unpleasant
and unhelpful.''
	   ``Israel expresses its displeasure with the speech of President
Mandela and his accusations against the government of Israel and
its leader,'' the press statement said.
	   At the Wednesday opening of the Nonaligned Movement summit in
Durban, South Africa, Mandela said Netanyahu's hard-line positions
had ``blocked progress toward a just and peaceful solution'' with
the Palestinians.
	   The foreign ministry statement also criticized Mandela's open
support for a Palestinian state as one-sided.
	   Mandela's African National Congress has been a long-time
supporter of Palestinian national aspirations.

Israel to release Soviet spy to house arrest after 14 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES spelling in graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court decided Thursday to release
into house arrest an elderly, ailing Israeli scientist jailed 15
years ago for spying for the former Soviet Union.
	   The state has 15 days to appeal the decision.
	   Polish-born Marcus Klingberg was sentenced to 18 years for
passing information on biological warfare. Klingberg, 80, has
suffered several strokes in prison but previous requests for early
release on health grounds were all rejected.
	   The Beersheva District Court in southern Israel, where Klingberg
is jailed, ruled Thursday in his favor however and said he could be
released under restricted conditions.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said Klingberg will only be allowed to
leave his home for medical treatment. Police surveillance will be
placed at his home, his telephone will be tapped and the Shin Bet
internal security agency will decide who can visit Klingberg's
home.

Singapore, Vietnam win; Indonesia, Thailand to face-off again

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Truong Viet Hoang scored after only 15
minutes and Vietnam beat Thailand 3-0 Thursday night, sending
itself to the final of the Tiger Cup and creating a rematch of a
controversial group match for the third-place game.
	   Vietnam will face Singapore on Saturday for the title after
Thailand meets Indonesia in the consolation match.
	   Singapore beat Indonesia 2-1 earlier Thursday in Ho Chi Minh
City in the other semifinal, helping to manufacture a third-place
game with as much intrigue as the championship match.
	   Thailand and Indonesia first squared off on Monday in group play
after both admitted it didn't care to win the match and face
Vietnam in the semifinals. Indonesia scored an intentional own goal
in the final minute to give Thailand a 3-2 victory and the semfinal
against Vietnam.
	   Tournament organizers have recommended to the ASEAN Football
Federation dlrs 40,000 fines for both teams.
	   Further penalties are possible when the Asian Football
Confederation meets Sept. 11. The manager of Thailand's national
team already has resigned in disgrace.
	   The final, to be played in Hanoi, will be a rematch of an
earlier Group B match that ended in a 0-0 draw.
	   On Thursday, Thailand created more chances throughout but
finished poorly. Hoang put Vietnam ahead after a free kick led to a
scramble in front of the goal.
	   The lead held until Nguyen Hong Son got free on a breakaway in
the 70th minute. His first attempt was blocked but he gathered the
rebound and scored into an empty net.
	   Van Sy Hung closed out the scoring in the 80th minute again on a
breakaway. He was ejected a minute later for a red card but
Thailand could not capitalize.
	   In the earlier game, Nazri bin Nasir scored one goal and set up
the other to give Singapore the victory.
	   Despite relatively appreciative and fairly full crowds earlier
in the tournament, Ho Chi Minh City's 22,000-seat Thong Nhat
Stadium was only about a third-full Thursday. Those who did show up
made their sentiments clear: They wanted Indonesia to lose.
	   Many sat during the Indonesian national anthem. One fan hung a
sign that read: ``Singapore 10, Indonesia 0.''
	   When the match started, they cheered every Singapore touch of
the ball. They cheered even louder whenever Indonesia made a
mistake.
	   And they went crazy when Singapore scored in the 13th minute as
Nasir fired a perfect free kick from the sideline and Mohammed Rafi
Mohammed Ali broke free to beat the keeper with a crisp header
right in front of the goal.
	   Nasir himself was the beneficiary of a good pass in the 30th
minute, gathering himself in front, turning and firing into the
corner to make it 2-0.
	   Indonesia's Mirobaldo Bento quieted the crowd when he got one
back in the 34th minute on an opportunistic rebound. Both teams had
opportunities in the second half, but were stymied by sharp
goalkeepeing.

Counselors seek to ease pain of survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Switzerland-Canada-Plane Crash
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Numb shock. Hysteria. Silence. Uncontrolled
talking.
	   Specially trained counselors at Geneva airport struggled
Thursday to cope with the array of differing emotions unleashed
among victims of the Swissair air disaster.
	   Friends and relatives who arrived at the airport to receive grim
news of the crash were shielded from reporters in an attempt to
spare them further agony.
	   Some 229 people died when Flight SR111 from New York crashed off
the coast of Canada. There were 137 American victims and 41 Swiss
among the dead.
	   A tall blond woman in her early 30s arrived crying with an older
woman and two men shortly after the midmorning scheduled arrival
time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They wandered aimlessly for a few minutes until they were
beckoned by airport security staff to a special area where they
were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking,'' said Pastor
Jim Longhurst of the relatives. ``There's shock over the pain and
devastation.''
	   Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket, said he had special
identification with relatives of the victims.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, N.Y., who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join clergy and psychologists _ in
consoling relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the
crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   ``We're here to give emotional first aid,'' was how one
counselor, Andreas Goerlich, described his task.
	   Goerlich, who acts as priest at Zurich airport, said the most
important task of carers was to allow relatives to give free reign
to their grief.
	   Some needed to sob their hearts out. Others had to mourn in
silence and didn't want to communicate with anyone, he said. Others
had the need to relate over and over again details of last contacts
with the dead or of future plans, now thwarted.
	   Goerlich is part of a permanent team which was set up last year
to help families and survivors of a massacre of tourists by Islamic
extremists in Luxor, Egypt. Thirty-six of the 58 victims were
Swiss.
	   In addition to immediate counseling, relatives would need
long-term help to come to terms with their loss, he said.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

in the cockpit, dumped tons of fuel and attempted an emergency
landing before his jetliner crashed into the ocean off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Flight SR111 from New York to Geneva plunged into the Atlantic
late Wednesday night after leaving Kennedy International Airport at
8:17 p.m (0017 GMT Thursday). It carried 215 passengers _ including
two infants _ and 14 crew. Most of the passengers _ 136 _ were
Americans.
	   By Thursday morning, 36 bodies had been found. Heaby surf _ a
remnant of Hurricane Bonnie _ hampered search efforts.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 reported problems at 33,000 feet
(10,000 meters), then descended to roughly 8,000 feet (2,500
meters) before disappearing from radar about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Halifax International Airport, said Philippe
Bruggisser, chief executive officer of Swissair's parent group.
	   The crash occurred between seven and 10 minutes before the plane
would have reached Halifax, he said at a news conference in Zurich.
	   The passengers had been prepared for an emergency landing and
many were wearing lifevests, he said, adding that the 136 Americans
killed were the largest single group aboard the plane.
	   The other passengers included some 30 French and 28 Swiss
citizens; six British citizens; three Germans; three Italians two
Greeks. One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia.
	   Roy Bears, a Canadian aviation safety investigator, said he
understood the pilot had talked to Logan International Airport in
Boston and was not allowed to land there because Halifax was
closer.
	   But officials at Logan said they had received no notification of
any plane in serious trouble.
	   ``We were not put on alert here of any flight coming this way,''
said airport spokesman Phil Orlandella.
	   A U.S. aviation source said that shortly after being switched
from the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority radar in Nashua, New
Hampshire, to the Canadian system in Moncton, New Brunswick, the
pilot radioed that he had a problem.
	   The pilot asked Canadian air traffic controllers whether he
should be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston. Air
traffic controllers told him he was 192 miles (309 kilometers) from
Logan and 42 miles (68 kilometers) from Halifax, the source said.
	   ``He said 'Fine' and continued on to Halifax,'' the source said.
	   Bruggisser identified the pilot as Urs Zimmermann, 50, and
co-pilot Stefan Low, 36. Both were Swiss.
	   Witnesses on the ground reported hearing sputtering noises from
an aircraft passing overhead and then a thundering crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said witness Claudia
Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships immediately headed
out in driving rain to the crash site, about six miles (ten
kilometers) off the coast of Peggy's Cove, a picturesque fishing
village popular with tourists. Debris was found about an hour after
the plane was reported missing.
	   ``We knew it was an explosion, there was a silence for two
seconds after the explosion, then my ears popped,'' said Darrell
Fralick, 26, a resident of Peggy's Cove. ``At that split second, I
looked at my watch it was 10:35, I don't know why I looked at my
watch, I just did.''
	   Wreckage from the crash spread out over six miles (ten
kilometers), and fishermen helping with the rescue effort said the
smell of fuel was overwhelming.
	   Bears said divers were using sonar to map the debris field and
try to locate the black box _ which gives technical data on the
flight _ in about 150 feet (50 meters) of water.
	   The White House and the FBI said terrorism likely was not a
factor in the crash. President Bill Clinton, who was visiting
Northern Ireland Thursday, was being regularly briefed.
	   Swissair said the passenger list will not be released until
family members are notified.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was among
the dead, along with his wife, according to the World Health
Organization.
	   The United Nations said seven U.N. workers returning to
headquarters in Geneva were on board the plane.
	   ``It's real ugly,'' said Craig Sanford, operator of a
whale-watching boat that was one of the first vessels on the scene.
``You see Styrofoam floating, chunks of wood, panels, the odd body
here and there. It's not a nice scene.''
	   The three-engine plane dumped tons of fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, The Canadian Press quoted an
airport worker as saying.
	   At the airports in New York and Geneva, grief counselors were on
hand for relatives of the crash victims. A special lounge was set
up in the Delta Air Lines terminal at Kennedy Airport.
	   More than 100 relatives and friends had gathered at the Geneva
airport. Kennedy officials reported only a handful of relatives had
shown up there overnight.
	   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington sent a
team of 10 people to Canada Thursday morning.
	   It was the first crash of a Swissair plane since Oct. 7, 1979,
when one of its DC-8s overshot the runway in Athens, Greece, while
attempting to land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were
killed.
	   The plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled
in August and September last year, said Georges Schorderet, the
chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup. It had been
checked as all are before takeoff, he added.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a jet known for its reliability,
even though its manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to
discontinue the model in the year 2000.

Albright says Western democracies have responsibility to stand by
</HEADLINE>
Russian reformers &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Returning from a critical U.S.-Russian
summit, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
democracies with market economies must encourage like-minded forces
in Russia and make clear there is ``no going backwards.''
	   ``They are at a crossroads,'' Albright said after meetings with
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel. ``If they are going to part of the global economy, they
are going to have to take certain steps.''
	   Albright paid a brief stop at this former imperial capital to
give Austrian and European Union officials a first-hand report on
the two-day summit, which took place amid a Russian political and
economic crisis that has shaken global financial markets and raised
concerns about the course of Moscow's reform program.
	   During a speech to representatives of the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Albright said the ``problem
right now is that the Russian people are hurting.
	   ``Many believe that democracy has not empowered them to improve
their lives,'' she told the representatives. ``This is dangerous
because Russia cannot emerge from its difficulties unless its
people take responsibility for shaping their country's future.''
	   Appearing with the Austrian foreign minister at a joint press
conference, Albright said Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``was
very much in charge during the meetings and he's directing the
process.''
	   She acknowledged ``increasing strength'' among Communist members
of the Russian parliament, who have been blocking confirmation of
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   ``What I think is very important ... is basically that it is up
to countries with market economies and democracy to continue to
encourage those (like-minded) forces within Russia and to make it
very clear that there is no going backwards,'' she said.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency,
said continuing with reforms was a firm condition for Moscow to
receive economic help from the Europeans.
	   On other issues, Albright said she was encouraged by U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from
Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill won an agreement in
principle this week from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
the main Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, for an interim
accord granting self-rule to Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   Albright also repeated calls for ``free and fair elections'' in
Bosnia, which she visited last week on her way to Moscow. Members
of Bosnia's three ethnic communities vote in national elections
next week.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hristo Bonev will rely on USA 94
stalwarts Hristo Stoichkov, Daniel Borimirov and Ivailo Yordanov
when Bulgaria plays its opening European Championship qualifier
against Poland on Sunday.
	   After several successful seasons with Barcelona, Stoichkov
signed with Kashiva Reysol from the Japanese J-league after the
World Cup.
	   Despite the first-round exit of Bulgaria from France 98, the
trio are the only remainders of the team that reached the
semifinals at the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``I decided to invite these three `old' players because the team
needs somebody to lead the youngsters,'' Bonev said.
	   After the fiasco in France, Bonev first said he was quitting,
but later decided to stay at least for the first three qualifying
matches for Euro 2000.
	   Bulgaria and Poland have met a total of 22 times so far with the
Poles winning nine times and eight resulting in draws.

Croats weakened but confident of good start to Euro 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia left Thursday for its opening
Euro 2000 qualifier against Ireland without World Cup scoring
leader Davor Suker and several other stars.
	   Despite the absence of Suker, the Croatian team still feels
buoyed by its stunning success at the World Cup, where it finished
third.
	   ``I'm sure that whoever runs out onto the pitch on Saturday will
give their best for a good start of this new qualifying cycle,''
coach Miroslav Blazevic said before the team's trip to Dublin.
	   The team will have to make do without five regular stars _
Suker, forwards Alen Boksic and Goran Vlaovic and defender Slaven
Bilic _ who are out with injuries.
	   Erratic midfielder Robert Prosinecki, who has had a history of
problems with coach Blazevic, has refused to line up for the
national side after a new series of squabbles.
	   But Blazevic, who guided Croatia to the quarterfinals of the
1996 European Championship in England and to third place at the
World Cup in France this year, had no time to dwell on the
setbacks.
	   ``Our short preparations are over and the form of those
available is encouraging,'' Blazevic said. ``I have no complaints
and that's the main thing.''
	   The optimism rubbed onto the players too.
	   ``The Irish will run like mad and fight to the bone,'' said Igor
Pamic of Hansa Rostock in Germany's Bundesliga, who was called in
to fill in for the absentees in the attack. ``But it goes without
saying, so will we.''

Police say arrests of settlers on the rise

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Arrests among Jewish settlers in Hebron
have shot up, with more settlers facing charges or under
investigation for violent acts against Palestinians, Israeli police
said Thursday.
	   Tensions have run high in this divided West Bank city since the
August 20 murder of a well-known rabbi. In angry acts of revenge,
settlers have lashed out and beaten Palestinians in the streets and
destroyed Arab-owned property. Settlers have also scuffled with
police and soldiers, blaming them for failing to protect the small
settler community.
	   Since the stabbing death of the rabbi, police have opened 15
separate investigations against Jewish settlers, resulting in three
indictments and eight pending indictments, Hebron police commander
Yitzhak Aharonowitch said.
	   There are 500 Jewish settlers in Hebron. Police said they have
recorded 142 incidents of law-breaking by Jewish settlers between
January and August, compared with a total of 134 for the entire
year of 1997.
	   Over the past two weeks, settlers have been questioned for
kicking and hitting Palestinian passersby in the streets, and
toppled vegetable carts in the Arab market. A senior settler leader
is also under investigation for incitement against Israel's
president, another man was arrested for shooting at Arab homes.
	   The settlers live in the city's downtown area together with some
30,000 Palestinians under Israeli control. The rest of the city,
home to the other 100,000 Palestinians, is under Palestinian
control.
	   Settler spokesman Noam Arnon accused the police of prosecuting
minor crimes by Jews while ignoring major crimes by Arabs.
	   ``We're seeing a time of serious Arab violence which to our
regret reached its peak in the murder,'' of the rabbi, Arnon said.
	   Aharonowitch denied his forces gave preferential treatment to
either group. ``There is no difference between Jews and Arabs.
There is one law.''

Crash shakes airline reputation, but customers stay faithful
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The crash of SR111 off the Canadian coast shook
Swissair's reputation as one of the world's safest airlines, but
customers said Thursday they would remain faithful.
	   The crash that killed 229 persons was far and away the worst
disaster to strike the airline, whose previous high death toll was
80 in 1963.
	   An international spokesman for the airline industry, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Swissair continues to have one the
world's best safety records.
	   While no international agencies rate world airlines for safety,
Swissair's previous fatal crash was nearly two decades ago, when a
DC-8 jet overshot the runway and killed 14 people while landing at
Athens, Greece.
	   ``In principle I like Swissair more than other airlines,'' said
Michelle Ansermoz of Geneva, one of a number of passengers
interviewed by The Associated Press at Geneva's Cointrin Airport,
intended destination of the plane from New York that crashed off
Canada Wednesday night.
	   ``This accident will make no difference,'' said Ansermoz, who
said she often flies the airline to Norway and Amsterdam. ``You
always have a bit of apprehension when you take a flight.''
	   Baerbel Kawitzke of Germany said she flies three or four times a
week, and uses Swissair regularly into and out of Geneva.
	   ``It's a terrible thing, but I can't say I'm nervous. It could
happen to any airline,'' Kawitzke said.
	   ``Swissair is a very good company,'' said a man who would
identify himself as Joseph. ``Accidents happen anywhere.''
	   A Swiss woman named Erika said she was nervous, but only because
she was traveling on the same day as the crash. ``But I trust
Swissair,'' she said.
	   Switzerland's flag carrier Swissair, a publicly traded company
with the government holding only a minority share, was founded in
1931 from the merger of Balair and Ad Astra. It has grown into a
medium-sized European airline with links to airlines on other
continents.
	   Most of its longhaul flights operate from Zurich's Kloten
airport, where the company is headquartered. The New York to Geneva
flight is one of the few that operates out of Cointrin Airport in
the western city.
	   The company has a fleet of 63 aircraft, among them 16 MD-11s of
the type that crashed off the Canadian coast.
	   It also owns five Boeing 747-357 jumbo jets, 19 Airbus A-320s,
nine Airbus A-321s, eight Airbus A-319s and six Airbus A310-300s.
	   The parent SAirGroup last month reported a 17 percent rise in
net first-half profit for this year to 109 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 72.6 million).

Williams sports WTA Tour patch under threat of fines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams appeared to back down from a
confrontation with the WTA Tour on Thursday, taking the court for a
second-round match wearing a small black logo patch promoting the
tour and its chief sponsor, software company Corel.
	   The patch, about 5 centimeters (2 inches) square, was plainly
visible on the left shoulder strap of Williams' lime-green tennis
dress.
	   The tour fined Williams dlrs 100 after she won her first-round
match without the logo, and said that the fines would rapidly
increase to dlrs 25,000 per infraction if the situation didn't
change.
	   Reebok, Williams' uniform and sneaker supplier in a
multimillion-dollar contract, said a Corel WTA Tour patch would
violate its ban on uniform logos other than its own.
	   But tour chairman Bartlett McGuire said the WTA Tour was
sticking to its rules.
	   ``It's a major part of our sponsorship program,'' McGuire said.
	   Although most players wear the patch on their chest or shoulder,
McGuire said Williams had other options.
	   ``She can wear it on her hip, on her leg _ she can wear it on
her beads,'' he said, referring to Williams' trademark beaded hair
style.
	   Reebok said in a statement late Wednesday that it was willing to
``accommodate the WTA'' by having Williams carry towels, water
bottles or other objects with the WTA Tour logo.
	   The sportswear company was adamant, however, that forcing
Williams to wear the patch ``would represent a breach of Reebok's
contract with Venus.''
	   The patch is required on virtually all women's uniforms. The
only exception is for players under contract to Nike, which has a
no-patch policy for its athletes that predates the WTA Tour rule
and was given a special exemption, the association said.
	   Williams' father, Richard, said the rule was unfair and
threatened court action.
	   Reebok said the rule was ``arbitrarily enforced, with selected
players not being required to wear the patch.''
	   The defiance apparently didn't extend to the entire Williams
family.
	   Serena Williams, Venus' 16-year-old sister, wore a WTA Tour
patch on her Puma outfit Wednesday in a 6-2, 6-1 victory over
Pavlina Stoyanova.
	   ``I think everyone has to make their own choices,'' Serena said.
	   ``She put it on as soon as one was brought out to her,'' McGuire
said.

Report: Poor potato crop forecast for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government officials' quotes. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A dry spring and early summer followed by heavy
August rains could result in a poor harvest of potatoes, a Russian
staple, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``This year is going to be very bad, very tight,'' Sergei
Solenkov, head of the Agriculture Ministry's crop department, told
The Moscow Times. ``And the people survive on potatoes.''
	   Solenkov had no figures for the forecasted potato harvest, which
begins in September. About 90 percent of the country's potatoes are
grown by individuals at their summer cottages or on private plots
of land.
	   One government official called for calm, however, stating that
potato and bread reserves from last year would compensate for the
poor harvest.
	   ``There is no threat of famine in Russia,'' Russian Security
Council Secretary Andrei Kokoshin said Thursday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Even so, Kokoshin admitted that Russia's provinces would suffer
because of the smaller crop. Government officials are working on
ways to guarantee food deliveries to the hardest-hit places,
Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Potatoes are a mainstay of the Russian diet, providing 10
percent of the country's caloric intake, the Times said. Russians
eat six times as many potatoes as Americans _ an average 127
kilograms (279 pounds) per person per year _ it said.
	   If the potato shortage does not cause famine, Russia's economic
crisis might, other economic officials warned Thursday.
	   Foreign firms are cutting off food shipments to Russia because
they don't trust Russian banks and the ruble's fall makes customs
duties too expensive, Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister
Andrei Kushnerenko told Interfax.
	   Foreign goods like raw meat and vegetable oil, two imports that
have become Russian staples, will disappear, predicted Viktor
Khlystun, director of the Russian Institute of Agrarian Market
Studies, according to Interfax.
	   Russia's meat-processing factories are heavily dependent on
imported raw meat, and are now running at 37 percent of capacity
because of the crisis, Khlystun said.
	   If the crisis continues and Russia does not lower tariffs,
foreign imports may stop completely, Kushnerenko warned.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Numb shock. Hysteria. Silence. Uncontrolled
talking.
	   Specially trained counselors at Geneva airport struggled
Thursday to cope with the array of differing emotions unleashed
among victims of the Swissair air disaster.
	   Friends and relatives who arrived at the airport to receive grim
news of the crash were shielded from reporters in an attempt to
spare them further agony.
	   Some 229 people died when Flight SR111 from New York crashed off
the coast of Canada. There were 137 American victims and 41 Swiss
among the dead.
	   A tall blond woman in her early 30s arrived crying with an older
woman and two men shortly after the midmorning scheduled arrival
time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They wandered aimlessly for a few minutes until they were
beckoned by airport security staff to a special area where they
were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking,'' said Pastor
Jim Longhurst of the relatives. ``There's shock over the pain and
devastation.''
	   Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket, said he had special
identification with relatives of the victims.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, N.Y., who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join clergy and psychologists _ in
consoling relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the
crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   ``We're here to give emotional first aid,'' was how one
counselor, Andreas Goerlich, described his task.
	   Goerlich, who acts as priest at Zurich airport, said the most
important task of carers was to allow relatives to give free reign
to their grief.
	   Some needed to sob their hearts out. Others had to mourn in
silence and didn't want to communicate with anyone, he said. Others
had the need to relate over and over again details of last contacts
with the dead or of future plans, now thwarted.
	   Goerlich is part of a permanent team which was set up last year
to help families and survivors of a massacre of tourists by Islamic
extremists in Luxor, Egypt. Thirty-six of the 58 victims were
Swiss.
	   In addition to immediate counseling, relatives would need
long-term help to come to terms with their loss, he said.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Russia's defense minister calls for hasty formation of new
</HEADLINE>
government

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Warning that Russia's armed forces are ``not in a
festive mood,'' the nation's acting defense minister called
Thursday for the quick formation of a new government, a news agency
said.
	   Acting Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said he expected the
``relevant branches'' of Russia's interim government to create a
new government soon, but did not specify who was to blame for the
delay, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he said,
according to Interfax. ``They are worrying (about) when the
situation will stabilize and when a government will be appointed
that will take the economic helm.''
	   Sergeyev, who was defense minister in the last government, has
been nominated for the post again.
	   President Boris Yeltsin ousted his entire government last month,
and Russia's parliament has sworn to oppose his choice for prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. If the parliament opposes the
nominee three times, Yeltsin is empowered to dissolve the body.
	   ``God forbid a repetition of 1993,'' Sergeyev said, referring to
the 1993 standoff between Yeltsin and hardliners that ended in the
shelling of the parliament building.
	   Sergeyev made his comments during military exercises involving
forces from Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan, and Kyrgyzstan in Russia's
Astrakhan region, about 1,280 kilometers (800 miles) south of
Moscow.

Premier League clubs take united approach to Super League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool agreed
Thursday to cease individual negotiations with the promoters of a
European Super League in favor of dealing through the Premier
League.
	   The owners of England's 20 Premier League soccer clubs met in
London, where a motion to work together in any consultation on a
European league was carried unanimously.
	   Premier League chief executive Peter Leaver said the meeting
listened to presentations from Media Partners, promoters of the
breakaway European league, and senior officials of UEFA, European
soccer's governing body.
	   ``There was clear opposition to the suggestion of a breakaway
but it was agreed that reform of European club competitions was
needed,'' Leaver said after the meeting.
	   ``(Club representatives) reaffirmed that the domestic league is
their bread and butter and they are content and want to stay within
the structure of the Premier League competition.''
	   Leaver said the creators of a new league could not sign up three
or four English Premier League clubs because all clubs had agreed
that negotiations would be done through the league.
	   ``Everyone agreed to deal with the League and fellow clubs in
good faith _ all clubs were happy with that.
	   ``I don't think in future any clubs will continue to have secret
meetings.''
	   However, Leaver, also a member of the UEFA taskforce formed to
overhaul the existing European club competition, said Media
Partners proposal had not been completely ruled out.
	   He said the potential of a rebel league had been a ``good stick
to wave at UEFA'' to force it into updating the existing European
club format.
	   ``It was inevitable there would be a change in the competitions
and the structure. In view of what's happened, I'd say the Media
Partners proposal has been a useful catalyst,'' he said.
	   ``We will continue to welcome, through the League, talks with
interested parties and to work closely with UEFA's taskforce to
bring about positive change in the interests of English football.
	   ``Nothing is in. Nothing is out. The paper is blank...we'll have
to see what develops.''
	   Leaver said the Premier League representatives listened to Media
Partners proposed structure but were not presented with a financial
model and therefore, could not decide completely on its merit.
	   ``Three or four or five clubs up to today had heard what Media
Partners was proposing, now all 20 know,'' he said.
	   ``Media Partners have presented a structure _ Media Partners
does not have copyright on proposals. We will be considering all
proposals on European league, it's not a question of rejecting this
or rejecting that.
	   ``It's easy to come up with a structure. What is difficult is
satisfying all the clubs, all the leagues and all the supporters.''
	   Leaver said the UEFA executive committee could decide on a new
format for the European club competition by December this year and
the new competition could be implemented as early as next season.
	   ``There is a lot of work to do until then. UEFA's opposition to
a breakaway league doesn't mean it can't take on suggestions,'' he
said.
	   Leaver said the Football Association's threat of bans or
sanctions against players and clubs involved in any breakaway
league was not raised at the meeting.
	   Media Partners, the Milan-based marketing company headed by
Rodolfo Hecht, presented a revised European Super League structure
to the Premier League members.
	   The new structure comprises a three-tier Super League involving
36 clubs and a second division knock-out competition involving 96
clubs from all of UEFA's 51 domestic leagues.
	   The Media Partners proposal, backed by international bank JP
Morgan and potentially funded through the sale of television
rights, opens the way for UEFA to take on a regulatory function
with Media Partners having a marketing role for at least six years.

FIFA medical chief calls for shorter season to stave off doping
</HEADLINE>
problems &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FIFA's medical chief said Thursday the
world soccer federation should forsake its search for more
television profits and shorten the season if it wants to keep
players away from doping.
	   Dr. Michel D'Hooghe said that certain soccer injuries had
increased dramatically since top-level soccer became an almost
year-round sport. That has increased the appeal of banned
substances for players wanting to stay fit longer or recover from
injuries faster.
	   ``The physical pressure on soccer players has become just too
much,'' D'Hooghe said. ``That's why people could be tempted to use
artificial means.''
	   He said so far doping was not a big problem in soccer, however,
could become one.
	   He said only a few days separated the July 12 World Cup final
and the first European Cup qualifying matches, putting
near-constant stress on the muscles and joints of the world's
greatest players.
	   ``Specifically, cartilidge injuries have increased
dramatically,'' he said.
	   D'Hooghe has no illusions, however. Medical arguments are
nothing in the face of big money.
	   ``It's the law of television,'' he said. ``There is one bigger
power than the power of medical science and that is the power of
money.''
	   FIFA already has been warned about the dangers of such a long
season, but he said other interests prevail.
	   In Europe, where the richest leagues lure the world's best
players, the proliferation of broadcast rights have added fortunes
to the coffers of soccer clubs and has resulted in a top-heavy
schedule.
	   ``There is no turning back,'' D'Hooghe said.
	   Even though soccer has been rocked by allegations of widespread
drug use in Italy, D'Hooghe remained convinced doping cases in
soccer were isolated incidents. D'Hooghe supervised 264 tests at
the World Cup and all were negative.
	   Like all other sports organizations, FIFA does not test for the
synthetic hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, because no reliable test
exists. EPO is used to enhance red blood cell production and was at
the center of the doping scandal that tainted the Tour de France
this summer.
	   ``I'm convinced EPO is not systematically used in soccer,'' he
said, although he admitted individual cases probably exist.
	   He said reseach had shown EPO to boost performances by 16
percent. It could be effective in soccer too, especially at the end
of the season when natural levels of EPO are low. EPO is banned on
health grounds.
	   D'Hooghe's comments came just ahead of the announcement of an
international sports medicine congress in his hometown next month.
	   The doctor tried to play down the soccer doping scandal in
Italy, where AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman has questioned the muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   ``It appears to be about creatine,'' said D'Hooghe, referring to
the legal muscle builder. ``That's not doping. It's a natural
product.''
	   D'Hooghe has had to deal with only one major case of doping as
head of FIFA's medical committee.
	   He excluded Argentina's Diego Maradona after he tested positive
for a ``coctail'' of stimulants at the 1994 World Cup.

Crash shakes airline reputation, but customers stay faithful

 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The crash of Flight SR111 off the Canadian coast
has shaken Swissair's reputation as one of the world's safest
airlines, but customers said Thursday they would remain faithful.
	   The crash that killed 229 passengers and crew was the worst ever
for the airline, whose previous highest death toll was 80 from an
accident in 1963.
	   Swissair is known as a reliable carrier. While no international
agencies rate world airlines for safety, Swissair's previous fatal
crash was nearly two decades ago, when a DC-8 jet overshot the
runway and killed 14 people while landing at Athens, Greece.
	   ``In principle I like Swissair more than other airlines,'' said
Michelle Ansermoz of Geneva, one of many passengers interviewed by
The Associated Press at Geneva's Cointrin Airport. The airport was
the intended destination for the MD-11 plane that departed New York
and crashed into the sea off Nova Scotia Wednesday night.
	   ``This accident will make no difference,'' said Ansermoz, who
said she often flies Swissair to Norway and Amsterdam. ``You always
have a bit of apprehension when you take a flight.''
	   Baerbel Kawitzke of Germany said she flies three or four times a
week and uses Swissair regularly to and from Geneva.
	   ``It's a terrible thing, but I can't say I'm nervous. It could
happen to any airline,'' Kawitzke said.
	   A Swiss woman who gave her name only as Erika said she was
nervous but only because she was traveling on the same day as the
crash. ``I trust Swissair,'' she said.
	   Swissair, Switzerland's flag carrier, is a publicly traded
company with the government holding a minority share. It was
founded in 1931 and has grown into a medium-sized European airline
with links to other continents.
	   Most of its longest flights operate from Zurich's Kloten
airport, where the company is headquartered. The New York-to-Geneva
flight is one of the few that operates out of Cointrin Airport in
Geneva.
	   The company has a fleet of 63 aircraft, among them 16 MD-11s of
the type that crashed off the Canadian coast.
	   It also owns five Boeing 747-357 jumbo jets, 19 Airbus A-320s,
nine Airbus A-321s, eight Airbus A-319s and six Airbus A310-300s.
	   The parent SAirGroup last month reported a 17 percent rise in
net first-half profit for this year to 109 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 72.6 million).
	   ``Swissair is a very good company,'' said a man who identified
himself as Joseph. ``Accidents happen anywhere.''

Kohl shows _ and shows off _ his age before younger challenger

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Less than a month before national
elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl unapologetically showed his age
Thursday in a televised speaking duel with his younger, slicker
challenger.
	   For 80 minutes, the chancellor who united Germany in 1990 and
now trails in the polls mostly reveled in the historic achievements
of his 16 years in power. He urged voters to renew their trust in
him at a time of uncertainty in many parts of the world.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, the centrist Social Democrat who leads in the
polls, replied with some of his nastiest broadsides of the campaign
as well as visions of a fairer society and more dynamic economy.
	   ``That was a long speech, and it was a speech about the past,''
Schroeder told Kohl. ``You are incapable of handling the future.''
	   With both candidates presenting sharply different campaign
spins, there was no clear winner in their face-off in parliament,
Germany's closest thing to a TV debate before the Sept. 27
election.
	   On the podium, the 68-year-old chancellor stabilized his bulk by
gripping the rostrum and visibly enjoyed reviewing his experiences
as a statesman.
	   Schroeder appeared tense. When his turn came, he quickly hit
hard at the record of Europe's longest-serving leader.
	   Pointing to Germany's 4.1 million jobless, he accused Kohl of
breaking his promise to cut unemployment when he first took power
16 years ago.
	   He lashed out at cuts in social and health programs passed by
Kohl's center-right coalition and accused his Christian Democrats
of presiding over a widening gap between rich and poor that the
Social Democrats would redress.
	   ``No one denies your achievements,'' Schroeder said. ``But your
policies have led to a split in German society.''
	   As Schroeder blasted his record, Kohl talked on a mobile
telephone, autographed a book and occasionally smiled like an
amused uncle.
	   ``I'm quite happy to be a grandfather,'' he said in an aside,
apparently after an opposition lawmaker mocked his image as the
father of German unity.
	   Kohl dismissed opposition criticism about former communist
eastern Germany, which remains economically depressed eight years
after unification. He said Schroeder's record suggested he would
not make continued aid to the east a priority.
	   ``Of course people had expectations there that could not be
fulfilled in such a short time,'' Kohl said. ``But just as clearly,
the picture has been improving.''
	   He said latest job market figures for all of Germany showed a
``clear turnaround'' in the fight against unemployment, and he
claimed credit for low inflation and a revival of economic growth.
	   But his strongest message: Voters should trust him more than
Schroeder, a 54-year-old centrist Social Democrat who has governed
Lower Saxony state since 1990.
	   ``The country needs clear, stable policies in these times,''
Kohl said. ``Experiments don't lead anywhere.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ruble toppled into a freefall Thursday
while the country's bitterly-divided political leaders headed in to
a parliamentary showdown that could brake _ or hasten _ deeper
collapse.
	   Members of parliament were to vote for the second time Friday on
whether to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. A ``no''
vote will prolong the political and economic instability, a ``yes''
vote could ease it.
	   ``Today the ruble is falling. Tomorrow the heads will roll,''
warned nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   The mood of anxiety and uncertainty was reflected in shops and
exchange booths. Price boards changed every few hours, with the
ruble skidding from 12 to 15 to 18 rubles a dollar. Shopkeepers
posted new prices on goods from noodles to shampoo to stereos.
	   ``From vodka to water, everything's going up,'' said grocery
store clerk Marina Suruyagina, 26. ``Our vodka is two times more
expensive than it was a week ago. Cigarettes are also up.''
	   The sudden and sharp price rises also sent tremors through the
rest of the country, where most people have not been paid in months
or don't have jobs. Russians were worried, but there was no sign of
panic or unrest.
	   In the central Russian city of Tula, pensioner Zinaida Danilova
burst into tears when she saw that the price of flour had doubled
in a week.
	   ``I haven't received my pension in two months, and I don't know
how I can afford this,'' she struggled to say.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Thursday, a day after the government said it was
powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   ``Some people are panicking, like pensioners,'' said Yulia
Nazarova, a 30-year-old seamstress. ``We're all nervous, of course.
But still, it was worse 10 years ago.''
	   The situation could stabilize, at least temporarily, if
Chernomyrdin is confirmed as prime minister Friday.
	   Zhirinovsky, who often criticizes President Boris Yeltsin, urged
lawmakers not to prolong the crisis despite what he called
Chernomyrdin's poor economic record.
	   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Of course we have pity for the 200
victims, but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''
	   But Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the lower house or State Duma,
predicted that Chernomyrdin will fall short of the 226 votes he
needs.
	   If Chernomyrdin is rejected Friday, several scenarios are
possible.
	   Under the Constitution, Yeltsin has the option of proposing him
a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the Duma votes no for
a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma elections.
	   Some say Yeltsin will do just that _ effectively calling the
Communists-led opposition's bluff and forcing them to face
elections a year earlier than scheduled. The Communists are not
particularly strong in the polls at the moment, but the turmoil is
likely to strengthen their support.
	   ``Zyuganov thinks this is his best chance of gaining power,''
said Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Duma deputy. ``The more unrest,
the better he thinks they'll do.''
	   However, Zhirinovsky and others warned that Yeltsin could decide
to impose emergency rule instead _ ruling by decree until the next
regularly scheduled elections for parliament in December 1999.
	   Several members of parliament's upper house, the Federation
Council, said they would approve emergency powers for Yeltsin if
the crisis came to that.
	   But others predicted the crisis would not take that direction.
The Agrarian Party, a Communist ally, said it would push Yeltsin to
name a different candidate the third time around.
	   Yeltsin himself moved Thursday to promote a compromise, reviving
a political deal nearly clinched last weekend, which the Communists
abandoned at the last minute. According to Russian news agencies,
Yeltsin made some amendments to the document _ which proposes a
reallocation of powers between the president and parliament _ and
sent it back to the Duma.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister. The political turmoil has left
the interim government unable to devote its attention to the
mounting economic crisis.
	   Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians not to panic and to leave
their money in banks, where he assured them it would be safe.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank reserves used to guarantee deposits
were also eroding. The bank said its reserves fell by dlrs 700
million in the last week of August to dlrs 12.7 billion. The bank
has spent billions in recent months in a futile effort to prop up
the ruble.

	   MAYOTTE, Comoros (AP)_ FBI agents searched a house and sought a
suspect in a possible Comorian connection to the U.S. embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last month, police said Thursday in
this archipelago off the Tanzanian coast.
	   The agents and Comorian military police on Wednesday night
searched the house on the island of Moroni that may have been
connected to the bombings last month, police said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Police also detained for questioning the brother of a suspect in
the investigation, police said. They declined to give the suspect's
name.
	   The possible Comorian connection came to light when
investigators found a Comorian phone number in Kenya, the police
said.
	   Transit links between the Comoros Islands and the east African
coast that includes Tanzania and Kenya are subject to light
security, raising the possibility the routes may have been used to
transport bomb-making ingredients.
	   About 20 FBI agents arrived on the island of Moroni on Sunday
and Monday, believed to be tracking the origin of the materials
used to make the bombs that exploded in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
police said.
	   U.S. authorities have obtained the extradition of several
suspects linked to the Aug. 7 bombings that killed 258 people,
including 12 Americans. More than 5,500 people were injured.
	   The suspects were linked to fugitive Islamic militant Osama bin
Laden, who was believed to be behind the bombings.

New Vancouver track could mean better racing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ It's a whole new game at the
Vancouver Molson-Indy.
	   When the CART FedEx Championship Series Indy cars get on the
track for practice Friday, it will be on a new layout. Thanks to
ongoing construction at the downtown Concord Pacific Place complex,
the old track is just a memory.
	   In fact, the new temporary road course hasn't even been
officially measured yet by Omega, CART's timing and scoring system.
That will occur before the cars go out for the first time.
	   All this newness doesn't faze Mauricio Gugelmin, the defending
champion.
	   The Brazilian driver got his first look at the track Aug. 20
during a promotional visit to the city.
	   ``They have done a great job,'' Gugelmin said. ``People say to
me, `Don't you want to go back to the track you won on?' My reply
is that the new track is such an improvement that everybody
benefits.
	   ``I think it is one of those places that is similar to Toronto.
Brakes are going to be very important _ a little more than on the
old track because there are more braking areas which will generate
more passing.''
	   Passing was very difficult on the old track. Since the first
Vancouver CART race in 1990, only one driver has won from farther
back than sixth. That was Al Unser Jr., who started ninth in 1995.
	   Unser, who has four of his 31 career victories at Vancouver,
said, ``I like going to new tracks. All of the drivers will have
the same amount of time to learn it before the race on Sunday,
which puts us on equal footing ...
	   ``I've had good fortune here, and it would be a great place to
give (team owner) Roger (Penske) his 100th win and to get my
32nd,'' he said ``I won my last Champ Car for Marlboro Team Penske
in Vancouver three years ago. It would be great to break the streak
here.''
	   Jimmy Vasser, who finished second last year, said, ``It's going
to be like racing on a brand new course. They've added some new
turns, there are a couple of new passing areas and I think the
whole track is going to be less bumpy. All the changes are positive
and should make for faster and more exciting racing.''
	   With five races remaining in the 19-race schedule, defending PPG
Cup champion Alex Zanardi of Italy is virtually a cinch to win the
title again. He has an 80-point lead over Target-Chip Ganassi
Racing teammate Vasser and will clinch his second straight
championship if he leaves here with an 89-point margin.
	   The Italian, who has won a series-high six races this season,
said, ``We're close to the championship, but I don't want to think
about that yet. I just want to get out there and race to a good
finish.''
	   Actually, the old Vancouver circuit never was a great course for
Zanardi, who started from the pole each of the past two years but
finished 26th and fourth.
	   ``I'm happy to be racing on a new circuit,'' he said. ``Maybe it
will bring me better luck. I'm sure the course will be better for
all the drivers because it's wider and has more opportunities for
overtaking than the old course.''

Bahrain records hottest summer month this century
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain experienced its hottest summer
month this century, with mean August highs of 41 C (106 F),
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The mean low temperature was 32.4 C (90 F), the English-language
Gulf Daily News and other dailies reported.
	   The previous mean high record was 39.4 C (102.9 F) set in August
1962 and August 1996. The previous mean low was 31.7 C (89 F) set
in the 1950s, the newspapers said, quoting figures from the
meteorology department.
	   The mean high apparent temperature, which factors in wind and
humidity, was 53.8 C (129 F), 4.8 C (8.6 F) above normal, the
papers said.
	   Although people in this Gulf emirate have been treated at
hospitals for sunstrokes or dehydration, no deaths have been
reported.
	   Last July, in the neighboring state of Qatar, five workers died
while working at a construction site as temperatures rose above 50
C (122 F). More than 150 people in Qatar were treated for
sunstroke, exhaustion and dehydration.
	   Temperatures of 50 C (122 F) are not uncommon in the Gulf.

Packers, Levens sign 25 million-dollar accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ Pro Bowl halfback Dorsey Levens
signed a five-year contract Thursday morning worth a reported dlrs
25 million, and now the Green Bay Packers can slap their franchise
tag on another star such as Antonio Freeman.
	   ``I feel appreciated now that somebody actually recognizes what
I've done in the past and possibly what I can do in the future,''
said Levens, who signed a one-year tender for dlrs 2.742 million on
Sunday so he could report to the team and begin practicing for the
American National Football League season opener against Detroit
this weekend.
	   ``Hopefully, I can end my career as a Packer. If I play past
this five-year contract, I'll be surprised,'' said Levens, 28.
	   General manager Ron Wolf said he felt Levens could be productive
throughout the length of the contract. Levens only became a
full-time starter last season when Edgar Bennett got hurt in
training camp.
	   ``I certainly think he can be, because of how he takes care of
himself and he is not ... beaten up,'' Wolf said. ``Through college
... there was always somebody there better than he was. Somebody
started in front of him. So, I don't think that will be a problem
for him.''
	   Levens played two years at Georgia Tech after transferring from
Notre Dame. He totaled 1,221 yards in 207 rushing attempts in
college. The Packers drafted him in the fifth round in 1994 and he
began his pro career as a fullback.
	   He split snaps with Bennett at halfback in 1996.
	   Levens apparently settled for a signing bonus of less than dlrs
5 million in exchange for a higher base scale in the first and
second years, His dlrs 5 million annual salary would be second to
quarterback Brett Favre's average of dlrs 6.75 million.
	   Levens' agent, Hadley Engelhard, and Packers chief negotiator
Mike Reinfeldt made significant progress after breaking through a
stalemate late last month. Engelhard lowered his demands on a
signing bonus and Green Bay increased its offer to a yearly average
of dlrs 5 million, according to Engelhard.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Albanian sources reported
fresh attacks Thursday in strife-torn Kosovo province despite
international hopes for a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts to
achieve a peaceful solution.
	   The reported fighting apparently concentrated in an area
southwest of the capital Pristina between the towns of Djakovica
and Klina, a town situated on the main east-west highway across the
province.
	   The region is one of few remaining strongholds of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been pushed out of other areas by
Serb-led forces in an offensive which began in late July.
	   The area of the fighting is believed to be packed with thousands
of refugees who fled the main town in the area -- Orahovac -- when
Serb forces recaptured it from KLA in July.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
said Serb forces launched a ``strong attack'' on three villages
outside of Orahovac, 55 kilometers (34 miles) southwest of here.
	   As the day progressed, fighting spread west, engulfing three
additional villages just north of the border town of Djakovica,
which is reportedly sealed off, the center said. Serb forces were
reportedly bringing in heavy reinforcements to the area.
	   The ethnic Albanian center also reported attacks early Thursday
on four villages south of Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from
Pristina, as well as in the Macedonian border region off Prizren
where fighting erupted three days ago.
	   No reports casualties were immediately available and the attacks
could not be independently confirmed.
	   According to Serb sources the fighting started after ethnic
Albanian militants launched coordinated attacks on police forces
patrolling the main Kosovo roads.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said armed Albanians launched
simultaneous attacks on Serb security forces near a village on the
Pristina-Pec road and near the town of Drenovac, 15 kilometers (9
miles) to the south near the Albanian border town of Djakovica. No
casualties were reported.
	   The reports come as U.S. diplomats continue to push for a
political agreement between the Serb-led Yugoslav government and
Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   In Vienna, Austria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the main Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, had agreed in principle on a formula
providing for self-rule for the province.
	   The formula would fall short of full independence as sought by
the Albanians but would be subject to review and changes after an
``interim period'' of three to five years.
	   Albright, returning from the U.S.-Russia summit, said both the
Americans and the Russians was critical now for Milosevic ``to halt
the violence'' to give diplomacy a chance.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled
with virtual martial law. In March, Serb and Yugoslav security
forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants, who are
fighting for independence.
	   The United States and European countries have called for
``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-1, but fear full independence would cause further
conflicts with Albanian populations in neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ At the scene of Northern
Ireland's worst terrorist attack, President Bill Clinton consoled
relatives of victims of a car bombing that killed 28 people and
shattered hundreds of lives last month in this religiously mixed
farming community.
	   ``To all of you, we thank you for standing up in the face of
such a soul-searing loss and restating your determination to walk
the road of peace,'' Clinton said Thursday in a closed session in a
community hall.
	   ``It's high time to stop the lilt of laughter and language being
drowned out by bombs and guns and sirens,'' Clinton said in a
crowded gymnasium where only the crying of a few babies melded with
the President's soothing voice.
	   With the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, at his side, the
president spoke to about 500 family members of victims. Later he
talked privately with a 14-year-old girl blinded in the bombing and
her mother, a nurse on duty at an Omagh hospital that day.
	   ``There's no word to explain a mindless act of terror that grabs
the life of an innocent, but I think the only way to truly redeem
such a terrible loss is to make the memories of the innocents
monuments to peace,'' he said. ``We cannot brook a descent into
terror. Northern Ireland is walking away from it. Life will never
be the same here, but it will go on.''
	   Earlier Thursday, the president told an assemblage of lawmakers
and citizens in Belfast that Roman Catholics and Protestants must
pull together with ``courage and reconciliation'' to build a new
Northern Ireland. ``America will continue to walk the road of
renewal with you,'' he declared.
	   Afterward Clinton met with members of the 108-member assembly
that will make decisions implementing the peace accord reached last
April that ended the Irish violence and set forth a road map for
disarmament and governing Northern Ireland.
	   In his private meeting with families in Omagh, Clinton told the
relatives the terrorist who set off the bomb in their farming
village ironically ``galvanized, strengthened and humanized the
impulse to peace.''
	   ``What happened here on August the 15th was so incredibly
unreasonable, so shocking to the conscience of every decent person
in this land that it has perversely had exactly the reverse impact
that the people who perpetrated this act intended,'' he said.
	   A transcript of Clinton's private remarks was provided
afterward.
	   The Omagh car bombing killed 28 people and shattered hundreds of
lives. The attack was perpetrated by an Irish Republican Army
splinter group that rejects the Irish peace accords and refuses to
adhere to the IRA's July 1997 truce. The group, calling itself the
Real IRA, later ``suspended'' its terror campaign in light of the
Omagh carnage, which it called unintentional.
 &UR; Still, optimism ..., 9th graf.

Explosion hits Socialists headquarters in a northern town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ An explosion rocked the headquarters of
the ruling Socialist Party in a northern Albanian town, further
raising political tensions, state television reported Thursday.
	   The explosion occurred late Wednesday, in the town of Lezha, 55
kilometers (35 miles) northwest of capital Tirana. Nobody was
injured in the blast that hit the four-story building that housed
the offices of the Socialists, their allies and the opposition,
state-run ATA news agency reported.
	   Both the ruling Socialists and the opposition of former
President Sali Berisha, have recently been embroiled in a political
dispute over the arrest of six Berisha party fellows. They accused
each other Thursday of standing behind the attack.
	   State television showed images of the shattered building, and
said that the offices of the Socialist Party suffered the most
damage.
	   Interior Minister Preikli Teta told the parliament Thursday that
his police were spending more time dealing with the opposition
politicians holding unauthorized rallies than fighting the
criminals.
	   On Wednesday, eight policemen were shot and wounded by armed
civilians in the south, while trying to regain control of a main
north-south road the civilians had blocked since Tuesday.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Shock. Hysteria. Silence. Uncontrolled talking.
	   Specially trained counselors at the Geneva airport struggled
Thursday to cope with the array of emotions displayed by relatives
and friends of victims of the Swissair air disaster.
	   Flight SR111 from New York crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia,
Canada, killing all 229 passengers and crew.
	   Loved ones who arrived at the airport to receive news of
Wednesday's crash were shielded from reporters in an attempt to
spare them further distress.
	   A tall blond woman in her early 30s arrived crying with an older
woman and two men shortly after the flight's scheduled arrival
time. She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older
man cried. They wandered aimlessly for a few minutes until airport
security staff beckoned them to a special area where counselors
tried to comfort them.
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking,'' Pastor Jim
Longhurst said of the relatives. ``There's shock over the pain and
devastation.''
	   Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket, said he felt a special
identification with relatives of the victims.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, an Albany, New York, native
who has lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst raced to Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join clergy and
psychologists in consoling victims' relatives and friends.
	   ``We're here to give emotional first aid,'' was how one
counselor, Andreas Goerlich, described his task.
	   Goerlich, a priest at Zurich airport, said the most important
task of care-givers was to allow relatives to give free reign to
their grief.
	   Some needed to sob their hearts out. Others had to mourn in
silence and didn't want to communicate with anyone, he said. Others
needed to relate over and over again the details of last contacts
with the dead or of future plans now shattered.
	   Goerlich is part of a permanent team set up last year to help
families and survivors of a massacre of tourists by Islamic
extremists in Luxor, Egypt. Thirty-six of the 58 massacre victims
were Swiss.
	   In addition to immediate counseling, relatives would need
long-term help to come to terms with their loss, he said.
	   Rabbi Mendel Pevzner of Geneva's Habad Jewish Community said
more than 100 relatives and friends had gathered by midday in the
crisis center, a quiet lounge surrounded by conference rooms for
private counseling sessions.
	   The people in the center were allowed to look for the names of
their relatives on the passenger list, Pevzner said.
	   ``The majority are calm, but there are people who are having
hysterical outbursts,'' he said.
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

Sanchez Vicario claims top Spanish sports honor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Three-time and reigning French Open
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario was chosen the winner of the
annual Prince of Asturias award for sports on Thursday.
	   A panel including International Olympic Committee chairman Juan
Antonio Samaranch praised Sanchez for her repeated tennis success
and selected her from a field of 27 other candidates from around
the world.
	   A winner of 26 WTA Tour titles, 27-year-old Sanchez Vicario
claimed her fourth Grand Slam victory in June at Roland Garros,
beating American Monica Seles.
	   The sister of ATP Tour pros Javier and Emilio Sanchez, Arantxa
was the third woman to accumulate more than dlrs 12 million in
career earnings when she reached the plateau in 1997.
	   Sanchez Vicario was the youngest to win Spain's national
championship when she claimed the crown at 13 years old.
	   The sports prize is one of eight Prince of Asturias awards given
each year in fields which include science, literature, arts and
peace.
	   Spain's national marathon team was awarded last year's sports
prize. Previous winners include American sprinter and long jumper
Carl Lewis, Algerian middle-distance runner Hassiba Boulmerka,
Czech-born American tennis player Martina Navratilova and Cuban
high jumper Javier Sotomayor.
	   The prizes take their name from the heir to the Spanish throne,
Prince Felipe of Asturias, who presents them each fall in the
northern town of Oviedo, capital of the Asturias region.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit, dumped tons of fuel and attempted an emergency
landing before his jetliner crashed into the ocean off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Flight SR111 from New York to Geneva plunged into the Atlantic
late Wednesday night after leaving Kennedy International Airport at
8:17 p.m (0017 GMT Thursday). It carried 215 passengers _ including
two infants _ and 14 crew. Most of the passengers _ 136 _ were
Americans, as was one crew.
	   By Thursday morning, 36 bodies had been found and searchers had
located a chunk of the plane's fuselage believed to be intact under
about 35 meters (115 feet) of water. Heavy surf _ a remnant of
Hurricane Bonnie _ hampered search efforts.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' said Maj. Michel Brisebois of the
rescue center.
	   Chances of survival at this point are ``very poor,'' Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 reported problems at 33,000 feet
(10,000 meters), then descended to roughly 8,000 feet (2,500
meters) before disappearing from radar about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Halifax International Airport, said Philippe
Bruggisser, chief executive officer of Swissair's parent group.
	   The crash occurred between seven and 10 minutes before the plane
would have reached Halifax, he said at a news conference in Zurich.
	   The passengers had been prepared for an emergency landing and
many were wearing lifevests, he said, although Canadian authorities
said there was no evidence so far that lifevests were used.
	   Aside from the Americvans, passengers included 30 French and 28
Swiss citizens; six British citizens; three Germans; three
Italians, two Greeks. One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia, and the Caribbean
island of St. Kitts.
	   In New York Swissair Vice President Walter Vollenweider said the
list was based on passports and cautioned: ``This is no indication
about the residences of these people.''
	   Vollenweider said the pilot originally planned to land in Boston
because Swissair has an infrastructure there, but then headed to
Halifax because it was closer. The plane was 42 miles (68
kilometers) from Halifax when the pilot notified Canadian
authorities that he had an ``urgent'' situation.
	   ``He said 'Fine' and continued on to Halifax,'' the source said.
	   Swissair identified the pilot as Urs Zimmermann, 50, and
co-pilot Stefan Low, 36. Both were Swiss.
	   Witnesses on the ground reported hearing sputtering noises from
an aircraft passing overhead and then a thundering crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said witness Claudia
Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships immediately headed
out in driving rain to the crash site, about six miles (ten
kilometers) off the coast of Peggy's Cove, a picturesque fishing
village popular with tourists. Debris _ a pocketbook, shoes, a
necktie, a baby sling _ was found about an hour after the plane was
reported missing.
	   Wreckage from the crash spread out over six miles (ten
kilometers), and fishermen helping with the rescue effort said the
smell of fuel was overwhelming.
	   Roy Bears, a Canadian aviation safety investigator, said divers
were using sonar to map the debris field and try to locate the two
black boxes _ one, a voice recorder and the other, with technical
data on the flight _ in about 150 feet (50 meters) of water.
	   Bears said early indications are that it was not a terrorist
act.
	   ``There were 16 minutes elapsed from the time they initially
declared an urgent situation _ smoke in the cockpit'' to the time
the craft disappeared from radar, he said. ``At this point ... the
crew do not think they have anything that would indicate a
terrorist act.''
	   The White House and the FBI agreed terrorism likely was not a
factor in the crash. President Bill Clinton, who was visiting
Northern Ireland Thursday, was being regularly briefed.
	   ``We are deeply grieved,'' Clinton told reporters, expresing his
condolences to the families.
	   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien also extended condolences.
``The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is leading the
investigation, and is also co-ordinating a massive international
effort,'' he said.
	   Swissair said the passenger list will not be released until
family members are notified _ probably not until Saturday.
Meanwhile, it was organizing flights to Halifax from Switzerland
and New York for the families.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was among
the dead, along with his wife, according to the World Health
Organization. The United Nations said seven U.N. workers returning
to headquarters in Geneva were on board the plane.
	   The three-engine plane dumped tons of fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, The Canadian Press quoted an
airport worker as saying.
	   At the airports in New York and Geneva, grief counselors were on
hand for relatives of the crash victims. A special lounge was set
up in the Delta Air Lines terminal at Kennedy Airport.
	   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington sent a
team of 10 people to Canada Thursday morning.
	   It was the first crash of a Swissair plane since Oct. 7, 1979,
when one of its DC-8s overshot the runway in Athens, Greece, while
attempting to land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were
killed.
	   The plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled
in August and September last year, said Georges Schorderet, the
chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup. It had been
checked as all are before takeoff, he added.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a jet known for its reliability,
even though its manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to
discontinue the model in the year 2000.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The prime minister during Rwanda's 1994
slaughter was manipulated by a powerful and evil military, ``a
marionette _ the strings were pulled and he danced,'' his lawyer
contended Thursday.
	   Rwandans in the gallery at the U.N. tribunal laughed aloud in
derision as the defense pleaded for a sentence of two years for
Jean Kambanda _ or none at all _ ``to enable the healing to take
place.''
	   Prosecutors countered that Kambanda's crimes merit life
imprisonment, even though he's the first ever to plead guilty to
genocide and has promised to testify against other killers.
	   Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in the
tribunal's custody, faces sentencing Friday by the court, formally
known as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
	   In the Rwandan capital Kigali, Anastase Murumba, director of the
survivors' group Ibuka, asked in anger, ``How dare he ask for such
a sentence when we who lived know Kambanda was no puppet? He was a
big supporter of the genocide. He deserves the death penalty.''
	   Kambanda has already recorded 90 hours of testimony about the
1994 carnage to help build genocide cases against others. The
court's rules allow it to consider factors including substantial
cooperation with the prosecutor.
	   But Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna argued that no amount of
testimony against others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda,
42, is accused of inciting massacres of more than 500,000 Tutsis
and distributing weapons for the slaughter as his hard-line Hutu
government presided over the bloodbath.
	   ``How can you balance the thousands and hundreds of thousands
killed with the cooperation of the accused?'' Muna asked the court.
``We believe this crime merits nothing less than life
imprisonment.''
	   A life sentence is the maximum the tribunal can impose.
	   In April, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted of
genocide, the first executions in connection with the meticulously
planned, 90-day slaughter.
	   Kambanda pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of genocide and
crimes against humanity, including responsibility for the murder
and extermination of civilians, becoming the first person to accept
culpability for genocide before an international court.
	   The crime of genocide was decreed and defined in 1948, after the
post-World War II Nuremberg trials.
	   During the hourlong session, defense attorney Oliver Michael
Inglis acknowledged that Rwanda's genocide was heinous.
	   But he said the three-month frenzy of killing had already begun
by the time Kambanda took office, after the assassination of Prime
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana on April 7, 1994.
	   Although the indictment said Kambanda controlled the government
ministers and military officers who were carrying out the killings,
Inglis characterized him as a reluctant officeholder manipulated by
a powerful military.
	   Kambanda was afraid to dissent because he and his family would
have been killed, his lawyer contended. ``That latent threat was
always present,'' Inglis said.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, wearing a dark suit and tie _ let
his lawyer speak for him, telling the chief judge: ``I have nothing
further to add.''
	   Inglis defended Kambanda's decision not to apologize for the
genocide, as many Rwandans had expected, saying, ``I think he had
shown enough remorse in his confession. He was not here to put on a
show.''
	   Rwandans disputed Inglis's portrayal of Kambanda, saying he used
his position as a leader of an extremist political faction to
promote the genocide even before he was named prime minister,
Murumba said.
	   Rwandan Justice Minister Faustin Ntezilyayo said in Kigali he
was ``very, very surprised'' to hear of the defense's light
sentencing request.
	   ``The fact that he plead guilty and the fact that he is
collaborating with justice is useful for our reconciliation, but
that doesn't change the terrible crimes that he had done,'' the
minister said.
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.

Shares tumble in Europe, mixed in Asia

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks extended their losses in skittish
trading Thursday, with the Dow industrials quickly sinking 150
points before recovering almost half of the lost ground.
	   The selloff came as shares tumbled in Europe and following a
mixed day in Asian markets. An additional unsettling factor was a
sharp drop in the dollar in global currency trading.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down as much as 150.87 in
the opening minutes of trading. The average of 30 big companies
remained off 79.81 at 7,702.56 by early afternoon, adding to
Wednesday's late 45-point decline. The Dow had been up as much as
125 points Wednesday, but the gains evaporated in late selling.
	   There are fears that Asia's yearlong economic crisis is
worsening and that Russia's financial collapse will spread into
Europe and Latin America, further dragging down world economies and
corporate profits. A steep drop Thursday in the Russian ruble added
to the concern, especially in Germany, a major Russian trade and
banking partner.
	   The major index at Frankfurt, Germany, closed with a loss of 3.2
percent. On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day down
2.2 percent.
	   Markets also were rattled by the dollar's morning plunge against
other major currencies on speculation that billionaire financier
George Soros was aggressively selling the U.S. currency.
	   A spokesman for Soros' investment fund, citing a policy against
commenting on market rumors, would not say whether Soros was
involved in the selloff that pushed the dollar to levels unseen
against the German mark since November.
	   Stocks finished higher in Malaysia, Indonesia and Korea but lost
ground in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.8
percent, halting a three-day rebound from Friday's 12-year lows.
Shares fell amid worries about unstable global markets and
deteriorating Japanese corporate earnings.
	   Among the latest developments were the collapse of Toa Steel,
the biggest failure ever of a Japanese manufacturer, and word that
one of Japan's biggest electronics manufacturers, Hitachi Ltd.,
will record its first loss since the end of World War II and
eliminate 4,000 jobs.

Three Serbs plead innocent to broadened war crimes indictment

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Three Bosnian Serbs pleaded
innocent Thursday to U.N. charges that they orchestrated a campaign
of terror and persecution against Muslims and Croats in the former
Yugoslavia in 1992 and 1993.
	   Simo Zaric, Miroslav Tadic and Milan Simic were called before
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal to enter pleas to a new indictment
that has been broadened since their arraignments in February to
include more detail of their alleged crimes.
	   The three Serbs face maximum life sentences if convicted. A
trial date was not immediately set.
	   According to the indictment, only 300 of 17,000 non-Serbs
remained in their homes following the brutal ethnic purge of
Bosanski Samac in northwest Bosnia. Muslims and Croats were forced
to flee were or rounded up and held in camps where inmates were
tortured and beaten, prosecutors allege.
	   The same pattern of persecution was repeated in nearby Odzak,
from which almost all 22,500 non-Serb residents were forced to
flee.
	   The suspects allegedly all were ranking members of Serb
institutions set up to organize the purges.
	   Simic had to return to The Hague for the hearing after judges
released him from pretrial custody because is confined to a
wheelchair following a 1993 attempt on his life. The other two
suspects are in custody in The Hague. All three turned themselves
in voluntarily in February, saying they wanted to clear their
names.
	   Tadic and Zaric each pleaded innocent to two crimes against
humanity charges and an additional charge of committing a grave
breach of the Geneva conventions. Simic pleaded innocent to five
crimes against humanity charges, four grave breach counts and two
war crimes charges.
	   Set up in 1993 to prosecute those accused of atrocities in the
former Yugoslavia, the tribunal has indicted 60 suspects and has 25
in custody. Its most wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic,
remain at large.

US, Britain consulting on suspending Iraq sanctions

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With U.N. inspections in Iraq at a
standstill, the Security Council is moving toward its first real
step to punish Baghdad for freezing cooperation with inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain were hoping to introduce a draft
resolution to the council later Thursday that would suspend regular
reviews of U.N. sanctions until Baghdad resumes cooperating. If
passed, the resolution would represent the council's toughest
action yet in the nearly monthlong impasse.
	   In order to bring all council members on board, however, U.S.
and British officials were considering the possibility of a review
of the entire U.N. sanctions package against Iraq _ a move that
would force it to recognize Iraq's progress over seven years of
intrusive inspections.
	   Permanent council members China and Russia, in particular, have
been pushing for such a review. The two, along with France,
generally take a more sympathetic line towards Baghdad.
	   ``It's very important for the parties concerned to encourage the
Iraqis to resume cooperation with UNSCOM,'' China's deputy
ambassador, Shen Guofang, said as he entered the council Thursday
morning. ``We hope the Americans can show some flexibility in this
regard.''
	   The suspension of the regular 60-day sanctions reviews is
largely symbolic, since years of reviews have done nothing to ease
the 8-year-old measures.
	   Nevertheless, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz threatened
``strict measures'' Wednesday if the reviews were suspended.
	   On Thursday, the council was to receive a briefing from the top
weapons inspectors before taking up discussions on a resolution.
The briefing, according to a U.S. official, was to remind members
that inspectors haven't carried out any new searches since before
Aug. 5.
	   Iraq announced then that it was suspending cooperation with
inspectors because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
refused to certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   A U.S.-British draft would suspend regular sanctions reviews
until after the chief inspectors report that they have been able to
do their jobs.
	   U.S. and British officials stressed that any comprehensive
review of sanctions would only take place after Iraq complies with
U.N. resolutions and allows inspectors to resume their work.

Interior Minister Chevenement in coma after surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chevenement's condition improving, ADDS
background. Filing all lines

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
was in a coma on Thursday, but his condition was improving, after
suffering a heart attack during surgery, officials said.
	   The 59-year-old minister, in charge of the nation's police and
security forces, suffered an allergic reaction to the anesthesia
during the gall bladder operation Wednesday, triggering the heart
attack, officials said.
	   ``The minister was the victim at the start of the anesthesia of
a cardiac arrest most probably because of anaphylaxis,'' said Yves
Cudennec, chief doctor at the military hospital of Val-de-Grace
where Chevenement is being treated.
	   Anaphylaxis is a rare life-threatening allergic reaction.
	   ``He is currently in intensive care and his state is improving
slowly,''
	   the doctor said.
	   Chevenement is a key figure in Lionel Jospin's French government
and has at times been a critic of U.S. foreign policy. Interior
minister since 1997, he is in charge of the nation's police and
security forces.
	   The government announced that Jean-Jack Queyranne, France's
deputy minister for overseas territorial affairs, would temporarily
take over Chevenement's duties.
	   Chevenement has held a number of other ministry portfolios
during his political career, including defense, industry,
education.
	   He was best known for his outspoken views during the Gulf War.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

Congolese rebels say no deal with Kabila, vow to fight on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Saying he saw little chance mediation efforts
would bring peace to Congo, a rebel leader on Thursday pledged tozybront. But our
goal remains the same,'' said Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president
of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``We're ready for
everything, including air strikes.''
	   However, the president and his allies are expressing increasing
confidence they can put down the rebellion.
	   Kabila's army _ which, with military reinforcements from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia has pushed rebel forces from the capital,
Kinshasa _ has threatened to take the war back to where it started,
pursuing the rebels in their eastern strongholds.
	   Ngoma said after the reversal of their western gains, the rebels
were consolidating in eastern Congo and advancing in the southern,
copper-rich Katanga province.
	   The rebels control the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie and claim
to have taken Moba and Kabila's birthplace of Manono. The
government denies the towns have fallen and says its allied forces
are surrounding Kalemie.
	   Ngoma said the rebels were also closing in on the strategic
Kindu airbase, which the government could use to bomb their
positions.
	   He ruled out a negotiated settlement with Kabila, whom he has
accused of incompetence, nepotism and corruption _ things Kabila
had promised to eradicate after ousting longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   ``Democracy cannot be negotiated. The only thing that can be
negotiated is Kabila's departure,'' Ngoma said. ``War will
accelerate, and we are hoping to finish it soon.''
	   In Luanda, Angola, chiefs of staff from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Nabimia told Angolan Television the end of the conflict was near.
The TV report said the three military leaders had devised a plan
for ``the final blow'' to the rebels.
	   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe all but declared victory
Thursday in suppressing the Congo rebellion, even as an
international summit and U.N. chief Kofi Annan urged a cease-fire
and called on all countries participating in the conflict to leave
Congolese territory.
	   Annan has been holding talks at the Non-Alligned Movement summit
in South Africa with Kabila, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and South African
President Nelson Mandela.
	   Ngoma said he regretted the rebels had not been invited to the
gathering, and said Rwanda or Uganda, whom Kabila accuses of
spearheading the rebellion, could not speak on the rebels' behalf.
	   Kabila has said he will not entertain a cease-fire until Rwandan
and Ugandan forces leave Congolese territory. The two countries _
which helped Kabila win power last year _ deny involvement in the
war, but both have said they will intervene if their interests in
eastern Congo are threatened.
	   Rwanda, in particular, has threatened to intervene in Congo to
protect ethnic Tutsis, whom Kabila has accused of fomenting the
rebellion.
	   On Thursday, the Rwanda News Agency cited ethnic Tutsis in
Kalemie as saying Congolese troops had massacred at least 77 Tutsis
last week before retreating from the rebel advance.
	   The agency said state-run Congo radio had urged the
extermination of Tutsis who were then rounded up in churches and
clinics before the men were pulled out and killed.
	   The U.N. regional information network IRIN, citing sources close
to the rebel forces, said another 100 were killed further south in
the village of Dyura, near Moba.
	   Rebel forces have also been accused of killing over 200
Congolese civilians.
	   In Goma, Ngoma said the rebels had to work hard to convince the
largely sceptical population that the struggle was worthwhile.
	   ``People have gone through two wars in one year. They are tired,
and rightly so, they need proof that we are different from Mobutu
and Kabila. It's a big challenge for us,'' he said.

	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ With winds of 75 mph (121 kph),
Hurricane Isis hit the Mexican mainland, drenching the state of
Sinaloa early Thursday, but it weakened as it began to slog over
land toward the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona.
	   Winds overnight blasted out windows, knocked out electricity and
littered this city with downed street posts and tree limbs. The
roof at a local gas station collapsed atop a compact car, which was
apparently unoccupied.
	   Mayor Francis Lopez Brito said one person was seriously injured
by a jolt from a downed power cable in Los Mochis, some 400 miles
southeast of the U.S. border at Arizona. The storm killed one
person Wednesday in Baja California Sur state and two people were
missing.
	   Isis continued to dump heavy rains, but its winds were down to
50 mph (80 kph) Thursday and it was downgraded to a tropical storm,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
	   At 0300 GMT, the center of Isis was about 100 miles (161
kilometers) north of Los Mochis and 270 miles south of the border
city of Douglas, Arizona. The hurricane center said it was moving
north about 9 mph (14 kph).
	   Maria Florencia Pedroza said she went to a Red Cross shelter at
a school when ``the water started coming into my house.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The scene has been played out daily amid Russia's
financial turmoil: Anxious customers try to withdraw their savings
from bank branches or teller machines, a process that often takes
hours, and sometimes ends in failure.
	   So far, most Russians have been getting their fast-devaluing
money. But as of Thursday, more serious problems are in store for
bank customers after Russia's Central Bank forbid largest retail
banks to operate with accounts.
	   Arthur Aksyonov thought he was being prudent when he divided his
money among several large banks after selling his Moscow apartment.
Since the crisis began, he could not withdraw his dollars.
	   ``These were the most prestigious banks, and I only put the
money there for two months. I just needed three, five more days,''
Aksyonov added.
	   On the face of it, the government's changes could eventually
help the depositors and ease the current crisis. However, customers
are likely to face a few unsettling weeks, or perhaps longer,
before the situation settles down.
	   Late Wednesday, the Central Bank forbid the country's leading
private banks _ Inkombank, Menatep, Most-Bank, Mosbiznesbank,
Promstroybank and SBS-Agro, to serve accounts. It urged them, along
with smaller banks, to transfer the deposits to the national
savings bank, Sberbank, where money would be guaranteed by the
government.
	   Customers would have the choice of leaving their savings at the
private banks or transferring them by Sept. 26. But for numerous
holders of U.S. dollar deposits, the order amounts to direct
confiscation _ according to Central Bank, the currency would be
converted into rubles at the rate of 9.33 against Thursday's 16.92.
	   ``That is robbery,'' an angry customer told Russia's NTV
network. Another woman added, ``How can you trust a state bank if
you don't trust the state?''
	   The largest banks would still be able to serve new accounts and
are to resume full operations by Nov. 15. But the Central Bank's
move is likely to force even the most reluctant customers to
transfer their money to the state bank rather than face long
periods of uncertainty.
	   In a statement, the Central Bank said the step was ``the only
way to protect the main part of deposits and at the same time allow
many leading banks to stabilize their work.''
	   The situation is even worse for bank workers. Top Moscow
employment agencies estimated Thursday that tens of thousands of
employees of banks and financial and investment companies will be
laid off in the next two months, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia's private banks sprouted rapidly after the Soviet
collapse in 1991 and the beginning of free-market reforms. But
critics say they have been poorly regulated and were already
vulnerable before the latest crisis hit.
	   Many Russian banks got in trouble by taking out large dollar
loans from foreign banks. Now, they can't afford to pay them back
because their ruble assets are worth less each day.
	   The story of SBS-Agro illustrates how quickly the banks grew _
and how swiftly they began to unravel.
	   In just a few years, SBS-Agro had become the second-largest
retail network in Russia after Sberbank. It has 5.7 million
depositors and 1.5 million commercial customers, and operates a
network of 2,500 branches across the country.
	   But SBS-Agro has been hard hit by the recent financial turmoil,
and the Central Bank last week said it was taking over SBS-Agro and
ordered it to close some branches. The bank refused to comply,
blocking Central Bank officials from entering its headquarters
earlier this week, and the sides are now entangled in a legal
dispute.
	   In the interim, the customers have been hurting.
	   Customers tried unsuccessfully to withdraw their dollars at the
start of the crisis last month, and then SBS-Agro offered them
limited amounts of rubles instead of dollars.
	   SBS-Agro owes dlrs 1 billion in foreign debt, according to
deputy director Andrei Likov. Still, SBS-Agro's mustachioed
chairman Alexander Smolensky fumes about the Central Bank's moves.
	   ``There are attempts to nationalize SBS-Agro. If this is the
case, then we will get back to the year of 1917,'' Smolensky said,
referring to the Bolshevik revolution that brought private property
seizures.

Government rejects compensation to Greenland children deported in
</HEADLINE>
1950s &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The government on Thursday rejected a
demand for apologies or compensation to 22 Greenland children who
were deported to Denmark as part of an experiment to imbue them
with a Danish identity.
	   Ellen Kristensen, one of the two members of Danish parliament
representing Greenland, had asked Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen to consider some kind of reparation.
	   The children, aged 5 and 7, were either orphans or had lost one
parent when they were deported in 1951. The aim was to encourage a
Danish identity so that when they returned to the Arctic island
they could set an example for others, according to a recently
published book on the previously little-known program.
	   In 1953, the children returned to Greenland and were they kept
away from their families. None of those involved were ever informed
why the children were deported and later isolated from their
relatives, according to Tine Bryld who authored the book.
	   ``It wasn't a happy period for the involved children but it was,
according to what I can understand, done with the best
intentions,'' Nyrup Rasmussen said in a letter to Kristensen.
	   In a statement, Kristensen said ``Money isn't the most important
thing. The prime minister owes an apology to the test persons and
their families.''
	   Greenland has substantial home-rule powers, but many
Greenlanders seek more autonomy or even independence.

Jane's: Suspect says Osama bin Laden's arsenal matches any small
</HEADLINE>
country &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The renegade Saudi millionaire accused by the
United States of inspiring attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania has an arsenal that can match the army of any small
country, Jane's Defense Weekly reported Thursday, quoting a suspect
in the attacks.
	   The respected military magazine said Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who
was arrested at Karachi airport on his arrival from Nairobi the day
of the bombings, told Pakistani intelligence officials that Osama
bin Laden's army contains 4,000 to 5,000 militants from Arab
countries and Pakistan.
	   Jane's said there are reports bin Laden also finances the
Pakistan-based religious group, Harakat-ul-Mujahideen.
	   That group, originally called the Harkat-ul-Ansar, changed its
name after the U.S. government declared it a terrorist
organization, the magazine said.
	   Last week, Jane's reported that Odeh also told Pakistani
intelligence he was on his way to Afghanistan with six other
members of bin Laden's forces, who were successful in evading
security checks at Karachi airport.
	   Jane's and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said he confessed
to involvement in the Aug. 7 embassy bombings, which killed 259
people and injured more than 5,500.
	   Odeh, 33, was sent to Kenya and then to the United States, where
he appeared in court last Friday on charges of murder, murder
conspiracy and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. His
lawyer said he insisted he was not part of the bomb plot.
	   In retaliation for the bombings, the United States fired cruise
missiles Aug. 20 at an alleged terrorist training compound in
Afghanistan run by bin Laden and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan
suspected of producing components of chemical weapons.
	   In this week's issue, Jane's quoted Pakistani intelligence
sources as saying they believe that, despite the missile attacks,
bin Laden's network remains intact, ``which is a great cause of
concern for Pakistani authorities.''
	   After the strikes, Afghanistan's Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad
Omar was quoted as saying bin Laden had promised not to threaten
the United States or any other country while he is in Afghanistan.
	   ``However, it is a matter of debate whether the Taliban can
influence the Saudi dissident who has been financing them for the
past three years and whose `private army' is believed to be
independent of Taliban command,'' Jane's said.
	   The magazine said the U.S. strikes on bin Laden's training camp
_ which ironically was built with CIA help to support Afghan
resistance fighters during the former Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan _ may have inadvertently contributed to accelerating
the arms race in South Asia.
	   The Tomahawk cruise missiles used by the United States flew over
Pakistani territory undetected to hit their targets in Pakistan,
Jane's said.
	   Senior Pakistani officials admit the missile strikes have
exposed Pakistan's vulnerabilities, and see the situation becoming
more alarming because India is working with Russia on the
submarine-launched Sagarika cruise missile, it said.
	   ``Islamabad will now certainly accelerate its project to deploy
its own cruise missiles,'' Jane's said.

Investigators looking at possible technical problem causing crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Investigators examining the wreckage of Swissair
flight SR111 that crashed off the Canadian coast suspect a
technical or human problem rather than any terrorist attack,
officials said Thursday.
	   But Swissair said they were unable to go into detail about what
caused the accident until the aircraft's flight-data and
cockpit-voice recorders can be recovered and examined. They will
give crucial insight into the plane's final 30 minutes.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti said there had been no threats or
other indications of a terrorist attack that would lead to any
conclusion other than technical or human failure.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said there were ``absolutely no
indications'' of terrorism.
	   U.S. officials said they also had no indication of terrorism,
but New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the FBI was investigating
nonetheless.
	   The three-engine MD-11 jetliner took off normally from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport at 8:18 p.m. Wednesday (0018gmt
Thursday) and initially was in regular radio contact, said a
Swissair statement.
	   But Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer Stephan Loew,
36, soon reported smoke in the cockpit and considered a change in
course for Boston, then decided to go for Halifax, Canada, which
was closer.
	   The plane crashed offshore, but with many bodies apparently
recovered in life jackets, it was clear there was time to prepare
for a crash landing.
	   Swiss Transportation Minister Moritz Leuenberger said there were
three possible sources for smoke in the cockpit _ a burning engine,
a fire in the luggage hold or an electrical short-circuit.
	   The airline pointed out that its pilot and copilot were not only
experienced with the MD-11, but were both rated as instructors with
the aircraft.
	   Swissair officials said the MD-11 has been a reliable, safe
aircraft even though they have had some technical problems with it
over the years.
	   The airline had some cracks in engine blades starting in 1993
and replaced all the blades in the entire fleet of MD-11s. Other
parts were changed on the manufacturer's recommendation.
	   The aircraft that crashed _ registration HB-IWF _ joined the
Swissair fleet in 1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years
ago. It passed its most recent one-day exam last Aug. 10.
	   It had been maintained by Swissair, KLM and Air France,
officials said.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash, and they are being joined by specialists from the United
States and Switzerland.
	   A Canadian investigator is expected in Zurich on Friday to
examine the plane's records.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandela clarifying he does NOT back military

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila's
main military ally _ Zimbabwe _ all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from the capital Kinshasa and were advancing
eastward into rebel territory in the vast central African nation.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny involvement.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared at
a summit of the Nonaligned Movement in this Indian Ocean city. ``We
have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain it cannot fall
and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Taking the podium minutes later, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni complained that foreign troops were propping up a
government which ``has not been elected.'' Kabila led a rebellion
last year that ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   For the first time, Museveni also acknowledged Ugandan troops
are in rebel-held territory in eastern Congo. He did not respond to
Kabila's allegations that Ugandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   The talks here have led to a shift in South Africa's position on
intervention by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
	   Before, President Nelson Mandela had sought to promote diplomacy
and negotiations to stop the fighting, but on Thursday he told
reporters it was ``reasonable'' for outside countries to give the
military aid Kabila had requested.
	   Mandela later denied that his remarks represented a shift in
South African policy, reaffirming that he opposed military
intervention but could accept the reasons for it.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland visited Geneva
airport Thursday to offer her sympathy to relatives of those killed
when a Swissair plane crashed off the coast of Canada.
	   ``This is a time of great grief and sorrow,'' Madeleine May
Kunin said told reporters visiting a crisis center set up at the
airport to help counsel next-of-kin.
	   A number of families and a number of Americans were at the
center, Kunin said, but declined to give more details. The flight
originated in New York.
	   Some 137 of the victims were U.S. citizens, making it the
largest national group on the plane, Swissair officials said. There
was no immediate indication of how many of the Americans lived in
Europe.
	   The ambassador said she had ``terrific sympathy for the family
and friends of those who perished.''
	   ``It is the kind of situation that leaves you at a loss for
words,'' Kunin said, adding that outsiders could help ``with our
humanity.''
	   Similar counseling was also being offered to relatives in New
York.
	   Pierre Froidevaux, chief of the Geneva airport's emergency
medical team, said conversation in the Swiss crisis center was
mostly in French, the local language of western Switzerland.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dr. Jonathan Mann, who became known as the
outspoken head of the World Health Organization's AIDS program when
the disease exploded in the 1980s, was among the 229 people killed
in the crash of Swissair Flight 111.
	   Mann, 51, was dean of Allegheny University of the Health
Sciences' School of Public Health in Philadelphia, formerly known
as Hahnemann University Hospital.
	   Mann resigned in December from Harvard University's School of
Public Health, where he was a professor of international health and
epidemiology. He was also director of Harvard's Francois-Xavier
Bagnoud Center of Health and Human Rights.
	   The Boston native headed the WHO's AIDS program from 1986 until
1990, when he resigned amid a bitter clash with Hiroshi Nakajima,
then WHO's director-general. Nakajima's attitude ``completely
paralyzed our efforts,'' Mann said then.
	   ``It's a terrific loss for the whole AIDS community because his
name and voice are very familiar to anybody who works on this
issue,'' Larry Kessler, executive director of the AIDS Action
Committee of Boston, said of Mann's death.
	   ``I think his only regret was that he could never find enough
money worldwide that would make a big enough dent in this
epidemic,'' he said.
	   Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, who was with her husband on the plane,
also was a noted AIDS researcher who taught at Johns Hopkins
University School of Public Health. She was working on developing
AIDS vaccines.
	   Mann had intended as a medical student to become an eye doctor,
but fast became interested in public health when he went to New
Mexico after graduation to work for the Centers for Disease
Control. Two years later, in 1977, he moved to the state's public
health department and held various positions, including state
epidemiologist. He stayed in New Mexico for 10 years and was
credited with helping control bubonic plague there.
	   After that, Mann said he needed a change and took an offer to
spend a year in Zaire setting up an AIDS research facility under
the auspices of the WHO.
	   A memorial observance was scheduled for Thursday, Leclair said.

Duma committee rushes to put impeachment on parliamentary agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The committee working to impeach President Boris
Yeltsin rushed on Thursday to put its motion on the parliamentary
agenda next week, Russian television reported.
	   The haste appeared motivated largely by the instinct for
self-preservation. A successful impeachment vote against Yeltsin
would secure the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, a
three-month period of immunity against possible dissolution by the
president. If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's prime minister-designate
Viktor Chernomyrdin three times, the president is constitutionally
empowered to disband the legislature.
	   The Duma has already voted once against Chernomyrdin. A second
vote is scheduled Friday.
	   Previous attempts to impeach Yeltsin have foundered. In addition
to confirmation by the Federation Council, the impeachment motion
would require approval from both the Constitutional and Supreme
Courts.
	   The impeachment campaign started long before Russia's latest,
unfolding financial crisis. The Communist-led opposition in the
Duma has accused Yeltsin of instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, causing Russia to lose much of its wealth and military
might.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse Yeltsin of
launching the botched war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's economy and
military, and using troops and tanks against his foes in the former
Russian parliament in October 1993.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Flashing the skills that could take her back to
the final, fifth-seeded Venus Williams moved easily into the third
round of the U.S. Open on Thursday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
qualifier Anne Kremer of Luxembourg.
	   In other early second-round matches, No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario defeated Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia 6-3, 6-2 and No. 13
Amanda Coetzer got past Raluca Sandu of Romania 6-0, 6-2. Kremer,
Zuluaga and Sandu all were qualifiers.
	   The three matches were the first completed in a jammed schedule
on Day 4 of the year's final Grand Slam.
	   The 18-year-old Williams, playing in only her second U.S. Open,
began by showing off a rapidly developing and lethal
serve-and-volley game. With her quickness, long legs and reach,
Williams a maturing net game that included a deft touch on drop
volleys.
	   It also didn't hurt to start the points with her huge serve, the
fastest of which was timed at 188 kph (117 mph).
	   While Williams completely controlled the opening set, Kremer put
up a much stiffer fight in the second.
	   ``She played better as the match went on. We had better rallies,
and I appreciate that very much,'' Williams said.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ At the scene of Northern
Ireland's worst terrorist attack, President Bill Clinton consoled
relatives of victims of a car bombing that killed 28 people and
shattered hundreds of lives last month in this religiously mixed
farming community.
	   ``To all of you, we thank you for standing up in the face of
such a soul-searing loss and restating your determination to walk
the road of peace,'' Clinton said Thursday in a closed session in a
community hall.
	   ``It's high time to stop the lilt of laughter and language being
drowned out by bombs and guns and sirens,'' Clinton said in a
crowded gymnasium where only the crying of a few babies melded with
the President's soothing voice.
	   With the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, at his side, the
president spoke to about 500 family members of victims. Later he
talked privately with a 14-year-old girl blinded in the bombing and
her mother, a nurse on duty at an Omagh hospital that day.
	   ``There's no word to explain a mindless act of terror that grabs
the life of an innocent, but I think the only way to truly redeem
such a terrible loss is to make the memories of the innocents
monuments to peace,'' he said. ``We cannot brook a descent into
terror. Northern Ireland is walking away from it. Life will never
be the same here, but it will go on.''
	   After meeting with families, the Clintons and Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, walked down Market Street and just
outside a bomb-gutted building unveiled a memorial plaque to the
victims. ``May their memories serve to foster peace and
reconciliation,'' the inscription read. Mrs. Clinton laid a spray
of white flowers at the foot of the plaque.
	   The leaders and their wives walked past shops with boarded up
windows and stopped to talk to emergency and hospital workers on
duty the day of the bombing. Clinton then greeted thousands of
people who cheered and applauded him.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Albanian sources reported
fresh attacks in Kosovo province on Thursday despite international
hopes for a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts to end the fighting.
	   The reported combat was apparently concentrated in an area
southwest of Kosovo's capital Pristina, between the towns of
Djakovica and Klina _ a town on the main east-west highway across
the Serbian province.
	   The region is one of few remaining strongholds of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been pushed out of other areas by
Serb-led forces in an offensive that began in late July.
	   The area of the fighting is believed packed with thousands of
refugees who fled the main town in the area _ Orahovac _ when Serb
forces recaptured it from the KLA in July.
	   Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Serbs have used a heavy military presence to hold on to the
province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb forces launched a ``strong attack''
on three villages outside Orahovac, 55 kilometers (34 miles)
southwest of here.
	   As the day progressed, fighting spread west and engulfed three
additional villages just north of the border town of Djakovica,
which is reportedly sealed off, the center said. Serb forces were
reportedly bringing heavy reinforcements to the area.
	   The ethnic Albanian center also reported attacks early Thursday
on four villages south of Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from
Pristina, as well as in the Macedonian border region of Prizren
where fighting erupted three days ago.
	   No reports on casualties were immediately available, and the
attacks could not be independently confirmed.
	   According to Serb sources the fighting started after ethnic
Albanian militants launched coordinated attacks on police forces
patrolling Kosovo's main roads.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said armed Albanians launched
simultaneous attacks on Serb security forces near a village on the
Pristina-Pec road and near the town of Drenovac, 15 kilometers
(nine miles) to the south near the Albanian border town of
Djakovica. No casualties were reported.
	   The reports came as U.S. diplomats continued to push for a
political agreement between the Serb-led Yugoslav government and
Kosovo's Albanians.
	   In Vienna, Austria, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the main Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, had agreed in principle on a formula
providing for self-rule for the province.
	   The formula would fall short of full independence as sought by
the Albanians but would be subject to review and changes after an
``interim period'' of three to five years.
	   Albright, returning from the U.S.-Russia summit in Moscow, said
both the Americans and the Russians wanted Milosevic ``to halt the
violence'' to give diplomacy a chance.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 and has since ruled
with virtual martial law. In March, Serb and Yugoslav security
forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants, who are
now fighting to secede.
	   The United States and European countries have called for
``substantial autonomy'' for Albanians but fear full independence
would spark additional conflicts with Albanian populations in
neighboring countries.

Driver arrested as suspect in gold looting of German transport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASCHAFFENBURG, Germany (AP) _ A magistrate on Thursday ordered
the arrest of a driver as a suspect in the looting of gold from a
post transport shipment a day earlier as police sought accomplices
in the plot.
	   The arrest came a day after the driver reported that robbers
with a police-style flashing blue light on their car ambushed his
van and made off with some 600,000 marks (dlrs 343,000) in gold and
other valuables.
	   Police said the 24-year-old driver claimed he was beaten
unconscious and locked in his cab by the two men, who forced him to
stop on an autobahn superhighway near Aschaffenburg, 45 kilometers
(30 miles) east of Frankfurt, at about midnight Tuesday.
	   A check of the driver revealed he had previously been involved
in stealing private property in Frankfurt, investigators said. In
addition some unopened mail sacks without valuables were found
discarded near where the alleged robbery took place.
	   Authorities have offered a reward of 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,500)
for information leading to the arrest of the driver's suspected
accomplices, police said.

Dollar down on rumored Soros selling, gold down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with late rates

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The U.S. dollar plunged against other major
currencies Thursday, hitting fresh lows against the German mark
amid speculation that investor George Soros was aggressively
selling the greenback.
	   Gold prices were also lower.
	   As the dollar dropped to 1.7270 marks, from 1.7520 on Wednesday,
Dow Jones Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying Soros was
selling dollars for marks in New York.
	   Soros would not say whether or not he was involved in the
selloff that pushed the dollar to levels unseen against the mark
since November.
	   ``It's the policy of Soros Fund Management not to comment on the
rumors of the marketplace,'' said Soros spokesman Shawn Pattison.
	   Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
	   _ 134.67 Japanese yen, down from 137.72
	   _ 1.4193 Swiss francs, down from 1.4398
	   _ 5.7905 French francs, down from 5.8646
	   _ 1.9496 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9757
	   _ 1,705.88 Italian lire, down from 1,727.96
	   _ 1.5391 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5517
	   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.6755, up from dlrs
1.6681.
	   Gold closed in London at dlrs 278.50 bid per troy ounce, down
from dlrs 279.90 bid Wednesday.
	   In Zurich, gold traded at dlrs 280.10, down from dlrs 280.20
late Wednesday.
	   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell dlrs 1.50 to close at dlrs
278.95 bid.
	   Silver closed in London at dlrs 4.77 bid per troy ounce, down
from dlrs 4.82 bid Wednesday.

Troubled Norwegian government losing support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Support for the three parties in Norway's
troubled centrist coalition government has declined sharply, new
polls indicate.
	   The polls, whose results were summarized Thursday by the
Norwegian news agency NTB, were conducted in August, just before
Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik took sick leave, saying he was
suffering a depressive reaction brought on by overwork.
	   According to summary, only 20.6 percent of the electorate would
vote for the parties in the government if elections were held now.
The Labor party, which lost power to the centrists a year ago,
recorded support of about 40 percent in the polls.
	   Bondevik's government remained popular until the economy soured
during the summer, as a result of low oil prices, the impact of the
Asian economic crisis and a perception that the coalition was
internally divided and unable to respond to an overheating economy.
	   The coalition's future has become even bleaker since Bondevik
became ill in the middle of tough budget negotiations and as it
became gradually more obvious that the government might have to
drop promises of cash support for mothers who stay home with their
children.

 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ By all accounts it was a
pleasant evening on Peggy's Cove, with a light wind and medium
seas, when a plane roared down from the sky and crashed into the
cold water, leaving a field of floating debris, bodies and jet fuel
that stretched over six miles.
	   ``I heard a huge crash, like thunder,'' said Wilfred Morash, a
resident of nearby Blandford. ``Then all of the sudden on my
scanner the alarms went off and they said a plane had gone down in
Peggy's Cove.''
	   Within minutes, fisherman and local boaters were searching for
survivors in the debris, making frantic radio calls to the Halifax
Search and Rescue Center, said navy spokeswoman Tracy Simoneau.
Rescuers said the air was thick with the smell of jet fuel, she
added.
	   Soon all available boats from this 200-year-old fishing village,
accustomed to making rescues in the North Atlantic, converged on
the site.
	   John Campbell, 34, was one of the first to rush out, calling on
some of his crew and heading out aboard his 42-foot (13-meter)
whale-watching boat. Smelling the fuel, he ordered his crew not to
smoke; seat cushions, Styrofoam and bodies littered the water in
the rocky cove.
	   Hours later, Campbell's ``So Much To Sea'' still was ferrying
rescue and military personnel to a scene he described over the
telephone from his boat as surreal and could not bring himself to
discuss it in detail.
	   Coast Guard helicopters hovered overhead and a navy refueling
ship, the HMCS Preserver, steamed into the bay. Above the
helicopters, a navy C-130 Hercules circled, searching the water
with advanced rescue equipment, and dropping flares that lit the
black water in an orange glow.
	   Life-jackets, luggage, clothing and papers bobbed in the
61-degree (16 Celsius) water. Jet fuel shimmered on the surface.
	   ``It's almost a floating city with the number of boats here.
They are making repeated calls that they are finding bodies and
human remains,'' a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
Rob Gordon, said by telephone from one of the boats. The largest
piece of debris was a shredded life raft, he said.
	   On shore, firefighters paced the beach near the crash sight,
behind them more than a dozen ambulances lined up to treat those
aboard and take them to hospitals. They waited in vain, for no
survivors were brought in.
	   A temporary morgue was set up in nearby Sheerwater.
	   After rain and choppy seas that made the search for survivors
difficult overnight, sun peeked through overcast skies.
	   Firefighters began walking the rocky shoreline at the first hint
of daylight, picking up debris washing ashore.
	   A Red Cross tent was set up on shore, where a few members of the
Canadian armed services and numerous journalists also waited,
subdued. A command post stood in the parking lot of a restaurant
overlooking the lighthouse and craggy shore.
	   Clapboard houses painted in pastels dot the rocky granite
landscape of Peggy's Cove, a popular Nova Scotia tourist town where
surf pounding against the rocks sends sprays 30 feet (10 meters)
into the air.
	   Clearly, however, fishing sustains many residents _ lobster pots
set in many yards and a black fishing net had been left to dry in
the public parking lot.
	   ``It is very eerie. Nothing happens here,'' said vacationer
Eleanor McMahon.

Singapore, Vietnam win; Indonesia, Thailand to face off again

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's coach called it justice. For his
Thai counterpart, it's ``some kind of punishment.''
	   Vietnam capitalized on its chances beat defending champion
Thailand 3-0 Thursday night to earn a spot in the Tiger Cup final
against Singapore, a 2-1 winner over Indonesia.
	   The outcomes create two intriguing rematches Saturday: Vietnam
and Singapore played to a goalless draw in a rain-drenched group
qualifying match.
	   Indonesia and Thailand, which meet in the consolation game,
played in Monday night's farce, when both tried not to win because
they didn't want to face Vietnam and its rabid fans in the
semifinals.
	   Indonesia scored an own goal with time running out to get the
preferred matchup, but then couldn't take advantage by losing to
Singapore. Thailand, the highest-ranked team in the eight-nation
competition, lost for the first time in four matches with Vietnam.
	   ``It serves them both right,'' one fan said.
	   The Tiger Cup organizing committee has urged a dlrs 40,000 fine
for each team. With a dlrs 20,000 prize for third place, both would
lose money if the maximum sanction is levied.
	   The ASEAN Football Federation will meet Friday to consider the
recommendation. Further sanctions are possible when the Asian
Football Confederation meets next week. The manager of Thailand's
national team already has resigned in disgrace.
	   Vietnam's Austrian coach, Alfred Riedl, said he thought the
punishment was too light.
	   ``Thank God, justice was on our side,'' he told the post-match
news conference. ``Luck was on our side.''
	   It certainly looked that way as Thailand's players _ who coach
Withaya Laohakul said were in a ``bad mood'' _ came out looking
like they had something to prove.
	   With a heavy police presence on hand, they kept the play almost
constantly in the Vietnamese end but couldn't finish.
	   ``In the first half, Thailand was the better team,'' Riedl said.
``We played too nervous. We made too many bad passes.''
	   Still, the Vietnamese took advantage when they got a chance.
After a free kick caused a scramble in front of the Thai net in the
15th minute, Truong Viet Hoang scored to spark frenzied
celebrations.
	   Those grew in intensity after Nguyen Hong Son got free on a
breakaway in the 70th minute and made it 2-0 after his first
attempt was blocked.
	   Van Sy Hung closed out the scoring in the 80th minute, again on
a breakaway. He was ejected a minute later for a red card but
Thailand could not capitalize.
	   When the match ended, fans took to the streets in droves for a
celebration they said would last through the night. Fans on
motorbike sped around waving Vietnamese flags.
	   Faced with heading back to Ho Chi Minh City to play Indonesia
again ``is some kind of punishment for the Thai team,'' Withaya
said.
	   Indonesia must feel the same.
	   Ho Chi Minh City's 22,000-seat Thong Nhat Stadium was only about
a third-full Thursday. Those who did show up made their sentiments
clear: They wanted Indonesia to lose.
	   Many sat during the Indonesian national anthem. They went crazy
when Singapore scored in the 13th minute as Nazri bin Nasir fired a
perfect free kick from the sideline and Mohammed Rafi Mohammed Ali
broke free with a crisp header right in front of the goal.
	   Nasir was the beneficiary of a good pass in the 30th minute,
gathering himself in front, turning and firing into the corner to
make it 2-0.
	   Mirobaldo Bento got one back in the 34th minute on an
opportunistic rebound, but that was all Indonesia could muster.

Naval leaders from Ukraine, Russia, U.S. plan for military

exercises &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Naval leaders from Russia, Ukraine, and the
United States conferred Thursday aboard the USS LaSalle, flagship
of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, preparing for joint Black Sea exercises,
the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
	   ``In this period of increased instability throughout the
theater, these meetings were even more crucial in promoting peace
and stability in the region,'' the U.S. Sixth Fleet commander, Vice
Adm. Daniel Murphy, said in the statement.
	   Ships from nine nations are scheduled to take part in the
NATO-sponsored Sea Breeze-98 exercises scheduled for Oct. 25 to
Nov. 4. The maneuvers will simulate relief and peacekeeping
operations in the wake of an earthquake.
	   In similar exercises last year, Ukraine, the United States, and
other nations angered many ethnic Russians on the Crimean peninsula
who believe the region should be part of Russia. Russia pulled out
of Sea Breeze-97 but accepted Ukraine's invitation to participate
this year.

Williams sports WTA Tour patch under threat of fines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Williams quotes in new grafs 5-6. &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams appeared to back down from a
confrontation with the WTA Tour on Thursday, taking the court for a
second-round match wearing a small black logo patch promoting the
tour and its chief sponsor, software company Corel.
	   The patch, about 5 centimeters (2 inches) square, was plainly
visible on the left shoulder strap of Williams' lime-green tennis
dress.
	   The tour fined Williams dlrs 100 after she won her first-round
match without the logo, and said that the fines would rapidly
increase to dlrs 25,000 per infraction if the situation didn't
change.
	   ``I wasn't sending any message,'' Williams said after beating
Anne Kremer of Luxembourg 6-1, 6-3.
	   Williams said she ``generally'' wears the patch. Asked why she
had deviated in the first round, she said: ``Deviation is common
among humans.''
	   Reebok, Williams' uniform and sneaker supplier in a
multimillion-dollar contract, said a Corel WTA Tour patch would
violate its ban on uniform logos other than its own.
	   But tour chairman Bartlett McGuire said the WTA Tour was
sticking to its rules.
	   ``It's a major part of our sponsorship program,'' McGuire said.
	   Although most players wear the patch on their chest or shoulder,
McGuire said Williams had other options.
	   ``She can wear it on her hip, on her leg _ she can wear it on
her beads,'' he said, referring to Williams' trademark beaded hair
style.
	   Reebok said in a statement late Wednesday that it was willing to
``accommodate the WTA'' by having Williams carry towels, water
bottles or other objects with the WTA Tour logo.
	   The sportswear company was adamant, however, that forcing
Williams to wear the patch ``would represent a breach of Reebok's
contract with Venus.''
	   The patch is required on virtually all women's uniforms. The
only exception is for players under contract to Nike, which has a
no-patch policy for its athletes that predates the WTA Tour rule
and was given a special exemption, the association said.
	   Williams' father, Richard, said the rule was unfair and
threatened court action.
	   Reebok said the rule was ``arbitrarily enforced, with selected
players not being required to wear the patch.''
	   The defiance apparently didn't extend to the entire Williams
family.
	   Serena Williams, Venus' 16-year-old sister, wore a WTA Tour
patch on her Puma outfit Wednesday in a 6-2, 6-1 victory over
Pavlina Stoyanova.
	   ``I think everyone has to make their own choices,'' Serena said.
	   ``She put it on as soon as one was brought out to her,'' McGuire
said.

Ethnic Hungarians withdraw their support for the ruling coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The political party which represents
Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians announced Thursday it was
withdrawing support for the government, accusing it of failing to
respect education rights of minorities.
	   The Hungarian Democratic Union, which has 36 seats in the
486-member parliament, made the announcement one day after a
parliamentary committee refused to support changes in the education
law to provide for a Hungarian-language university.
	   ``From now on, we will act in conformity with our own program
and the interests of our own electors, '' the party leader, Marko
Bela, said.
	   The loss of Hungarian support leaves the ruling coalition --
made of the center-right Democratic Convention and the social
democrats of the Democratic Party -- with 251 seats in the
assembly, still a comfortable majority.
	   But the move could exacerbate relations not only between the
Romanian majority and the Hungarian minority but also between
Romania and the Hungarian government in Budapest.
	   For centuries, Hungary ruled what is now Romania's Transylvania
region until the end of World War II, when control was transferred
to Romania. The status of the Romanian Hungarian community has
often been a source of tension in relations between the two
countries, even during the decades of Communist rule.
	   Relations between Hungary and Romania have improved markedly
over the past two years, since the reformist coalition government
took power in Bucharest. But the differences over the university
issue could threaten those ties.
	   Other major parties prefer a ``multicultural'' university for
all ethnic minorities in Romania, not simply one for Hungarians.
Romania already has a university in Cluj which offers courses in
both Romanian and Hungarian.
	   The leader of the Democratic Convention, Ion Diaconescu, said he
hoped the dispute will be settled ``in a correct way, respecting
the legislation.'' He did not elaborate.
	   President Emil Constantinescu invited the ruling coalition
leaders to talks Friday at the presidency palace. Leaders of the
Hungarian Democratic Union said they would attend.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland visited Geneva
airport Thursday to offer her sympathy to relatives of those killed
when a Swissair flight SR111 crashed off the coast of Canada.
	   ``This is a time of great grief and sorrow,'' Madeleine May
Kunin said told reporters visiting a crisis center set up at the
airport to help counsel next-of-kin.
	   Many families were at the center, Kunin said, but she declined
to give more details. The flight originated in New York.
	   Of the 229 crash victims, 137 were U.S. citizens, Swissair
officials said. There was no immediate indication of how many of
the Americans lived in Europe.
	   ``It is the kind of situation that leaves you at a loss for
words,'' Kunin said, adding that outsiders could help ``with our
humanity.''
	   Similar counseling was also being offered to relatives in New
York.
	   Pierre Froidevaux, chief of the Geneva airport's emergency
medical team, said conversation in the Swiss crisis center was
mostly in French, the local language of western Switzerland.

Clarke leads European Masters and looms up on European No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ While Nick Faldo and Colin
Montgomerie flopped once more, Darren Clarke carded a 7-under 64
Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the European Masters and move
a step closer to the European No. 1 spot.
	   The Northern Ireland golfer, currently No. 2 on the European
Tour money list 42,600 pounds (dlrs 69,864) behind Lee Westwood,
has a one stroke lead over Sweden's Patrik Sjoland.
	   Eduardo Romero, the 1994 winner, is one stroke further back at
5-under 66 with Sweden's Olle Karlsson and Per Haugsrud of Norway.
	   Westwood, who missed last week's BMW International after
pulling-out of the European Masters in Dublin with a hip injury,
carded a 1-under-par 70 to finish level with playing partner
Montgomerie, Seve Ballesteros and young English professional Justin
Rose.
	   While Westwood has struggled with injury, Clarke has been
closing the gap on his No. 1 spot with two second-place finishes
and a fourth-place in his last four tournaments.
	   Clarke opened with an eagle after driving to within 12 inches of
the flag and narrowly missed a second eagle when a brilliant
recovery shot on the 16th hit the flag and landed beside the cup.
	   ``It was a thing of beauty,'' Clarke said as he described the
missed chance after a poor drive. ``I tried to hit a high
four-iron, but instead hit it low and fat 100 yards left into a
bunker.''
	   Clarke hit the ball out of a bunker 83 yards out. It travelled
over the flag, spun back onto the flag and almost dropped for an
eagle.
	   ``The first shot was horrible, the bunker shot was very good,''
said Clarke who holed a short putt for the first of three
successive birdies on the last three holes.
	   Clarke said he was not focusing on the No. 1 spot on the tour.
	   ``I want to win tournaments,'' he said. ``If I do, the rest
takes care of itself.''
	   The tournament was the first to count towards Ryder Cup points
and struggling Montgomerie and Faldo started their campaigns with
uninspiring first rounds in wet conditions.
	   Montgomerie, a five-time European No. 1 who has missed his last
two cuts, started with a 1-under 70 on a course expected to produce
low scores.
	   Faldo, going through a disastrous period of form on the U.S.
Tour, was one stroke further behind after an even-par 71. Without a
win in 18 months, he carded four birdies and four bogeys on his
brief return to the European tour before he returns to the U.S.
	   ``I made a couple of bad swings and missed a couple of short
putts,'' said Faldo, winner of three British Opens and three
Masters. ``I've just got to keep working.''
	   Montgomerie also had four birdies but three bogeys.
	   ``A 70 is not acceptable round here unfortunately. The course is
tougher by a couple of shots this year but I didn't hit it as I
wanted and I didn't putt very well,'' he said.

Duma committee rushes to put impeachment on parliamentary agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 2nd graf that vote would be to begin impeachment
proceedings, ADDS background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The committee working to impeach President Boris
Yeltsin rushed Thursday to put its motion on the parliamentary
agenda next week, Russian television reported.
	   The haste appeared motivated largely by the instinct for
self-preservation. If the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, has started impeachment proceedings, the Constitution bars
Yeltsin from dissolving the body.
	   The Duma is currently at loggerheads with Yeltsin, who wants
them to approve his choice of prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's nominee three times, the president is
empowered to disband the legislature.
	   The Duma has already voted once against Chernomyrdin. A second
vote is scheduled for Friday.
	   Previous attempts to impeach Yeltsin have foundered. Once on the
agenda, the motion would need a two-thirds majority vote in the
Duma. It would then need two-thirds votes in three other bodies:
the upper house or Federation Council, and both the Constitutional
and Supreme Courts. All of those bodies have many Yeltsin allies.
	   The Duma's impeachment campaign started long before Russia's
latest, unfolding financial crisis. The Communist-led opposition in
the Duma has accused Yeltsin of instigating the collapse of the
Soviet Union, causing Russia to lose much of its wealth and
military might.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse Yeltsin of
launching the botched war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's economy and
military, and using troops and tanks against his foes in the former
Russian parliament in October 1993.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit, dumped tons of fuel and prepared for an emergency
landing before his jetliner crashed into the ocean off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Flight SR111 from New York to Geneva plunged into the Atlantic
late Wednesday night after leaving Kennedy International Airport at
8:17 p.m (0017 GMT Thursday). It carried 215 passengers _ including
two infants _ and 14 crew. Most of the passengers _ 136 _ were
Americans, as was one crew.
	   By Thursday morning, 36 bodies had been found and searchers had
located a chunk of the plane's fuselage believed to be intact under
about 35 meters (115 feet) of water. Heavy surf hampered search
efforts.

Investigators looking at possible technical problem causing crash

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Investigators examining the wreckage of Swissair
flight SR111 that crashed off the Canadian coast suspect a
technical or human problem rather than any terrorist attack,
officials said Thursday.
	   But Swissair said they were unable to go into detail about what
caused the accident until the aircraft's flight-data and
cockpit-voice recorders can be recovered and examined. They will
give crucial insight into the plane's final 30 minutes.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti said there had been no threats or
other indications of a terrorist attack that would lead to any
conclusion other than technical or human failure.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said there were ``absolutely no
indications'' of terrorism.
	   U.S. officials said they also had no indication of terrorism,
but New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the FBI was investigating
nonetheless.
	   The three-engine MD-11 jetliner took off normally from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport at 8:18 p.m. Wednesday (0018 GMT
Thursday) and initially was in regular radio contact, a Swissair
statement said.
	   But Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer Stephan Loew,
36, soon reported smoke in the cockpit and considered a change in
course for Boston, then decided to go for Halifax, Canada, which
was closer.
	   The plane crashed offshore, but many bodies were apparently
recovered in life jackets, making it clear there was time to
prepare for a crash landing.
	   Swiss Transportation Minister Moritz Leuenberger said there were
three possible sources for smoke in the cockpit: a burning engine,
a fire in the luggage hold or an electrical short-circuit.
	   The airline pointed out that its pilot and copilot were not only
experienced with the MD-11 but were both rated as instructors with
the aircraft.
	   Swissair officials said the MD-11 has been a reliable, safe
aircraft even though they have had some technical problems with it
over the years.
	   The airline had some cracks in engine blades starting in 1993
and replaced all the blades in its entire fleet of MD-11s. Other
parts were changed on the manufacturer's recommendation.
	   The aircraft that crashed _ registration HB-IWF _ joined the
Swissair fleet in 1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years
ago. It passed its most recent one-day exam on Aug. 10.
	   It had been maintained by Swissair, KLM and Air France,
officials said.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash, and they are being joined by specialists from the United
States and Switzerland.
	   A Canadian investigator is expected in Zurich on Friday to
examine the plane's records.

 &UR; Upper chambers in Britain, Ireland pushe anti-terrorist bills &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with debate; deletes byline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The House of Lords rushed through a debate on
anti-terrorist legislation Thursday, with some members complaining
of haste but most joining in the feeling that something must be
done after bombers killed 28 people in a Northern Ireland town.
	   The Seanad, the senior chamber in Ireland's parliament, hastened
similar emergency legislation toward passage.
	   The legislation is aimed at Northern Ireland's die-hard
extremists such as the so-called Real IRA, which admitted
responsibility for killing 28 people in Omagh on Aug. 15, the
largest death toll of any terrorist attack in 30 years of violence
in the province.
	   Both government aimed to complete passage during U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to both parts of Ireland on Thursday and
Friday.
	   Lord Cranborne of Britain's opposition Conservative Party said
the bill betrayed the ``extraordinarily hurried and unprepared
way'' in which it was prepared, but that he supported passage.
	   ``We are invited to abandon our role as a revising chamber,''
complained Lord Williams of the Liberal Democrats, Britain's
third-largest party.
	   ``We are asked to give the executive almost absolute power to
put the legislation on the statute book without detailed debate in
the normal manner,'' Williams said.
	   The House of Commons, which approved the bill 391-17 in the key
vote, completed its debate early Thursday.
	   The British legislation would give more weight to police
testimony that a suspect belonged to a banned organization, and
allow judges to draw inferences from a suspect's refusal to answer
questions.
	   In the House of Lords, the strongest debate centered on
provisions making it a crime for British-based exile groups to
conspire to cause violence abroad _ legislation inspired in part by
the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   ``We have to direct the unambiguous message to international
terrorists that the U.K. is vigilant _ and that we will not allow
them to use our country as a base for planning crime,'' said Lord
Williams of Mostyn, speaking for the government.
	   Despite claims that the government was proposing tough
legislation, Lord Lloyd of Berwick said he had ``grave doubts
whether it will have any effect at all.''
	   ``Even if this bill had been in force before the Omagh bombing,
I doubt very much whether it would have added to the chances of
convicting those responsible for the outrage,'' he said.
	   But Lloyd also supported the bill, saying, ``It may be this is
nothing more than a gesture, but there are times when gestures are
necessary and this is one such occasion.''

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The government on Thursday rejected a
demand for apologies or compensation to 22 Greenland children who
were deported to Denmark as part of an experiment to imbue them
with a Danish identity.
	   Ellen Kristensen, one of the two members of Danish parliament
representing Greenland, had asked Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen to consider some kind of reparation.
	   The children, aged 5 and 7, were either orphans or had lost one
parent when they were deported in 1951. The aim was to encourage a
Danish identity so that when they returned to the Arctic island
they could set an example for others, according to a recently
published book on the previously little-known program.
	   In 1953, the children returned to Greenland and were kept away
from their families. None of those involved were ever informed why
the children were deported and later isolated from their relatives,
according to Tine Bryld who authored the book.
	   ``It wasn't a happy period for the involved children but it was,
according to what I can understand, done with the best
intentions,'' Nyrup Rasmussen said in a letter to Kristensen.
	   In a statement, Kristensen said ``Money isn't the most important
thing. The prime minister owes an apology to the test persons and
their families.''
	   Greenland has substantial home-rule powers, but many
Greenlanders seek more autonomy or even independence.

Crisis accelerates _ ruble in freefall, parliament girds for

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ruble toppled into a freefall Thursday
while the country's bitterly-divided political leaders headed in to
a parliamentary showdown that could brake _ or hasten _ deeper
collapse.
	   Members of parliament were to vote for the second time Friday on
whether to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. A ``no''
vote will prolong the political and economic instability, a ``yes''
vote could ease it.
	   ``Today the ruble is falling. Tomorrow the heads will roll,''
warned nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   The mood of anxiety and uncertainty was reflected in shops and
exchange booths. Price boards changed every few hours, with the
ruble skidding from 12 to 15 to 18 rubles a dollar. Shopkeepers
posted new prices on goods from noodles to shampoo to stereos.
	   ``From vodka to water, everything's going up,'' said grocery
store clerk Marina Suruyagina, 26. ``Our vodka is two times more
expensive than it was a week ago. Cigarettes are also up.''
	   The sudden and sharp price rises also sent tremors through the
rest of the country, where most people have not been paid in months
or don't have jobs. Russians were worried, but there was no sign of
panic or unrest.
	   In the central Russian city of Tula, pensioner Zinaida Danilova
burst into tears when she saw that the price of flour had doubled
in a week.
	   ``I haven't received my pension in two months, and I don't know
how I can afford this,'' she struggled to say.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Thursday, a day after the government said it was
powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   ``Some people are panicking, like pensioners,'' said Yulia
Nazarova, a 30-year-old seamstress. ``We're all nervous, of course.
But still, it was worse 10 years ago.''
	   The situation could stabilize, at least temporarily, if
Chernomyrdin is confirmed as prime minister Friday.
	   Zhirinovsky, who often criticizes President Boris Yeltsin, urged
lawmakers not to prolong the crisis despite what he called
Chernomyrdin's poor economic record.
	   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Of course we have pity for the 200
victims, but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''
	   But Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the lower house or State Duma,
predicted that Chernomyrdin will fall short of the 226 votes he
needs.
	   If Chernomyrdin is rejected Friday, several scenarios are
possible.
	   Under the Constitution, Yeltsin has the option of proposing him
a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the Duma votes no for
a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma elections.
	   Some say Yeltsin will do just that _ effectively calling the
Communists-led opposition's bluff and forcing them to face
elections a year earlier than scheduled. The Communists are not
particularly strong in the polls at the moment, but the turmoil is
likely to strengthen their support.
	   ``Zyuganov thinks this is his best chance of gaining power,''
said Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Duma deputy. ``The more unrest,
the better he thinks they'll do.''
	   However, Zhirinovsky and others warned that Yeltsin could decide
to impose emergency rule instead _ ruling by decree until the next
regularly scheduled elections for parliament in December 1999.
	   Several members of parliament's upper house, the Federation
Council, said they would approve emergency powers for Yeltsin if
the crisis came to that.
	   But others predicted the crisis would not take that direction.
The Agrarian Party, a Communist ally, said it would push Yeltsin to
name a different candidate the third time around.
	   Yeltsin himself moved Thursday to promote a compromise, reviving
a political deal nearly clinched last weekend, which the Communists
abandoned at the last minute. According to Russian news agencies,
Yeltsin made some amendments to the document _ which proposes a
reallocation of powers between the president and parliament _ and
sent it back to the Duma.
	   Some Duma members rushed to try and block any attempt by Yeltsin
to dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy, complex and would require confirmation by
the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court _ both of whom are loyal
to the president.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister. The political turmoil has left
the interim government unable to devote its attention to the
mounting economic crisis.
	   Chernomyrdin appealed to Russians not to panic and to leave
their money in banks, where he assured them it would be safe.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank reserves used to guarantee deposits
were also eroding. The bank said its reserves fell by dlrs 700
million in the last week of August to dlrs 12.7 billion. The bank
has spent billions in recent months in a futile effort to prop up
the ruble.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister said Thursday he had been framed in a ``larger political
conspiracy'' and vowed to fight all charges against him.
	   Anwar Ibrahim said allegations of sexual misconduct and leaking
state secrets were fabricated by the camp of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to undermine any challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
leadership of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``This is an unjust administration,'' Anwar, who was also dumped
as finance minister Wednesday, told hundreds of supporters and
journalists at his private residence.
	   ``If the number two man cannot be sure of justice, then I'm
sorry for Malaysia.''
	   He called the allegations against him _ from corruption, to
spying for foreign powers, even sodomy and murder _ part of a
``larger political conspiracy.''
	   Anwar, 51, was fired unceremoniously Wednesday evening after
months of bitter political differences with his one-time mentor,
Mahathir.
	   The firing came a day after Mahathir imposed rigid currency
controls, virtually isolating the Southeast Asian country from the
global free-market system.
	   It also comes just as Malaysia prepares to host the 16th
Commonwealth Games and welcome Queen Elizabeth II for an official
state visit later this month.
	   Anwar, a conservative Muslim and the father of six children,
said he had undergone DNA testing to prove his innocence in an
apparent paternity suit.
	   He said Mahathir threatened to get prostitutes to testify
against him.
	   ``I told him, `If that's the game you want to play, I can also
line up prostitutes,''' who would make the same allegations against
other ministers, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was
under investigation on charges contained in a book that includes
widespread allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   The affidavit said that Nalla and Anwar could face charges under
the Internal Security Act, the Official Secrets Act, the Women and
Girls Protection Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act.
	   The authors of the book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be
Prime Minister,'' are currently being tried for defamation.
	   Anwar, who hugged his wife, Aziza, as she stood next to him
during the news conference, said he expected to be arrested and
would fight to prove his innocence.
	   ``I have enough documentary evidence, tapes, statutory
declarations under oath that would defend and establish my
innocence,'' he said, adding that his associates and family had
been harassed by the police.
	   The Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National
Organization met late Thursday and stripped Anwar from his seat of
deputy vice president of the party.
	   Mahathir, making his first public comments on Anwar's ouster,
told reporters early Friday morning that he was ``saddened'' by the
course of events.
	   ``I wish it hadn't happened, not at this point,'' he said. ``But
these things have gone out of my control.''

Annan saddened by those who died `in the service of the UN'

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Swissair flight that crashed off Nova
Scotia was the most frequently used by U.N. staff travelling
between U.N. headquarters in New York and the second-largest U.N.
office in Geneva, officials said Thursday.
	   The United Nations confirmed the identities of five U.N.
staffers, two U.N.-afiliated officials and an officials' wife who
perished in the crash. At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N.
flag flew at half staff.
	   On U.N. staffer, from the Food and Agriculture Organization, was
supposed to have been on the plane but ``that at the last minute
for reasons that weren't explained to me, he changed his fight
plans,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   The staffer's identity wasn't released.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was deeply saddened by the
deaths of over 200 people of the Swissair Flight 111 crash off Nova
Scotia, ``including a number of members of the United Nations
family.''
	   ``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of all the
victims, and in particular to the relatives and friends of those
who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the United
Nations,'' Annan said in a statement.
	   ``Their loss is felt not only personally but professionally as
well,'' he said.
	   Among the victims was Dr. Jonathan Mann, who became known as the
outspoken head of the World Health Organization's AIDS program when
the disease exploded in the 1980s. His wife, Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann, also was killed.
	   They were on their way to attend a series of WHO and UNAIDS
meetings, WHO said in a statement.
	   U.N. officials said Swissair Flight SR111 was the most heavily
used flight for U.N. staffers travelling between the two U.N. hubs.
	   ``It was like a U.N. Airbus,'' said Eckhard. ``Even before we
got confirmation that there were U.N. staff on the flight, we just
knew from the identification of the flight that there would've been
some of our people on that plane.''

Police clash with port workers, 50 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police fired rubber bullets and
tear gas Thursday to disperse hundreds of rioting port workers
protesting the construction of Bangladesh's first private container
terminal by a U.S. company, officials said.
	   At least 50 protesters were injured, 12 of them hospitalized
with serious injuries, in Chittagong, 135 miles (215 kilometers)
southeast of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Labor unions that control 10,000 port workers oppose
privatization. They announced an indefinite strike at state-run
Chittagong Port to protest the police action against the workers,
said Mohammed Allauddin, a trade union leader.
	   The clash between police and workers erupted just before a
planned visit to the port by Saber Hossain Chowdhury, junior
shipping minister. Chowdhury called off the visit.
	   Stevedoring Services of America plans to build a dlrs 438
million private container terminal near Chittagong Port over the
next three years.
	   The government decided to have the new terminal to handle
container cargo that was growing 20 percent every year. Chittagong
Port, the largest in Bangladesh, handles 300,000 tons of container
cargo every year, three times higher than its capacity.

Slovakia asks for additional judgment in dam dispute with Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Slovakia has asked the World Court
for an additional judgment in its acrimonious dispute with Hungary
over a huge hydroelectric dam project, the court said Thursday.
	   Slovakia contends the additional judgment is necessary because
Hungary has been unwilling to implement a decision issued a year
ago by the court, the United Nations' highest judicial body.
	   The row, one of Europe's longest-running environmental disputes,
dates back to the Cold War. In 1977, the two neighboring countries
agreed to build a system of dams on the Danube River to produce
more electricity.
	   Hungary eventually withdrew from the project in 1990, wary of
potential dangers to the environment, while Slovakia pressed on
alone and launched an alternative project only on Slovakian soil.
Hungary contended that operation affected its access to the
Danube's water.
	   Both countries took their dispute to the World Court, whose
judges ruled last September that both breached their legal
obligations. They were ordered them to ``negotiate in good faith
... to ensure the achievement of the objectives'' of their initial
agreement.
	   Slovakia said that following the decision, both parties have
conducted a series of negotiations but that Hungary has been
dragging its feet.
	   Its request is seen as a way to prod Hungary back to the
negotiating table.

UNITED NATIONS: U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision has prevented inspectors from carrying
out any new inspections of suspected weapons sites and has reduced
the ability of U.N. monitors to survey sites that have already been
searched, Butler has said.
	   Iraq has said that this monitoring was not affected by the Aug.
5 decision, which came after Butler refused to declare that Iraq
had destroyed all of its banned weapons.
	   But in his briefing, Butler told council members that on Aug.
16, U.N. monitors were refused access to a facility ``which had
been inspected within the scope of monitoring in the past,''
according to Butler's talking notes.
	   ``Iraq refused to permit the inspection citing that the unit was
military and that it was not, according to Iraq, within the scope
of monitoring.''

European Union issues peace appeal to Eritrea and Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union appealed Thursday to
Eritrea and Ethiopia to reach a negotiated settlement of their
border dispute, which erupted into armed conflict last June.
	   The appeal was issued by the EU's ``Troika'' -- Austria, Britain
and Germany -- which has been spearheading the Union's efforts on
behalf of resolving the conflict between the two African neighbors.
	   In a statement issued by the Austrian foreign ministry, the EU
said special envoys of the three countries urged both governments
to avoid any new actions might lead to a resumption of fighting and
further suffering by their civilian populations.
	   The statement welcomed declarations by the two governments that
they were willing to work with international humanitarian
organizations and urged them to cooperate with diplomatic efforts
of the Organization of African Unity.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries had been deteriorating since last year and erupted
into open warfare last June with air attacks and shelling along the
border.

	   On Sept. 1, a monitoring team arrived at the gate of a site
known to contain missile components that were under the monitoring
of the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the inspections
and monitoring, Butler said.
	   ``The team requested access to the site to verify that all items
were tagged and present,'' Butler's notes say. ``Iraq refused to
provide access to the site on the ground that the facility was not
a `declared site.'''
	   Both Iraq and the U.N. commission declare, or designate sites
for monitoring.
	   Despite Iraq's pledge that monitoring can continue, ``In fact
this may not be the case as Iraq has advised the commission,
orally, that it may only visit those sites which Iraq alone has
declared.''

	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   In an effort to punish Iraq for the freeze, the United States
and Britain were hoping to pass a resolution in the next few days
that would suspend regular sanctions reviews, including a critical
six-month review in October, until Iraq resumes cooperation.
	   Though highly symbolic, the move would effectively end Iraq's
chances of having 8-year-old sanctions lifted. In the past,
however, the reviews have never led to any easing of the measures.
	   A copy of the draft resolution also said the council would
express its willingness to consider ``in a comprehensive fashion,
Iraq's compliance with its obligations under all relevant
resolutions once Iraq has rescinded its above-mentioned decision.''
	   Permanent council members China and Russia, in particular, had
been pushing for such a review. The two, along with France,
generally take a more sympathetic line towards Baghdad.
	   ``It's very important for the parties concerned to encourage the
Iraqis to resume cooperation with UNSCOM,'' China's deputy
ambassador, Shen Guofang, said as he entered the council Thursday
morning. ``We hope the Americans can show some flexibility in this
regard.''

Report: Poor potato crop forecast for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with grain harvest down 48 percent from last year in
new 8th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A dry spring and early summer followed by heavy
August rains could result in a poor harvest of potatoes, a Russian
staple, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``This year is going to be very bad, very tight,'' Sergei
Solenkov, head of the Agriculture Ministry's crop department, told
The Moscow Times. ``And the people survive on potatoes.''
	   Solenkov had no figures for the forecasted potato harvest, which
begins in September. About 90 percent of the country's potatoes are
grown by individuals at their summer cottages or on private plots
of land.
	   One government official called for calm, however, stating that
potato and bread reserves from last year would compensate for the
poor harvest.
	   ``There is no threat of famine in Russia,'' Russian Security
Council Secretary Andrei Kokoshin said Thursday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Even so, Kokoshin admitted that Russia's provinces would suffer
because of the smaller crop. Government officials are working on
ways to guarantee food deliveries to the hardest-hit places,
Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Potatoes are a mainstay of the Russian diet, providing 10
percent of the country's caloric intake, the Times said. Russians
eat six times as many potatoes as Americans _ an average 127
kilograms (279 pounds) per person per year _ it said.
	   Russia's grain harvest is also down, Interfax reported Thursday.
By the end of August, the country had produced 48.2 percent less
grain than it had by the same time last year, the news agency said,
citing the State Statistical Committee.
	   If the potato and grain shortage does not cause famine, Russia's
economic crisis might, other economic officials warned Thursday.

Crash shakes airline reputation, but customers stay faithful
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS explanation of why so many Americans aboard grafs
11-12, checks ordered grafs 15-16 &QL; 
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The crash of SR111 off the Canadian coast shook
Swissair's reputation as one of the world's safest airlines, but
customers said Thursday they would remain faithful.
	   The crash that killed 229 persons, including 137 Americans, was
far and away the worst disaster to strike the airline, whose
previous high death toll was 80 in 1963.
	   An international spokesman for the airline industry, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Swissair continues to have one the
world's best safety records.
	   While no international agencies rate world airlines for safety,
Swissair's previous fatal crash was nearly two decades ago, when a
DC-8 jet overshot the runway and killed 14 people while landing at
Athens, Greece.
	   ``In principle I like Swissair more than other airlines,'' said
Michelle Ansermoz of Geneva, one of a number of passengers
interviewed by The Associated Press at Geneva's Cointrin Airport,
intended destination of the plane from New York that crashed off
Canada Wednesday night.
	   ``This accident will make no difference,'' said Ansermoz, who
said she often flies the airline to Norway and Amsterdam. ``You
always have a bit of apprehension when you take a flight.''
	   Baerbel Kawitzke of Germany said she flies three or four times a
week, and uses Swissair regularly into and out of Geneva.
	   ``It's a terrible thing, but I can't say I'm nervous. It could
happen to any airline,'' Kawitzke said.
	   ``Swissair is a very good company,'' said a man who would
identify himself as Joseph. ``Accidents happen anywhere.''
	   A Swiss woman named Erika said she was nervous, but only because
she was traveling on the same day as the crash. ``But I trust
Swissair,'' she said.
	   Beyond the safety record, other factors contributed to Americans
being the most numerous aboard.
	   Swissair is the only airline flying nonstop between New York and
Geneva; the Swiss city is a favorite foreign location for major
U.S. corporations; and Delta Air Lines sells seats on Swissair
planes under a partnership agreement.
	   Switzerland's flag carrier Swissair, a publicly traded company
with the government holding only a minority share, was founded in
1931 from the merger of Balair and Ad Astra. It has grown into a
medium-sized European airline with links to airlines on other
continents.
	   Most of its longhaul flights operate from Zurich's Kloten
airport, where the company is headquartered. The New York to Geneva
flight is one of the few that operates out of Cointrin Airport in
the western city.
	   The company has a fleet of 63 aircraft, among them 16 MD-11s of
the type that crashed off the Canadian coast. The airline ordered
checks on its remaining 15 MD-11s and concern chief Philippe
Bruggisser said the fleet would be replaced by Airbus A-340s in the
year 2002.
	   It also owns five Boeing 747-357 jumbo jets, 19 Airbus A-320s,
nine Airbus A-321s, eight Airbus A-319s and six Airbus A310-300s.
	   The parent SAirGroup last month reported a 17 percent rise in
net first-half profit for this year to 109 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 72.6 million).

Teen murder suspects await judgment on extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A judge rules this weekend whether to extradite
Maryland teen-ager Samuel Sheinbein to the United States or try him
in Israel for the brutal killing of an acquaintance nearly one year
ago.
	   The high-profile case has strained relations between the two
countries, with U.S. lawmakers threatening at one point to withhold
aid to Israel if Sheinbein wasn't returned to Maryland.
	   Regardless of the judge's ruling Sunday, the 18-year-old son of
a Washington patent lawyer is not expected to go on trial for some
time, with both the state and his defense attorney likely to
appeal.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the
mutilated body of 19 year-old Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in
the garage of an empty house near the Sheinbein home in Silver
Spring Maryland. Shortly after he arrived, he was picked up by
police and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug overdose.
	   A second suspect, Aaron Needle hanged himself in April, one day
before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Montgomery
County, Maryland.
	   In Israeli custody with charges already filed against him in
Maryland, Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship, through his father
who was born in pre-state Palestine, before the state was founded
in 1948. Under Israeli law, citizens cannot be extradited and
Sheinbein's attorney, former Israeli justice minister David Libai,
is fighting the U.S. extradition request based on the citizenship
law.
	   The claims caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and
threatened relations between the two. Two senior members of the
Senate House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Robert Livingstone,
Louisiana, and Rep. Sonny Callahan, Alabama, both considered
delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was not returned.
	   They softened their positions however when Israel's justice
ministry rejected Sheinbein's citizenship claims. State prosecutors
have asked the court to rule against Sheinbein's citizenship claim
because his father left the country before the citizenship law was
enacted, and never applied for citizenship in the United States
where he has lived since he was a child.
	   The Montgomery County prosecutor's office has worked closely
with Israeli prosecutors in the extradition case. For State
Attorney Robert Dean, Israel's intricate laws have been a
frustrating delay of justice.
	   ``I really feel bad for the victim's family. They have a right
to see that justice gets done and I think that alot of people in
Maryland and Montgomery County are feeling a bit frustrated that
Samuel Sheinbein, who was born and raised here, is not back yet,''
he said in a telephone interview.
	   Citizenship would not mean that Sheinbein would be let off of
the charges. If Judge Moshe Ravid Sunday declares Sheinbein a
citizen, it would mean that the murder trial would be moved to
Israel, where courts, sentences and even prison life can be easier.
	   There is no jury system in Israel. Reuven Shapira, a crime
reporter for Israeli newspapers for 10 years, said while murder
convictions carry a 24-year sentence, most prisoners are released
after serving two-thirds of the sentence or even less for good
behavior.
	   For youths, the sentence is usually 16 years and can be reduced
for good behavior. Sheinbein was 17-years-old at the time of
Tello's murder and would likely be tried as a youth. Almost all
prisoners, including murder convicts are eligible for one week-end
furlough each month after the completion of the first quarter of
the sentence. Prison life is considered safer than in the United
States, murder is non-existent in Israeli jails and rape is rare.
	   Only a small handful of prisoners including assassin Yigal Amir,
who killed prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, have been denied week-ends
off and eligibility for sentence reduction.
	   Larry Shwartz, spokesman for the U.S. embassy said the United
States would prefer the trial be held in Maryland but should the
court decide that the trial will be in Israel, the U.S. will
provide every assistance.
	   But that could be expensive and complicated and it is unclear
who would pick-up the costs. Witnesses, evidence, aides, and even
the victim's family would need to be flown in for the trial.
	   ``The logistical concerns alone are a compelling argument to
keep the trial in Maryland,'' said Dean.
	   In Israel, there have also been calls to send Sheinbein back.
Lawmakers and major newspaper editorials harshly criticized the
motives of the accused, saying that Israel was not built as a haven
for Jewish criminals.
	   Sheinbein, who is in lock-up at a youth detention center, has
appeared handcuffed and shackled at most court sessions, but has
not spoken to reporters. Sometimes he is accompanied by his mother
Victoria, who flew in towards the end of the extradition trial or
his father Sol, who has been charged with aiding his son's flight
to Israel.
	   Sheinbein's attorney, Libai, would not comment on his client's
condition three days ahead of the verdict. ``I'm waiting for the
decision,'' he said.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Overshadowed by a war in the heart
of Africa, a Nonaligned Movement summit of developing countries
strove on Thursday to find relevancy for an organization created
during the Cold War.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro was defiant amid suggestions the
43-year-old group whose original mission _ to fend off domination
by the White House and the Kremlin _ was a relic.
	   ``There is no need for the Movement to apologize or ask for
anyone's permission to exist and to go on fighting,'' Castro told
52 other heads of state and government. He called for developing
nations to unite and ``struggle for their development.''
	   Resolutions prepared for the close of the two-day summit of 53
heads of state decounced nuclear powers for keeping weapons of mass
destruction after the end of the Cold War, deplored the use of land
mines against civilians and called for a cease-fire in Congo, among
a host of other issues. The summit had been scheduled to end
Thursday evening but was being extended to accomodate the long list
of speakers.
	   The Congo war involving troops from as many as six African
countries took center stage.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan tried to forge a Congo peace
initiative on the sidelines of the summit, but his efforts were
being overtaken by events on the battlefield in the vast central
African nation.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from Congo's capital and were knifing eastward
into rebel territory _ and closer to the Rwandan and Ugandan
borders.
	   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe all but declared victory
Thursday.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Mugabe told heads of state in this Indian
Ocean city. ``We have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain
it cannot fall and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Kabila, the president of Congo who last year came to power in an
insurrection against Mobutu Sese Seko, also appeared at the summit.
Instead of talking peace he accused Ugandan and Rwandan troops of
slaughtering his countrymen, then abruptly left early Thursday.
	   Mugabe and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos justified
their intervention, saying Kabila had formally requested their help
and pointing out he was a head of state recognized by the
international community.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who had opposed military
intervention in favor of peace talks, said it was ``reasonable for
neighbouring countries to respond to'' Kabila's request for help.
After Namibian state radio crowed that Mandela had flip-flopped and
now supported intervention, Mandela angrily said: ``It is an
exaggeration and mischievous to say we are now backing the
(Congo-allied) forces.''
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni complained foreign troops
allied with Kabila were propping up a government which ``has not
been elected.''
	   Museveni acknowledged Ugandan troops were in rebel-held
territory in eastern Congo, but didn't respond to allegations they
were fighting alongside the rebels.
	   Rwandan President Pasteur-Bizimungu denied any involvement in
the Congo war, saying ``it is a result of the conditions the
(Kabila) regime has created in the country.''
	   Since taking power, Kabila has tried to crush opposition groups.
The rebels, in a statement distributed at the summit, said
government radio stations were calling for the slaughter of ethnic
Tutsis in Congo.
	   Senior diplomat Princeton Lyman, the first-ever U.S. guest at a
Nonaligned summit, earlier told The Associated Press he was very
concerned about ``hate radio'' broadcasts in Congo, similar to ones
that preceded the 1994 Hutu massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda.
	   Mugabe told a news conference that the warring sides planned to
meet in three days. There was no immediate confirmation all the
parties would participate.
	   The rebels weren't present at the talks here. However, their
statement said they would negotiate if Kabia first stops ``the
ongoing killings and ethnic cleansing.''
	   But Kabila, now holding the upper hand on the battlefield after
being on the verge of losing the war just two weeks ago, has ruled
out a cease-fire, saying Rwandan and Ugandan troops must first
leave Congo.
	   Despite the obstacles to peace, Annan said he was ``very
encouraged'' by the talks he held here.
	   ``I think we'll be leaving South Africa encouraged with what has
transpired. The people of Congo have suffered far too long for us
not to bring this to a solution,'' the U.N. chief told reporters.

Police arrest criminal gang, rescue three hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police arrested seven men, including an
American and a Uraguyan, and freed three hostages of a criminal
gang early Thursday, officers said.
	   One hostage was listed in critical condition after police found
him wrapped in cellophane inside the trunk of a car parked in a
garage in Robledo de Chavela, a town near Madrid, a police
statement said.
	   The hostages were thought to have been involved in drug
trafficking in northern Spain. One of them, a woman, had been
tortured and hit repeatedly by a metal baseball bat.
	   Police located the armed kidnappers' hideout in a chalet Monday,
after the group demanded 30 million pesetas (200,000 dollars) in
ransom money.
	   The police raid resulted in the seizure of weapons and the
ransom money.
	   The seven men arrested were an American, Leonardo Craig, 29, of
Florida; a 20-year-old Uruguayan; and five Spaniards. They were
turned over to the courts, a policespokesman said.
	   Police said the group had carried out kidnappings and engaged in
extortion involving drug smuggling in Spain and Portugal.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   The Irish Times, Dublin, on Northern Ireland:
	   A little more than two weeks after Omagh, a tentative optimism
has re-emerged in the task of establishing Northern Ireland's new
democracy and securing a complete and lasting peace. Alongside it,
there are disquieting tinges of doubt as to how the threat of
violence is to be countered in both jurisdictions.
	   The process of prisoner releases in the North which starts next
week will see up to 17 convicted men go free immediately. For
unionists it will be another galling concession. But the return of
these men to their communities will represent a significant triumph
for the Sinn Fein leadership.
	   It will offer a timely opportunity for Mr. (Gerry) Adams and his
senior colleagues to make the long-sought declaration that the era
of Provisional violence is finally ended. That, in turn, could
afford Mr. (David) Trimble some political space to open dialogue
with Sinn Fein on its role within a future executive. If it takes
the president of the United States to bang heads together to
achieve this momentum then so be it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, Australia, on worldwide recession:
	   Prime Minister John Howard declared there would not be a world
recession. As the reverberations of sharp stock market falls around
the globe were still being felt, some might think this is a big
call. Indeed, some economists argue the world is already on the
brink of recession.
	   Japan leads an almost clean sweep of Asian economies with
negative growth, all experiencing the worst conditions for half a
century. The Russian economy shows no signs of correcting itself
and Latin America is the latest victim of the global financial
contagion that had its origins in Thailand last year.
	   As in the United States, the economic fundamentals are strong in
Australia. Our growth has been strong and interest rates are at
30-year lows. As long as the U.S. keeps its economic head above
water, there is hope the world will not slip into recession. But if
the Japanese continue to avoid taking the necessary harsh medicine
and the Russians are left to flounder alone, the prospects are not
good.
	    &UR; ___
	   Frankfurter Rundschau of Germany, on the US-Russia summit:
	   Feigning normalcy, that is the main motive behind the so-called
summit meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin ... using their job
titles to cover up their personal faults. And what brings this
farce of a summit to its lowest point is a complete lack of
relevant content. The American did not bring any dollars with him,
and the Russian has completed neither reforms nor promised nuclear
disarmament. Talking past one another is thus called for.
	   Summits aren't what they used to be ... historic meetings
determining nuclear co-existence, when the weaknesses of one were
translated into military and political power plays by the other.
Today, the weakness of one may just barely make the other look
good. The term 'summit' can now be dismissed. After inflationary
use in past years it was buried in Moscow.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on the North Korean missile test:
	   North Korean authorities themselves acknowledge the plight of
the nation's people and are requesting food assistance. Yet the
country continues to develop missiles and does not hesitate to sell
them to other countries for hard currency.
	   Unfortunately, North Korea's posture of threatening the
proliferation of missiles will not win it the understanding and
sympathy of the international community. It is impermissible to
wield a sword in one hand and ask for assistance with the other.
...
	   The threat of North Korean missiles, meanwhile, has spurred the
Japanese government to embark on advanced technological research
into ballistic missile defense jointly with the United States
within the next fiscal year.
	   Unfortunately, that project is fraught with problems concerning
its feasibility and cost. It has also generated some wariness among
the Chinese. The government must study the project very cautiously.
	    &UR; ___
	   El Pais of Madrid, on execution of two Palestinians by Arafat
government:
	   Arafat is in more than a delicate situation _ his political and
economic credibility are in ruins, as are Palestinian hopes for the
future. The rehearsal for self-rule, which it was so often said
would be a model of freedom and transparency for an Arab world
equipped with little of those two raw materials, is turning out to
be as disastrous as Israeli propaganda said it would be. ...
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued 20-odd death sentences
since it was created in 1994, all of which have so far been
suspended. It would be a good idea for the Authority not to get
drunk on power, believing that exercising its power over people's
lives is going to transform it into a state like all the rest.
	    &UR; ___
	   Buenos Aires Herald, Buenos Aires, on the world's markets:
	   A turbulent year for the world's stock exchanges has become
positively helter skelter this week with Wall Street plunging over
500 points on Monday .... and (rising Tuesday). Yet the general
trend remains down. Such violent ups and downs leave the forecasts
of the future equally split.
	   If Wall Street fell more points on Monday than on Black Monday
in 1987 (22.6 percent) _ it fell even more points last October yet
recovered to new records in July _ this week's retreat can be
downplayed as a correction of Alan Greenspan's ``irrational
exuberance.'' The main cause of recent alarm has been Russia ...
yet the real focus of this global crisis remains Asia.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on South Africa:
	   The Nonaligned Movement meeting in South Africa is an
opportunity for 160 or so countries of the movement to debate an
array of global and regional issues.
	   Different and opposing political persuasions and ideologies
still divide many capitals. This is not to mention the deep
division between countries on the economic, social and cultural
levels.
	   Even with the advent of the global economy, the debate still
ranges on whether the economic interdependence of countries should
be oriented solely to free economy and private enterprise, where
state-controlled economies have no role to play.
	   The countries of the world are also deeply divided on human
rights, the unilateral use of force and the sanctions regime to
which the U.N. Security Council often resorts to the detriment of
the interest of peoples everywhere.
	   If the movement is unable, due to the diversity of its members,
to agree on a set of policies on issues ... the least it could do
at this important summit ... is to adapt a new set of ethics that
should govern the conduct of nations in the 21st century.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Pioneer, New Delhi, India, on the Russian crisis:
	   The Russian financial crisis has been a long time in the making,
but a weakened President Boris Yeltsin's war with the Parliament
has lent a heightened dimension to it. ...
	   The timing of the political confrontation could not have been
worse for the Russian government, which has to urgently stabilize
the economy that has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of
the ruble and the government defaulting on its debts. ...
	   For too long has Yeltsin ignored the opposition and the latter's
constituents are now unwilling to give up the opportunity to
extract a high price when the financial crisis has pushed him into
a corner.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian-American summit may be a casualty. With
both presidents enfeebled, it is unlikely to produce earth-shaking
results. It is surprising that it is being held.
	    &UR; ___
	   Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, Sweden, on Norwegian Prime Minister
Bondevik:
	   Norway's prime minister (Kjell Magne Bondevik) has been
afflicted by `depression' and has put himself on sick leave, his
office says. The depression has come in the final phase of
extremely important budget negotiations, as the Norwegian krone has
fallen and excessively loose financial politics threatens to lead
to a severe recession in Norway. ...
	   The nation must be able to trust that its prime minister is
functioning, with judgment and cool-headedness, in the face of the
threat of war and crises.
	   That's a very tough demand. But neither are there very many
people who aspire to be prime minister. If the man does not meet
the demands, which are fully understood, there is only one
alternative: to step down from the post.
	    &UR; ___
	   De Volkskrant, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the Russian crisis:
	   The Russian economy is at the point of collapse. The shaky
structure of a pseudo market economy with super-rich tycoons, an
impoverished population, an oligarchy instead of competition and
ubiquitous corruption where rules of law should have been, has been
shaken to its foundations.
	   It is the Russian people, who must have imagined something else
from the new dawn following the end of communist dictatorship, who
must foot the bill. The fact that Russians have fostered an
unfathomable contempt for their `democratic' and communist
politicians is understandable.
	    &UR; ___
	   Liberation, Paris, on the US-Russia summit:
	   The spectacle awaiting Clinton in Moscow is surreal. There is
the bankruptcy, of course. But also the pathetic vision of a
president (Boris Yeltsin) that can now only be harmful to his
country and harmful to his people.
	   Without forgetting an empty political abyss that the Communists
and their allies are coming back to fill.
	   It is difficult to say what tactics the Communists have chosen
to exploit the situation. It is clear that they have quickly
refused an institutional compromise that would reduce the powers of
Yeltsin, in opposing the investiture of (Viktor) Chernomyrdin.
	   They clearly want more than a president recycling an
inauguration, a president susceptible to a short circuit.
	   But what exactly?
	   A dozen ministers at the Duma? Another prime minister more
malleable and even more permeable to the ideas of the former boss
of Gazprom, as is the gossip in Moscow?
	   Nothing can be excluded.
	    &UR; ___
	   Il Messaggero, Rome, on the Russian crisis:
	   After meeting with Boris Yeltsin, President Bill Clinton will
leave Moscow without signing any economic accord or entering any
negotiations able to give Russia a new government.
	   A solution in the Russian crisis is not predictable for the time
being ...
	   The image of the two presidents, one representing the most
powerful country, the other one the largest country, holds a
message that stands beyond present circumstances. It underlines
today's impossibility to guarantee a stable government in the
international community.
	   At the basis of such incapability to govern there's a worldwide
phenomenon called globalization.
	   Along with the economic globalization, also a social, a
psychological, and an ethical one is brought into the international
field.
	   But each country still evaluates similar situations in different
ways, thus increasing existing tensions. ...
	   Adding to this is the political attitude of certain countries,
like the U.S., whose intention to become the world's only
legitimate peacemaker is worrisome.
	   The present situation doesn't offer, for the moment, any easy
way out. A ``physical unification'' of our planet not able to
include yet a political one will cause many risks, no one spared.

	   The News-Journal, Daytona Beach, Florida, on Boris Yeltsin:
	   Boris Yeltsin's erratic behavior in recent months suggests that
his presidency and even Russia's free-market democracy are in
serious trouble. ... U.S. policy toward Russia should concentrate
attention on the economy to underpin a free society. ...
	   Yeltsin has been progressively less involved in carrying out
presidential duties. ... He has grown increasingly dependent on
prime ministers to lead the country through painful economic
reforms. ...
	   He fired Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and installed Sergei
Kiriyenko. ... When the government's decision last week to let the
ruble drop in value and freeze Russian debts caused a political
uproar, Yeltsin simply reversed course again, firing Kiriyenko and
bringing back Chernomyrdin.
	   Financial institutions are scrambling this week to deal with
swift changes in the country's fortunes. ... Yeltsin's days as a
leader may be fading.
	   Maintaining good relations over the long haul is the key.
	    &UR; ___
	   Tulsa World, Tulsa, Oklahoma, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   President Bill Clinton left the country Monday to meet with
Russian leaders in sessions that could either save that country for
democracy or push it back into communism. And he left with some
members of Congress calling for impeachment hearings because the
president ``no longer has the moral authority to lead either here
at home or in the world.''
	   That kind of rhetoric, this time from House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, is of course what the enemies of the United States
and of President Clinton like to hear. ...
	   DeLay says he doesn't want Congress to adjourn without deciding
whether to impeach the president once special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr submits what is expected to be a lengthy, detailed report on
the president's sexual shenanigans with Monica Lewinsky.
	   It's hard to see how that could be done in the 60 days or so
before the November elections. Congress is scheduled to adjourn at
the end of September so members can go home to campaign.
	   Which leads to the speculation that DeLay simply wants to get
the racy details into Congress _ and out to the public _ in advance
of the election. You can't blame DeLay and the Republicans for
wanting to make the most out of the misbehavior of this president.
He deserves it.
	    &UR; ___
	   Los Angeles Times, on the economy:
	   Is the promise of the market-driven global economy of the 1990s
unraveling? Hardly, but the very idea is facing its most severe
test. ...
	   Should market psychology worsen, consumer spending drop off and
the scepter of recession loom, the Federal Reserve Board could help
soothe anxious consumers and businesses with an interest rate cut.
... A rate cut would help buttress the U.S. economy and make it
easier for other countries to strengthen their securities. Perhaps
most important, the United States would be taken a global economic
leadership role.
	   Others might follow. Japan, the world's second-largest economy,
poses the biggest problem as the government dawdles in indecision,
unwilling to face the shock of cleaning up a banking system
festooned with bad debts. ...
	   The Russian economy is tiny in comparison, but the depth of
political uncertainty there is exacerbating fears that a world
nuclear power is rudderless and thus dangerous. ...
	   Japan is the most startling and troublesome example of a
centrally controlled economy out of sync with the open capitalism
driving markets today. Russia's more spectacular failure at
creating an honest market economy has some there pining for the old
days. Even the Fed could find itself locked in its inflation
ideology _ but we're betting (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan)
Greenspan is too smart for that.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swissair ordering checks on MD-11 graf 2,
replacement plans graf 13 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Investigators examining the wreckage of Swissair
flight SR111 that crashed off the Canadian coast suspect a
technical or human problem rather than any terrorist attack,
officials said Thursday.
	   Swissair ordered safety checks on its 15 remaining MD-11 planes,
but said it had no plans to take the three-engine craft out of
service.
	   It refused to speculate about what caused the accident until the
aircraft's flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders can be recovered
and examined. They will give crucial insight into the plane's final
30 minutes.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti said there had been no threats or
other indications of a terrorist attack that would lead to any
conclusion other than technical or human failure.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller said there were ``absolutely no
indications'' of terrorism.
	   U.S. officials said they also had no indication of terrorism,
but New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the FBI was investigating
nonetheless.
	   The three-engine MD-11 jetliner took off normally from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport at 8:18 p.m. Wednesday (0018gmt
Thursday) and initially was in regular radio contact, said a
Swissair statement.
	   But Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer Stephan Loew,
36, soon reported smoke in the cockpit and considered a change in
course for Boston, then decided to go for Halifax, Canada, which
was closer.
	   The plane crashed offshore, but with many bodies apparently
recovered in life jackets, it was clear there was time to prepare
for a crash landing.
	   Swiss Transportation Minister Moritz Leuenberger said there were
three possible sources for smoke in the cockpit _ a burning engine,
a fire in the luggage hold or an electrical short-circuit.
	   The airline pointed out that its pilot and copilot were not only
experienced with the MD-11, but were both rated as instructors with
the aircraft.
	   Swissair officials said the MD-11 has been a reliable, safe
aircraft even though they have had some technical problems with it
over the years.
	   The airline had some cracks in engine blades starting in 1993
and replaced all the blades in the entire fleet of MD-11s. Other
parts were changed on the manufacturer's recommendation. Airline
chief Philippe Bruggisser said the company planned to replace its
MD-11 fleet with Airbus A-340s in the year 2002.
	   The aircraft that crashed _ registration HB-IWF _ joined the
Swissair fleet in 1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years
ago. It passed its most recent one-day exam last Aug. 10.
	   It had been maintained by Swissair, KLM and Air France,
officials said.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash, and they are being joined by specialists from the United
States and Switzerland.
	   A Canadian investigator is expected in Zurich on Friday to
examine the plane's records.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swissair officials and counselors expect to spend
at least another day breaking the news to relatives about loved
ones who died on flight SR111 before the passenger list can be made
public.
	   But the United Nations and other sources disclosed that the 229
victims included some prominent U.N. officials, who frequently used
the flight between the organization's New York headquarters and its
main European office:
	   _Dr. Jonathan Mann, a top pioneer in the fight against AIDS and
current dean of Allegheny University of the Health Science's School
of Public Health in Philadelphia. Mann, a U.S. citizen, was the
first director of the World Health Organization global program on
AIDS. He was on his way to a meeting of AIDS experts.
	   _Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, American wife of Jonathan. A professor
in the Department of International Health at John Hopkins
University in Baltimore. She specialized in research into vaccines.
The couple had three children.
	   _Pierce Gerety, director of the African Great Lakes operations
at the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees. A veteran of refugee
operations in Sudan, the Philippines, Pakistan, Somalia and the
Great Lakes area around Rwanda, Congo and Burundi. He was a U.S.
citizen.
	   _Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, UNHCR senior social welfare officer. A
French citizen with seven years' experience at the refugee agency.
She had recently returned to work after maternity leave and leaves
behind a husband and baby daughter.
	   _Joachim Bilger, controller of the World Intellectual Property
Organization.
	   _Ludwig Beaumler, WIPO official.
	   _Yves de Roussan, UNICEF regional advisor for Central and
Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
	   _Ingrid Acevedo, director of public relations for the U.S.
Committee for UNICEF.
	   _An as-yet unidentified staffer with the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations.
	   Beatrice Tschanz, spokeswoman of Swissair's parent, the
SAirGroup, told The Associated Press that the airline expected it
might take until Saturday or Sunday for every family on the list to
be contacted.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Flashing the skills that could take her back to
the final, fifth-seeded Venus Williams moved easily into the third
round of the U.S. Open on Thursday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
qualifier Anne Kremer of Luxembourg.
	   Martina Hingis, who beat Williams for the women's title a year
ago, also won, but with a bit more difficulty. The top seed from
Switzerland defeated Iva Majoli 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, in a rematch of the
French Open final in 1997.
	   The men's runner-up last year, sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski of
Britain, saved a match point and outlasted Bohdan Ulihrach of the
Czech Republic 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.
	   In other early second-round matches, No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario defeated Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia 6-3, 6-2 and No. 13
Amanda Coetzer got past Raluca Sandu of Romania 6-0, 6-2. Kremer,
Zuluaga and Sandu all were qualifiers.
	   The three matches were the first completed in a jammed schedule
on Day 4 of the year's final Grand Slam.
	   The 18-year-old Williams, playing in only her second U.S. Open,
began by showing off a rapidly developing and lethal
serve-and-volley game. With her quickness, long legs and reach,
Williams a maturing net game that included a deft touch on drop
volleys.
	   It also didn't hurt to start the points with her huge serve, the
fastest of which was timed at 117 mph.
	   While Williams completely controlled the opening set, Kremer put
up a much stiffer fight in the second.
	   ``She played better as the match went on, we had better rallies,
and I appreciate that very much,'' Williams said.
	   Williams played while wearing a small logo for the Corel WTA
Tour, after being fined dlrs 100 for refusing to wear it in the
first round. The fines could have grown to dlrs 25,000 per
infraction.
	   ``I wasn't sending any message,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis beat Majoli in straight sets for the fourth straight time
since the Croatian won her only Grand Slam title in Paris 15 months
ago. After having trouble with her serve in the first set, Hingis
pulled away in the second set, holding Majoli to 12 points.

Chief inspector says monitors blocked from previously approved
</HEADLINE>
sites &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, SUBS last quote with new one, minor
edits &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector told the
Security Council on Thursday that even under the reduced inspection
regime in Iraq, U.N. monitors had been denied access to sites
previously approved by Baghdad.
	   Richard Butler's briefing came as the United States and Britain
introduced a draft resolution that would suspend regular sanctions
reviews until Iraq reverses its decision to freeze cooperation with
U.N. inspectors.
	   Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision has prevented inspectors from carrying
out any new inspections of suspected weapons sites and has reduced
the ability of U.N. monitors to survey sites that have already been
searched, Butler has said.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq has said that the monitoring of previously ``declared''
sites was not affected by the Aug. 5 decision, which came after
Butler refused to declare that Iraq had destroyed all of its banned
weapons.
	   But in his briefing, Butler told council members that on Aug.
16, U.N. monitors were refused access to a facility ``which had
been inspected within the scope of monitoring in the past,''
according to Butler's talking notes.
	   ``Iraq refused to permit the inspection citing that the unit was
military and that it was not, according to Iraq, within the scope
of monitoring.''
	   On Sept. 1, a monitoring team arrived at the gate of a site
subject to the monitoring of the U.N. Special Commission and known
to contain missile components, Butler said.
	   ``The team requested access to the site to verify that all items
were tagged and present,'' Butler's notes say. ``Iraq refused to
provide access to the site on the ground that the facility was not
a `declared site.'''
	   Both Iraq and the U.N. commission declare, or designate sites
for monitoring.
	   Despite Iraq's pledge that monitoring can continue, ``in fact
this may not be the case as Iraq has advised the commission,
orally, that it may only visit those sites which Iraq alone has
declared.''
	   In an effort to punish Iraq for the freeze, the United States
and Britain were hoping to pass a resolution in the next few days
that would suspend regular sanctions reviews, including a critical
six-month review in October, until Iraq resumes cooperation.
	   The move would effectively end Iraq's chances of having
8-year-old sanctions lifted. In the past, however, the reviews have
never led to any easing of the measures.
	   A copy of the draft resolution also said the council would
express its willingness to consider ``in a comprehensive fashion,
Iraq's compliance with its obligations under all relevant
resolutions once Iraq has rescinded its above-mentioned decision.''
	   Permanent council members China and Russia, in particular, had
been pushing for such a review. The two, along with France,
generally take a more sympathetic line towards Baghdad.
	   ``It's very important for the parties concerned to encourage the
Iraqis to resume cooperation with UNSCOM,'' China's deputy
ambassador, Shen Guofang, said as he entered the council Thursday
morning. ``We should make a kind of package deal.''

Austrian president tells Albright of effort to identify stolen art
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's president told Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday that the government was
establishing a commission to identify art which was stolen from
Holocaust victims by the Nazis.
	   Austrian officials said President Thomas Klestil told Albright,
who paid a one-day visit to Vienna after the Moscow summit, that
the commission would first determine the origin of all art works
owned by the Federal Museum here.
	   There was no statement on the art issue by U.S. officials.
Albright left for the United States after meetings with Klestil,
Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
	   Austria, the United States and 37 other nations have launched a
drive to identify billions of dollars worth of art stolen from
Holocaust victims throughout Europe.
	   The World Jewish Congress estimates the current value of stolen
art at between dlrs 90 billion and dlrs 140 billion.
	   In June, the Association of Art Museum Directors in the United
States recommended that American art museums check their own
collections to determine if any works were stolen during the war
and set up a worldwide database for tracking.
	   Austria was absorbed into Adolf Hitler's Germany in 1938 and was
restored as an independent nation following World War II.

Venezuelan actor and businessman Espartaco Santoni dies at 61
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARBELLA, Spain (AP) _ Espartaco Santoni, a Venezuelan actor and
businessman known for his luxurious life in the posh Mediterranean
resort of Marbella, died of a pancreatic pain on Thursday.
	   Santoni died at his home, the town hall of Marbella said in a
statement. He was 61.
	   Santoni's pirate-like head scarf and his five marriages helped
to make him a fixture in Spain's glossy gossip magazines, which
cover the lifestyles of Marbella's nouveau riche Spaniards, Arab
oil tycoons, film stars and models.
	   Born in Caracas in 1937, he first came to Spain after marrying
Spanish actress and singer Marujita Diaz.
	   His last appearance in a film came early this year in
``Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley'' (``Torrente, the stupid arm
of the law''), by Spanish director Santiago Segura.
	   Santoni, who is survived by his latest wife Eva Medina, was to
be buried Friday in Marbella.

Swiss tennis star narrowly missed fated crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss tennis star Marc Rosset and his
coach missed death on the fated Swissair flight SR111 when he
changed his reservation at the last minute.
	   Rosset, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, had booked a seat on
Wednesday's flight from New York to Geneva after being eliminated
from the U.S. Open tournament.
	   ``But when we were in the hotel, Marc said he wanted to stay an
extra day after all,'' his coach Pierre Simsolo said. ``I will be
eternally grateful to him,'' he told the Swiss sports agency.
	   Rosset said he heard the news while dining with friends and
watched the unfolding drama on television.
	   He said he was unsure now when he would return to Switzerland.
	   ``I'm not sure I want to get on to a plane right now,'' he told
Sport Information. ``I'm too scared.''
	   Rosset is currently ranked 47th in the world, having suffered
from poor performance in recent months.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Three foreigners died during a mob
attack on a train after they were accused of stealing jobs from
South Africans, police said Thursday.
	   Two of the dead were from Senegal and one was from Mozambique.
	   Police spokesman Captain George Francis said two of the victims
were electrocuted by overhead wires when they tried to escape the
mob by climbing on to the train roof.
	   The third man was run over by an oncoming train after he was
pushed out a window, Francis said.
	   The incident occurred late afternoon on Thursday near a station
outside Pretoria.

Iraq planning to replace veteran U.N. envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Hamdoon has been at the U.N. for six years, U.S.
and Iraq restored relations in 1984 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's high-profile ambassador to the United
Nations is leaving his post for a more senior job in Baghdad,
officials said Thursday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, one of President Saddam Hussein's most trusted
aides, will likely leave at the end of the year after six years at
the United Nations, Iraqi officials in Amman, Jordan, told The
Associated Press by telephone.
	   His job could go to the deputy foreign minister, Riyadh
al-Qaisi, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They declined to say what post Hamdoon could get.
	   Hamdoon's transfer is the latest in a recent reshuffle of
diplomatic missions, the biggest that Saddam has ordered since the
end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Some 30 ambassadors and other diplomats have been recalled since
July to be replaced by prominent journalists and officials from the
ruling Baath Party. Saddam reportedly hopes that the new officials
will be able to improve Iraq's image that has been tarnished since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   However, Hamdoon's recall is not considered a demotion.
	   A former deputy foreign minister, Hamdoon was made ambassador in
1992 after the war, and has frequently led Iraq's negotiations with
U.N weapons inspectors who are entrusted with dismantling the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Fluent in English, Hamdoon was the first Iraqi ambassador to the
United States after the two countries restored diplomatic relations
in 1984 ending a nearly 20-year break.
	   He is a senior official of the Baath Party and during his nearly
30 years in government has served as deputy information minister
and deputy foreign minister.
	   Hamdoon studied architecture in the United States but spent most
of his career as a Baath activist. One of his jobs was to oversee
the party's covert operations in Arab countries.
	   One of the ambassadors to lose their jobs in the July reshuffle
was Saddam's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, at the United Nations
in Geneva.
	   But the Iraqi officials in Jordan said he is not expected to
return to Baghdad and will remain abroad to supervise Saddam's
family's business.

Three sentenced to death for Guatemala kidnap-murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Three men have been sentenced to death for
the kidnapping and murder of a 76-year-old woman, one of a series
of abductions that outraged the country.
	   A three-judge panel late Wednesday ordered Ever Gabriel Alvarado
Garcia, Luis Amilcar Cetino Perez and Tomas Serrate Hernandez to
die by lethal injection. The sentences can be appealed.
	   A woman convicted in the case, Lilian Yolanda Javier Solis, was
sentenced to 50 years in prison. Another man charged in the case,
Daniel Fernando Palacios Luna, escaped from prison and was captured
in El Salvador, where he is imprisoned.
	   Isabel Bonifasi de Botran was kidnapped in the Guatemalan
capital in November 1996. Her strangled body was discovered on Jan.
28, 1997, a few miles (kilometers) to the south.
	   Relatives had paid the kidnappers the equivalent of dlrs
220,000, but the gang had sought more than dlrs 1 million.
	   A wave of kidnappings, assaults and murders led Guatemala to end
a 13-year moratorium on executions in 1996.

Tribal fighting displaces 100 families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, South Africa (AP) _ Tribal fighting in Zambia's North
Western province displaced more than 100 families, a government
official said Thursday.
	   Grain supplies were torched and 50 houses burned down in the
Zambezi and Chavuma districts, near the border with Congo,
according to senior North Western official Felix Mfula.
	   The feud appeared to be linked to fighting over land rights
between the Lunda and Luvale tribes that dates back to British
colonial rule, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The Zambian Red Cross and the Lutheran World Federation are
coordinating relief efforts to find food, clothes and shelter for
the displaced families.
	   State House spokesman Richard Sakala on Thursday appealed to
traditional leaders to resolve the tribal tensions.

 &UR; Investigators looking at possible technical problem causing crash &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swissair ordering checks on MD-11 graf 2, plans
to replace the aircraft in 4 years. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Investigators examining the wreckage of Swissair
flight SR111 that crashed off the Canadian coast suspect a
technical or human problem rather than any terrorist attack,
officials said Thursday.
	   Swissair ordered safety checks on its 15 remaining McDonnell
Douglas MD-11 planes, but said it had no plans to take the
three-engine craft out of service.
	   It refused to speculate about what caused the accident until the
aircraft's flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders can be recovered
and examined. They will give crucial insight into the plane's final
30 minutes.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti said there had been no threats or
other indications of a terrorist attack that would lead to any
conclusion other than technical or human failure.
	   U.S. officials said they also had no indication of terrorism,
but New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the FBI was investigating
nonetheless.
	   The jetliner took off from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport at
8:18 p.m. Wednesday (0018gmt Thursday) en route to Geneva and
initially was in regular radio contact, the airline said.
	   But Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer Stephan Loew,
36, soon reported smoke in the cockpit and considered a change in
course for Boston, then decided to go for Halifax, Canada, which
was closer.
	   The plane crashed offshore, but with many bodies apparently
recovered in life jackets, it was clear they had been preparing for
a crash landing.
	   Swiss Transportation Minister Moritz Leuenberger said there were
three possible sources for smoke in the cockpit _ a burning engine,
a fire in the luggage hold or an electrical short-circuit.
	   The airline pointed out that its pilot and copilot were not only
experienced with the MD-11, but were both rated as instructors with
the aircraft.
	   Swissair officials said the MD-11 has been a reliable, safe
aircraft even though they have had some technical problems with it
over the years.
	   The airline had some cracks in engine blades starting in 1993
and replaced all the blades in the entire fleet of MD-11s. Other
parts were changed on the manufacturer's recommendation. Airline
chief Philippe Bruggisser said the company planned to replace its
MD-11 fleet with Airbus A-340s in the year 2002.
	   The aircraft that crashed _ registration HB-IWF _ joined the
Swissair fleet in 1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years
ago. It passed its most recent one-day exam on Aug. 10. It had been
maintained by Swissair, KLM and Air France, officials said.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into the crash,
joined by specialists from the United States and Switzerland.
	   A Canadian investigator is expected in Zurich on Friday to
examine the plane's records.

Venice Film Festival opens with tributes to absent Sophia Loren

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Steven Spielberg was there. Tom Hanks was
there. But the spotlight at Thursday's opening of the Venice Film
Festival was on a celebrity who wasn't _ Sophia Loren, kept away by
illness.
	   Producer-husband Carlo Ponti filled in to accept a lifetime
achievement award for Loren, his eyes reddening as he read a
message from his wife.
	   ``Italy, especially its cinema, has first place in my heart,''
Loren said in her message to the audience. ``I embrace you all.''
	   The Italian-born actress, 63, was hospitalized in New York last
month and examined for an arrhythmia, an irregularity in the
heartbeat. She was released after a few days.
	   Ponti said Loren is doing fine, and only needs a period of rest.
	   ``The knowledge that Sophia Loren is doing well makes the world
indeed a better place,'' Hanks said during the opening ceremony.
``We wish she were here.''
	   The American actor stars in Spielberg's World War II epic
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which is opening the festival in the
film's European premiere.
	   Hanks clowned for the cameras before the ceremony, dropping to
the carpet in his tuxedo for a few push-ups, a la Jack Palance at
the Academy Awards.
	   Spielberg rebuffed a question on what message he wanted the film
to get across to audiences here.
	   ``I really think that messages are something that audiences need
to discover for themselves,'' Spielberg said, adding, ``I'm very
proud of all the messages that are being perceived in my country
about this picture.''
	   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' already a hit in the United States, is
showing out of competition.
	   Thursday's other lifetime achievement went to Polish director
Andrzej Wajda
	   The competition for Golden Lion award starts Friday and features
19 movies, including Abel Ferrara's ``New Rose Hotel,'' Emir
Kusturica's ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' and ``Rounders,'' featuring
Hollywood's latest star Matt Damon.
	   Although less glitzy than Cannes, Venice attracts its share of
stars. Among those expected are Sean Penn, George Clooney, Michael
Douglas, Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, James Caan and
Kenneth Branagh.
	   The 55th edition of the festival runs hrough Sept. 13.

Russia introduces new restrictions on hard-currency deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a desperate attempt to stem capital flight,
Russia will introduce a series of tight controls over
foreign-currency payments for imports and exports, the Central Bank
announced Thursday.
	   Government officials have said that more than dlrs 25 billion
have been smuggled out of Russia since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
Between dlrs 3.5 billion and dlrs 4.5 billion were taken out of the
country legally between May and mid-August.
	   As the economic crisis has unfolded, the Central Bank has sought
to ensure that foreign currency comes into Russia and stays, and
has recently revived a defunct rule requiring Russian exporters to
bring half their export earnings to Russia and convert them into
rubles.
	   The new regulations, which take effect Friday, will require
Russian exporters to either secure a pre-payment in hard currency
to their accounts at an authorized Russian bank, or open an
irrevocable letter of credit at such a bank.
	   The foreign counterpart will be allowed to make payments only
through authorized banks that guarantee the compliance of Russia's
currency controls, the Central Bank said.
	   Russian-based importers will have to prove that the goods will
be sold in Russia in order to be allowed to pay out hard currency.

Tennis star's late change keeps him off fatal Swissair flight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late change kept 1992 Olympic tennis champion
Marc Rosset off the Swissair flight that crashed off the Canadian
coast, killing all aboard.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's No. 1 men's player, was set to return
to Geneva on Swissair Flight 111 from New York's Kennedy Airport
Wednesday night after being eliminated from the U.S. Open.
	   Instead, Rosset decided to spend another night in New York.
	   ``Changing your mind is your life,'' he said Thursday.
	   It was not believed that any players or coaches were aboard the
flight, which crashed into the water off the Canadian province of
Nova Scotia late Wednesday.
	   The flight is heavily used by athletes flying from the United
States to Europe.
	   ``I believe in destiny,'' Rosset told a Zurich newspaper. ``I
don't think it was time to go yet.''
	   Jacques Hermenjat, tournament director of the Swiss Open, which
is held in Gstaad, normally returns home on Wednesday night from
meetings held in conjunction with the U.S. Open. This year,
however, he booked Flight 111 on Thursday night when the United
States Tennis Association invited him to have lunch Thursday.
	   ``Now when people say they are glad to see me, I am real happy
to say I'm glad to be here,'' Hermenjat said.
	   Rosset said he learned of the crash when friends in New York
called him at his hotel and told him to turn on the television.

WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Surprising sunshine, bombing opponent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The best of local omens greeted
U.S. President Bill Clinton as he arrived to celebrate Northern
Ireland's peace agreement: against the odds of history, blazing
sunshine prevailed in Belfast.
	   Northern Ireland has suffered this year through one of the most
unrelentingly gray, soggy summers in living memory _ until
Thursday.
	   The heavens parted to coincide with the arrival of Clinton and
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
	   ``I've been telling Bill and Hillary it's always like this in
Northern Ireland,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said,
sparking genuine laughter from a mixed crowd in west Belfast.
	   Officials had taken no chances. They held the groundbreaking
ceremony for a new university campus inside a waterproof tent.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   After Clinton's somber meeting with bombing victim families in
Omagh, the Clintons strolled the streets near the blast site for
about 45 minutes, shaking hands with well-wishers in an atmosphere
that grew festive with cheering and applause.
	   The Clintons, Blair and his wife, Cherie, stopped at Watterson's
Clothing Store, where hundreds of bouquets were left in memory of
three store employees who died in the bombing.
	   Security for Clinton was especially intense in light of last
month's car bombing at Omagh and terrorist bomb attacks against
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Lewis Merletti, director
of the Secret Service, accompanied the plainclothes agents who
stick close to the president during his public appearances.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   In the Irish Republic, the mayor of Limerick said he's disturbed
by the Aug. 20 U.S. missile attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan, which
the president ordered to retaliate for the embassy bombings.
	   But Mayor Joe Harrington, a Socialist member of the Limerick
Council, said he won't try to score any political points when
Clinton arrives Saturday for a speech.
	   ``It is very hard for me then to turn on the television and see
missiles being fired into backward countries in Africa and Asia,''
said Harrington, who has visited the devastation of Omagh's bombing
site.
	   ``It's a double standard I couldn't possibly support.''

	   CHAKLALA AIR BASE, Pakistan (AP) _ Five of at least 50 Iranian
prisoners held by the hard-line Taliban army in Afghanistan were
released Thursday in a goodwill gesture.
	   Iran, Afghanistan's powerful western neighbor, has blamed the
Taliban for the disappearance of 11 Iranian diplomats. None of the
diplomats were among those released Thursday.
	   The prisoners, all old and three appearing frail, landed at
about 8:30 p.m. at the Chaklala military air base near Islamabad,
aboard a white Pakistan Air Force Fokker propeller plane. Two of
five, all truck drivers, flashed the victory sign as they walked
across the tarmac.
	   ``This is part of a goodwill (gesture) by ... Afghanistan with
the Iranian government,'' Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan,
Saeed-ur Rehman Haqqani, said through his interpreter.
	   A five-man delegation, including two Iranian diplomats and
Pakistanis, spent all day Thursday in Afghanistan negotiating with
the Taliban over the release of the Iranians. They also sought to
find out what happened to the diplomats.
	   Tensions between Iran and the ruling Taliban have deepened since
11 Iranian diplomats disappeared following a Taliban takeover of
key parts of north Afghanistan from its northern-based opponents.
The diplomats were working at the Iranian Consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif at the time.
	   ``We consider it as a good gesture by Taliban. But it is not
enough. We should go forward to ease the tension,'' said Iranian
diplomat Mohammed Hussein Abdulahahi, who headed the delegation.
	   Abdullahahi, who is based in Pakistan, said the Taliban has
promised a full report on the fate of the diplomats in one week.
Failing that, the Taliban will allow a joint team from Iran,
Pakistan and Afghanistan into the area to conduct its own
investigation, he said.
	   He said the talks had led to ``some understandings that will
facilitate the peace'' and that the Taliban promised to look into
the release of remaining prisoners. Abdullahahi said the men were
being held in poor conditions and that some need medical attention.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to its
enemies, while Iran says the religious militia is holding 70 of its
citizens, including the 11 diplomats and a journalist for the
official Iranian news agency.
	   Since the disappearance of the diplomats, Iran has begun
wide-scale military exercises on its border with Afghanistan,
deploying more than 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers.
	   Earlier this week, Iran warned Afghanistan that it would
consider all options to retrieve its citizens. There were some
reports from Tehran that the diplomats were feared killed by
Taliban troops. The Taliban has denied the accusation.

Suspect in Irish journalist's slaying loses extradition fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect appearing in special court in Dublin

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A man appeared in Dublin's Special
Criminal Court on Thursday charged with the murder of a prominent
investigative reporter.
	   Brian Meehan, 33, of Dublin, is accused of driving a motorcycle
alongside the car of Veronica Guerin in a Dublin district on June
26, 1996, so his passenger could open fire on the 36-year-old
reporter.
	   Guerin, who reported extensively on Dublin's underworld for the
Sunday Independent newspaper, later died of her wounds.
	   Meehan, who was arrested in Amsterdam last October by Dutch
police, lost his battle against extradition and arrived back in
Ireland from the Netherlands earlier Thursday. Meehan claimed he
was innocent and could not receive a fair trial due to intense
media coverage of the killing in Ireland.
	   If convicted, Meehan faces a maximum life sentence. At the 20
minute hearing at the special court, prosecutors also charged
Meehan with 17 other crimes, including firearms and narcotics
offenses. Meehan was remanded in custody until Oct. 8.
	   Another man, Paul Ward, 33, also from Dublin, is awaiting trial
on a charge of murdering Guerin.

Iraq planning to replace veteran U.N. envoy

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Hamdoon has been at the U.N. for six years, U.S.
and Iraq restored relations in 1984 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq's high-profile ambassador to the United
Nations is leaving his post for a more senior job in Baghdad,
officials said Thursday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, one of President Saddam Hussein's most trusted
aides, will likely leave at the end of the year after more than six
years at the United Nations, Iraqi officials in Amman, Jordan, told
The Associated Press by telephone.
	   His job could go to the deputy foreign minister, Riyadh
al-Qaisi, said officials speaking on condition of anonymity. They
declined to say what post Hamdoon could get.
	   Hamdoon's transfer is the latest in a recent reshuffle of
diplomatic missions, the biggest ordered by Saddam since the end of
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Some 30 ambassadors and other diplomats have been recalled since
July to be replaced by prominent journalists and officials from the
ruling Baath Party. Saddam reportedly hopes the new officials will
be able to improve Iraq's image that has been tarnished since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   However, Hamdoon's recall is not considered a demotion.
	   A former deputy foreign minister, Hamdoon was made ambassador in
1991 after the war, and has frequently led Iraq's negotiations with
U.N weapons inspectors who are entrusted with dismantling the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Fluent in English, Hamdoon was the first Iraqi ambassador to the
United States after the two countries restored diplomatic relations
in 1984, ending a nearly 20-year break.

All bets are off on Mexican peso, experts say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONICA GUTSCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ As Mexico's peso slid past 10.00 to the U.S.
dollar on Thursday, all bets were off about where it was headed.
But many hoped that Latin America's ``shock absorber'' would bounce
back by year's end.
	   ``An uneducated guess is as good as an educated guess,'' says
Jonathan Heath, an independent Mexican economist. ``I think it's
very, very hard to forecast the peso in the midst of this kind of
volatility.''
	   The peso lost 2.4 percent of its value last week alone; it has
depreciated 20 percent so far this year despite a strong economy,
and in spite of the central bank's attempts to tighten money supply
and prop up interest rates.
	   The Mexican currency closed Thursday on the spot market at a
mid-rate of 10.135 to to dlr 1, weaker from its open of 10.12 and
from its close Wednesday of 9.902.
	   As a free-floating currency, the reflects investor sentiment
toward emerging markets in general, as frightened investors pull
money out of risky markets in Latin America, Asia and Eastern
Europe, analysts say.
	   New York investment bank Merrill Lynch recently revised its
year-end peso forecast downward to 10.00 from 9.20, cite peso's new
role as an instant signaler of broad investor sentiment toward
emerging markets, and Japan.''
	   Walter Molano, economist with SBC Warburg Dillon Read, calls the
peso Mexico's ``shock absorber,'' noting it has borne most of the
impact of money being pulled out of Latin America. Brazil has used
its international reserves for the same purpose, while other
countries have mitigated damage by boosting interest rates.
	   Observers point to external shocks that have battered the peso _
the Russian debt crisis, low oil prices, Asia's financial debacle,
and fears of devaluations in Brazil, Venezuela, China, Hong Kong
and other vulnerable economies.
	   At home, the peso's weakness has radically changed Mexico's
economic panorama.
	   Inflation has begun rising, and few expect it will finish the
year under the government's original goal of 12 percent. Most
economists are projecting 15 to 16 percent.
	   Interest rates also are rising. Banks have stopped issuing new
credit; several have canceled recently revived mortgage plans.
	   Some worry about an economic slowdown, despite the 5.4 percent
growth registered in the first half of 1998. While most analysts
believe Mexico is still on track to report a 4.5 percent rise in
gross domestic product in 1998, many have reduced their 1999
estimates, some to just above 3.0 percent.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo in a speech this week noted that
Mexico's ``solid bases'' make it more able than most emerging
markets to weather the storm.
	   Economists point to Mexico's still-buoyant economy, its tight
fiscal discipline and its proactive monetary policy as factors that
will eventually attract investors back.

Russians default, U.S. halts dlrs 45 million in credits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States has suspended dlrs 45
million in agricultural commodity credits to Russia because of
default on past loans, an official said Thursday.
	   The suspension happened after banks in Russia, enduring severe
economic problems, failed to pay dlrs 20.9 million due Aug. 20,
said Christopher Goldthwaite, manager of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's export credit programs.
	   ``We have not yet had contact with them about it. I'm hopeful it
can be cleared up quickly,'' Goldthwaite said.
	   The dlrs 45 million is part of Russia's overall credit line of
dlrs 95 million this fiscal year. The credit program, used to
finance purchase of U.S. farm commodities, represents only about 5
percent of total U.S. agricultural exports to Russia, Goldthwaite
said.

Hurricane Isis reaches Mexican mainland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cyclone dissipating, heavy rainfront headed
toward Texas, new location, storm warnings canceled. At 1600 GMT,
storm located near latitude 28.0 north, longitude 108.0 west. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ Hurricane Isis hit the Mexican
mainland with 75 mph (120 kph) winds on Thursday but rapidly
dissipated into a rainstorm heading for the U.S. border.
	   Winds overnight blasted out windows, knocked out electricity and
littered this city with downed street posts and tree limbs. The
light roof at a local gas station collapsed atop a compact car,
which was apparently unoccupied.
	   Mayor Francis Lopez Brito said one person was seriously injured
by a jolt from a downed power cable. The storm killed one person
Wednesday in Baja California Sur state and two people were missing.
	   By 1600 GMT, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said
Isis had dissipated into a rainstorm that could dump 4 to 8 inches
(10 to 20 cms) of rain in some areas.
	   The storm was speeding northeast at 20 to 25 mph (30 to 40 kph)
and was located about 270 miles south-southwest of El Paso.
	   A few cars sent up a muddy spray as they battled through waters
above bumper level in the streets of this city of 300,000.
	   Maria Florencia Pedroza said she went to a Red Cross shelter at
a school when ``the water started coming into my house.''
	   ``I wasn't afraid for myself, but for my mother,'' she said. The
two were among three dozen people who slept on blankets on the
concrete floor of a school.
	   Carlos Alberto Villegas used a bucket inside his concrete-block
house in a seemingly vain attempt to bail out the lake of water
that stood just below seat level of his new sofa.
	   ``It came in so very strong that the house just began to
flood,'' he said.
	   But early reports indicated that the storm was less disastrous
than 1995's Hurricane Ismael, which caught fishing fleets at sea
and killed more than 90 people. Local radio stations said most
boats were in harbor because the shrimp season, a mainstay of the
local economy, had not yet begun.
	   Further south in the port city of Mazatlan, flooding was
reported in 15 neighborhoods and the army helped residents
evacuate. Waves pushed some boats onto the rocks.
	   On Wednesday, Isis belted the tip of the Baja California
peninsula, cutting phones and electricity, forcing thousands of
residents from their homes and trapping tourists in storm-battered
seaside hotels.
	   One woman was killed and her husband was missing after they
tried to cross a stream in Los Cabos, said Emigdio Suarez Aguilar,
a civil protection official in Baja California Sur state. The body
of Josefina Espinosa Agundez, 48, has been recovered. Her husband
is presumed dead.
	   Notimex also reported one man was missing after being swept away
by floodwaters in Jalisco state.
	   As Isis dissipated, tropical warnings were canceled.
	   With Isis toward the west and Hurricane Earl in the east near
the Florida coast, heavy rains fell in much of Mexico.
	   In the southern state of Chiapas, more than 300 families had to
be evacuated after flooding along two rivers in the coastal
municipalities of Mapastepec and Acapetuhua.
	   Heavy rains also forced 95 families to seek shelter in the
municipalities of Jiutepec and Yautepec in the central state of
Morelos, Notimex reported.

Latin American leaders face economic woes at summit

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Leaders of 14 Latin American nations
meet here this weekend, hoping to find a common approach to the
global economic crisis that has rattled their countries and to ease
other problems.
	   Foreign ministers were due on Friday, followed on Saturday by
presidents from 10 countries and stand-ins from four others for the
Rio Group summit.
	   Summit spokeswoman Ivette Franco Koroneos said the leaders would
try to agree on a common statement about the economic crisis, which
caused stock markets and currencies to plummet across Latin
America.
	   ``I would be very surprised if there are any new policies,''
said Ronald Ratcliff, chief Latin American economist for SG Cowen
Securities Corp. in New York.
	   He said leaders would be worried about announcements that could
worry investors.
	   They likely will be talking about possible scenarios behind
closed doors and the failure of currency devaluations in Russia and
Asia to stem the crisis, he said.
	   Discussions also were planned on security, relations with
Europe, development of science and technology, trafficking in arms
and drugs and cooperation against terrorism, she said.
	   The presidents of Peru and Ecuador, Alberto Fujimori and Jamil
Mahuad, were taking advantage of the summit for a side meeting on
their border dispute, which has led to periodic clashes. The two
also met Aug. 15 in Paraguay.
	   The Rio Group, which held its first annual summit in 1987, aims
to raise the Latin American alliance to the level of other regional
groups, Franco said.
	   Eight nations _ Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina,
Brazil, Peru and Uruguay _ founded the group in Rio de Janeiro in
1986. It grew to include Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Guyana and Paraguay.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila's
main military ally _ Zimbabwe _ all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative.
	   Congolese government forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, have pushed rebels allegedly supported by
Rwanda and Uganda from the capital Kinshasa and were advancing
eastward into rebel territory in the vast central African nation.
	   Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu denied any involvement in
the Congo war, saying ``it is a result of the conditions the
(Kabila) regime has created in the country.'' Uganda has also
denied involvement.
	   ``Had we not intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila ...
would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared at
a summit of the Nonaligned Movement in this Indian Ocean city. ``We
have now secured Kinshasa and we're quite certain it cannot fall
and that the government cannot fall.''
	   Taking the podium minutes later, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni complained that foreign troops were propping up a
government which ``has not been elected.'' Kabila led a rebellion
last year that ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   For the first time, Museveni also acknowledged Ugandan troops
are in rebel-held territory in eastern Congo. He did not respond to
Kabila's allegations that Ugandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   The talks here have led to a shift in South Africa's position on
intervention by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
	   Before, President Nelson Mandela had sought to promote diplomacy
and negotiations to stop the fighting, but on Thursday he told
reporters it was ``reasonable'' for outside countries to give the
military aid Kabila had requested.
	   Mandela later denied that his remarks represented a shift in
South African policy, reaffirming that he opposed military
intervention but could accept the reasons for it.
	   After Namibian state radio crowed that Mandela had flip-flopped
and now supported intervention, Mandela angrily said: ``It is an
exaggeration and mischievous to say we are now backing the
(Congo-allied) forces.''

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Swissair pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit, dumped tons of fuel and prepared for an emergency
landing before his jetliner crashed into the ocean off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Flight SR111 from New York to Geneva plunged into the Atlantic
late Wednesday night about 90 minutes after leaving Kennedy
International Airport at 8:18 p.m (0018 GMT Thursday). It carried
215 passengers _ including two infants _ and 14 crew. Most of the
passengers _ 136 _ were Americans, as was one crew.
	   By Thursday morning, 36 bodies had been found and searchers had
located a chunk of the plane's fuselage believed to be intact under
about 35 meters (115 feet) of water. Heavy surf hampered search
efforts.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' said Maj. Michel Brisebois of the
rescue center. Bodies were being taken to a temporary morgue at the
Canadian Forces Base Shearwater, 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the
east.
	   Chances of survival at this point are ``very poor,'' Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire said.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 reported problems at 33,000 feet
(10,000 meters), then descended to roughly 8,000 feet (2,500
meters) before disappearing from radar about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Halifax International Airport, said Philippe
Bruggisser, chief executive officer of Swissair's parent group.
	   The crash occurred between seven and 10 minutes before the plane
would have reached Halifax, he said at a news conference in Zurich.
	   The passengers had been prepared for an emergency landing.
Swissair officials said some bodies had been recovered wearing
lifevests.
	   Aside from the Americans, passengers included 30 French and 28
Swiss citizens; six British citizens; three Germans; three
Italians, two Greeks. One passenger each came from Saudi Arabia,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Spain and Russia, and the Caribbean
island of St. Kitts.
	   In New York, Swissair Vice President Walter Vollenweider said
the list was based on passports and cautioned: ``This is no
indication about the residences of these people.''
	   Vollenweider said the pilot originally planned to land in Boston
because Swissair has an infrastructure there, but then headed to
Halifax because it was closer.
	   Swissair identified the pilot as Urs Zimmermann, 50, and
co-pilot Stefan Loew, 36. Both were Swiss.
	   Witnesses on the ground reported hearing sputtering noises from
an aircraft passing overhead and then a thundering crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said witness Claudia
Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships immediately headed
out in driving rain to the crash site, about six miles (ten
kilometers) off the coast of Peggy's Cove, a picturesque fishing
village popular with tourists. Debris _ a pocketbook, shoes, a
necktie, a baby sling _ was found about an hour after the plane was
reported missing.
	   Wreckage from the crash spread out over six miles (ten
kilometers), and fishermen helping with the rescue effort said the
smell of fuel was overwhelming.
	   Roy Bears, a Canadian aviation safety investigator, said divers
were using sonar to map the debris field and try to locate the two
black boxes _ one, a voice recorder and the other recording with
technical data on the flight _ in about 150 feet (50 meters) of
water.
	   Bears said early indications are that it was not a terrorist
act.
	   ``There were 16 minutes elapsed from the time they initially
declared an urgent situation _ smoke in the cockpit'' to the time
the craft disappeared from radar, he said. ``At this point ... the
crew do not think they have anything that would indicate a
terrorist act.''
	   The White House and the FBI agreed terrorism likely was not a
factor in the crash, although the FBI was studying passenger
manifests. President Bill Clinton, who was visiting Northern
Ireland Thursday, was being regularly briefed.
	   ``We are deeply grieved,'' Clinton told reporters, expresing his
condolences to the families.
	   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien also extended condolences.
Canadian officials were scrambling to find 1,000 hotel rooms needed
for relatives of the dead, emergency staff and investigators.
	   Swissair was flying relatives from Zurich to Halifax on Friday.
It said the passenger list will not be released until family
members are notified _ probably not until Saturday.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, was among
the dead, along with his wife, according to the World Health
Organization. The United Nations said seven U.N. workers returning
to headquarters in Geneva were on board the plane.
	   ``It was like a U.N. air bus,'' said spokesman Fred Eckhard in
New York. ``Even before we got confirmation that there were U.N.
staff on the flight, we just knew from the identification of the
flight that there would've been some of our people on that plane.''
	   The three-engine plane dumped tons of fuel over nearby St.
Margaret's Bay before crashing, The Canadian Press quoted an
airport worker as saying.
	   At the airports in New York and Geneva, grief counselors were on
hand for relatives of the crash victims. A special lounge was set
up in the Delta Air Lines terminal at Kennedy Airport.
	   It was the first crash of a Swissair plane since Oct. 7, 1979,
when one of its DC-8s overshot the runway in Athens, Greece, while
attempting to land and burst into flames. Fourteen people were
killed.
	   The plane was put into service in August 1991 and was overhauled
in August and September last year, said Georges Schorderet, the
chief financial officer of parent company SAirGroup. It had been
checked as all are before takeoff, he added.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a jet known for its reliability,
even though its manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to
discontinue the model in the year 2000.
	   Swissair will check its 15 remaining MD-11s in the wake of the
crash, Bruggisser said. The fleet will only be brought back into
service when it's been established there are no technical problems,
he said. That process could take days or months.

Omagh fights conflicting feelings as Clinton pays respects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Excitement fought with guilt,
gratitude with grief on the streets of bomb-shattered, sun-drenched
Omagh as U.S. President Bill Clinton paid respects Thursday at the
scene where 28 people perished at the hand of terrorists.
	   ``You just wouldn't really know how to feel. You feel guilty for
feeling a wee bit happy,'' said Gemma Kerr, 17, who had brought
along a small American flag, but left it resting by her side as the
presidential limousine passed by.
	   ``He's here because 28 people were butchered: two baby girls, a
mother heavily pregnant with twins, children _ so many children,''
said George Maxwell, carrying his own young daughter on his
shoulders so she could take a picture.
	   ``The stories of the bereaved families are just too much to
bear, but here's Mr. Clinton flying all the way from Washington to
hear them,'' he said.
	   ``It's an amazing moment wrapped up in all this unspeakable
horror. ... You're pleased he's here. You wish he'd no reason to
come.''
	   The visit of Clinton _ on the heels of two weeks of high-profile
visits by Prince Charles and Irish and British politicians _
sparked the first surges of public joy in Omagh since that
split-second nightmare 19 days before when an IRA dissidents' car
bomb tore apart workers, shoppers and tourists on Market Street.
	   ``There's quiet pleasure that the most powerful person in the
world wanted to be in Omagh today,'' said Pat McDonell, a moderate
Catholic politician from the town.
	   At the community center where many locals had learned last month
whether their missing loved ones were wounded or slain, the
president and first lady offered condolences one by one, hearing
firsthand stories of physical and emotional anguish.
	   ``He seemed quite emotional. It was easy to talk to him man to
man,'' said Stanley McCombe, whose 49-year-old wife Ann was killed
in the attack.
	   ``Everybody there today was pleased that the Clintons were able
to meet them,'' said Seamus Gallagher, whose daughter Claire, a
14-year-old pianist, lost her right eye and faces surgery next week
on her left eye to see whether ``she can get a bit of sight from
it.''
	   Gallagher said the president told his daughter ``to keep up her
good work on the piano, to keep fighting, to keep her chin up. Mrs.
Clinton actually said to Claire that if she ever came to America
that she would get her to come play the piano for her.''
	   The thousands who stood for hours lining the main street waiting
for the president greeted him with enthusiastic smiles and
outstretched hands.
	   In the nearby Monument bar, people reflected wounded feelings.
	   ``It's been hard enough for this town to try to get back to
normal. Many businesses only reopened last Monday, and that was
very, very difficult for us. Now everything's been turned upside
down and brought to a standstill again,'' said Nigel O'Kane, the
bar's manager.
	   Paddy McGowan, a retired fireman who like many others on the day
of the blast ran forward to try to help the hundreds of wounded and
dying, said the Clinton visit had accelerated the slow healing
process that the community must endure.
	   ``It's a tremendous gesture of solidarity for our suffering,''
he said.

FBI agents investigate possible Comorian connection to bombings

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect's wife also detained, two houses
searched, name of suspect who lived in Sudan, other details
 &UR; By KAMAL EDDINE SAINDOU &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MAYOTTE, Comoros (AP)_ FBI agents searched two homes and sought
a suspect in a possible Comorian connection to the U.S. embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last month, police said Thursday in
this archipelago off the Tanzanian coast.
	   About two dozen agents and Comorian military police on the
island of Moroni on Wednesday searched homes belonging to the wife
and parents of the suspect, police said on condition of anonymity.
	   Police identified the suspect as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a
Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly
after the embassy bombings last month in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   Police detained Fadhul's wife and his brother for questioning,
police said.
	   During the five-hour house searches Wednesday, police cordoned
off the two working-class neighborhoods where the homes were
located. Authorities took away attache chases, clothes of Fadhul's
parents and combed the houses with sensing devices for traces of
bomb-making materials, police said.
	   Fadhul had returned to Moroni with his wife but left three days
later. His wife stayed behind with her ailing father, who since
died, police said. Fadhul's wife and brother attended the funeral
Thursday by police escort.
	   The possible Comorian connection came to light when
investigators found a Comorian phone number in Nairobi, the police
said, without elaborating.
	   As a result, at least 24 FBI agents had arrived on the island of
Moroni since Sunday to run down the lead, authorities said.
	   Transit links between the Comoros Islands and the east African
coast that includes Tanzania and Kenya are subject to light
security, raising the possibility the routes may have been used to
transport bomb-making ingredients.
	   U.S. authorities have obtained the extradition of several
suspects linked to the Aug. 7 bombings that killed 258 people,
including 12 Americans. More than 5,500 people were injured.
	   The suspects were linked to fugitive Islamic militant Osama bin
Laden, who was believed to be behind the bombings.
	   U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 struck at targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that Washington linked to the embassy bombings. The
missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of
Khartoum that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials.
	   The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic
militants supporting bin Laden.

Flying and allergic to peanuts? Tell the ticket agent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID PACE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hold the peanuts. The government has ordered
airlines to establish ``peanut-free buffer zones'' when passengers
with peanut allergies are aboard.
	   The instructions have Southern farmers boiling and their
congressmen roasting U.S. Transportation Department phone lines.
	   But airline officials insist it won't be a problem. The skies
still will be filled with peanuts, they say, except for those
booked on one of the few flights carrying a peanut allergy
sufferer.
	   ``It is truly no big deal,'' said Ed Stewart, a spokesman for
Southwest Airlines, which prides itself on low fares and passes out
peanuts instead of meals. ``Some people are upset by what came out
of the government, but in terms of our operation, we'll just go
with the flow.''
	   The Transportation Department's order last month required
airlines to set aside at least three rows where peanuts cannot be
served when they have advance requests from passengers with
medically documented peanut allergies.
	   Lawmakers from peanut-producing states were furious.
	   Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama telephoned the
Transportation Department demanding an explanation. He issued a
statement calling the directive ``an embarrassment'' to both the
department and the government.
	   ``It is overreaching, bureaucratic nonsense like this that makes
people distrust and resent government,'' said Shelby, chairman of
the Senate Appropriations panel with jurisdiction over the
Transportation budget.
	   Rep. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican from Georgia, drafted a
letter to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater deploring the
directive and demanding a meeting to discuss it. The letter had
signatures from seven other peanut-state lawmakers.
	   The directive stems from a 1986 law guaranteeing access to
airlines for the disabled. The Transportation Department acted
after receiving complaints from peanut allergy sufferers. Peanuts
are the snack food of choice for almost every airline in the United
States.
	   For Southwest, the no-frills airline that once advertised
``peanut fares,'' providing buffer zones is impossible. It doesn't
assign seats. So the airline has just continued what it has been
doing for five years: operating peanut-free flights when any
passenger notifies them of an allergy.

WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Surprising sunshine, bombing opponent

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The best of local omens greeted
U.S. President Bill Clinton as he arrived to celebrate Northern
Ireland's peace agreement: against the odds of history, blazing
sunshine prevailed in Belfast.
	   Northern Ireland has suffered this year through one of the most
unrelentingly gray, soggy summers in living memory _ until
Thursday.
	   The heavens parted to coincide with the arrival of Clinton and
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
	   ``I've been telling Bill and Hillary it's always like this in
Northern Ireland,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said,
sparking genuine laughter from a mixed crowd in west Belfast.
	   Officials had taken no chances. They held the groundbreaking
ceremony for a new university campus inside a waterproof tent.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   After Clinton's somber meeting with bombing victim families in
Omagh, the Clintons strolled the streets near the blast site for
about 45 minutes, shaking hands with well-wishers in an atmosphere
that grew festive with cheering and applause.
	   The Clintons, Blair and his wife, Cherie, stopped at Watterson's
Clothing Store, where hundreds of bouquets were left in memory of
three store employees who died in the bombing.
	   Security for Clinton was especially intense in light of last
month's car bombing at Omagh and terrorist bomb attacks against
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Lewis Merletti, director
of the Secret Service, accompanied the plainclothes agents who
stick close to the president during his public appearances.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   In the Irish Republic, the mayor of Limerick said he's disturbed
by the Aug. 20 U.S. missile attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan, which
the president ordered to retaliate for the embassy bombings.
	   But Mayor Joe Harrington, a Socialist member of the Limerick
Council, said he won't try to score any political points when
Clinton arrives Saturday for a speech.
	   ``It is very hard for me then to turn on the television and see
missiles being fired into backward countries in Africa and Asia,''
said Harrington, who has visited the devastation of Omagh's bombing
site.
	   ``It's a double standard I couldn't possibly support.''

Hingis wins, then reflects on Swissair crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and updates with additional results; will be UPDATED
following Agassi-Raoux match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Winning was an afterthought for Martina Hingis
as she moved one step closer to successfully defending her U.S.
Open title Thursday. Her thoughts were dominated by the nature of
tragedy.
	   Hingis moved into the third round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 win over
Iva Majoli a few hours after hearing about the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 off the Canadian coast, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Hingis, a national heroine in her homeland of Switzerland, said
she knows many Swissair flight attendants.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' Hingis said. ``It's the airplane
I fly the most. When I heard I was like, `No way. Swissair seems
very safe.' It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up
there.''
	   Marc Rosset, the top Swiss male player, had been set to return
to Geneva on Flight 111 Wednesday night after losing in the first
round at the U.S. Open. Instead, he stayed an extra day to practice
with players still in the tourney.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you know you just realize that
for just changing your mind you are still alive,'' he said. ``I
think I am a little afraid, when you realize you were close to
dying.''
	   Joining Hingis in the third round were No. 2 Lindsay Davenport,
No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, No. 5 Venus Williams and No. 13
Amanda Coetzer.
	   Williams served at up to 117 mph (187 kmph) while winning 6-1,
6-3 over qualifier Anne Kremer, a Stanford student. Williams wore a
small black logo promoting the WTA Tour on the left shoulder strap
of her lime tennis dress, two days after being fined by the tour
for refusing to wear the logo.
	   Men's winners included No. 6 Greg Rusedski, No. 7 Alex Corretja,
No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman. Corretja completed a
first-round match that had been halted by rain Wednesday night,
while the others won second-round matches.
	   Hingis' match had been scheduled for Wednesday night, but was
wiped out by torrential rain and strong winds. She was inconsistent
in the first set, bringing back memories of her loss to Majoli in
the 1997 French Open final. That was the only Grand Slam title
Hingis failed to win last year.
	   ``I was very nervous in the beginning,'' Hingis said. ``It was
very strange coming from last night not having played and having to
play the next day.''
	   Majoli was the aggressor in the first set, moving Hingis from
side to side and slamming groundstrokes past the defending
champion. Hingis sighed loudly in exasperation as she netted a
forehand late in the first set, and her soft second serve was
pummeled by Majoli.
	   But, just as the green concrete of Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed to
be turning into the red clay of Roland Garros, a jet flew noisily
over the court to return the New York feeling and Hingis made it
clear this would be no Paris replay.
	   After needing 45 minutes to win the first set, Hingis swept
through the second set in 20 minutes. Just like the fly she swatted
away in her post-match news conference, Hingis had little trouble
with Majoli after the tiebreaker.
	   ``I loosened up and everything started to go in,'' Hingis said.
``I was strong and I didn't let her back in the game.''

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States has suspended dlrs 45
million in agricultural commodity credits to Russia because of
default on past loans, an official said Thursday.
	   The suspension happened after banks in Russia, enduring severe
economic problems, failed to pay dlrs 20.9 million due Aug. 20,
said Christopher Goldthwaite, manager of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's export credit programs.
	   ``We have not yet had contact with them about it. I'm hopeful it
can be cleared up quickly,'' Goldthwaite said.
	   The dlrs 45 million is part of Russia's overall credit line of
dlrs 95 million this fiscal year. The credit program, used to
finance purchase of U.S. farm commodities, represents only about 5
percent of total U.S. agricultural exports to Russia, Goldthwaite
said.

Flying and allergic to peanuts? Tell the ticket agent

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hold the peanuts. The government has ordered
airlines to establish ``peanut-free buffer zones'' when passengers
with peanut allergies are aboard.
	   The instructions have Southern farmers boiling and their
congressmen roasting U.S. Transportation Department phone lines.
	   But airline officials insist it won't be a problem. The skies
still will be filled with peanuts, they say, except for those
booked on one of the few flights carrying a peanut allergy
sufferer.
	   ``It is truly no big deal,'' said Ed Stewart, a spokesman for
Southwest Airlines, which prides itself on low fares and passes out
peanuts instead of meals. ``Some people are upset by what came out
of the government, but in terms of our operation, we'll just go
with the flow.''
	   The Transportation Department's order last month required
airlines to set aside at least three rows where peanuts cannot be

Venus patches up problems with WTA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and updates with additional details &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams' most pressing problem at the
U.S. Open Thursday had more to do with her patch than her match.
	   After paying a dlrs 100 fine for failing to wear a WTA patch in
her opening match, Williams cut off the controversy by attaching
the tiny rectangular logo to the shoulder strap of her lime-green
outfit for her 6-1, 6-3 victory against qualifier Anne Kremer.
	   Why the change?
	   ``Because generally, I usually appear in the patch when I
play,'' Williams said.
	   So why did she deviate from that policy, first at the Lipton
Championships in March, then at the Open, causing the patch flap in
the first place?
	   ``Deviation is common among humans,'' she said.
	   Williams faced a dlrs 500 fine if she did not display the patch
Thursday. The fines would have escalated to dlrs 25,000 had she
continued to pass on the patch.
	   Williams, seeded fifth in the tournament, shrugged off the flap,
saying it was not a distraction to her.
	   ``It just seems I am always in the middle of controversy, so it
is nothing new for me,'' she said. ``I am separate from those type
of things. Generally, I do my practicing and I play tennis.''
	   WTA rules require players to wear the logo as part of its
sponsorship contract. Only Nike athletes are exempted from the
patch requirement because of a company policy that predates the WTA
deal.
	   Reebok, which has a multimillion dollar sneaker and clothing
contract with Williams, designed a seven outfit wardrobe for her at
the Open and defended the logo-less look, arguing that wearing one
would violate the company's agreement with her.
	   Williams shrugged off speculation that her stand was part of a
turf war between the two sporting goods companies, saying only, ``I
wasn't sending any messages.''
	   Instead, the 18-year-old may have been sending a message to the
rest of the field at the Open.
	   She dominated against Kremer, winning the match's first seven
points and seemed equally comfortable coming to the net or booming
serves that zoomed at speeds up to 117 mph from the baseline. She
overpowered Kremer on some points, then beat her on soft, touch
shots at other moments.
	   When Kremer, a junior at Stanford, got Williams running, it was
like she was facing a windmill at the other side of the net.
Williams looked like a perpetual motion machine, her legs, arms and
beaded hair flying in every direction. The mostly white beads
included some green ones that matched her outfit.
	   ``Everything is going very well,'' Williams said. ``I think
everything is solid. I am trying to work more on serve and volley,
and some coming into the net more. I would definitely like to play
better.''
	   It is hard to imagine any improvement. She needed only 58
minutes to beat Kremer, completing a thorough, wipeout that
sometimes seemed too easy.
	   ``My matches haven't been too tough so far,'' she said. ``I
think the tougher your match, maybe the better you play. I just
want to make sure that I'm doing what I should on every point and
not losing any focus.''
	   So far, so good. And that's with the WTA logo patch or without
it.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks extended their losses in skittish trading
Thursday, with the Dow industrials briefly sinking more than 200
points late in the day before a closing-minutes comeback that
trimmed the losses by half.
	   The downturn came after shares tumbled in Europe and followed a
mixed day in Asian markets. An additional unsettling factor was a
sharp drop in the dollar Thursday morning in global currency
trading.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 150.87 in the opening
minutes of trading, then bounced back to recover much of that
ground. But it suddenly sank to a loss of 203.91 points as it
prepared to enter the final half hour of trading before once more
bouncing off its lows. At the finish of another turbulent day, in
which it never was in positive territory, the Dow was off 100.15 to
close at 7,682.22.

Hurricane Isis dissipates, but brings dangerous rains

	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ Hurricane Isis slammed into the
Mexican mainland with 75 mph (120 kph) winds on Thursday but
rapidly dissipated into a rainstorm heading for the U.S. border.
	   The storm blasted out windows, knocked out electricity and
littered this coastal city with downed street posts and tree limbs.
The coastal highway in the southern part of Sinaloa state was cut,
state authorities said.
	   Some rivers rose dangerously high on Thursday and authorities
warned residents in the Rio Fuerte region, just north of Los
Mochis, to stand by for possible evacuation.
	   At least two people were killed and several more were missing
after Isis clipped the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula then marched across the Gulf of California to the Mexican
mainland.
	   Sinaloa Gov. Renato Vega Alvarado toured affected areas on
Thursday and said a man drowned in the settlement of Los Chinitos
just south of Guasave.
	   Local authorities in Leyva said that a family was reporting
missing, but state civil protection officials said they could not
confirm that report.
	   Los Mochis Mayor Francis Lopez Brito said one person was
seriously injured by a jolt from a downed power cable.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said that by 1600
GMT, Isis had dissipated into a rainstorm that could dump 4 to 8
inches (10 to 20 cms) of rain in some areas.
	   The storm was speeding northeast at 20 to 25 mph (32 to 40 kph)
and was located about 270 miles (430 kms) south-southwest of El
Paso.
	   A few cars send up a muddy spray as they battled through
bumper-high waters Thursday morning in the streets of this city of
300,000.
	   Carlos Alberto Villegas used a bucket inside his concrete-block
house in a seemingly vain attempt to bail out the lake of water
that stood just below seat level of his new sofa.
	   ``It came in so very strong that the house just began to
flood,'' he said.
	   Isis-spawned rains further south flooded neighborhoods and
shoved yachts onto rocks in the port city of Mazatlan and washed a
man down a swollen river in Jalisco state.
	   On Wednesday, Isis belted the tip of the Baja California
peninsula, cutting phones and electricity, forcing thousands of
residents from their homes and trapping tourists in storm-battered
seaside hotels.
	   Officials said one woman was killed and her husband was missing
after they tried to cross a stream in Los Cabos.
	   Officials cancelled tropical storm warnings, but many ports
along Mexico's Pacific coast remained closed Thursday.
	   With Isis toward the west and Hurricane Earl in the east near
the Florida coast, heavy rains fell in much of Mexico.
	   In the southern state of Chiapas, more than 300 families were
evacuated due to flooding in the coastal municipalities of
Mapastepec and Acapetuhua.
	   Heavy rains also forced hundreds of people to seek shelter in
the municipalities of Jiutepec and Yautepec in the central state of
Morelos.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss tennis star Marc Rosset said
Thursday he felt like he had been reborn after narrowly missing
death on the fated Swissair flight SR111.
	   Rosset, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, and his coach Pierre
Simsolo were booked on Wednesday's flight from New York to Geneva
after Rosset was eliminated from the U.S. Open tournament.
	   ``But when we were in the hotel, Marc said he wanted to stay an
extra day after all,'' his coach Pierre Simsolo said. ``I will be
eternally grateful to him,'' he told the Swiss sports agency.
	   Rosset said he heard the news while dining with friends and
watched the unfolding drama on television. He said he was unsure
now when he would return to Switzerland.
	   ``It's almost like a second birth, a second life, and I want to
make the most of it,'' Rosset told Swiss television.
	   But he said he didn't feel good about the situation, especially
because of the suffering of all the relatives of the 229 people who
died.
	   ``It's a bizarre feeling, knowing that you might have been
killed,'' said the tennis player.
	   He said he didn't know when he would now return to Switzerland
as he was too scared to get on a plane.
	   Rosset is currently ranked 47th in the world, having suffered
from poor performance in recent months.

Researchers find new evidence of water on the moon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As much as 10 billion metric tons of water may
be frozen in soil near the moon's poles, according to new data from
a spacecraft orbiting the moon.
	   If that much water is there _ more than 10 times previous
estimates _ it might one day be enough to build a moon village or
to fuel rocket ships cruising even deeper into space, experts say.
	   ``Our data is very clear _ there is an abundance of hydrogen at
both lunar poles, and we interpret that to mean there is water
there,'' said Alan Binder, chief scientist for the Lunar Prospector
spacecraft now orbiting the moon. ``There is at least one billion
tons of water, but there could be as much as 10 billion tons.''
	   That, said Binder, is enough to build a colony on the moon's
surface and to operate a rocket service station for journeys
beyond.
	   ``We knew from the Apollo missions that we could go to the moon
and build a base there, but we would have to take our water and
fuel with us,'' Binder said.
	   The deposits of water or hydrogen, he said, are ``an enabling
resource. You could build a colony without it, but this really
makes it a lot simpler.''
	   In addition to sustaining life in such a colony, water also can
be used for rocket fuel by breaking it into its constituent
chemicals _ hydrogen and oxygen. Propellant for the main engines on
the space shuttle, for instance, is hydrogen and oxygen.
	   Paul Spudis, a researcher at the Lunar and Planetary Institute
in Houston, called the discovery significant.
	   ``We've debated for 30 years whether or not there is ice on the
moon, and now this shows there is,'' Spudis said.
	   Spudis was on the science team of an earlier lunar mission _ the
Clementine spacecraft _ that found radar indications of water on
the lunar south pole. Now, he said, two different research methods
have confirmed the presence of lunar water.
	   ``This makes colonizing the moon a lot more attractive,'' said
Ed Weiler, a space scientist at NASA. ``I think before we colonize
to Mars we need to colonize the moon for practice, so from that
perspective this is a major discovery.''
	   Binder, head of the U.S. Lunar Research Institute, and
researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, both in
California, report their findings from the Lunar Prospector
spacecraft Friday in the U.S. journal Science.
	   Lunar Prospector was launched in January and has spent months
orbiting the moon, gathering signals with four instruments.
	   The craft found water or hydrogen deposits with a device that
measures the energy, or speed, of neutrons. Neutrons form when
radiation from the sun strikes the moon's surface. They bounce
around in the soil, then out into space. The energy or speed of the
neutrons is affected by the chemistry of the soil.
	   By measuring the ratio of intermediate-speed neutrons to the
fast and slow neutrons, the researchers were able to determine that
hydrogen is present in the lunar soil, Binder said.
	   Ice is signaled at both poles, but about 50 percent more appears
to be around the north pole, the researchers said.
	   Binder and other researchers said the most logical form for that
hydrogen to take is as a constituent of water. And since the moon
is so cold, the water is certain to be frozen solid.
	   All the deposits are in patches within craters that never see
sunlight. Temperatures there are constantly about minus-250 degrees
F (minus-156C), said Binder. This keeps the ice in place
``virtually forever,'' he said. The data suggest the ice is in
layers, covered with up to 18 inches of soil.
	   Even more ice could be in layers below two feet of soil, said
Binder.
	   Harvesting the ice would involve digging it up and thawing it,
using solar reflectors. A chemical process then could separate
hydrogen and oxygen.
	   ``The only trick would be to build equipment that could work in
those extremely cold temperatures,'' said Binder.
	   Comets smashing into the moon over millions of years probably
deposited the water, Binder and Spudis said.
	   An impacting comet would spray water vapor around the moon,
Spudis said. Some of that vapor could get trapped in deep shaded
areas _ cold traps.
	   ``Once it's trapped there, it could be stuck for two or three
billion years,'' he said.

 &UR; Two professors among victims in Swissair crash &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dr. Jonathan Mann, who became known as the
outspoken head of the World Health Organization's AIDS program when
the disease exploded in the 1980s, and his wife Mary Lou
Clements-Mann _ another prominent AIDS researcher_ were among the
229 people killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111.
	   The deaths were described by colleagues Thursday as a blow to
the world's medical and scientific community.
	   ``I don't know of two people in the AIDS world who had more
friends worldwide,'' said Dr. Richard Marlink, director of the
Harvard AIDS Institute at the School of Public Health. ``They were
warm and caring people totally committed to their work in public
health.''
	   Mann, 51, was dean of Allegheny University of the Health
Sciences' School of Public Health in Philadelphia, formerly known
as Hahnemann University Hospital.
	   He resigned in December from Harvard University's School of
Public Health, where he was a professor of international health and
epidemiology. He was also director of Harvard's Francois-Xavier
Bagnoud Center of Health and Human Rights.
	   The Boston native headed the WHO's AIDS program from 1986 until
1990, when he resigned amid a bitter clash with Hiroshi Nakajima,
then WHO's director-general. Nakajima's attitude ``completely
paralyzed our efforts,'' Mann said then.
	   U.S. Health Secretary Donna Shalala said he would be missed.
	   ``More than any other individual, Jonathan Mann argued for a
coordinated international effort on AIDS, '' she said. ``It was
through his obstinence and brilliance that the world finally began
that effort.''
	   His wife of two years, a medical doctor, was the founder of the
Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University, where
she also earned her masters in public health.
	   Clements-Mann, 51, also was a professor at Johns Hopkins School
of International Health and was influential in developing vaccines
for Influenza, Roto virus and Hepatitis B.
	   The couple lived in a suburb of Baltimore, where Johns Hopkins
is based.
	   Mann was remembered as a visionary who accurately predicted in
the 1980s that AIDS would reach epidemic levels in Africa and other
parts of the developing world _ but his insistence that fighting
AIDS required adopting a wider social agenda stirred controversy.
	   In his view, distributing condoms and educating people about
safer sex were not enough. Stopping the epidemic meant wholesale
improvements in women's rights and leveling economic and social
inequity around the world.
	   ``Take a country with hardly any AIDS today and you can predict
that, within 10 years, the virus will more likely affect those
people who are discriminated against because of gender, religion,
race or sexual preference,'' he said at the international AIDS
meeting in Amsterdam in 1992, which he chaired.
	   The Manns, who were married in December 1996, were en route to a
conference in Geneva where Mrs. Mann was scheduled to speak, said
her colleague, Dr. Donald S. Burke.
	   ``Mary-Lou was a demanding collaborator and supervisor, and she
accepted nothing less than excellence,'' said Burke, who now
directs the Center for Immunization Research. ``And as a result her
work was uniformly world-class.''
	   ``I would say these are two extraordinarily happy people,'' said
Dr. D.A. Henderson, a professor at the Hopkins school of public
health. ``I don't think I've seen many people who were as much in
love as those two.''
	   Henderson, who led the team that finally eradicated smallpox in
the mid-1970s, said Mrs. Mann worked on wiping out the disease in
India, which Henderson called ``one of the last strongholds'' of
the disease.
	   The couple had no children, although Jonathan Mann had children
from a previous marriage.
	   Henderson said the two died at ``the worst possible time _ just
as they were really just reaching their peak in productivity and
influence and respect. They had a lot to contribute.''

Rebels kill 50 Iraqi soldiers in clashes in southern marshes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group said Thursday that
its fighters battled government soldiers in southern marshes this
week, killing 50 troops.
	   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shiite
rebel group based in Iran, did not say if its forces suffered any
casualties.
	   The group said that on Saturday, Iraqi soldiers launched a
three-pronged attack against rebel positions in marshes near the
southern town of Nasiriya, 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of
Baghdad.
	   Iraq expanded the attack Sunday to include areas between
Nasiriya and al-Amara, some 140 kilometers (90 miles) northeast,
the group said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo.
	   Rebel forces ``managed to contain and check the attacks,
inflicting heavy losses,'' the statement said.
	   It said some 50 soldiers were killed and two T-62 tanks were
destroyed.
	   The group said Iraqi army shelling during the fighting killed
and wounded civilians living in the marshes. It gave no figures.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and there was no
immediate information from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   Tens of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge in the
marshes after soldiers loyal to President Saddam Hussein crushed a
Shiite rebellion in the south following Iraq's defeat in the 1991
Gulf War.
	   Iraqi troops have mounted numerous campaigns against the Shiites
hiding in the marshes.

Change of plans averts tennis tragedy in Swissair crash

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Intuition and an invitation prevented the flight
of Swissair 111 from becoming a tragedy for tennis.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's top male player and the 1992 Olympic
gold medalist, was scheduled to fly Wednesday night's New
York-to-Geneva flight, but decided at the last minute to stay in
New York one more night after losing at the U.S. Open.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you realize that for just
changing your mind you are still alive,'' Rosset said Thursday.
	   The Swissair jet crashed into the water off the Canadian coast,
killing all aboard.
	   Jacques Hermenjat, tournament director of the Swiss Open,
usually returns home Wednesday night after attending meetings held
in conjunction with the U.S. Open. This year, however, he booked
Flight 111 a day later after being invited to lunch Thursday by the
U.S. Tennis Association.
	   ``Now when people say they are glad to see me, I am real happy
to say I'm glad to be here,'' Hermenjat said.
	   Both Rosset and Hermenjat said they understood that Pierre
Babolat, president of a Lyon, France-based tennis equipment
company, was on the flight. Reports that a handful of other players
and coaches had booked the Wednesday night Swissair flight but not
taken it could not be confirmed.
	   Rosset said he learned of the crash when friends in New York
called his hotel and told him to turn on the television. As soon as
he saw the news, ``I called my coach (Pierre Simsolo) and said we
were lucky,'' he said.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' said Martina Hingis, the world's
top-ranked woman from Switzerland. ``It's the airplane I fly the
most. It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up there.
	   ``In a car, if somebody bumps into you, it's different. When I
heard, I was like, `No way. Swissair seems very safe.' ''
	   Once ranked as high as ninth in the world, Rosset has not won a
set since Wimbledon, let alone a match. He lost his first-round
U.S. Open match to Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3),
7-5 on Monday.
	   On Tuesday, he made reservations for Wednesday's Flight 111. But
after practicing Wednesday, Rosset postponed his flight until
Thursday.
	   ``We decided to try to stay here for practice because here you
can practice with such good players,'' he said. Rosset told the
Zurich newspaper Tages-Anzeiger: ``I believe in destiny. I don't
think it was time to go yet.''
	   Rosset said that after spending the night watching news reports
from New York, Geneva and the crash site near Peggy's Cove, Nova
Scotia, he called his parents in Switzerland, who knew about the
crash and had been trying to call him.
	   ``They didn't get my number in the hotel, so they were a little
worried,'' he said. ``Then they called a few persons who know my
numbers and then I called them, so they were happy.''

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss tennis star Marc Rosset said
Thursday he felt like he had been reborn after narrowly missing
death on the fated Swissair flight SR111.
	   Rosset, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, and his coach Pierre
Simsolo were booked on Wednesday's flight from New York to Geneva
after Rosset was eliminated from the U.S. Open tournament.
	   ``But when we were in the hotel, Marc said he wanted to stay an
extra day after all,'' his coach Pierre Simsolo said. ``I will be
eternally grateful to him,'' he told the Swiss sports agency.
	   Rosset said he heard the news while dining with friends and
watched the unfolding drama on television. He said he was unsure
now when he would return to Switzerland.
	   ``It's almost like a second birth, a second life, and I want to
make the most of it,'' Rosset told Swiss television.
	   But he said he didn't feel good about the situation, especially
because of the suffering of all the relatives of the 229 people who
died.
	   ``It's a bizarre feeling, knowing that you might have been
killed,'' said the tennis player.
	   He said he didn't know when he would now return to Switzerland
as he was too scared to get on a plane.
	   Rosset is currently ranked 47th in the world, having suffered
from poor performance in recent months.

Salvage teams pump sulfuric acid from damaged ship into ocean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Salvage teams pumped sulfuric acid from
a damaged ship in southern Brazil on Thursday, racing to prevent
tons of fuel oil from being dumped into the ocean before the vessel
corrodes and causing an environmental catastrophe.
	   The Maltese-registered ship ``Bahamas'' arrived earlier this
week in the port of Rio Grande do Sul, 1,000 kms (600 miles)
southwest of Sao Paulo.
	   When water entered the ship's holds, it made the acid ``much
more corrosive than it normally is,'' said Leo Antonio Bulling of
the Rio Grande do Sul state's Civil Defense Department. He said it
was not known how the water entered the ship.
	   To avoid the total collapse of the ship's structure by
corrosion, ``which would cause more than 100 tons of fuel oil to
spill into the ocean, we decided to pump the acid and dump it into
the water because this would cause less damage to the
environment,'' Bulling said.
	   He said the water had to be dumped into the water because there
were no containers available that could withstand the corrosion.
	   As of Thursday afternoon, just one ton of sulfuric acid, of a
total of 12 tons, had been pumped from the ship. Bulling said it
would take another three or four days before the remaining acid was
withdrawn.
	   Fuel oil is also being pumped from the ship, but he could not
specify how much had already been withdrawn.
	   The sulfuric acid was imported from the Netherlands by Brazilian
industries, mostly fertilizer manufacturers, Bulling said.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ At the close of its 12th summit of
heads of state, the Nonaligned Movement on Thursday:
	   -Criticized the ``unjustified stockpiling and development of
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a rampant
traffic in armaments.''
	   _Expressed ``deep concern'' about Washington's ``unilateral and
unwarranted'' cruise missile attack last month against a factory in
Sudan. The attack was a counterstrike for the bombings of American
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The Movement in a final
document called for Washington to compensate Sudan for damage
caused by the attack.
	   _Complained that the globalization of the world economy, aided
by the communications revolution, had increased marginalization of
developing countries.
	   _Called for the United Nations to convene an international
conference on terrorism.
	   _Urged developed nations to take further steps to cutting the
debt burden of the world's poorest nations.
	   _Held the leadership of the former Angolan rebel group UNITA and
its leader Jonas Savimbi ``personally accountable'' for the
unravelling of the peace process in Angola.
	   _Insisted the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba be lifted.
	   _Condemned Israel for creating ``obstacles to peace'' contrary
to ``the rights of the Palestinian people.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The crash of SR111 off the Canadian coast shook
Swissair's reputation as one of the world's safest airlines, but
customers said Thursday they would remain faithful.
	   The crash that killed 229 persons, including 137 Americans, was
far and away the worst disaster to strike the airline, whose
previous high death toll was 80 in 1963.
	   An international spokesman for the airline industry, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Swissair continues to have one the
world's best safety records.
	   ``We have always had to plan for such an instance, but we
thought it would never happen to us,'' said Philippe Bruggisser,
chief of the parent company SAir.
	   He told a late night news conference in Zurich that the company
would pay dlrs 20,000 in immediate cash help to relatives of
victims if they needed financial aid. This is in addition to
compensatory damages provided for under international law.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ An earthquake rocked central-northern

No damage or casualties were reported.
	   The quake, at 13.38 (17.38 GMT), had a preliminary magnitude of
6.5, said the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado. Its
epicenter was 45 miles north-northwest of La Serena, 300 miles (500
kms) north of Santiago.
	   The quake was barely felt in the capital.
	   Police and the Emergency Office said no victims or damage were
reported in the area affected, a stretch of some 850 kilometers
(530 miles) of Chile*s narrow territory.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Numb shock. Hysteria. Silence. Uncontrolled
talking.
	   Specially trained advisors and priests at Geneva airport
struggled Thursday to cope with the array of differing emotions
unleashed among victims of the Swissair air disaster.
	   The airline said by the end of the day it had counseled more
than 120 people at its airport crises centers, and had received
more than 10,000 calls to its special hot lines.
	   An impromptu memorial service was held in a downtown Geneva
church late Thursday, and a specially chartered Airbus was due to
leave Zurich and Geneva Friday with up to 150 family members of
victims of the crash.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, the head of the parent company SAir Group,
said Swissair would pay out dlrs 20,000 in immediate financial aid
to families who requested it. This was in addition to any
compensation due under international law.
	   Some 229 people died when Flight SR111 from New York crashed off
the coast of Canada. There were 137 American victims and 41 Swiss
among the dead.
	   A tall blond woman in her early 30s arrived crying with an older
woman and two men shortly after the midmorning scheduled arrival
time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They wandered aimlessly for a few minutes until they were
beckoned by airport security staff to a special area where they
were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking,'' said Pastor
Jim Longhurst of the relatives. ``There's shock over the pain and
devastation.''
	   Longhurst, Bible in his hip pocket, said he had special
identification with relatives of the victims.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, N.Y., who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join clergy and psychologists _ in
consoling relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the
crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   ``We're here to give emotional first aid,'' was how one
counselor, Andreas Goerlich, described his task.
	   Goerlich, who acts as priest at Zurich airport, said the most
important task of carers was to allow relatives to give free reign
to their grief.
	   Some needed to sob their hearts out. Others had to mourn in
silence and didn't want to communicate with anyone, he said. Others
had the need to relate over and over again details of last contacts
with the dead or of future plans, now thwarted.
	   Goerlich is part of a permanent team which was set up last year
to help families and survivors of a massacre of tourists by Islamic
extremists in Luxor, Egypt. Thirty-six of the 58 victims were
Swiss.
	   In addition to immediate counseling, relatives would need
long-term help to come to terms with their loss, he said.
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, turning to the
white-bearded man by her side and smothering him in kisses.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The House of Lords rushed through a debate on
anti-terrorist legislation Thursday, with some members complaining
of haste but most joining in the feeling that something must be
done after bombers killed 28 people in a Northern Ireland town.
	   Similar measures became law in Ireland Thursday night after an
emergency session of the Irish parliament.

Precedes OMAGH, Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Clinton points to Northern Ireland as example for others &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's peace was
obtained through the courage and determination of its people, an
example to war-torn peoples the world over, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Thursday.
	   Capping an emotional day of celebrating the Good Friday peace
his intervention helped mold in April, Clinton said he came to
battle-scarred Armagh ``to thank you _ to thank you for the peace,
to thank you for strengthening the hand of everyone, everyone
anywhere who is working to make the world a little better.''
	   ``When I go now to other troubled places, I point to you as
proof that peace is not an idle daydream, for your peace is real,
and it resonates around the world.''
	   Earlier, in a gymnasium hushed in grief at Omagh, Clinton
consoled families torn by the worst terror attack of Northern
Ireland's three decades of agony. There, he declared it is ``high
time to stop yesterday's nightmares from killing tomorrow's
dreams.''
	   The president also walked down Omagh's bomb-shattered Market
Street and gazed at scenes of wreckage where 28 people _ mostly
women and children _ died and hundreds were wounded in an Aug. 15
attack blamed on Irish Republican Army extremists trying to wreck
the peace agreement.
	   ``The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the `Troubles,'''
Clinton said in a speech in Belfast to members of the legislative
Assembly born from the agreement. ``It was the opening shot of a
vicious attack on the peace.''
	   But Clinton expressed optimism that Northern Ireland had turned
from its bloody past toward a hopeful future. ``Do not let it slip
away,'' he urged. ``It will not come again in our lifetime.''
	   Arriving in Northern Ireland from a two-day Moscow visit,
Clinton was greeted by friendly crowds _ although not the massive
turnout he encountered on his first visit three years ago. The
crowd at the evening address in Armagh was far less than half the
25,000 whom organizers had talked about.
	   Clinton said the Omagh attack had backfired. ``Out of the
unimaginably horrible agony of Omagh, the people said it is high
time somebody told these people that we are through with hate,
through with war, through with destruction. It will not work
anymore.''
	   The audience cheered.
	   ``Now when I meet Palestinians and Israelis, I can say: Don't
tell me impossible _ look at Northern Ireland,'' Clinton said, to
more applause.
	   ``When I meet Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, I can say: Don't
tell me it's impossible _ look at Northern Ireland.
	   ``When I hear what the Indians and Pakistanis say about each
other over their religious differences, I say: Don't tell me you
can't work this out _ look at Northern Ireland.
	   ``Centuries were put to bed, and a new day has dawned.''
	   The president's motorcade took him past rolling green hills of
grazing sheep and cows, a bucolic contrast to the suspense-filled
Kremlin halls where he had worried over Russia's economic and
political turmoil. In Omagh, there was a festive mood as thousands
pressed to see the president after he visited the bomb site. He
shook hundreds of hands.
	   Security was intense. Streets were barricaded and store doors
were sealed after police checks. Secret Service Director Lew
Merletti kept vigil over Clinton and agents nearly surrounded him.
	   The mood was solemn earlier at the community center where
Clinton met with about 500 relatives of the victims of the bombing.
They sat at tables spread across the room and fell silent when
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke.
	   Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and Blair and his wife, Cherie,
went out into the crowd, stopping at each table with words of
solace and encouragement, aides said. The Clintons stopped first at
the table of 14-year-old Claire Gallagher who was blinded in the
bombing. Her mother, a radiologist, was on duty at the hospital
when her daughter was brought in.
	   Her dad, Seamus, said Clinton told her ``to keep up her good
work on the piano, to keep fighting, to keep her chin up. Mrs.
Clinton actually said to Claire that if she ever came to America
that she would get her to come play the piano for her.''
	   Clinton has made Northern Ireland peacemaking a priority of his
foreign policy, and Blair said, ``There is no president of the
United States of America who has done more for peace in Northern
Ireland.''

Change of plans averts tennis tragedy in Swissair crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Intuition and an invitation prevented the flight
of Swissair 111 from becoming a tragedy for tennis.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's top male player and the 1992 Olympic
gold medalist, was scheduled to fly Wednesday night's New
York-to-Geneva flight, but decided at the last minute to stay in
New York one more night after losing at the U.S. Open.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you realize that for just
changing your mind you are still alive,'' Rosset said Thursday.
	   The Swissair jet crashed into the water off the Canadian coast,
killing all aboard.
	   Jacques Hermenjat, tournament director of the Swiss Open,
usually returns home Wednesday night after attending meetings held
in conjunction with the U.S. Open. This year, however, he booked
Flight 111 a day later after being invited to lunch Thursday by the
U.S. Tennis Association.
	   ``Now when people say they are glad to see me, I am real happy
to say I'm glad to be here,'' Hermenjat said.
	   Both Rosset and Hermenjat said they understood that Pierre
Babolat, president of a Lyon, France-based tennis equipment
company, was on the flight. Reports that a handful of other players
and coaches had booked the Wednesday night Swissair flight but not
taken it could not be confirmed.
	   Rosset said he learned of the crash when friends in New York
called his hotel and told him to turn on the television. As soon as
he saw the news, ``I called my coach (Pierre Simsolo) and said we
were lucky,'' he said.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' said Martina Hingis, the world's
top-ranked woman from Switzerland. ``It's the airplane I fly the
most. It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up there.
	   ``In a car, if somebody bumps into you, it's different. When I
heard, I was like, `No way. Swissair seems very safe.' ''
	   Throughout the day, players said the crash reminded them that
the life of a globe-hopping athlete has many risks.
	   ``That's certianly one of your biggest fears, to say goodbye to
your loved ones and not return,'' Andre Agassi said. ``When you
travel the world like we do, you're bound to have your share of
travel difficulties. But you pray to God you don't have to go
through something like that.''
	   Once ranked as high as ninth in the world, Rosset has not won a
set since Wimbledon, let alone a match. He lost his first-round
U.S. Open match to Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3),
7-5 on Monday.
	   On Tuesday, he made reservations for Wednesday's Flight 111. But
after practicing Wednesday, Rosset postponed his flight until
Thursday.
	   ``We decided to try to stay here for practice because here you
can practice with such good players,'' he said. Rosset told the
Zurich newspaper Tages-Anzeiger: ``I believe in destiny. I don't
think it was time to go yet.''
	   Rosset said that after spending the night watching news reports
from New York, Geneva and the crash site near Peggy's Cove, Nova
Scotia, he called his parents in Switzerland, who knew about the
crash and had been trying to call him.
	   ``They didn't get my number in the hotel, so they were a little
worried,'' he said. ``Then they called a few persons who know my
numbers and then I called them, so they were happy.''

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Numb shock. Hysteria. Silence. Uncontrolled
talking.
	   Specially trained advisers and priests at Geneva airport
struggled Thursday to cope with the array of differing emotions
unleashed among victims of the Swissair air disaster.
	   The airline said it had counseled more than 120 people at its
airport crises centers, and had received more than 10,000 calls to
its special hot lines.
	   An impromptu memorial service was held in a downtown Geneva
church late Thursday, and a specially chartered Airbus was due to
leave Zurich and Geneva on Friday with up to 150 family members of
crash victims.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, the head of the parent company SAir Group,
said Swissair would pay out dlrs 20,000 in immediate financial aid
to families who requested it. This was in addition to any
compensation due under international law.
	   Some 229 people died when Flight SR111 from New York crashed off
the coast of Canada. There were 137 American victims and 41 Swiss
among the dead.
	   A tall blond woman in her early 30s arrived crying with an older
woman and two men shortly after the midmorning scheduled arrival
time of flight SR111 from New York.
	   She turned sobbing and hugged the older woman as the older man
cried. They wandered aimlessly for a few minutes until they were
beckoned by airport security staff to a special area where they
were being met by specialists in dealing with grief.
	   ``Right now there is no logic in their thinking,'' said Pastor
Jim Longhurst. ``There's shock over the pain and devastation.''
	   Longhurst, holding a Bible in his hip pocket, said he had
special identification with relatives of the victims.
	   ``My parents have taken that flight before. I can see their
faces on that plane,'' said Longhurst, of Albany, New York, who has
lived in the Geneva area for four years.
	   Longhurst, dressed in slacks and button-down shirt, raced to
Geneva's Cointrin Airport to join clergy and psychologists _ in
consoling relatives and friends of the 229 people who died in the
crash off Nova Scotia, Canada.
	   ``We're here to give emotional first aid,'' was how one
counselor, Andreas Goerlich, described his task.
	   Goerlich, who acts as priest at Zurich airport, said the most
important task of the counselors was to allow relatives to grieve.
	   Some needed to sob their hearts out. Others had to mourn in
silence and didn't want to communicate with anyone, he said. Others
had the need to relate over and over again details of last contacts
with the dead or of future plans.
	   Goerlich is part of a permanent team established last year to
help families and survivors of a massacre of tourists by Islamic
extremists in Luxor, Egypt. Thirty-six of the 58 victims were
Swiss.
	   In addition to immediate counseling, relatives would need
long-term help to come to terms with their loss, he said.
	   A tall, blond Swiss woman in her early 20s who gave her name
only as Nathalie appeared shaken, but relieved in the reception
area. She had just found her father, who had flown in from New York
on a different flight.
	   ``I woke up this morning, and I forgot his flight number,'' she
said. ``I came straight over in a taxi.''
	   ``I'm so happy you're here, Papa,'' she said, smothering the
white-bearded man in kisses.

Chile protests rejection of extradition of fugitive by Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The government on Thursday temporarily
withdrew its ambassador to Switzerland, angered because the
European nation refused to extradite a leftist guerrilla convicted
in the assassination of a police officer here.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza also announced a formal
protest will be filed with the Swiss government.
	   The fugitive, Patricio Ortiz, was allowed to stay in Switzerland
for now, but his appeal for political asylum was turned down, a
decision valid for 12 months but that may be changed.
	   Insulza said ambassador Hugo Miranda, who was supposed to return
to Bern on Thursday, was ordered to remain in Santiago ``until a
decision to the contrary is made'' by the government.
	   Ortiz was one of four urban guerrillas who staged a daring
helicopter escape from a maximum security prison in Santiago on
Dec. 31, 1996, and then flew to Switzerland, where he was traced by
Chilean authorities. The whereabouts of the other remain unknown.
	   The Swiss Office for Refugees said Ortiz*safety could not be
guaranteed if he was extradited to Chile, an argument Insulza
angrily rejected.
	   Ortiz, 34, was to be released by Swiss federal police, who had
been holding him, while a decision was made on the Chilean request
for his extradition.
	   Ortiz and the other three escapees were members of the Manuel
Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a pro-communist guerrilla gang organized
in the early 80s to fight the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.

Treasury department rejects U.S. business trip to Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The U.S. government on Thursday rejected
plans for U.S. business executives to visit Cuba next week as part
of a business summit, saying it violated U.S. interests. The
American conference organizer said permission was denied after he
refused to promise to criticize the Cuban government.
	   Alamar Associates, a Washington-based business consultancy, was
planning to lead a business group on an overnight visit to Cuba
beginning Sept. 11. The visit was part of a three-day summit
between the executives and Cuban officials beginning in the Mexican
resort city of Cancun on Wednesday. About 60 people had signed up,
said Alamar's president, Kirby Jones.
	   Alamar was charging dlrs 3,250 per person to participate in the
summit, which it promoted as an ``opportunity to see first hand the
reality of the Cuban economy and the business potential for their
companies.''
	   In publicizing the summit, Alamar said it was making ``every
arrangement in full compliance with U.S. law.'' The U.S. trade
embargo bars Americans from spending in money in Cuba, but doesn't
prohibit visits outright. Alamar said the Cuban government would
pay all the executives' costs in Cuba _ as it did during a one-day
summit organized by Alamar in March.
	   A leading Cuban exile group, the Miami-based Cuban American
National Foundation, had denounced the summit plans, accusing
Alamar of exploiting loopholes in the embargo.
	   The Treasury Department rejected Alamar's Cuba visit after
consulting with the State Department because the ``proposed
activity is inconsistent with current U.S. policy aimed at bringing
about a peaceful transition to democracy,'' a Treasury official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A State Department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the trip was rejected because it ``seems to be more
support for the Cuban government than anything else.''
	   Jones, Alamar's president, said he had met with Treasury
officials in June who had told him he was in ``full compliance''
with U.S. regulations.
	   But Jones said that in August he met with Michael Ranneberger,
Cuban desk officer at the State Department, who asked him to set up
meetings with Cuban dissidents.
	   Jones said that Ranneberger also asked whether the executives
would be willing to make critical comments about Cuba to the media
and whether he would hold a news conference after the trip to say
he was in Cuba ``to discuss business, but `only with a freely
democratically elected government.' '' Jones said he refused those
conditions.
	   Jones described himself as being ``at the whim of government
bureaucrats, who virtually create laws apparently whenever and
however they want.''
	   Ranneberger did not immediately return a telephone call placed
to his office in Washington on Thursday.
	   Top Cuban government officials were expected to participate in
the summit, including National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon
and Vice President Carlos Lage.
	   Jones said Alamar was considering holding the entire summit in
Cancun. He said he would see first if Cuban officials could travel
there and whether there was still sufficient interest among the
executives who had signed up.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Winning was an afterthought for Martina Hingis
as she moved one step closer to defending her U.S. Open title
Thursday. Her thoughts were dominated by the nature of tragedy.
	   Hingis moved into the third round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 victory
over Iva Majoli a few hours after hearing about the crash of
Swissair Flight 111 off the Canadian coast, killing all 229 people
aboard.
	   Hingis, a national heroine in her homeland of Switzerland, said
she knows many Swissair flight attendants.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' Hingis said. ``It's the airplane
I fly the most. When I heard I was like, `No way. Swissair seems
very safe.' It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up
there.''
	   Marc Rosset, the top Swiss male player, had been set to return
to Geneva on Flight 111 Wednesday night after losing in the first
round in the U.S. Open. Instead, he stayed an extra day to practice
with players still in the tourney.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you know you just realize that
for just changing your mind you are still alive,'' he said. ``I
think I am a little afraid, when you realize you were close to
dying.''
	   Joining Hingis in the third round were No. 2 Lindsay Davenport,
No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, No. 5 Venus Williams, No. 7 Conchita
Martinez, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 12 Mary Pierce and No. 13
Amanda Coetzer.
	   Williams served at up to 117 mph (187 kmph) while winning 6-1,
6-3 over qualifier Anne Kremer, a Stanford student. Williams wore a
small black logo promoting the WTA Tour on the left shoulder strap
of her lime tennis dress, two days after being fined by the tour
for refusing to wear the logo.
	   Top-seeded Pete Sampras, seeking his fifth U.S. Open crown, had
23 aces while overcoming early sloppiness to reach the third round
with a 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Paul Goldstein.
	   Sampras had 43 unforced errors in the first two sets and double
faulted on set point to lose the second set, but settled down in
the final two sets. He will not face a seeded player before a
possible encounter with No. 8 Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals.
	   Agassi struggled midway through his match before defeating
Guillaume Raoux 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1, finishing the match
with his 10th ace.
	   Agassi said the crash of the Swissair flight, which many players
take from the United States to tournaments in Europe, was a stark
reminder that athletes face big risks while traveling around the
world.
	   ``That's certainly one of your biggest fears, to say goodbye to
your loved ones and not return,'' Agassi said. ``When you travel
the world like we do, you're bound to have your share of travel
difficulties. But you pray to God you don't have to go through
something like that.''
	   Other men's winners included No. 6 Greg Rusedski, No. 7 Alex
Corretja, No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman. Corretja
completed a first-round match that had been halted by rain
Wednesday night, while the others won second-round matches.
	   Hingis' match had been scheduled for Wednesday night, but was
wiped out by torrential rain and strong winds. She was inconsistent
in the first set, bringing back memories of her loss to Majoli in
the 1997 French Open final. That was the only Grand Slam title
Hingis failed to win last year.
	   ``I was very nervous in the beginning,'' Hingis said. ``It was
very strange coming from last night not having played and having to
play the next day.''
	   Majoli was the aggressor in the first set, moving Hingis from
side to side and slamming groundstrokes past the defending
champion. Hingis sighed loudly in exasperation as she netted a
forehand late in the first set, and her soft second serve was
pummeled by Majoli.
	   But, just as the green concrete of Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed to
be turning into the red clay of Roland Garros, a jet flew noisily
over the court to return the New York feeling and Hingis made it
clear this would be no Paris replay.
	   After needing 45 minutes to win the first set, Hingis swept
through the second set in 20 minutes. Just like the fly she swatted
away in her post-match news conference, Hingis had little trouble
with Majoli after the tiebreaker.
	   ``I loosened up and everything started to go in,'' Hingis said.
``I was strong and I didn't let her back in the game.''

Chief inspector says monitors blocked from previously declared

sites &QL;

comprehensive review not a concession, RAISES details from
resolution; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector told the
Security Council on Thursday that U.N. monitors working under
Baghdad's new restrictive terms have been denied access to sites
prevously approved for surveillance.
	   Richard Butler's briefing came as the United States and Britain
introduced a draft resolution that would punish Iraq for freezing
cooperation with inspectors by suspending regular sanctions reviews
until Iraq reverses its decision.
	   According to a draft of the resolution, however, the council
also appeared to be offering Iraq an incentive to resume
cooperation _ if inspectors are allowed to get back to work, the
council would be willing to consider a comprehensive review of
Iraq's previous compliance.
	   That could allow Iraq to emphasize its previous record of
destroying its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 that it was freezing cooperation with
inspectors because Butler refused to certify that it had destroyed
all of it banned weapons.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The Aug. 5 decision has prevented arms experts from carrying out
any new inspections of suspected weapons sites and has reduced the
ability of U.N. monitors to survey sites that have already been
searched, Butler has said.
	   Iraq has said that ongoing monitoring activities by Butler's
U.N. Special Commission were not affected by the Aug. 5 decision.
	   But in his briefing, Butler told council members that on Aug.
16, U.N. monitors were refused access to a facility ``which had
been inspected within the scope of monitoring in the past,''
according to Butler's talking notes.
	   ``Iraq refused to permit the inspection citing that the unit was
military and that it was not, according to Iraq, within the scope
of monitoring.''
	   Despite Iraq's pledge that monitoring can continue, ``in fact
this may not be the case as Iraq has advised the commission,
orally, that it may only visit those sites which Iraq alone has
declared.''
	   Both Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission declare, or designate
sites for inspections and monitoring, though the often don't agree.
	   In an effort to punish Iraq for the freeze, the United States
and Britain were hoping to pass a resolution next week that would
suspend regular sanctions reviews, including a critical six-month
review in October, until Iraq resumes cooperation.
	   The move would effectively end Iraq's chances of having
8-year-old sanctions lifted. In the past, however, the reviews have
never led to any easing of the measures.
	   The deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, dismissed
suggestions that the United States was compromising by including
the provision of a comprehensive review.
	   Permanent council members China and Russia, in particular, had
been pushing for such a review. The two, along with France,
generally take a more sympathetic line towards Baghdad.

Second man files assault charge against Tyson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENISE CABRERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A second man who says he was assaulted by Mike
Tyson following a minor traffic accident in a Maryland suburb filed
a criminal assault charge Thursday against the former heavyweight
boxing champion.
	   Abmielec Saucedo, 62, says Tyson punched him in the face
``without warning'' as Saucedo talked with another driver following
the accident on Monday.
	   Saucedo's car struck a car driven by Richard Hardick, which then
struck a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife at a Gaithersburg,
Maryland intersection on Monday.
	   Hardick, 50, filed a similar complaint against Tyson on
Wednesday, saying Tyson kicked him in the groin following the
accident.
	   Each man corroborates the other's story in his complaint. Tyson,
32, has denied the allegations.
	   ``I did not kick anyone. I did not punch anyone,'' Tyson said in
a statement released Wednesday through his lawyer, John G. Branca.
	   ``My wife and I were the victims of a traffic accident. I am
distressed by these false allegations. I did not touch anyone,'' he
said.
	   His wife backed up his story, saying: ``Mike did not punch, kick
or touch anyone at any time.''
	   ``I was talking with the driver of the car in front of me when
Mr. Tyson came at me,'' Saucedo said in his complaint. ``Without
warning he punched me in the face with his fist.
	   ``I saw stars, cut my upper lip and I was bleeding,'' Saucedo
added.
	   Saucedo and Hardick described returning to their cars because of
Tyson's agitated state, only to have men who had previously tried
to restrain Tyson reach into their cars and remove their keys from
the ignitions to keep them from leaving the scene.
	   The Tysons, however, did leave and were pulled over a short time
later by police, who had received calls from witnesses.
	   A preliminary hearing on both charges has been set for Oct. 2.
However Paul Kemp, the lawyer representing Tyson in both cases,
says it's likely that hearing will be canceled and a trial date
set.
	   Tyson faces up to 10 years in prison and-or a $2,500 fine on
each assault charge.
	   ``We're hopeful we can work out a prompt resolution of this
thing,'' Kemp said.
	   In Indianapolis, Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford,
who sentenced Tyson following his rape conviction, said Tuesday she
expected probation officials would review the Maryland incident.
	   Tyson is due to released from court supervision in March.
	   He spent three years in an Indiana prison for rape, and a
lawsuit is pending in Montgomery County in which two women contend
Tyson yelled slurs at them and flipped a table over in a Washington
restaurant in March.
	   Last year, Tyson lost his license to box and was fined $3
million after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a title bout. He
is scheduled to appear before the Nevada Athletic Commission Sept.
19 seeking a new license. Commission members have said they will
want an explanation of the events surrounding Monday's accident.

Mutated gene turns on colon cancer gene, researchers find
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ When a cancer-blocking gene turns bad, it
actually helps another gene start the process that leads to cancer
of the colon, researchers have found.
	   A gene called APC normally deactivates a cancer-causing gene
called c-MYC, but when APC is mutated it actually turns on the
cancer gene, causing the uncontrolled growth of cells in the colon,
according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute in Baltimore.
	   A report on the gene discovery was being published Friday in the
journal Science.
	   Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a Hopkins researcher who first discovered
the cancer-suppressing action of APC, said he and his colleagues
have now found that the mutation of APC is a key step in developing
colon cancer.
	   ``Cancer is like a car with the accelerator pushed to the floor
and with failed brakes,'' Vogelstein said in a statement. For colon
cancer, he said, ``c-MYC is the accelerator and APC is the failed
brakes.''
	   APC is normally a suppressor gene that keeps cells from
multiplying out of control. When the gene is mutated, either
through heredity or as the result of exposure to certain chemicals,
it then sends a signal to the c-MYC gene that causes cells to
multiply out of control, the study found.
	   Researchers said the finding may help develop drugs that will
block the signal that causes the c-MYC gene to turn on.
	   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Paramedics and nurses scrambled to
help keep emergency rooms running on Thursday as many public sector
doctors rejected a government order to end a three-day walkout.
	   About half the 2,000 doctors in public hospitals and clinics in
Caracas are on strike. The others say the walkout violates their
code of ethics.
	   Many hospitals were forced to cancel elective surgery, prenatal
examinations and other non-emergency treatment.
	   Government officials say the striking doctors could be fined or
dismissed if they do not return to work.
	   The doctors want their salaries raised from dlrs 380 a month to
dlrs 1,030 a month. The government says it lacks the money for
large raises.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Foreign ministers of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica will meet at the United Nations this month to discuss
disputes over immigration and use of a border river, the foreign
ministry announced Thursday.
	   Eduardo Montealegre of Nicaragua and Roberto Rojas of Costa Rica
were to attend the U.N. General Assembly session on Sept. 22.
	   The two countries have disputed use of the Rio San Juan on their
border. Nicaragua first granted, then withdrew permission for Costa
Rican police to patrol the river, fearing it threatened the
country's sovereignty.
	   Costa Rica says it needs armed patrols to stem traffic in drugs,
undocumented workers and contraband.
	   Heavy Nicaraguan immigration to Costa Rica, where wages are
higher, also has been a source of tension between the two
countries.
	   ___
	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ Canada-based Linamar Corp. is putting
the final touches on a new auto components manufacturing plant in
the northern city of Saltillo, a company official said Thursday.
	   The company expects to start production this fall at the dlrs 25
million plant in the Ramos Arizpe Industrial Park, said Linamar
group vice president Jim Jarrell.
	   Jarrell said the plant will reach full production, with about
250 workers, in 18 months to two years.
	   Linamar's plant, its first in Mexico, will supply the country's
fast-growing auto industry with machined and assembled components
for transmissions, engines, and steering and braking systems, he
said.
	   The company has retained options to buy property adjacent to the
new plant and may eventually set up a cluster of factories as it
has done in Canada, the United States and Hungary to supply local
markets, Jarrell said.

Japan on alert against possible second missile test by North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea placed their forces on
increased alert Thursday and pledged stronger military cooperation
after signs emerged that North Korea was preparing for another
ballistic missile test.
	   The Japanese Parliament passed resolutions condemning North
Korea for a missile test earlier this week, and Tokyo went on a
diplomatic offensive to persuade Pyongyang to abandon possible
plans for a second launch.
	   Japan ``needs to further strengthen its precaution and
defense,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted as
telling reporters by Kyodo News agency.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura met Thursday in Tokyo
with his Korean counterpart, Hong Soon-young. The two agreed to
seek high-level meetings between their countries and the United
States later this month in New York to coordinate a response to the
North's growing missile threat, news reports said.
	   Japan's military had upgraded its level of alertness after
receiving unspecified information Thursday that North Korea was
preparing for a second test. Officials refused to say what actions
Japan was taking.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   It was the first test of the new missile and rattled Tokyo by
demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases. Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are
stationed here.
	   The North _ which has criticized Japan for making ``a fuss''
over the first test launch on Monday _ was apparently brushing off
Tokyo's calls for restraint.
	   ``They are rejecting our protests,'' Nonaka said.
	   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an unidentified
government source, said launch preparations had been spotted by
U.S. military satellites and reconnaissance planes.
	   A flotilla of 10 North Korean fishing vessels crossed the
Tsugaru Strait between the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido
into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, Japan's Maritime Safety Agency,
or coast guard, said.
	   Another three vessels, yet to be identified, were also spotted,
said agency spokesman Kazuki Hataguchi in Sapporo.
	   Agency patrol boats and aircraft were watching the ships, which
officials think could be involved in any upcoming missile test,
Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Yonhap said South Korea's military has also been placed on
coastal alert. Kyodo said Japanese military ships were being
dispatched to the Sea of Japan to monitor any possible missile
launch.
	   The United States was also strengthening its presence in the
region. The Pentagon was sending six B-52 and B-2 stealth bombers
to the Pacific island of Guam, though officials said the warplanes
were being moved only for training.
	   Nonaka said the Japanese government was concerned the North
might conduct a second launch to coincide with the convening of its
national congress on Saturday or the country's national day
celebrations next Wednesday.
	   But Yonhap said that the South Korean government does not
believe the North will be prepared to launch another missile in
time for the Saturday congress, when de facto leader Kim Jong Il is
expected to be formally elected president.
	   Tokyo and Seoul also pledged closer military cooperation in
response to the heightened threat from the reclusive North.
	   South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek returned from a
visit to Japan on Thursday and said the two countries had agreed to
hold joint navy exercises for the purpose of search and rescue
missions in international waters. No time was set for the
exercises.
	   A second test is certain to further chill relations between
Tokyo and Pyongyang at a time when North Korea is increasingly
dependent on outside aid to stave off famine.
	   The first test has already prompted Japan to withdraw an offer
of talks on establishing diplomatic relations, and the government
has ruled out further food aid to the impoverished North.
	   Japan on Thursday refused a request from the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, to reconsider a decision
to suspend funding for an international project to build nuclear
reactors in North Korea, Kyodo reported.
	   Japan Monday suspended its dlrs 1 billion contribution to the
dlrs 4.6 billion project, which KEDO administers, in retaliation
for the missile launch.

Roberts' 9-under par gives him lead in Greater Milwaukee Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT IMRIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ With a brace around his lower back, some
adjustments in his swing and a blistering 28 on the front nine,
Loren Roberts held a three-shot lead after the opening round of the
Greater Milwaukee Open on Thursday.
	   He also landed in the record books, tying the tournament record
for Brown Deer Park Golf Course of 9-under par 62 set in 1996 by
Nolan Henke.
	   ``I was perfect for nine holes and then I hit every green. I
just really had a birdie putt on every single hole,'' Roberts said
after playing under bright blue skies and conditions so calm that
the cackle of a flight of Canadian geese occasionally echoed across
the fairways.
	   ``I feel comfortable here,'' he said. ``The golf course fits my
game. ... You don't have to stand up there and rip it on every
hole. You can kind of play position.''
	   Roberts, 43, won the tournament in 1996 and was second last year
and in 1994, the year play moved to Brown Deer from Tuckaway
Country Club.
	   Jay Don Blake was in second Thursday with 6-under-par 65.
	   ``It helped to start with four birdies. I helps your
confidence,'' Blake said. ``I enjoyed watching the board.''
	   Among those at 5-under par were Mark Calcavecchia, searching for
his first Milwaukee victory in his 18th appearance.
	   PGA champion Vijay Singh, who played in the threesome with
Roberts, was among a crowded field of finishers at 67.
	   Steve Stricker, the homestate favorite from nearby Madison, shot
a 68, three days after his first child, daughter Bobbie Jean, was
born.
	   With little sleep because of what he called the ``miracle'' and
excitement of fatherhood, Stricker, 31, said he was ``in a fog for
awhile'' Thursday, ``even found myself yawning'' and had to talk to
himself to remind him he was playing in a golf tournament.
	   He didn't arrive at Brown Deer until about two hours before
teeing off and has practiced little on some new things he wanted to
try, he said.
	   ``I feel like I kind of crammed for a test and really have not
prepared all that well,'' Stricker said. ``But I didn't really have
to worry about how I was playing because of what has happened the
last few days.''
	   Defending champ Scott Hoch shot a 70.
	   Roberts was atop the leaderboard all day, finishing the front
nine at 7-under, which included five birdies and an eagle at No. 4
after hitting a 4-wood shot 3 1/2 feet (1.05 meters) from the cup.
	   Roberts, ranked 70th on the PGA money list with dlrs 348,108,
said he last shot a 28 in New Zealand in 1978 while playing on the
Australian Tour.
	   For a time, Roberts thought 59 was possible, but he missed an
8-footer (2.5 meters) for birdie at 16 and pitched 20 feet (6
meters) above the hole at 18 from ``no man's land'' about 18 yards
(16 meters) in front of the green. Roberts barely missed the
downhill birdie putt coming back.
	   ``My goal was to at least get 10-under par,'' he said.
	   At the 16th hole, Roberts' caddie scolded some people with
cameras as Roberts lined up his putt, but Roberts refused to make
excuses for what he called a poor putt.
	   ``Hey, world-class players don't let that kind of thing bother
them. If I want to be one of those, I have to forget about it,'' he
said.
	   Roberts' stellar play came despite wearing a back brace and
getting daily treatments for the soreness, he said.
	   ``I haven't been playing that good since I came back in the end
of May. I made a huge adjustment in my golf swing last week and it
kind of paid off in my play my last three rounds,'' he said. ``I
just feel good about making a couple of particular changes that
seem to be working.''

`Swoon' gives Pak time to reflect on spectacular season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Se Ri Pak slipped almost unnoticed onto
the practice green at Columbia-Edgewater Country Club and began to
practice putting. Only a small group of Asian reporters, who have
shadowed her every move this season, waited nearby.
	   The attention surrounding Pak's phenomenal rookie season has
waned a bit the past several weeks as the 20-year-old South Korean
goes through her version of a late-season slump.
	   She won the first of her two majors this season, the McDonald's
LPGA Championship, in May, then made a bigger splash in early July
when she won a 20-hold playoff to capture the U.S. Women's Open.
Just days later, she fired a 10-under-par 61 in the Jamie Farr
Kroger Classic and finished with a 23-under-par 261, the lowest
72-hole score in the 48-year history of the LPGA.
	   But after winning the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic in Ohio July 26,
her fourth victory of the season, Pak had a relatively quiet
August. She was 41st in the du Maurier Classic, 34th in the Women's
British Open and 10th in the State Farm Rail Classic. In between,
she skipped two other tournaments.
	   ``One day I play really great, but another day I play really
bad. That is golf,'' said Pak, preparing for the dlrs 600,000
Safeway LPGA Golf Championship that begins Friday. ``But I just
thinking two years, three years later, that time I know many things
about many golf courses, this country, everything. But this year is
first time. Everything is new.
	   ``I win two majors. That was good start. Good feelings. I have
some more confidence in myself now.''
	   Pak, who turns 21 on Sept. 28, also is trying to deal with the
media better, but admits interviews are a strain, and seems
perplexed by questions comparing her to Tiger Woods.
	   ``Every week, wherever I go it's busy with interviews,'' she
says. ``I have bad things and good things. I am not emotionless
person. (Some) people think I'm perfect, everything's great,
there's nothing difficult, everything going easy. It's not that
easy, though. I have to more worry, I have to do many things. I
have to be nice to everything.
	   ``I have to make myself happy,'' she added. ``Nobody can help.
If I'm really upset, I don't upset long time. I just tell myself,
`OK, quiet. You can do it. Of course I can do it.'''
	   Pak said tour veterans like Nancy Lopez, who won five
tournaments in a row during her rookie season of 1978, prompting
comparison with Pak's debut year, have helped her put the game in
perspective.
	   ``She said, `Don't get yourself mad or sad or something.' She
said make yourself happy, take care of yourself. Be nice to people.
Be nice to media, because she said media can (be) friends.''
	   Lopez is not entered in the LPGA Safeway, played at the par-72,
6,294 Columbia-Edgewater course. Chris Johnson will try to defend
the title she won last year when she shot a 6-under-par 66 in the
third round to win by a stroke over Kim Saiki and Lisa Hackney.
	   Another favorite is Annika Sorenstam, the tour's leading money
winner, who won three titles during a seven-tournament stretch in
June and July and finished second at du Maurier. She hasn't
finished higher than ninth.

Diamondbacks edge Pirates 1-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's early game; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Brian Anderson pitched a three-hitter for his
first career shutout and the Arizona Diamondbacks finished off a
three-game sweep of one-run games, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates
1-0 Thursday.
	   Arizona won its team-record sixth straight game. The Pirates
lost their sixth in a row and are one loss away from being
mathematically eliminated from the National League Central race.
	   Matt Williams' two-out single in the third inning drove in the
only run the left-handed Anderson (11-12) needed to outpitch
Francisco Cordova (12-12), who struck out 10 while allowing only
four hits.
	   Anderson didn't allow a runner past second base while striking
out three and, as usual, walking none. He has walked only seven
since June 13 and his average of 1.2 walks per nine innings is tied
with the Mets' Rick Reed as the best in the NL.
	   It was the third victory in a row for Anderson, Arizona's first
pick in the expansion draft in November. The Diamondbacks' longest
winning streak was four until they swept the Pittsburgh series by
winning 4-3, 2-1 in 11 innings and 1-0.

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Todd Walker doubled and scored on Terry
Steinbach's single in the 12th inning Thursday, giving the
Minnesota Twins a 5-4 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   A season-low crowd of 7,072 at the Metrodome saw the Twins rally
twice late in the game. Minnesota made it 3-all with a run in the
ninth, and Matt Lawton's two-out homer in the 10th tied it at 4.
	   Walker led off the 12th with his second double of the game.
Steinbach grounded a one-out single to center field, and Walker
scored just ahead of Randy Winn's throw.
	   Eddie Guardado (3-1) retired all seven batters he faced for the
win. Rick White (1-5), who came on in the bottom of the 11th, took
the loss.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Thursday, extending a slide
that began late Wednesday and halted a partial rebound from
Monday's brutal selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped
100.15 points _ or 1.3 percent _ at 7,682.22 as a spurt of bargain
hunting trimmed a 203-point deficit over the final half hour.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street's selloff came as shares tumbled in
Europe and followed a mixed day in Asian markets. An additional
unsettling factor was a sharp drop in the dollar in global currency
trading. There are fears that Asia's yearlong economic crisis is
worsening and that Russia's financial collapse will spread into
Europe and Latin America, further dragging down world economies and
corporate profits. A steep drop Thursday in the Russian ruble added
to the concern, especially in Germany, a major Russian trade and
banking partner. The major index at Frankfurt, Germany, closed with
a loss of 3.2 percent. On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's
biggest market, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
ended the day down 2.2 percent. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Growth in American workers' productivity _ the
key to rising living standards _ slowed in the April through June
quarter, posting the smallest gain in nearly two years.
Productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers _ measured as
output per hour of work _ rose at 0.1 percent annual rate, the
Labor Department said Thursday. That's better than advance figures,
released last month, which speculated that productivity had
actually fallen 0.2 percent in the second quarter. But it's still
the worst showing since the third quarter of 1996, when
productivity was unchanged. The April through June weakness
followed a healthy 3.5 percent increase in productivity during the
first three months of this year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a desperate attempt to stem capital flight,
Russia will introduce a series of tight controls over
foreign-currency payments for imports and exports, the Central Bank
announced Thursday. Government officials have said that more than
dlrs 25 billion have been smuggled out of Russia since the 1991
Soviet collapse. Between dlrs 3.5 billion and dlrs 4.5 billion were
taken out of the country legally between May and mid-August. As the
economic crisis has unfolded, the Central Bank has sought to ensure
that foreign currency comes into Russia and stays, and has recently
revived a defunct rule requiring Russian exporters to bring half
their export earnings to Russia and convert them into rubles.
(RUSSIA-CURRENCY CONTROLS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giants Shell and Texaco said Thursday they
want to combine their European refining and retail operations in a
joint venture that will cut jobs and save money. The companies
signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding on a deal that
they believe would save dlrs 200 million per year in a European
refining and fuel market that long has been plagued by
overcapacity. Shell and Texaco said they could offer few specifics
about their plans, which are not yet final. They could not say, for
example, how many of the 29,300 jobs in their combined refining and
marketing work forces will be eliminated. ``It's too early to say
exactly how many and where those will be,'' Shell spokesman Eric
Nickson said. (BRITAIN-SHELL-TEXACO)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Airbus Industrie said Thursday that a joint effort
with other companies to build a 100-seat jetliner in China has
collapsed, but the European consortium said it will seek a new
project with the Chinese. Airbus said in a brief statement that the
project with Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Italy's Alenia,
and Singapore Technologies Ltd. ``jointly concluded that no solid
common basis was found for further developing this new aircraft.''
The decision was made after an ``in-depth viability assessment,''
the statement said. (FRANCE-AIRBUS-CHINA)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As Germany waits to see if Russia's
crisis saps its own economic growth, its central bank announced
Thursday it would not change key interest rates. The decision by
the Bundesbank had been expected since Russia's economy began to
unravel two weeks ago. Germany's key interest rate has been fixed
at 3.3 percent since October 1997. And raising interest rates,
which generally dampens economic growth, would have been ``crazy,''
said Kai Wildfoerster, a senior analyst at West LB in Duesseldorf.
``Our economists are thinking about reducing the growth forecast.
They are waiting to see if there is any contagion'' from Russia,
Wildfoerster said. (GERMANY-INTEREST RATES)

<TEXT>
	   BERKELEY, California (AP) _ Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
spent almost two decades behind bars for his pro-democracy stand,
but it's the last year of his life that most concerns him now _ and
he's afraid he's lost it all, in a briefcase he mistakenly left on
a bus stop bench.
	   Wei's briefcase held a year's worth of research, along with his
passport, car registration and some checks. He'll give dlrs 200 to
whoever returns it.
	   ``It was a whole lot of notes, all written in Chinese, in a
small black vinyl briefcase, and he left it on a bus bench ... last
Thursday ...,'' said Abbi Kaplan, Wei's interpreter.
	   Wei has been researching the pro-democracy movement at the
University of California. He was released on medical grounds last
November after spending most of the previous 18 years in prison for
criticizing the Chinese communist government.
	   Wei, 48, is working at Columbia University in New York, but has
been doing his research at the Univesrity of California-Berkeley
under a fellowship that ends in December.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hollywood just can't let it be.
	   Several entertainers do their own versions of Beatles songs on a
new superstar compilation that includes Jim Carrey warbling
``ku-ku-kachoo'' on ``I Am the Walrus.''
	   The recording, to be called ``In My Life,'' will mark the
retirement of 70-year-old Beatles producer George Martin.
	   Celine Dion sings ``Here, There and Everywhere,'' and Jeff Beck
takes his guitar to ``A Day in the Life.'' Robin Williams and
Goldie Hawn also contribute to the MCA Records project.
	   ``Ringo loved it,'' Martin said. ``Paul's only comment was there
aren't enough McCartney songs.''
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A top Mexican soccer club is looking for a
hand at the helm _ and officials think former Argentine star Diego
Maradona would be divine choice.
	   Eduardo Leano, vice president of the Autonomous University of
Guadalajara Tecos _ or Owls _ said the club had offered Maradona
the coaching job, to replace the fired Victor Manuel Vucetich.
	   ``We are awaiting his response,'' Vucetich said.
	   Maradona was known for brilliant play, erratic behavior and the
``hand of God'' goal against Britain in the 1986 World Cup. He says
he has overcome a problem of drug abuse.
	   The Tecos, once a strong team in Mexico's top soccer league, are
struggling this year, managing only four points in five games.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter has joined
the cast of a TV movie about the 1960s civil rights struggle.
	   Yolanda King has signed on to appear in the ``Wonderful World of
Disney'' movie ``Selma, Lord, Selma.''
	   The movie is based on two girls' experiences during the 1965
Selma, Alabama, voting rights march led by King, the black civil
rights leader assassinated in 1968.
	   Filming is set to begin in Georgia and Alabama this month. The
movie is scheduled for broadcast in January.
	   ___
	   SANTA MONICA, California (AP) _ Arnold Schwarzenegger says in a
dlrs 50 million libel lawsuit that a U.S. tabloid libeled him by
reporting he was in ill health and fears having a heart attack.
	   A Globe cover story headlined ``Arnie's Heart Crisis'' defamed
Schwarzenegger by implying his health was poor after heart surgery
last year, the ``Terminator'' star contends in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday against the tabloid's publisher, Globe Communications
Corp.
	   Schwarzenegger underwent surgery in April 1997 to replace a
faulty aortic valve.
	   The Globe's Aug. 4 cover story ``maliciously implied that
specific doctors had warned Schwarzenegger that he was a `ticking
time bomb,''' said the actor's public relations agency, PMK.
	   ``The physician quoted has never examined or had any contact
with the superstar, and has never had access to Schwarzenegger's
medical records,'' the statement said. It added that the actor's
surgery was ``a complete success'' and that he does not have
coronary heart disease.

category codes:
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The 229 people aboard Swissair
Flight 111 had time to prepare for the worst while the pilots
struggled vainly to keep the smoking, groaning jetliner aloft long
enough for an emergency landing. Some passengers donned their life
vests during the several minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet crashed
and broke apart Wednesday night in choppy seas off Nova Scotia,
Swissair officials said Thursday. The plane left a slick of jet
fuel, floating luggage and human remains, but no survivors.
(CANADA-PLANE CRASH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While the ruble is plunging and prices rising
steeply, parliament is headed for a second vote on the confirmation
for President Boris Yeltsin's acting prime minister. If the lower
house of parliament, the State Duma, again rejects Viktor
Chernomyrdin in its vote Friday, the nation's crisis will drag on.
His approval could ease the political instability reigning over
Russia, though it would not assuage the nation's economic distress
very quickly. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's peace was
obtained through the courage and determination of its people, an
example to war-torn peoples the world over, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Thursday. Capping an emotional day of celebrating the
Good Friday peace his intervention helped mold in April, Clinton
said he came to battle-scarred Armagh ``to thank you _ to thank you
for the peace, to thank you for strengthening the hand of everyone,
everyone anywhere who is working to make the world a little
better.'' Earlier, he visited Omagh to console families torn by the
worst terror attack in Northern Ireland's three decades of
sectarian violence. (CLINTON-NIRELAND)
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila's
main military ally _ Zimbabwe _ all but declared victory Thursday
in suppressing an insurrection in Congo, even as U.N. chief Kofi
Annan tried to forge a peace initiative. Congolese government
forces, backed by troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, have
pushed rebels allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda from the
capital Kinshasa and were advancing eastward into rebel territory
in the vast central African nation. ``Had we not intervened, the
government of Laurent Kabila ... would have fallen,'' Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe declared at a summit of the Nonaligned
Movement. He also announced that a meeting of leaders from all
countries involved in the war would be meeting in three days.
(NONALIGNED SUMMIT)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The prime minister during Rwanda's 1994
genocide was merely a puppet used by a powerful and evil military.
``The strings were pulled and he danced,'' his lawyer contended
Thursday. Rwandans in the gallery laughed aloud in derision as the
defense pleaded for a sentence of two years for Jean Kambanda _ or
none at all _ ``to enable the healing to take place.'' Prosecutors
countered that Kambanda merits life imprisonment, even though he's
the first ever to plead guilty to genocide and has promised to
testify against other killers. Kambanda, the highest-ranking former
political leader in the tribunal's custody, was to be sentenced
Friday by the U.N. court. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)

Salvage teams pump sulfuric acid from damaged ship into ocean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to CORRECT name of port, UPDATES with
officials warning of possibility of explosion. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Salvage teams pumped tons of sulfuric
acid from a damaged ship into the water off southern Brazil, saying
the step was necessary to preven the ship from exploding and
causing a larger environmental disaster.
	   The acid was being pumped from the Maltese-registered ship
Bahamas, which arrived this week in the port of Rio Grande, 1,000
kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Sao Paulo in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul.
	   Leo Antonio Bulling, a Civil Defense official, said by phone
that water had entered the holds of the ship and come into contact
with the sulfuric acid, making it much more corrosive.
	   Authorities made the decision to dump the acid into the water to
prevent it from eating through the ship's structure and releasing
100 tons of fuel oil into the water, Bulling said.
	   He said the acid could not be diverted into containers on land
because nothing available could withstand the corrosive acid.
	   Gilmar Viera of Brazil's environmental protection agency told
the Globo TV network that another reason for dumping the acid into
the water was prevent the ship from exploding.
	   ``When the water came in contact with the acid, the ship's holds
filled with gas, transforming the vessel into a bomb,'' he said.
	   TV Globo footage showed dead fish floating in the water near the
ship.
	   As of Thursday afternoon, just one ton of sulfuric acid, of a
total of 12 tons, had been pumped from the ship. Bulling said it
would take another three or four days before the remaining acid was
withdrawn.
	   Fuel oil is also being pumped from the ship, but he could not
specify how much had already been withdrawn.
	   The sulfuric acid was imported from the Netherlands by Brazilian
industries, mostly fertilizer manufacturers, Bulling said.

Diplomatic efforts bring no quick end to Kosovo fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Battles between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanian rebels are complicating U.S.-led diplomatic
efforts, which American and European officials say are making
progress toward a settlement of the bitter ethnic conflict in
Kosovo province.
	   Serb and Albanian sources said fighting erupted Thursday in
villages between the towns of Djakovica and Klina. The area,
southwest of Pristina, is one of the few that remain under the
control of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Both sides said the fighting continued through the night. A Serb
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said government troops
were surprised by the KLA attacks and that the rebels were putting
up stiff resistance.
	   There were no reports of casualties, and Albanian sources said
telephone links to the area had been cut. The area of the fighting
is believed to be crowded with thousands of refugees who fled the
main town in the region _ Orahovac _ when Serb forces recaptured it
in July.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for the majority Albanian
province, which is part of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the province's 2 million
inhabitants.
	   Fighting escalated in March after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs
describe as ``terrorists.''
	   The conflict persisted despite intense American and European
diplomatic efforts, which appear to be making progress.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill won agreement in
principle by both Milosevic and the main Albanian political leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, on a formula for an ``interim'' settlement.
	   Under the proposed agreement, Milosevic would grant Kosovo
self-rule rather than independence. But the accord would be
reviewed after three to five years, leaving the door open for new
political arrangements.
	   The key to the success could be the KLA, many of whose members
oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of violence. But Western
diplomats hope that enough KLA members will eventually accept the
diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners isolated politically within
the Albanian community.
	   In Vienna, Austria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
the tentative agreement by Milosevic and Rugova represented ``a
good procedural step forward.''
	   ``We want to make sure that the violence is ended and that there
is action to let the humanitarian workers to be able to get in to
deal with the over now 250,000 displaced people,'' Albright said.
	   She said it was critical for Milosevic ``to halt the violence''
to allow negotiations to move forward.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said U.S. diplomacy
had ``for the first time'' produced ``is a glimmer of hope'' for
peace in Kosovo.
	   ``Don't think that the solution is there,'' Schuessel said a
press conference with Albright. ``This is a small hope but it is
part of a diplomatic process.''
	   Albright said the United States was concerned that approaching
winter would threaten the lives of about 50,000 refugees camped out
in the forested hills of Kosovo.
	   She said the United States would provide another dlrs 20 million
for humanitarian operations in Kosovo.

Albright appeals to democracies to stand by Russian reformers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The United States is urging free-market
democracies to stand by reform-minded groups in Russia and make
clear there is ``no going backwards'' if the country is to play a
role in the global economy.
	   ``It is up to countries with market economies and democracy to
continue to encourage those (reform) forces within Russia and to
make it very clear that there is no going backwards,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters Thursday.
	   ``To be part of the global economy, there are certain rules that
need to be followed,'' she added.
	   Albright stopped by Vienna on her way home from the U.S.-Russia
summit to brief Austrian and European Union officials on the
results of President Bill Clinton's talks with Russia's president,
Boris Yeltsin.
	   Developments in Russia are expected to be high on the agenda
when EU foreign ministers meet this weekend in Salzburg, Austria.
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, whose government holds the
rotating EU presidency, said Russia must stick by its reform
program if it expects financial help from the 15 EU members.
	   Albright told reporters that during the Moscow summit, Yeltsin
``was very much in charge during the meetings'' with Clinton,
despite speculation that the Russian leader's political position
was crumbling.
	   But she acknowledged the ``increasing strength'' among Communist
lawmakers, who have been blocking confirmation of Yeltsin's choice
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Following her meetings with the Austrians, Albright told
representatives of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that ``the problem right now is that the
Russian people are hurting.''
	   ``Many believe that democracy has not empowered them to improve
their lives,'' she told the OSCE, headquartered in Vienna. ``This
is dangerous because Russia cannot emerge from its difficulties
unless its people take responsibility for shaping their country's
future.''
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the chaos in
Moscow showed once again that the free-market democracies,
including the United States and the EU members, were the only
groups capable of coping with global crises.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ If it weren't for the Slavic-looking
mannequins and Cyrillic neon signs, there would be little left in
the Laleli neighborhood of Istanbul to remind the visitor that it
specializes in trade with Russia.
	   Once an area bustling with Russians _ whose suitcases were the
cargo ships of Turkey's thriving, little-regulated ``shuttle
trade'' with its northern neighbor _ Laleli today seems deserted.
	   The ruble's plunge has left ordinary Russians hard-pressed to
buy what they need to stay alive _ let alone the consumer goods
that lured Russian traders across the border for much of the 1990s,
making Russia Turkey's No. 1 trade partner.
	   ``Before, it was always full of Russians here. Now, look around.
There are only Turks left,'' said Dimitri Anofry, who has been
selling toys in the Laleli district since 1993.
	   Like most shop owners in the area, Anofry's boss employed a
Russian-speaking salesman to do business with the hundreds of
thousands of Russians who poured into Turkey after the Soviet Union
collapse. The enterprising traders turned to Turkey to fill newly
capitalist Russia's surging demand for household goods _ seeking
everything from toilet brushes to wallpaper, along with textiles
and Turkey's cheap leather.
	   Most of the traders were women, visiting on tourist visas,
toting the suitcases into which they would stuff their purchases.
	   They could be seen sitting on mountains of cloth bags in the
streets of the neighborhood, waiting for their buses or ferry boats
to take them back to Russia.
	   The suitcase trade had an estimated volume of dlrs 8 billion in
1997, twice that of Turkey's official trade with Russia.
	   But suffering from competition in Asia, where many commodities
are even cheaper, bustling Laleli has been losing vigor for at
least a year.
	   Official exports to Russia have dropped by some 25 percent since
the start of 1998, and the luggage trade could lose an estimated
dlrs 1.1 billion this year. The loss could increase Turkey's trade
deficit and further stem Turkey's growth, which already dropped to
4 percent by midyear from the first quarter's 9 percent.
	   ``For the past years, Russia has permanently taken measures to
limit the shuttle trade, because it wants to stimulate the official
trade and local manufacturing goods,'' said Andrey Gerdev, Istanbul
representative of the Russian Federation of Chambers of Commerce
and Industry. The latest measure limits to dlrs 1,000 the amount of
goods Russians can import duty-free.
	   The devaluation of the ruble in August left Turks with little
hope of a rebound in Russia's imports.
	   Armenak Ipekci, who exported kitchenware and food to Russia for
years, has put a temporary halt to his trade.
	   ``We don't know whether we are going to be paid. They cannot
find currency, so they cannot make their payments.''

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The 229 people aboard Swissair
Flight 111 had time to prepare for the worst while the pilots
struggled vainly to keep the smoking, groaning jetliner aloft long
enough for an emergency landing.
	   Some passengers donned their life vests during the several
minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet crashed and broke apart
Wednesday night in choppy seas off Nova Scotia, Swissair officials
said Thursday. The plane, which carried 137 Americans, left a slick
of jet fuel, floating luggage and human remains, but no survivors.
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were, you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat that joined a makeshift flotilla that
fruitlessly searched for people to rescue. The cause of the crash
was not known.
	   Aboard the jet flown by one of the world's safest airlines were
14 crew members and 215 passengers. There were two infants, several
United Nations employees and one of the foremost leaders in the
global fight against AIDS, Dr. Jonathan Mann.
	   The Geneva-bound plane departed New York's Kennedy International
Airport at 8:18 p.m. EDT Wednesday (0018 GMT Thursday) and crashed
100 minutes later near Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia.
	   Sixteen minutes passed between the crew's first report of
trouble _ including smoke in the cockpit, in Canadian airspace at
33,000 feet (9,900 meters) _ and the plane's disappearance from
radar scopes at about 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), according to Roy
Bears of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Five minutes after the aircraft crew reported the smoke and
headed toward Halifax, they began descending to dump fuel, said
Tony Rushton of the Canadian air traffic controllers' union.
	   In another five minutes the crew declared an emergency, and just
moments later, the aircraft's transponder, which automatically
transmits its identity and altitude, stopped functioning, he said.
	   Controllers could still monitor the plane on radar until all
contact was finally lost.
	   The pilot, Urs Zimmermann, 50, tried to coax the plane to an
emergency landing at the Halifax airport, 35 miles (56 kilometers)
from the crash site. The pilot initially proposed heading for
Boston, but air traffic controllers pointed out Halifax was closer
_ 42 miles (67 kilometers) compared to 192 miles (307 kilometers).
	   Swissair said the plane was seven to 10 minutes away from the
airport in Halifax, when it plunged into waters about 150 feet (45
meters) deep.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington
sent 10 experts to Canada and experts from Switzerland also were
deployed.
	   Canadian officials and the White House said there was no
indication the crash resulted from a terrorist act. The Canadians
said their intelligence services were in contact with the FBI
nonetheless.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh said his agents were examining the
passenger list and working to ensure key evidence was properly
preserved.
	   ``We don't have any indication at this point what caused that
tragedy,'' Freeh said.
	   In towns along the scenic but often treacherous Nova Scotia
coast, residents reported hearing sputtering noises from an
aircraft passing overhead, then a thundering crash.
	   ``The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding
deep groan that I've ever heard,'' said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships hurried out to the
crash site, about six miles off the coast of Peggy's Cove. The
picturesque fishing village _ population 60 _ is popular with
tourists for its pirate lore and much-photographed lighthouse, but
the area also is known for shipwrecks and other maritime tragedies.
	   After the first few hours of the nightlong search, the mood
among boat crews turned grim when reports of survivors proved
false. Instead, boat after boat radioed to a naval command vessel
that more body bags were needed to cradle human remains scattered
among aircraft debris over several square miles (kilometers) of the
Atlantic.
	   Searchlights from boats, helicopters and planes illuminated the
area during the night. Heavy surf _ a remnant of Hurricane Danielle
_ hampered the first hours of the rescue effort and rain fell until
dawn.
	   The first three dozen bodies recovered were taken to a temporary
morgue at the Canadian Forces Base Shearwater, 30 miles (48
kilometers) to the east. Twenty doctors, including dentists and
pathologists, worked to identify remains.
	   Searchers said they had located a chunk of the plane's fuselage
believed to be intact on the ocean floor. Divers planned to search
for the flight recorders, which could help determine the cause of
the disaster.
	   Swissair and its partner, Delta Airlines, were flying relatives
from New York and Switzerland to Halifax. Nova Scotia officials
offered to provide 900 hotel rooms for the families, and pledged to
protect their privacy as they faced the grim chore of identifying
loved ones.
	   Swissair said the passenger list would not be released until
family members are notified. In addition to the 136 American
passengers and an American crew member, it said 39 Swiss nationals
and 30 French citizens were killed. Others were from Britain,
Canada, Germany, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain, St. Kitts and Russia.
	   The United Nations confirmed that seven U.N. workers returning
to offices in Geneva and the wife of one of the officials were on
board.
	   ``Any one of us could have been on that plane,'' U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said in New York. ``It's a flight we take
frequently.''

	   By nightfall Thursday, authorities estimated that 60 bodies had

none of the pieces was any larger than an automobile. Fauteux said
more than 1,000 people were still involved in the search, most of

Corruption alleged in flood aid distribution effort in India

	   GORAKHPUR, India (AP) _ For Ram Dular Sharma, the choice was to
drown or die of hunger. Marooned in his flooded village, Sharma,
his wife and daughter went four days without eating, until an army
boat came Thursday carrying food and medicine.
	   ``He didn't even wave _ he just started crying,'' said Maj.
Mukesh Sisodia.
	   By comparison, Sharma's wait for help was short. Beharilal
Yadav, a farmer in a nearby village, complained he didn't see any
government officials for nearly two weeks.
	   ``Our village has been flooded over the past three weeks and we
were without food for a fortnight,'' said Yadav, whose Brajenganj
village is about 400 miles (645 kilometers) southeast of New Delhi.
	   Their desperate tales came amid complaints by private aid
workers that corrupt officials were siphoning money and food meant
for victims of devastating floods in northern India.
	   The worst flooding in decades has affected more than half of
Uttar Pradesh state's 83 districts and swamped over 8 million acres
(3.25 million hectares) in the last month. The death toll from
monsoon flooding has risen to nearly 1,500. Some 12 million
villagers have been marooned or left homeless, the state flood
relief center said.
	   Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state with 150 million
people.
	   A top government relief official, speaking by phone from
Lucknow, the state capital, on condition of anonymity, said
investigations into charges of corruption would begin as soon as
the emergency was over.
	   The state government says it disbursed dlrs 24 million to
flood-hit areas, and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee sent an
additional dlrs 3.5 million.
	   District relief official Net Ram denied the claims that relief
wasn't reaching victims. ``We have been distributing food packets
and rescuing marooned people around the clock. Such charges are
politically motivated,'' Ram said.
	   After battling day and night for survival for three weeks, the
villagers were buoyed Thursday as water levels stopping rising and
rains began to let up. But the floods were expected to recede
slowly.
	   In Gorakhpur, a city where thousands of residents have been
asked by officials not to bathe for risk of disease from sewage
that is swamping roads and courtyards, the hardships are many.
	   ``People wade through the streets and come back with black
knees,'' said Shiraz Wahiya, who heads the Voluntary Health
Association of India in the state.
	   The filthy water has left many people with a brain disease,
Japanese encephalitis, that occurs in rice-growing areas, Wahiya
said.
	   Private groups, political parties and business leaders are
supplementing government efforts. Sahara India diverted two
helicopters from its commercial airline services and sent a fleet
of jeeps and cars to distribute food, clothing and medicine.
	   But destitute villagers across the region said they had received
only crumbs of aid, while many others said they had yet to see any
relief officials. Since the floods hit, some residents have been
able to scratch out an existence using food stored in their homes.

Ruble in freefall, parliament girds for battle

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While the ruble plunged in street trading and
prices rose steeply, parliament headed for the second time this
week into a confirmation vote for President Boris Yeltsin's acting
prime minister.
	   If the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, again rejects
Viktor Chernomyrdin in its vote Friday, the nation's crisis will
drag on. His approval could ease the political instability reigning
over Russia, though it would not assuage the nation's economic
distress very quickly.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Thursday, a day after the government said it was
powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   ``Some people are panicking, like pensioners,'' said Yulia
Nazarova, a 30-year-old seamstress. ``We're all nervous, of
course.''
	   Leaders of the hard-line opposition to Yeltsin vowed to vote
against Chernomyrdin, and the Communist speaker of the Duma,
Gennady Seleznyov, predicted that Chernomyrdin would fall short of
the 226 votes he needs.
	   Under the Constitution, Yeltsin has the option of proposing him
a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the Duma votes no for
a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma elections.
	   Some say Yeltsin will do just that _ forcing the legislators to
undergo elections a year earlier than scheduled. The Communists,
led by Gennady Zyuganov, are not particularly strong in the polls
at the moment, but the turmoil is likely to strengthen their
support.
	   ``Zyuganov thinks this is his best chance of gaining power,''
said Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Duma deputy. ``The more unrest,
the better he thinks they'll do.''
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others warned
that Yeltsin could decide to impose emergency rule instead _
governing by decree until the next regularly scheduled elections
for parliament in December 1999.
	   Yeltsin himself moved Thursday to promote a compromise, reviving
a political deal nearly clinched last weekend, which the Communists
abandoned at the last minute.
	   According to Russian news agencies, Yeltsin made some amendments
to the document _ which proposes a reallocation of powers between
the president and parliament _ and sent it back to the Duma.
	   Some Duma members rushed to try and block any attempt by Yeltsin
to dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy, complex and would require confirmation by
the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court _ both of which are
loyal to the president.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister. The political turmoil has left
the interim government unable to devote its attention to the
mounting economic crisis.

Ex-Rwandan leader seeks leniency in genocide sentence

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Preparing to issue its first sentence, a
U.N. tribunal must weigh an ex-prime minister's admission of guilt
and testimony incriminating other killers against his crime _ the
genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the custody of the Rwandan war crimes tribunal, was hoping for
leniency during his sentencing Friday.
	   The defense asked for a sentence of two years or nothing at all
on Thursday for Kambanda, the first ever to plead guilty to
genocide.
	   The prosecution countered that Kambanda merits life
imprisonment, despite agreeing to plead guilty and giving evidence
against other alleged ringleaders.
	   Defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis contended that Kambanda,
42, was merely a puppet manipulated by a powerful and evil
military. ``The strings were pulled and he danced,'' he said.
	   Rwandans in the gallery at the U.N. tribunal laughed aloud in
derision as he pleaded for a lenient sentence for Kambanda ``to
enable the healing to take place.''
	   In the Rwandan capital Kigali, Anastase Murumba, director of the
survivors' group Ibuka, asked in anger, ``How dare he ask for such
a sentence when we who lived know Kambanda was no puppet? He was a
big supporter of the genocide. He deserves the death penalty.''
	   Kambanda has already recorded 90 hours of testimony about the
1994 carnage to help build genocide cases against others. The
court's rules allow it to consider factors including substantial
cooperation with the prosecutor.
	   But Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna argued that no amount of
testimony against others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda is
accused of inciting massacres, ordering roadblocks to help round up
of Tutsis, and distributing weapons for the slaughter as his
hard-line Hutu government presided over the bloodbath.
	   ``How can you balance the thousands and hundreds of thousands
killed with the cooperation of the accused?'' Muna asked the court.
``We believe this crime merits nothing less than life
imprisonment.''
	   A life sentence is the maximum that can be imposed by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in the northern
Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   Rwanda has carried out its own war crimes prosecutions. In
April, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted of
genocide, the first executions in connection with the meticulously
planned, 90-day slaughter.
	   Kambanda pleaded guilty before the U.N. court on May 1 to six
counts of genocide and crimes against humanity, including
responsibility for the murder and extermination of civilians,
becoming the first person to accept culpability for genocide before
an international court.
	   The crime of genocide was decreed and defined in 1948, after the
post-World War II Nuremberg trials.
	   During the hourlong session, defense attorney Inglis said the
three-month frenzy of killing had already begun by the time
Kambanda took office, after the assassination of Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana on April 7, 1994.
	   Although the indictment said Kambanda controlled the government
ministers and military officers who were carrying out the killings,
Inglis characterized him as a reluctant officeholder manipulated by
a powerful military.
	   Kambanda was afraid to object because he and his family would
have been killed, his lawyer said.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, wearing a dark suit and tie _ let
his lawyer speak for him, telling the chief judge: ``I have nothing
further to add.''
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ First there was a deafening
explosion, then not a sound.
	   ``All the crickets stopped,'' said Darrell Fralick, one of 60
residents of this tiny fishing village of pastel homes and
sunbleached, granite boulders. ``It was dead silent.''
	   Some people stepped out on their porches, gazing over St.
Margaret's Bay, where the sound had come from.
	   Wilfred Morash, a resident of nearby Blandford, described the
noise as ``a huge crash, like thunder.'' Because he has a police
scanner, he learned quicker than most what the cause of the noise
was: ``The alarms went off, and they said a plane had gone down in
Peggy's Cove.''
	   John Campbell first learned what had happened when he saw
reports on television that a plane had crashed into the cold, inky
blue waters off the Nova Scotia coast.
	   He rounded up his crew and set out on his whale-watching boat,
``So Much to Sea,'' heading out of Peggy's Cove into the churning
seas to see if he could help.
	   A few miles (kilometers) out, the smell of jet fuel stung his
sinuses.
	   ``You could taste it,'' he said. He warned his crew not to toss
their cigarettes into the water.
	   As military flares briefly illuminated the water, the men were
stunned to see, floating in their usual fishing waters, debris and
bodies from a Swissair flight bound from New York to Geneva.
	   ``It was just a big pile of everything you would find in a
plane,'' Campbell said. ``There were seat cushions, piles of wood
and lots of styrofoam.''
	   By the time Campbell's crew arrived, other fishing boats were
trolling the waters, hoping to save someone. They found no one.
	   Standing outside his home, a stone's throw from crashing surf,
Fralick, who oversees tourism for Peggy's Cove, saw emergency
lights snake across the shoreline. Soon the Canadian armed forces
called to ask him to unlock the public restrooms because they were
heading for Peggy's Cove.
	   At about 3 a.m., the Royal Canadian Mounted Police borrowed
Campbell's boat.
	   That's about the time the commotion woke up Don and Mary Ellen
DeBoer, a Wayne, New Jersey, couple vacationing at the Breakwater
Inn.
	   ``We were woken up by the flares over the water,'' Don DeBoer
said. ``It looked like the moon was out.''
	   As day broke Thursday, giant helicopters criss-crossed the sky
above a Navy frigate about three miles (five kilometers) off the
coast.
	   Although authorities eventually took over the search, local
fishermen continued to pull debris out of the water and turn it
over to officials.
	   The residents who had spontaneously volunteered to help save
lives watched helplessly as shattered wood, twisted metal, torn
pieces of rug, shoes, a purse, a necktie, and an infant sling
sailed into town on police boats. Three men lowered the Canadian
and U.S. flags to half-staff.
	   The bodies of the victims were taken to the Shearwater military
base about 35 miles (56 kilometers) away. Their personal belongings
were placed in plastic bags and catalogued.
	   About 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the coast, a child's dark
blue sweater, papers, a brown leather purse and a page from a math
textbook floated amid body parts on rolling ocean swells.
	   Throughout the day, details of the disaster were delivered by
Canadian authorities to reporters camped at the Sou' Wester Gift
Shop and Restaurant. The military set up cots under large tents in
preparation for a long stay.
	   Walking away from a tangle of rescue workers, reporters and
cameras, Rabbi Mendel Feldman of Halifax headed out of town after a
short visit.
	   He said he had come to help families and rescue workers deal
with their grief, but was told he might be need more elsewhere.
	   ``I was referred to Shearwater,'' he said, clutching a
leather-bound volume of The Rabbi's Guide, a collection of prayers.
	   ``That would be the best place to help families.''

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in early
trading Friday after senior finance ministry officials hinted Japan
may intervene to further strengthen its currency. Tokyo stocks
fell.
	   The dollar bought 133.76 yen in early trading, down 1.83 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 134.70 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency weakened after the Japanese Finance Ministry's
vice finance minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara,
hinted early Friday that Japan was ready for possible intervention
in support of the yen.
	   He was joined by Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's
international bureau, who warned that the yen's rise against the
dollar could pick up pace.
	   Overnight in New York, the dollar fell sharply after Dow Jones
Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying George Soros'
investment fund group was dumping dollars and buying the German
mark.
	   A spokesman for Soros' fund refused to comment on the rumors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market opened lower amid
concern over a fall in shares on Wall Street overnight and worry
about the outlook for Japanese corporate profits, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 111.89 points,
or 0.78 percent, to 14,149.35 in the first half hour of trading. On
Thursday, the index fell 115.38 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 11.24 points, or 1.01
percent, to 1,102.53. The TOPIX declined 4.99 points, or 0.45
percent, the previous day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 100.15 points, or 1.3
percent, to 7,682.22 on Thursday. It had suffered its
second-biggest point loss ever on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's 1.065 percent. Its price fell
to 112.65 yen, down from 112.66 yen.

British and Irish lawmakers pass new anti-terrorist legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ New anti-terrorist legislation drafted in the wake
of a car bombing that killed 28 people in Northern Ireland
completed its run through Parliament early Friday morning and was
on course for approval by Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Companion legislation in Ireland became law late Thursday night.
	   Although some members of both the House of Commons and the House
of Lords protested they had not been given enough time to consider
the bills, the Commons approved the bill 391-17 in the key vote
early Thursday and the Lords passed it without a formal vote
Friday.
	   The bill was then sent the queen for her signature, a formality
for the legislation to become law.
	   The measures would give more weight to police testimony that a
suspect belonged to a banned organization, and allow judges to draw
inferences from a suspect's refusal to answer questions.
	   The laws are aimed at Northern Ireland's dissident paramilitary
groups, such as the so-called Real IRA, which admitted
responsibility for the Aug. 15 car bomb in Omagh. The attack
produced the largest death toll of any terrorist attack in 30 years
of violence in the province.
	   Both governments aimed to complete passage during U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to both parts of Ireland on Thursday and
Friday.

Annan saddened by those who died `in the service of the UN'

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Swissair flight that crashed off Nova
Scotia was the most frequently used by U.N. staff travelling
between U.N. headquarters in New York and the second-largest U.N.
office in Geneva, officials said.
	   The United Nations confirmed the identities of five U.N.
staffers, two U.N.-afiliated officials and an officials' wife who
perished in the crash. At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N.
flag flew at half staff and officials made plans for a memorial
service, to be attended by the U.N. chief, sometime next week.
	   On U.N. staffer, from the Food and Agriculture Organization, was
supposed to have been on the plane but ``that at the last minute
for reasons that weren't explained to me, he changed his fight
plans,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   The staffer's identity wasn't released.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was deeply saddened by the
deaths of over 200 people of the Swissair Flight 111 crash off Nova
Scotia, ``including a number of members of the United Nations
family.''
	   ``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of all the
victims, and in particular to the relatives and friends of those
who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the United
Nations,'' Annan said in a statement.
	   ``Their loss is felt not only personally but professionally as
well,'' he said.
	   Among the victims was Dr. Jonathan Mann, who became known as the
outspoken head of the World Health Organization's AIDS program when
the disease exploded in the 1980s. His wife, Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann, also was killed.
	   They were on their way to attend a series of WHO and UNAIDS
meetings, WHO said in a statement.
	   Other victims were, according to the United Nations:
	   _Pierce Gerety, American, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
director of the Great Lakes operations.
	   _Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, French, UNHCR senior social welfare
officer.
	   _Joachim Bilger, Germany, controller of the office of internal
oversight and productivity, World Intellectual Property
Organization.
	   _Ludwig Beaumler, Germany, WIPO senior director for
international and operational affairs since 1968.
	   _Yves de Roussan, Canada, 41, UNICEF regional advisor for
Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
	   _Ingrid Acevedo, American, 33, director of public relations for
the U.S. Committee for UNICEF.
	   U.N. officials said Swissair Flight 111 was the most heavily
used flight for U.N. staffers travelling between the two U.N. hubs.
Swissair was one of about 30 preferred carriers for the United
Nations, meaning U.N. staff got a discount on tickets, the
officials said.
	   The evening flight was popular because it was the only non-stop
at that time of day, they said.
	   ``It was like a U.N. Airbus,'' said Eckhard. ``Even before we
got confirmation that there were U.N. staff on the flight, we just
knew from the identification of the flight that there would've been
some of our people on that plane.''

Chief inspector: monitors blocked from previously approved sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors working under
Baghdad's new restrictive terms have been denied access to sites
previously approved for surveillance, the chief weapons inspector
said.
	   Richard Butler's report to the U.N. Security Council came as the
United States and Britain introduced a draft resolution that would
punish Iraq for freezing cooperation with inspectors by suspending
regular sanctions reviews until Iraq reverses the decision.
	   According to a draft of the resolution, however, the council
also appeared to offer Iraq an incentive to resume cooperation. The
resolution says if inspectors are allowed to get back to work, the
council would be willing to consider a comprehensive review of
Iraq's previous compliance.
	   That could allow the council members to highlight Iraq's
previous record of destroying its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 that it was freezing cooperation with
inspectors because Butler refused to certify that it had destroyed
all of it banned weapons.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990, leading to the Persian Gulf War.
	   In its Aug. 5 decision barring any new inspections, Baghdad said
it would not oppose the monitoring of sites already under
surveillance.
	   But in his briefing Thursday, Butler told council members that
on Aug. 16, U.N. monitors were refused access to such a facility.
	   ``Iraq refused to permit the inspection,'' insisting the site
``was military and that it was not ... within the scope of
monitoring,'' Butler said.
	   On Tuesday, an inspection team was again barred from a site
known to contain missile components already under surveillance by
the U.N. Special Commission, Butler added.
	   ``The team requested access to the site to verify that all items
were tagged and present,'' Butler's notes say. ``Iraq refused to
provide access to the site on the ground that the facility was not
a declared site.''
	   Iraq and the U.N. commission, independent of each other, declare
which sites will inspected and monitored. But at times the two
sides are not in accord.
	   Despite Iraq's pledge that monitoring can continue, ``in fact
this may not be the case, as Iraq has advised the commission ... it
may only visit those sites which Iraq alone has declared,'' Butler
said.
	   In an effort to punish Iraq for the freeze, the United States
and Britain were hoping to pass a resolution that would suspend
regular sanctions reviews, including a critical six-month review in
October, until Iraq resumes cooperation.
	   Though highly symbolic, the move would effectively end Iraq's
chances of having the 8-year-old sanctions lifted. In the past,
however, the reviews have never led to any easing of the measures.
	   Permanent council members China and Russia, in particular, had
wanted an incentive for Iraq to comply _ a comprehensive review _
be included in any resolution that suspended the regular sanctions
reviews. The two, along with France, generally take a more
sympathetic line towards Baghdad.

Church offers every tribute to Calcutta's nun _ except speeded-up
</HEADLINE>
sainthood &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Mother Teresa's church is planning lavish
public commemorations for Saturday's first anniversary of her
death, including an homage from Pope John Paul II, memorial Mass in
St. Peter's Basilica and a television spectacular from the Vatican.
	   The Roman Catholic Church's tributes _ including the Italian TV
special from a Vatican hall draped in the blue and white of her
saris _ offer everything but the speeded-up sainthood that her
followers say the extraordinary nun of Calcutta deserves.
	   Even for Mother Teresa, the Vatican made clear again Thursday,
the mandatory five-year waiting period stands.
	   ``Rome has got its rules,'' sighed Calcutta Archbishop Ivan
Dias, at the Vatican for Thursday's kick-off of the anniversary
events.
	   Mother Teresa died Sept. 5, 1997, in Calcutta at 87, after a
life spent aiding the poor and wretched through her Missionaries of
Charity order and other good works.
	   Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi will preside at Saturday morning's
memorial Mass in St. Peter's.
	   Saturday night's television tribute will feature everyone from
Kofi Annan and Yassir Arafat to Ben Kingsley and Italian singers
and celebrities _ including a model, paying her respects to Mother
Teresa's own ``beauty.''
	   The pope will open the program with remarks on the woman known
in her time as a living saint.
	   In October, John Paul quashed speculation that the church might
expedite sainthood for Mother Teresa. Rules signed by the pope
himself in 1983 mandate a five-year wait after death before the
process of canonization can begin.
	   ``I think it is necessary to follow the normal way,'' the pope
said at the time.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Thursday the pope's
position is unchanged, despite growing calls from India _ where
nuns have begun collecting supporting evidence of miracles _ and
elsewhere for an exception.
	   ``He prefers to apply to everyone the same rules,''
Navarro-Valls said, and offered solace for the wait.
	   ``Once the whole process begins, maybe the whole thing will be
very quick.''
	   Even those devoted to Mother Teresa are divided about sainthood,
with some saying the nun wouldn't want the fuss.
	   The Calcutta archbishop said the most appropriate tribute is a
hospital being built in her honor in Tirana, Albania, Mother
Teresa's homeland. Supporters hope to get enough donations to open
the hospital in 2000, the church's Jubilee Year.
	   Dias himself sees the calls to sanctify Mother Teresa as ``the
living voice of the people,'' similar to the movements of the early
saints, before there were rules and waiting periods.
	   But Mother Teresa's followers are content to wait, if need be,
Calcutta's archbishop said.
	   ``She has been venerated, even without a title,'' he said.

Russia's new rich reeling from financial crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The glitzy shops in the Manezh shopping center
that used to sell dlrs 400 shirts, diamonds, rare wines and other
luxuries to Russia's new wealthy elite are empty.
	   These days, bored shop assistants stare at the empty corridors.
Some shops have closed temporarily ``for technical reasons.''
	   ``Nobody buys anything,'' says Veronika, a saleswoman at a posh
clothes boutique.
	   The new rich were the first to benefit from Russia's post-Soviet
economic reforms, amassing wealth, property and businesses. Now
they are among the first to feel the country's financial and
political turmoil as the currency drops sharply and the stock
market collapses.
	   Poor Russians, who have struggled to make ends meet for years,
have little to lose.
	   However, the wealthy are watching their world crumble. Their
stores are closing, the banks they keep their money in are failing
and they are being cut off by their business partners abroad.
	   Nobody knows how many people in Russia are wealthy. In a country
where avoiding taxes is a national obsession and fear of crime is
pervasive, the rich enjoy their wealth behind closed doors. But
thousands of Russians, perhaps tens of thousands, have made large
fortunes in recent years.
	   Although many rich Russians have investments and property
abroad, they also have Russian assets that are becoming less
valuable. Many are suffering major, even irreparable losses as the
economy unravels.
	   ``I did not lose money in cash, see,'' said Arthur Zaslavsky.
``My money is invested in apartments,''
	   The 35-year-old businessman invested his fortune in real estate,
betting that prices would rise. Now he faces owning empty
apartments that are worth a fraction of what he paid for them.
	   Full of glossy cafes, chic shops, glass elevators and marble
balustrades, the newly built Manezh in Moscow was meant to be a
showcase of the new Russia and its wealthy elite.
	   But it is quiet now. A few Muscovites fleeing an early autumn
rain duck inside, but they barely glance at the shop windows filled
with dlrs 2,000 suits and dresses.
	   The fallout also is starting to hit Russia's small but important
middle class.
	   The crisis is squeezing many small- and medium-sized private
companies, once touted as proof that Russia's economic reforms were
working. The companies are owned by the middle class and employ
many middle-class people, including managers, accountants and
lawyers.
	   Russia runs on cash. There are no checking accounts, and
mortgages are almost unheard of. Many Russians keep their savings
at home.
	   Tatyana Kovalyova, office manager of a large company that
imports automobile accessories and building materials, has
desperately tried to squeeze some cash out of banks that are nearly
paralyzed. The employees' salaries and her own dlrs 1,200 monthly
pay, about 10 times the average Russian wage, depend on it.
	   The company lost dlrs 20,000 on one deal because it was paid
after the ruble had collapsed, and the currency's drop wiped out
its profit.
	   The firm has no funds to make payments to foreign suppliers,
Kovalyova said.
	   ``For the first time, nobody really understands a thing. I've
not seen anything like this,'' she said. ``We went to some
parliament people, asking what will happen. They don't know. We
went to our banker. He doesn't know.''
	   Feeling that things are hopeless, some wealthy Russians just
want to have a good time, spending money in casinos while they
still have it.
	   Employees at a popular Moscow casino say the crisis has driven
more people to their club, even though the entrance fee has almost
doubled to dlrs 45.
	   Stacks of dlrs 2 chips tower in front of the players. Somebody
loses and changes another dlrs 100 chip.
	   Two girls in black mini dresses leave, one complaining loudly
that the place was ``full of those amateurs.''

Albright appeals to democracies to stand by Russian reformers

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The United States is urging free-market
democracies to stand by reform-minded groups in Russia and make
clear there is ``no going backwards'' if the country is to play a
role in the global economy.
	   ``It is up to countries with market economies and democracy to
continue to encourage those (reform) forces within Russia and to
make it very clear that there is no going backwards,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters Thursday.
	   ``To be part of the global economy, there are certain rules that
need to be followed,'' she added.
	   Albright stopped by Vienna on her way home from the U.S.-Russia
summit to brief Austrian and European Union officials on the
results of President Bill Clinton's talks with Russia's president,
Boris Yeltsin.
	   Developments in Russia are expected to be high on the agenda
when EU foreign ministers meet this weekend in Salzburg, Austria.
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, whose government holds the
rotating EU presidency, said Russia must stick by its reform
program if it expects financial help from the 15 EU members.
	   Albright told reporters that during the Moscow summit, Yeltsin
``was very much in charge during the meetings'' with Clinton,
despite speculation that the Russian leader's political position
was crumbling.
	   But she acknowledged the ``increasing strength'' among Communist
lawmakers, who have been blocking confirmation of Yeltsin's choice
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Following her meetings with the Austrians, Albright told
representatives of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that ``the problem right now is that the
Russian people are hurting.''
	   ``Many believe that democracy has not empowered them to improve
their lives,'' she told the OSCE, headquartered in Vienna. ``This
is dangerous because Russia cannot emerge from its difficulties
unless its people take responsibility for shaping their country's
future.''
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the chaos in
Moscow showed once again that the free-market democracies,
including the United States and the EU members, were the only
groups capable of coping with global crises.

Aussie rancher finds 100 million-year-old dinosaur bones

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, Australia (AP) _ Rob Ievers had just finished a cattle
roundup on his northwest Queensland ranch when his brother, Ian,
noticed what he thought was a tree root protruding in a gully.
	   That chance encounter a decade ago has led Ievers into a
sideline _ dinosaurs.
	   ``Ian snapped it off, and when we looked closely at it we
realized it was a jaw of fossilized stone, with a row of teeth
encased in it,'' Ievers recalls.
	   ``When we went back to look and saw there was more, we began
digging and found an entire head. We knew then what we'd found was
very different.''
	   The Ievers brothers were amazed to learn the large head belonged
to a 100 million-year-old marine reptile called a pliosaur, which
swam the ancient inland sea.
	   With assistance from the Queensland Museum, the entire pliosaur
was dug out. Measuring more than 4.25 meters (12 feet) long, it was
unearthed almost intact, with its flippers outstretched.
	   ``When things from the inland sea died, they sank to the bottom
of the ocean, developed putrefaction gases, then rose to the top,''
Ievers explains. ``Through the natural process of rotting, other
animals would have fed off them and bits and pieces would have
fallen off, so usually you would only find a small piece of these
huge animals as fossils.
	   ``But when this pliosaur was uncovered it was almost like it had
died yesterday _ it was 96 percent complete. The chances of finding
it whole was like winning the lottery.''
	   Although they found it 10 years ago, the ``world's best
pliosaur'' has been on public display only for three years, since
Ievers opened the Marine Fossil Museum in Richmond, 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Townsville.
	   He decided to establish the museum soon after finding the
pliosaur. After persuading the town council to buy the old movie
theater to house the museum, he began a fundraising campaign among
his neighbors as well as seeking sponsorship from local businesses.
	   Ievers claims his museum has the most comprehensive display of
inland sea reptiles anywhere in Australia.
	   Just three months after finding the pliosaur, dubbed the
``Ievers' crocodile'' because its head resembles a croc, the Ievers
brothers made another significant discovery.
	   Under about 20 centimeters (six inches) of soil in a 1,620
hectare (4,000-acre) sheep paddock, they found an almost complete
ankylosaurus.
	   That creature, which is 80 percent complete, is also on display
at the museum. Widely considered Australia's best preserved
dinosaur, its skin and armor are still visible.
	   The museum covers the period when a vast inland sea covered
northwestern Queensland. Other fossil displays include squid, fish,
shells, turtles and the swimming reptiles known as ichthyosaurus
and woolungasaurus.
	   Ievers still has his cattle ranch but now spends three days a
week running the museum. Raised in Richmond, he says it is
rewarding to see his home town becoming a tourist stop because of
the museum.
	   ``The locals here have become very aware of fossil finds. I
spend a lot of time looking at items they bring in and quite often
they're just ordinary rocks. But I don't discourage it, because I
know something interesting will always turn up.''
	   Ievers says he would never sell the prehistoric collection, or
move it to a larger city facility.
	   ``Richmond is one of the richest areas in Australia for fossils,
and people have been making small discoveries here since the turn
of the century,'' he says.
	   ``You just have to know where to look and what to look for. I go
out for picnics with the family on weekends and we always find
something.''

Shipwreck explorers' find updates lore of piracy

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Legend has it that ``Black Sam'' Bellamy was on
his way to a rendezvous with a lover when his pirate ship sank in a
ferocious storm off Cape Cod in 1717.
	   Since then, the wreckage of the Whydah _ and most of its
five-ton cargo of gold and silver _ have eluded archeologists. They
have found bits and pieces, but not the pirate's chief stash of
loot.
	   This summer, a tantalizing underwater trail of gold coins and
guns led researcher Barry Clifford to a perfectly preserved chunk
of what appears to be the ship's hull.
	   ``We found wood and I thought, `Oh, my God!''' said Clifford,
53. ``We got our stuff (scuba gear) on in double-time.''
	   Clifford said the July 19 find came on the final day of a
three-day expedition at a site off the coast of Wellfleet on the
easternmost tip of the Massachusetts coastline.
	   After days of retrieving ancient coins and cannons, the crew was
exhausted and close to giving up, Clifford said, when they decided
to dig one more hole in an untouched spot in about 25 feet (8
meters) of water.
	   To their amazement, 10 feet (3 meters) below the ocean floor
they struck a large wooden object that seemed to be covered in tin.
	   Clifford said the 30-foot (9-meter) piece of wood appeared to be
a section of the Whydah's gunpowder room, covered with tin to keep
explosives dry.
	   ``When we rubbed it a bit it became very shiny,'' said Clifford,
who discovered the first traces of the legendary ship in 1984 about
a quarter-mile (nearly a half-kilometer) offshore.
	   Since then, Clifford has uncovered the ship's bell inscribed
with ``The Whydah Gally 1716,'' along with more than 100,000
artifacts, including a sword-sharpening wheel, cannons, lead shot,
tens of thousands of coins and even the remains of a pirate's leg,
still encased in silk stocking and a leather dress shoe.
	   The 280-year-old Whydah site _ the only documented wreckage of a
pirate ship _ is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places.
	   Last year, archeologists off the coast of North Carolina
discovered what they believe is a portion of Queen Anne's Revenge,
flagship of the fabled pirate Blackbeard. But that find has not
been historically authenticated.
	   Artifacts are continually being salvaged from the Whydah, but
never had explorers pinpointed such a large and intact piece of the
ship's skeleton, Clifford said.
	   They hope the hull section will unlock the location of the
mother lode of Bellamy's treasure _ gold and silver believed
plundered from more than 50 other ships, said Clifford.
	   The discovery adds a chapter in the saga of Samuel ``Black Sam''
Bellamy, a 28-year-old English swashbuckler who epitomized the era
chronicled in Daniel Defoe's ``The History of the Pirates,'' when
bands of rebellious sailors roamed the seas.
	   The Whydah, a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long), three-masted
galley, was named after the African ``widow bird'' and seaport of
the same name.
	   The ship was captured by Bellamy and his crew in 1716 as it
headed back to England from its maiden voyage to the Caribbean to
sell African slaves.
	   Legend has it that Bellamy turned the ship toward Cape Cod to
meet with his love, a local girl named Maria Hallet. But a deadly
storm pummeled the Whydah, and Black Sam was never seen again.
	   The Whydah explorers, sponsored by the National Geographic
Society, have spent much of the past 14 summers searching for the
probable burial ground of the one-time slave ship.
	   Using underwater cameras and other high-tech tools, Clifford and
his crew painstakingly charted wreckage discoveries and traced
patterns left by tiny grains of gold.
	   ``It's like Hansel and Gretel, but rather than following bread
crumbs, we're following a trail of gold dust,'' said Clifford.
``We've been looking for the wooden hull of a ship which doesn't
give off a huge magnetic hit like a cannon would.''
	   The history of piracy in the late 1600s and early 1700s has been
simplified by filmmakers and some historians, and Clifford believes
finds like his can become teaching tools.
	   ``We've learned that pirates were a maritime revolutionary
group,'' he said. ``Sailors brutalized by their captains and freed
slaves joined willingly. They saw themselves as Robin Hood's men.''
	   The handful of pirates who escaped the Whydah sinking were tried
in Boston, and six were hanged, Clifford said.
	   When the new discoveries are brought to shore, they will be
evaluated for authenticity and may be exhibited locally at the
Expedition Whydah Sea Lab and Learning Center in Provincetown. They
will likely appear in a National Geographic Society exhibit in
Washington next spring.
	   ``This is not a treasure hunt,'' he said. ``Nothing will ever be
sold.''

Caldera says he won't leave office early
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Battling an economic crisis, President
Rafael Caldera has rejected calls that he resign to allow the
winner of the Dec. 6 election to take over early.
	   ``I am prepared to govern until Feb. 2, not one day more or one
day less,'' Caldera said in a nationally televised speech Thursday,
referring to the day the new president is to be sworn in.
	   Caldera, 82, a two-time president, added that he has ``the
respect and the backing of the Armed Forces and all the important
sectors of national life.''
	   Leading presidential candidate Hugo Chavez, the leader of a
failed military coup six years ago, has called for Caldera to leave
office early so the new president can address the crisis.
	   Caldera spoke during a ceremony at Miraflores presidential
palace, where Congressional leaders formally presented him with
legislation approved this week that allows him to decree certain
laws to help combat the economic troubles.
	   Tumbling prices for international oil have cost Venezuela's
economy several billion dollars this year and contributed to a 69
percent drop in the stock market.
	   Venezuela is one of the top foreign suppliers of oil to the
United States.

Death penalty: One Texas county does it best
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY303-306; Graphic DEATH PENALTY &QL; 
 &UR; By ARLENE LEVINSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Toward the end of June in a dimly lit county
courtroom, Arthur Lee Burton was fighting for his life. He was
accused of strangling a jogger with her own shoelaces. He didn't do
it, he insisted.
	   In another courtroom around that time, Coy Wayne Wesbrook took
the stand in a rumpled suit and ashen face. He massacred five
people, among them his ex-wife. Wesbrook claimed he never meant to.
	   Both men wept. But no tears or pleas could stop the mighty force
that is the death penalty in Harris County, Texas. Juries decided
they were guilty and deserved to die.
	   At a time when the death penalty is on the rise again, endorsed
by most Americans, this place does it best.
	   Since capital punishment was reinstated in Texas in 1976, Harris
County convictions have led to 53 of the state's 155 executions. In
the same period, the county has killed as many killers as Virginia,
which has more than twice the population. And Virginia's is the
busiest death chamber after Texas'.
	   Among the reasons are a hawkish district attorney, his army of
prosecutors, a weak system of court-appointed defense lawyers,
state law that bars juries from learning a life sentence really
means decades in Texas _ plus lots of practice.
	   This is where pickax murderer Karla Faye Tucker was sentenced to
die. On Feb. 3 she became the first woman executed in Texas since
the Civil War.
	   Executions, which peaked nationwide at 199 in 1935, had become
rare by 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the death
penalty as ``cruel and unusual punishment'' because states used it
in arbitrary and capricious ways. Executions were allowed again in
1976 when the high court approved new, narrower laws in Texas,
Florida and Georgia, paving the way for reinstatement nationwide.
At the same time, Texas was among the first to trade its electric
chair for the cleaner and quieter lethal injection.
	   Today, 38 states, the federal government and military have the
death penalty. The overall death row population is approaching
3,500. Of these, Texas had 452 inmates in August, second only to
California's 510.
	   But Texas, the second most populous state, leads them all in
executions. It sends so many people to its death house in
Hunstville, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Houston, that the
customary hour of executions was rolled back from midnight to the
more convenient 6 p.m.
	   Even for Texas, Harris County sets an awesome pace. A pulsing
urban giant with Houston at its hub, this large county has 3.1
million people _ one-sixth of Texas' population. But it accounts
for one-third of the executions, and nearly one-third of death row.
	   The murder rate _ last year it was 10.4 per 100,000 population _
is lower than comparable urban counties'.
	   The county's ethnic mix with 54 percent Anglo, 22 percent
Hispanic and 18 percent black is typical for a lot of urban
America. Here, immigrants and cross-country transplants jostle with
the heirs of founding wildcatters for their piece of the Texas
dream. And there is plenty to share where shipping, high-tech
industries and huge gas refineries have squeezed the rice farms and
ranches to the rural fringe.
	   Few in the county call the death penalty a deterrent. It's more
a matter of being fed up with violent crime, according to Tanya
Linn, an alternate juror in Wesbrook's trial. It's ``the
eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-tooth thing,'' she said.
	   Four years ago, the Scripps Howard Texas Poll found 83 percent
in this part of the state favored the death penalty. In June that
number was 71 percent. The results are in line with similar
national polls.
	   At the wrong end of downtown Houston, long steamy blocks from
glittering office towers and amid an asphalt sea of parking lots,
stands the Harris County Court House. Behind tan brick walls, its
eight floors swarm with tense jurors, sweating defendants, furious
victims and opposing hordes of lawyers. They lean against grimy
walls murmuring confidences and crowd wooden benches that line the
narrow corridors.
	   This is where Burton, a 28-year-old cement finisher with four
children, was tried for last year's slaying of Nancy Adleman, a
48-year-old mother of three.
	   Burton said his interrogators slapped and browbeat him into
making a false confession.
	   Wesbrook, a onetime security guard, was tried in the same week
in the same place. The defendant, who is 40 and has a daughter,
admitted the crime. He said he had gone to patch things up with
Gloria Jean Coons, his 32-year-old former wife, and found her
giving a party where she had sex with two guests. He went to his
truck intending to leave, he said, but someone took his keys so he
returned with a high-powered rifle.
	   ``He didn't mean to kill anybody,'' Robert Loper, one of two
defense attorneys, told the jury.
	   ``This is evidence of cold-blooded murder,'' countered
prosecutor Hans Nielsen, lifting the killer's gun above his head.
``He knew exactly what he was doing, and he did it.''
	   Burton's fate was decided in seven days, Wesbrook's in 11.
	   Both requested new trials, a routine move before appeals begin.
Wesbrook's bid was denied. A Sept. 9 hearing was set for Burton.
	   People ascribe Harris County's extraordinary numbers to District
Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. Named 19 years ago to fill his boss's
unexpired term, Holmes has won every election since. Voters
evidently like the way he runs his team of 200-plus prosecutors.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swissair officials and counselors expect to spend
at least another day breaking the news to relatives that their
loved ones died on Flight 111 before making the passenger list
public.
	   But the United Nations disclosed that the 229 victims included
some prominent U.N. officials who frequently used the flight
between the organization's New York headquarters and its main
European office.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was deeply saddened by
the deaths and sent condolences to victims' loved ones,
``particular to the relatives and friends of those who lost their
lives in the service of the ideals of the United Nations.''
	   According to employers and family members, passengers on Flight
111 included:
	   _Dr. Jonathan Mann, a top pioneer in the fight against AIDS and
current dean of Allegheny University of the Health Sciences School
of Public Health in Philadelphia. Mann, an American, was the first
director of the World Health Organization's global program on AIDS
and was en route to a meeting of AIDS experts.
	   _Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, Mann's American wife. A professor in
the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore. She specialized in research into vaccines.
	   _Pierce Gerety, director of African Great Lakes operations at
the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees. An American, Gerety was a
veteran of refugee operations in Sudan, Philippines, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Somalia and the Great Lakes area around Rwanda, Congo and
Burundi.
	   _Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, UNHCR senior social welfare officer. A
Frenchwoman with seven years experience at the refugee agency.
	   _Joachim Bilger, controller of the World Intellectual Property
Organization.
	   _Ludwig Beaumler, a WIPO official.
	   _Yves de Roussan, UNICEF regional adviser for Central and
Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
	   _Ingrid Acevedo, the director of public relations for the U.S.
Committee for UNICEF.
	   _Dr. Roger R. Williams, a recognized expert in the field of
cardiovascular genetics, and a professor of internal medicine at
the University of Utah. Williams was flying to Geneva to chair a
meeting on one of his projects at the World Health Organization
	   _Dr. Klaus Kinder-Geiger, a top physicist at the Nuclear Theory
Group at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. A
native of Germany, Kinder-Geiger was working on a computerized
model of large nuclei at high energies.
	   _Dr. Per Spanne, a pioneer in the field of microbeam radiation
therapy and diagnostic X-rays. Spanne, from Sweden was also a guest

HOUSTON: 200-plus prosecutors.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The blunt-talking 57-year-old Republican, a familiar face in
Texas with his handlebar mustache, is acutely aware of being a
media attraction and declined a face-to-face interview, agreeing
only to talk by telephone.
	   He's never seen an execution and doesn't want to, he said,
although ``there are some I would be tickled to death to do
myself.''
	   But seeking the death penalty is nothing personal, he said.
``I'm a lawyer. I follow the law.''
	   Prosecutors in Harris County have won more than twice as many
death sentences as those in Dallas County, the next biggest urban
county in Texas, since the 1970s.
	   ``Our standards may be different,'' said Norman Kinne, Dallas
first assistant district attorney. ``I know Mr. Holmes runs a very
efficient office. I have admiration. I'm not saying we're better or
worse. It's a matter of philosophy.''
	   One critic is Richard Burr, a defense attorney in Houston. ``The
DA's office in Harris County is answerable to no one,'' he said.
``It has no check on its own power.''
	   ``We're spending millions of dollars killing people,'' said
another critic, Harris County District Judge Douglas Shaver. He
supports the death penalty but feels it's pursued too often in his
county and courtroom _ ``to the extent of being abusive.''
	   Another complaint is that the odds are unfairly stacked against
murder suspects.
	   For one thing, Harris county has no public defender agency, so
trial judges must find defense attorneys willing to work cheap. The
county pays a lead attorney dlrs 20,000 at most per case, an
assistant dlrs 15,000.
	   Wilford Anderson, a prosecutor-turned-criminal defense lawyer,
was tapped to represent Arthur Burton. He takes maybe two capital
murders a year, he said, and sometimes digs into his own pocket for
the defense. ``The time that's involved, the preparation, the
actual trial itself. It can be substantial,'' Anderson said.
	   Because of stories of incompetent defense lawyers, the county
now requires attorneys appointed for death penalty cases to pass a
special exam.
	   Better lawyers might save some people from conviction, but they
also give the condemned fewer grounds on which to make their
appeals.
	   Until 1995, Texas appellants had no automatic right to a lawyer.
Now they do, and the state provides money, but not much: dlrs
15,000 for the lawyer and about dlrs 5,500 for an investigator and
expert witnesses. Appeals to federal courts pay better, up to dlrs
125 an hour for the lawyer and no cap. But by then it's usually too
late.
	   Texas capital murder trials come in two parts. If the jury finds
the defendant guilty, a second trial is held to choose between
death and life imprisonment.
	   Critics object that juries go for the death penalty because
state law forbids judges to tell them that a life sentence means at
least 40 years in prison.
	   ``The Texas rule unquestionably tips the scales in favor of a
death sentence that a fully informed jury might not impose,'' four
U.S. Supreme Court justices wrote in an opinion last year, even as
the full court let a Texas death sentence stand. Harris County
judges are taking note, and legislators may change the law.
	   At the same time, the high court is getting tougher on appeals,
as is Congress, Texas and other states where new laws seek to
shorten the time between sentence and death. In Texas the average
time on death row currently approaches 10 years. New limits on
Texas appeals should cut that lag by two or three years.
	   Race is also presumed by some to figure in Harris County's high
death row count. Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities are 46
percent of the population. But they make up 75 percent of Harris
County convicts now on death row.
	   Is that because they commit more murders, or because they are
more likely to be targeted for a capital trial? ``I think ... if
you're a defendant of color, that you're more likely to be tried in
a capital case,'' said Anderson, Burton's attorney.

Japan steelmaker goes bust in biggest postwar failure of
</HEADLINE>
manufacturer

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toa Steel Co., a midsized affiliate of leading
Japanese steelmaker NKK Corp., has collapsed under a massive debt
load in Japan's biggest failure of a manufacturer since the end of
World War II.
	   NKK Corp., which owns a 52 percent stake in Toa, will take over
the operations of the effectively bankrupt steelmaker in April, NKK
spokesman Ryosuke Nishiyama said Friday.
	   Toa plans to sell off assets to help cover debts of around 250
billion yen (dlrs 1.86 billion), but NKK said it still expects to
suffer 60 billion yen (dlrs 45 million) in losses due to Toa's
liquidation.
	   In addition to NKK, other major shareholders in Toa include
Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp., which owns 8.8 percent of
the company, and Fuji Bank Ltd., which has a 1.2 percent stake.
	   Toa's collapse comes less than a month after Mita Industrial
Co., a Japanese maker of copy machines with debts of 205 billion
yen (dlrs 1.53 billion), sought court protection from creditors.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The 229 people aboard Swissair
Flight 111 had time to prepare for the worst while the pilots
struggled vainly to keep the smoking, groaning jetliner aloft long
enough for an emergency landing.
	   Some passengers donned their life vests during the several
minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet crashed and broke apart
Wednesday night in choppy seas off Nova Scotia, Swissair officials
said Thursday. The plane, which carried 137 Americans, left a slick
of jet fuel, floating luggage and human remains, but no survivors.
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were, you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat that joined a makeshift flotilla that
fruitlessly searched for people to rescue. The cause of the crash
was not known.
	   Aboard the jet flown by one of the world's safest airlines were
14 crew members and 215 passengers. There were two infants, several
United Nations employees and one of the foremost leaders in the
global fight against AIDS, Dr. Jonathan Mann.
	   By nightfall Thursday, authorities estimated that 60 bodies had
been recovered, as well as an array of aircraft parts. But Lt.
Commander Jacques Fauteux, one of the search coordinators, said
none of the pieces was any larger than an automobile. Fauteux said
more than 1,000 people were still involved in the search, most of
them aboard a dozen navy and coast vessels.
	   The Geneva-bound plane departed New York's Kennedy International
Airport at 8:18 p.m. EDT Wednesday (0018 GMT Thursday) and crashed
90 minutes later, at 9:48 p.m. EDT (0148 GMT Thursday) near
Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude
Donzel said.
	   Sixteen minutes passed between the crew's first report of
trouble _ including smoke in the cockpit, in Canadian airspace at
33,000 feet (9,900 meters) _ and the plane's disappearance from
radar scopes at about 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), according to Roy
Bears of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Five minutes after the aircraft crew reported the smoke and
headed toward Halifax, they began descending to dump fuel, said
Tony Rushton, vice president of the Canadian air traffic
controllers' union.
	   In another five minutes the crew declared an emergency, and just
moments later, the aircraft's transponder, which automatically
transmits its identity and altitude, stopped functioning, he said.
	   Controllers could still monitor the plane on radar until all
contact was finally lost.
	   The pilot, Urs Zimmermann, 50, tried to coax the plane to an
emergency landing at the Halifax airport, 35 miles (56 kilometers)
from the crash site. The pilot initially proposed heading for
Boston, but air traffic controllers pointed out Halifax was closer
_ 42 miles (67 kilometers) compared to 192 miles (307 kilometers).
	   Swissair said the plane was seven to 10 minutes away from the
airport in Halifax, when it plunged into waters about 150 feet (45
meters) deep.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington
sent 10 experts to Canada and experts from Switzerland also were
deployed.
	   Canadian officials and the White House said there was no
indication the crash resulted from a terrorist act. The Canadians
said their intelligence services were in contact with the FBI
nonetheless.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh said his agents were examining the
passenger list and working to ensure key evidence was properly
preserved.
	   ``We don't have any indication at this point what caused that
tragedy,'' Freeh said.
	   In towns along the scenic but often treacherous Nova Scotia
coast, residents reported hearing sputtering noises from an
aircraft passing overhead, then a thundering crash.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships hurried out to the
crash site, about six miles (10 kilometers) off the coast of
Peggy's Cove. The picturesque fishing village _ population 60 _ is
popular with tourists for its pirate lore and much-photographed
lighthouse, but the area also is known for shipwrecks and other
maritime tragedies.
	   After the first few hours of the nightlong search, the mood
among boat crews turned grim when reports of survivors proved
false. Instead, boat after boat radioed to a naval command vessel
that more body bags were needed to cradle human remains scattered
among aircraft debris over several square miles (kilometers) of the
Atlantic.
	   Searchlights from boats, helicopters and planes illuminated the
area during the night. Heavy surf _ a remnant of Hurricane Danielle
_ hampered the first hours of the rescue effort and rain fell until
dawn.
	   Searchers said they had located a chunk of the plane's fuselage
believed to be intact on the ocean floor. Divers planned to search
for the flight recorders, which could help determine the cause of
the disaster.
	   Swissair and its partner, Delta Airlines, were flying relatives
from New York and Switzerland to Halifax. Nova Scotia officials
offered to provide 900 hotel rooms for the families, and pledged to
protect their privacy as they faced the grim chore of identifying
loved ones.
	   Swissair said the passenger list would not be released until
family members are notified. In addition to the 136 American
passengers and an American crew member, it said 39 Swiss nationals
and 30 French citizens were killed. Others were from Britain,
Canada, Germany, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain, St. Kitts and Russia.
	   The United Nations confirmed that seven U.N. workers returning
to offices in Geneva and the wife of one of the officials were on
board.

Late bounce halves latest 200-point drop by Dow

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late bounce sliced a 200-point plunge in half
as a jittery stock market continued to swing violently in the
aftermath of Monday's brutal selloff.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average finished Thursday with a loss
of 100.15 at 7,682.22, about 2.9 percent below this year's starting
point and 17.7 percent below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The blue-chip barometer recovered several times during the day
from steep declines, including a 203-point deficit with just a half
hour left to the session.
	   Broader indicators also slid hard Thursday before a pre-Labor
Day session that may find the market vulnerable to more wild swings
if traders leave early for the long weekend.
	   The market swung higher and lower throughout the session, which
was ushered in by another day of big losses overseas amid
discouraging developments in Russia and Asia.
	   ``This is a market that continues to be rife with fear,'' said
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. ``It's
very difficult to buy things when they're down, especially with the
barrage we've been getting with this pendulum swing of pessimism.
	   A 512-point plunge on Monday and a 138-point slide Tuesday
morning pushed the Dow as low as 7,400, a drop of nearly 2,000
points from the July record. The Dow rose as much as 125 points
Wednesday after rallying to a 288-point gain on Tuesday. But a late
selloff Wednesday left the blue-chip measure 45 points lower at the
close.
	   The battered Russian ruble fell sharply again Thursday as Boris
Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament headed for a showdown vote
over the president's candidate to lead a new government.
	   Meanwhile, the continuing economic crisis in Asia claimed more
casualties in Japan. Electronics maker Hitachi warned of its first
annual loss since the end of World War II and Toa Steel announced
plans to close in the biggest-ever failure of a Japanese
manufacturer.
	   Financial companies, many have which stepped forward in the past
week to warn of heavy losses on loans to Russia, took another
beating Thursday.
	   J.P. Morgan fell 6 1/2 to 88 3/4, and American Express fell 6
1/2 to 77 1/4, accounting for more than half of the Dow's decline.
	   ``It looks as if bank stocks right now seem to be discounting a
virtual grinding halt to business around the world. Many of these
stocks have pulled back in less than two weeks between 20 and 30
percent,'' said Bleier.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 fell 8.21 to 982.26, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 20.99 to 1,571.86.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite totaled 1.023 billion
shares, topping a billion for the sixth straight session. NYSE-only
volume, which doesn't include trading of NYSE-listed stocks on
other U.S. exchanges, was expected to surpass the one-week record
of 4.016 billion set last October soon after Friday's open.
	   The NYSE composite index fell 4.74 to 489.89, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.91 to 598.70. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.36 to 346.29.
	   In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 3.2 percent, London's
FT-SE 100 fell 2.2 percent, and the Paris CAC-40 fell 2.2 percent.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.

Fernandez needs extra effort to advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It wasn't easy, but Mary Joe Fernandez reached
the third round of the U.S. Open on Thursday.
	   Fernandez, a three-time Grand Slam finalist but unseeded this
time, saved six match points to beat Alexandra Fusai of France 6-3,
4-6, 7-6 (12-10). The match lasted almost 2 1/2 hours, with the
last set going more than an hour.
	   Fernandez was sidelined for five months after wrist surgery last
December.
	   ``It was tough watching the French and Wimbledon and watching
everyone improve and get better, but it is great to be back,''
Fernandez said.
	   She returned to the WTA circuit in April.
	   ``It was too soon. My wrist wasn't ready yet and I just started
to play at the end of July,'' Fernandez said. ``I am still a little
bit awkward on the court. It is hard when you have been out for
such a long time. I am still a bit hesitant out there.''
	   Fernandez has made the finals of the Australian Open twice and
the French Open once, and won the season-ending Chase Championships
in 1996.
	   Fernandez had only a 5-5 match record for the year entering the
U.S. Open but now has victories over Fusai and Tina Krizan of
Slovenia. She'll now meet 11th-seeded Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; UNDER PRESSURE: &LR;  Who's the best tennis player under pressure?
According to statistics, the best in the U.S. Open last year were
Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Patrick Rafter and Greg Rusedski _
the four singles finalists.
	   IBM developed a system of rating players' performance in certain
situations, such as first- and second-serves, return games and
break points.
	   ``It's based strictly on points won and lost,'' said Leo Levin,
the IBM statistics analyst. ``Other stats such as unforced errors
and net advances tell you more about how a player plays.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CHAMPIONSHIP SCHEDULE CHANGED: &LR;  For the first time in
tournament history, there will be early morning and evening
sessions of the season-ending Chase Championships, which brings
together the top 16 women's singles and top eight doubles teams of
the year.
	   Tournament organizers also said that general admission tickets
will be sold for the morning sessions, allowing fans to get as
close as possible to the players.
	   To date, defending champion Jana Novotna, who won Wimbledon this
year, No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis and No. 2 Lindsay Davenport have
qualified for the tournament. It is the only tournament that has a
best-of-five final for the women.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; COSTLY COACHING: &LR;  Magui Serna found it costly to get coaching.
	   The Spanish player was fined dlrs 1,000 by the tournament
organizers for getting advice during her first-round match in the
U.S. Open. Rules prohibit coaching during matches.
	   It didn't help Serna, though. She lost the match to Maria Vento
of Venezuela.
	   In other money matters, Andrei Pavel of Romania was fined dlrs
1,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct in his first-round match and
Hicham Arazi was penalized dlrs 750 for racket abuse in his loss
against defending champion Patrick Rafter.

Tennis becomes afterthought at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with Rafter, Kournikova victories &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The roar of jets passing over the U.S. Open took
on a ominous tone Thursday. Players chasing Grand Slam glory
struggled with a tragic crash that nearly claimed one of their own.
	   While top-seeded Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis reached the
third round, tennis was mostly an afterthought as players reflected
on the dangers they face while flying around the globe.
	   ``That's certainly one of your biggest fears, to say goodbye to
your loved ones and not return,'' said Andre Agassi, who also won a
second-round match. ``When you travel the world like we do, you're
bound to have your share of travel difficulties. But you pray to
God you don't have to go through something like that.''
	   Hingis moved one step closer to defending her title with a 7-6
(7-4), 6-0 victory over Iva Majoli a few hours after hearing about
the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the Canadian coast, killing
all 229 people aboard.
	   Hingis, a national heroine in her homeland of Switzerland, said
she knows many Swissair flight attendants.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' Hingis said. ``It's the airplane
I fly the most. When I heard I was like, `No way. Swissair seems
very safe.' It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up
there.''
	   Marc Rosset, the top Swiss male player, had been set to return
to Geneva on Flight 111 Wednesday night after losing in the first
round. Instead, he stayed an extra day to practice with players
still in the tourney.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you know you just realize that
for just changing your mind you are still alive,'' he said. ``I
think I am a little afraid, when you realize you were close to
dying.''
	   Sampras, seeking his fifth U.S. Open crown, had 23 aces while
overcoming early sloppiness to reach the third round with a 7-6
(7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Paul Goldstein.
	   Sampras had 43 unforced errors in the first two sets and double
faulted on set point to lose the second set, but settled down in
the final two sets. He will not face a seeded player before a
possible encounter with Agassi in the quarterfinals.
	   Agassi, seeded eighth, struggled midway through his match before
defeating Guillaume Raoux 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1, finishing
the match with his 10th ace.
	   Other men's winners included No. 3 Patrick Rafter, No. 6 Greg
Rusedski, No. 7 Alex Corretja, No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 12 Jonas
Bjorkman. Rafter, the defending champion, lost just seven games in
his straight-sets victory over Hernan Gumy.
	   Hingis' match had been scheduled for Wednesday night, but was
wiped out by torrential rain and strong wind. She was inconsistent
in the first set, bringing back memories of her loss to Majoli in
the 1997 French Open final. That was the only Grand Slam title
Hingis failed to win last year.
	   ``I was very nervous in the beginning,'' Hingis said. ``It was
very strange coming from last night not having played and having to
play the next day.''
	   Majoli was the aggressor in the first set, moving Hingis from
side to side and slamming groundstrokes past the defending
champion. Hingis sighed loudly in exasperation as she netted a
forehand late in the first set, and her soft second serve was
pummeled by Majoli.
	   But, just as the green concrete of Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed to
be turning into the red clay of Roland Garros, a jet flew noisily
over the court to return the New York feeling and Hingis made it
clear this would be no Paris replay.
	   After needing 45 minutes to win the first set, Hingis swept
through the second in 20 minutes. Just like the fly she swatted
away in her post-match news conference, Hingis had little trouble
with Majoli after the tiebreaker.
	   ``I loosened up and everything started to go in,'' Hingis said.
``I was strong and I didn't let her back in the game.''
	   Joining Hingis in the third round were No. 2 Lindsay Davenport,
No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, No. 5 Venus Williams, No. 7 Conchita
Martinez, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 12 Mary Pierce, No. 13
Amanda Coetzer and No. 15 Anna Kournikova, who wore a daisy in her
blonde hair.
	   Williams served at up to 117 mph (187 kmph) while winning 6-1,
6-3 over qualifier Anne Kremer, a Stanford student. Williams wore a
small black logo promoting the WTA Tour on the left shoulder strap
of her lime tennis dress, two days after being fined by the tour
for refusing to wear the logo.

10-year-old served summons to appear in drowning death

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A 10-year-old boy has been served a
summons to face manslaughter charges over the drowning death of a
six-year-old, court officials said Friday.
	   Juvenile Justice spokesman Ross Parker said it was believed the
boy would be the youngest person to be charged with manslaughter in
New South Wales state.
	   Macquarie Fields detectives said the summons was served on the
boy's parents after the Director of Public Prosecutions recommended
charges be laid.
	   Sgt. Steve Foster said the boy was the oldest of a group of
children present when Corey Davis drowned in the Georges River at
Macquarie Fields in Sydney's southwest on March 2.
	   Corey, who could not swim and was afraid of water, was allegedly
pushed into the Georges River while in the company of the group.
	   Police had spoken to the 10-year-old at his home on the night of
the drowning and at Macquarie Fields police station the following
day but his parents had refused to allow police to talk to him on a
second occasion.
	   ``He was advised by a solicitor . . . as is his right, he was
advised and it was decided by his mother that he wasn't going to
talk any further to the police,'' Foster said.
	   However the police investigation managed to gather enough
evidence for the DPP to recommend charges be laid.
	   A spokesman for the New South Wales attorney-general's
department said because the boy was below the age of 14 _ the age
of criminal responsibility _ the prosecution would have to prove
that he understood what he was doing and the consequences of his
actions.
	   That provision applies to children between the ages of 10 and 14
in the state.
	   The department said manslaughter carried a maximum penalty of 25
years jail, which the boy could serve in a Juvenile Justice Center
if found guilty.
	   He is due to appear in Bidura Children's court on Sept. 21.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Swissair flight that crashed off Nova
Scotia was the most frequently used by U.N. staff travelling
between U.N. headquarters in New York and the second-largest U.N.
office in Geneva, officials said.

staffers, two U.N.-affiliated officials and an officials' wife who
perished in the crash. At U.N. headquarters in New York, the U.N.
flag flew at half staff and officials made plans for a memorial
service, to be attended by the U.N. chief, sometime next week.

Mutiny edges Clash 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Roy Wegerle scored with 5:31 left lifting
Tampa Bay past San Jose 2-1 Thursday night in Major league Soccer.
	   The victory keeps alive the Mutiny's playoff hopes. Tampa Bay
trails Miami by four points in the battle for the fourth and final
Eastern Conference postseason berth. San Jose is seven points
behind fourth-place Dallas in the Western Conference.
	   The point-blank effort by Wegerle was his first Mutiny goal. The
forward was acquired for Roy Lassiter on April 27 in a trade with
D.C. United. Lassiter has 17 goals since the trade.
	   The Clash tied the match in the 80th minute on Ronald Cerritos'
header. Tampa Bay's Mauricio Ramos opened the scoring from 35 in
the 33rd minute.
	   Mutiny backup goalkeeper Doug Petras, who has two of his three
victories against the Clash, caught a break three minutes into the
game when Cerritos' shot hit the cross bar.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Todd Walker doubled and scored on Terry
Steinbach's single in the 12th inning Thursday, giving the
Minnesota Twins a 5-4 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   A season-low crowd of 7,072 at the Metrodome saw the Twins rally
twice late in the game. Minnesota made it 3-all with a run in the
ninth, and Matt Lawton's two-out homer in the 10th tied it at 4.
	   Eddie Guardado (3-1) retired all seven batters he faced. Rick
White (1-5) was the loser.
 &UR; Indians 2, Tigers 1
	   In Detroit, Dwight Gooden (7-6), with excellent defensive
support, improved to 5-2 on the road. He went seven innings for the
third time this year, giving up five hits and one walk with five
strikeouts.
	   Sandy Alomar and Enrique Wilson, the last two batters in
Cleveland's order, each singled off Justin Thompson (10-13) in the
third and scored on Kenny Lofton's double into the left-field
corner for a 2-0 lead.
	   Mike Jackson got the last two outs for his 35th save in 40
chances.
 &UR; Blue Jays 4, Red Sox 3
	   In Toronto, Shannon Stewart drove in the winning run in the 11th
with his fourth hit of the game as Toronto won its seventh
straight.
	   In the opener of a four-game series, the Blue Jays managed to
overcome Pedro Martinez and moved within a half-game of overtaking
Texas for second place in the AL wild-card race. With a sweep, the
Blue Jays would move within five games of the Red Sox, the
wild-card leader.
	   Martinez gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings,
struck out 11 and walked three.
	   Robert Person (3-0) got out of a second-and-third jam in the
11th by striking out Darren Lewis and Chris Snopek. Dario Veras
(0-1) was the loser.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning stock, bond and dollar rates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday morning
after senior finance ministry officials hinted Japan may intervene
to further strengthen its currency. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 134.31 yen in morning trading, down 1.83 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 134.70 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency weakened after the Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early
Friday that Japan may intervene in currency markets to support the
yen.
	   He was joined by Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's
international bureau, who warned that the yen's rise against the
dollar could pick up pace.
	   Overnight in New York, the dollar fell sharply after Dow Jones
Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying George Soros'
investment fund group was dumping dollars and buying the German
mark.
	   A spokesman for Soros' fund refused to comment.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares fell in line with a decline
on Wall Street overnight and amid worries about the outlook for
Japanese corporate profits, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 163.04 points,
or 1.14 percent, to close the morning session at 14,098.20. On
Thursday, the index fell 115.38 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   The collapse of a major steel company on Thursday and a forecast
by Hitachi that it would lose money this year for the first time
since the end of World War II both weighed heavily on shares.
	   The failure of Toa Steel Co was Japan's biggest manufacturing
sector collapse since World War II. Shares of related companies
tumbled Friday.
	   Steelmaker NKK, which holds a majority stake in Toa, sank
sharply after it said it would suffer a big loss to take over the
operations of Toa. Fuji Bank, Toa's main lender, also fell sharply.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 17.11 points, or 1.54
percent, to 1,096.66. The TOPIX declined 4.99 points, or 0.45
percent, the previous day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 100.15 points, or 1.3
percent, to 7,682.22 on Thursday. It had suffered its
second-biggest point loss ever on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's 1.065 percent. Its price fell
to 112.65 yen, down from 112.66 yen.

Sales of imported cars in Japan plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The weak yen and Japan's sluggish economy took a
toll on sales of imported automobiles, pushing them down 23 percent
in August from a year earlier to 16,588, an industry group said
Friday.
	   Sales of imported cars, buses, and trucks fell for the 17th
straight month in August, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said.
	   Foreign car makers have been hit hard in Japan, which is
struggling through its worst recession in decades. A drop in the
yen against the dollar has made an already tough market even more
difficult for foreign automakers by raising the price of imported
vehicles.
	   Sales of imported passenger cars fell 20.2 percent in August to
15,907 while sales of trucks sank 58.1 percent to 678, the group
said.
	   As a group, U.S. carmakers suffered the biggest decline, with a
drop of 44.5 percent to 2,590 autos.
	   Among U.S. manufacturers, only General Motors sold more cars on
the month. GM sold 1,026 cars in Japan in August, 1.3 percent more
than a year before.
	   German automakers, which accounted for more than half of Japan's
imports, saw their sales slip 14.4 percent to 9,344 automobiles.

Japan defense chief says attack on missile bases remains an option
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is not ruling out a military strike against
North Korean bases to stop the communist country from testing
another ballistic missile, a news report Friday quoted the Japanese
defense chief as saying.
	   Fukushiro Nukaga, director general of the Defense Agency, told
reporters that a government understanding dating from 1956 permits
Japan to carry out such an attack in self-defense as a last resort,
Kyodo News reported.
	   ``As one of many options, it's still alive,'' Kyodo quoted
Nukaga as saying after a Friday morning Cabinet meeting.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   On Thursday, Japan placed its forces on increased alert when
signs emerged that North Korea could be preparing for another test.
	   But the defense agency chief denied Friday that the government
has any information confirming North Korea plans to launch a second
missile, Kyodo said.
	   A special Cabinet session which had been planned for Friday to
consider additional sanctions against North Korea was postponed.
Kyodo reported the meeting will be rescheduled pending the
collection and analysis of unspecified information related to a
possible second missile firing.
	   Japan has already withdrawn an offer for talks on establishing
diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, ruled out further food aid to
the impoverished North and suspended funding for a project to build
nuclear reactors in the reclusive communist state.
	   The launch Monday, the first test for the Taepo Dong 1 missile,
rattled Tokyo by demonstrating North Korea's ability to strike any
part of Japan, including U.S. military bases home to 50,000
American troops.

 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The 229 people aboard Swissair
Flight 111 had time to prepare for the worst while the pilots
struggled vainly to keep the smoking, groaning jetliner aloft long
enough for an emergency landing.
	   Some passengers donned their life vests during the several
minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet crashed and broke apart
Wednesday night in choppy seas off Nova Scotia, Swissair officials
said Thursday. The plane, which carried 137 Americans, left a slick
of jet fuel, floating luggage and human remains, but no survivors.
	   ``When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were, you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash,'' said Jim Buckley,
skipper of a whaling boat that joined a makeshift flotilla that
fruitlessly searched for people to rescue. The cause of the crash
was not known.
	   Aboard the jet flown by one of the world's safest airlines were
14 crew members and 215 passengers. There were two infants, several
United Nations employees and one of the foremost leaders in the
global fight against AIDS, Dr. Jonathan Mann.
	   By nightfall Thursday, authorities said about 60 bodies had been
recovered, as well as an array of aircraft parts. But Lt. Commander
Jacques Fauteux, one of the search coordinators, said none of the
pieces was larger than an automobile.
	   Fauteux said more than 1,000 people were still involved in the
search, which was expected to continue through the night and into
Friday morning.
	   The Geneva-bound plane departed New York's Kennedy International
Airport at 8:18 p.m. EDT Wednesday (0018 GMT Thursday) and crashed
90 minutes later, at 9:48 p.m. EDT (0148 GMT Thursday) near
Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude
Donzel said.
	   Sixteen minutes passed between the crew's first report of
trouble _ including smoke in the cockpit, in Canadian airspace at
33,000 feet (9,900 meters) _ and the plane's disappearance from
radar scopes at about 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), according to Roy
Bears of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Five minutes after the aircraft crew reported the smoke and
headed toward Halifax, they began descending to dump fuel, said
Tony Rushton, vice president of the Canadian air traffic
controllers' union.
	   In another five minutes the crew declared an emergency, and just
moments later, the aircraft's transponder, which automatically
transmits its identity and altitude, stopped functioning, he said.
	   Controllers could still monitor the plane on radar until all
contact was finally lost.
	   The pilot, Urs Zimmermann, 50, tried to coax the plane to an
emergency landing at the Halifax airport, 35 miles (56 kilometers)
from the crash site. The pilot initially proposed heading for
Boston, but air traffic controllers pointed out Halifax was closer
_ 42 miles (67 kilometers) compared to 192 miles (307 kilometers).
	   Swissair said the plane was seven to 10 minutes away from the
airport in Halifax, when it plunged into waters about 150 feet (45
meters) deep.
	   Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused
the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington
sent 10 experts to Canada and experts from Switzerland also were
deployed.
	   Canadian officials and the White House said there was no
indication the crash resulted from a terrorist act. The Canadians
said their intelligence services were in contact with the FBI
nonetheless.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh said his agents were examining the
passenger list and working to ensure key evidence was properly
preserved.
	   ``We don't have any indication at this point what caused that
tragedy,'' Freeh said.
	   In towns along the scenic but often treacherous Nova Scotia
coast, residents reported hearing sputtering noises from an
aircraft passing overhead, then a thundering crash.
	   Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships hurried out to the
crash site, about six miles (10 kilometers) off the coast of
Peggy's Cove. The picturesque fishing village _ population 60 _ is
popular with tourists for its pirate lore and much-photographed
lighthouse, but the area also is known for shipwrecks and other
maritime tragedies.
	   After the first few hours of the nightlong search, the mood
among boat crews turned grim when reports of survivors proved
false. Instead, boat after boat radioed to a naval command vessel
that more body bags were needed to cradle human remains scattered
among aircraft debris over several square miles (kilometers) of the
Atlantic.
	   Searchlights from boats, helicopters and planes illuminated the
area during the night. Heavy surf _ a remnant of Hurricane Danielle
_ hampered the first hours of the rescue effort and rain fell until
dawn.
	   Searchers said they had located a chunk of the plane's fuselage
believed to be intact on the ocean floor. Divers planned to search
for the flight recorders, which could help determine the cause of
the disaster.
	   Swissair and its partner, Delta Airlines, were flying relatives
from New York and Switzerland to Halifax. Nova Scotia officials
offered to provide 900 hotel rooms for the families, and pledged to
protect their privacy as they faced the grim chore of identifying
loved ones.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, the head of Swissair's parent company
SAirGroup, said the airline would pay out dlrs 20,000 in immediate
financial aid to victims' families who request it. This was in
addition to any compensation due under international law.
	   Swissair said the passenger list would not be released until
family members are notified. In addition to the 136 American
passengers and an American crew member, it said 39 Swiss nationals
and 30 French citizens were killed. Others were from Britain,
Canada, Germany, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Spain, St. Kitts and Russia.
	   The United Nations confirmed that seven U.N. workers returning
to offices in Geneva and the wife of one of the officials were on
board.
	   At Kennedy Airport, Jeffrey Katz, chief executive officer of
Swissair, said a company review of the plane's record revealed ``a
clean bill of health.''
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is a jet known for its reliability,
even though its manufacturer, Boeing, has announced plans to
discontinue the model in 2000.

North Korea returns remains of U.S. soldiers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday returned three
sets of skeletal remains believed to be those of U.S. soldiers
missing from the Korean War.
	   U.N. honor guards carried three gray metal coffins across the
border in a simple but solemn ceremony at this truce village inside
the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   Dozens of U.S. and South Korean military officers saluted the
coffins draped in a light blue U.N. flag. After a prayer by a U.S.
military chaplain, the remains were flown to the U.S. Army's
Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for forensic tests and
identification.
	   The remains were unearthed by a joint U.S.-North Korea team.
	   North Korea began repatriating American remains in 1990. In
1996, it began allowing U.S. forensic experts to search for the
remains in its territory, assisted by North Korean officials.
	   About 220 sets of remains so far have been repatriated by North
Korea but less than a dozen have been positively identified. North
Korea handed over three sets in the last repatriation in July.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea.
	   More than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the 1950-53
Korean conflict, and about 8,100 of them are still unaccounted for.
	   The United States led 15 other Western countries to fight on
South Korea's side in the Korean conflict.

Korea's Mando resumes operation after strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's largest auto components
supplier partially resumed operation at its seven plants Friday, a
day after police broke up an 18-day-old strike.
	   But Mando Machinery Corp. said normal operation was at least
three days away because hundreds of workers were in police custody
for questioning and many others refused to return to work in
protest against the police raids.
	   Police planned to arrest at least 30 active union members on
charges of using violence and organizing illegal strikes.
	   Mando is a monopoly supplier of air conditioners, heaters,
alternators and other key components for Hyundai Motor Co. and
other domestic automakers.
	   Its strike has hampered operation at Hyundai, South Korea's No.
1 auto maker, which was recovering from its own 36-day-old strike
that ended just last week.
	   In Thursday's coordinated dawn assaults at Mando's plants around
the country, some 8,000 riot police used bulldozers and tear gas to
break through barricades and disperse strikers protesting layoffs.
	   It was the first use of police force to break up a labor protest
under the new government of President Kim Dae-jung. Layoffs are
legal but new to Korean workers, long accustomed to lifetime
employment.
	   Mando's 4,300 unionized workers went on strike Aug. 17 to
protest the company's plan to dismiss 1,090 employees amid a severe
slump in the auto industry.
	   Authorities outlawed the strike because the union did not submit
to mandatory government mediation.
	   Mando sold dlrs 1 billion in car components last year, 80
percent of them to Hyundai.

	   LONDON (AP) _ New anti-terrorist legislation drafted in the wake
of a car bombing that killed 28 people in Northern Ireland became
law in Britain and Ireland Friday.
	   Although some members of both the House of Commons and the House
of Lords protested they had not been given enough time to consider
the bills, the Commons approved the bill 391-17 in the key vote
early Thursday and the Lords passed it without a formal vote
Friday.
	   The bill was then sent the queen for her signature, a formality
for the legislation to become law.
	   Similar legislation became law earlier in Ireland after passing
the Senate in the Irish parliament without a vote.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swissair officials and counselors expect to spend
at least another day breaking the news to relatives that their
loved ones died on Flight 111 before making the passenger list
public.
	   But the United Nations disclosed that the 229 victims included
some prominent U.N. officials who frequently used the flight
between the organization's New York headquarters and its main
European office.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was deeply saddened by
the deaths and sent condolences to victims' loved ones,
``particular to the relatives and friends of those who lost their
lives in the service of the ideals of the United Nations.''
	   According to employers and family members, passengers on Flight
111 included:
	   _Dr. Jonathan Mann, a top pioneer in the fight against AIDS and
current dean of Allegheny University of the Health Sciences School
of Public Health in Philadelphia. Mann, an American, was the first
director of the World Health Organization's global program on AIDS
and was en route to a meeting of AIDS experts.
	   _Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, Mann's American wife. A professor in
the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore. She specialized in research into vaccines.
	   _John Mortimer, a former executive for The New York Times who
served as the paper's senior vice president for personnel and labor
relations for more than 25 years. He was traveling with his wife
Hilda on their vacation.

	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ Hurricane Isis slammed into the
Mexican mainland with 75 mph (120 kph) winds on Thursday but
rapidly dissipated into a rainstorm and headed for the U.S. border.
	   The storm blasted out windows, knocked out electricity and
littered this coastal city with downed street posts and tree limbs.
The coastal highway in the southern part of Sinaloa state was cut,
state authorities said.
	   Some rivers rose dangerously high on Thursday and authorities
warned residents in the Rio Fuerte region, just north of Los
Mochis, to stand by for possible evacuation.
	   At least two people were killed and several more were missing
after Isis clipped the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula then marched across the Gulf of California to the Mexican
mainland.
	   Sinaloa Gov. Renato Vega Alvarado toured affected areas on
Thursday and said a man drowned in the settlement of Los Chinitos
just south of Guasave.
	   Local authorities in Leyva said that a family was reporting
missing, but state civil protection officials said they could not
confirm that report.
	   Los Mochis Mayor Francis Lopez Brito said one person was
seriously injured by a jolt from a downed power cable.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said that by
Thursday afternoon, Isis had dissipated into a rainstorm that could
dump 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain in some areas.
	   The storm was speeding northeast at 20 to 25 mph (35-40 kph) and
was located about 270 miles (435 kilometers) south-southwest of El
Paso.
	   A few cars send up a muddy spray as they battled through
bumper-high waters Thursday morning in the streets of this city of
300,000.
	   Carlos Alberto Villegas used a bucket inside his concrete-block
house in a seemingly vain attempt to bail out the lake of water
that stood just below seat level of his new sofa.
	   ``It came in so very strong that the house just began to
flood,'' he said.
	   Isis-spawned rains further south flooded neighborhoods and
shoved yachts onto rocks in the port city of Mazatlan and washed a
man down a swollen river in the state of Jalisco.
	   On Wednesday, Isis belted the tip of the Baja California
peninsula, cutting phones and electricity, forcing thousands of
residents from their homes and trapping tourists in storm-battered
seaside hotels.
	   Officials said one woman was killed and her husband was missing
after they tried to cross a stream in Los Cabos.
	   Officials canceled tropical storm warnings, but many ports along
Mexico's Pacific coast remained closed Thursday.
	   With Isis toward the west and Hurricane Earl in the east near
the Florida coast, heavy rains fell in much of Mexico.
	   In the southern state of Chiapas, more than 300 families were
evacuated due to flooding in the coastal municipalities of
Mapastepec and Acapetuhua.
	   Heavy rains also forced hundreds of people to seek shelter in
the municipalities of Jiutepec and Yautepec in the central state of
Morelos.

Ousted deputy PM stripped of party post, awaits arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister said Friday it was ``just a matter of time'' before his
arrest on allegations of sexual misconduct.
	   ``Of course I will be arrested, it's just a matter of time,''
Anwar Ibrahim told The Associated Press at his home, two days after
being sacked and only hours after being expelled from the ruling
party.
	   Anwar was ousted from his posts of deputy prime minister and
finance minister on Wednesday, after months of bitter differences
in style and policy with his boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   He was then dumped as vice president of the ruling United Malays
National Organized in a late-night UMNO Supreme Council emergency
session on Thursday.
	   ``I am not surprised at the party's decision,'' Anwar said in an
interview. ``As I've said before, Mahathir gets what he wants.''
	   Anwar, a conservative Muslim who once spearheaded the drive for
stronger Islamic influence over Malaysia's secular government, has
been accused of sexual trysts and of leaking state secrets.
	   In an affidavit filed in High Court on Wednesday, Malaysia's
Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was under
investigation for sexual misconduct detailed in a recent book.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the ousted minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The affidavit said that Nalla and Anwar could face charges under
the Internal Security Act and the Official Secrets Act.
	   Mahathir, who made his first public comments in the predawn
hours Friday, said he was ``saddened'' by events.
	   ``I wish it hadn't happened, not at this point,'' he said. ``But
these things have gone out of my control.''
	   Mahathir said he would serve as acting finance minister for now
and wait until next year's UMNO party elections before appointing a
new deputy.
	   Anwar, for years seen as Mahathir's successor, had been left out
of economic decisions for months after differing with his boss on
the course for recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for last decade,
formally went into recession last week after its economy shrank
another 6.8 percent.

Report: Thai police chief blames Myanmar, Laos for drug problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's police chief has said
neighboring Myanmar and Laos are a prime cause of the surging abuse
of amphetamines among Thai youths, The Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Police Chief Pracha Promnok said he knew of at least eight
laboratories within five kilometers (3 miles) of the Thai border
producing 200 million amphetamine tablets a year in Laos and
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   ``Everybody knows that our neighbors, Burma and Laos, are the
major producers of amphetamines,'' The Nation quoted Pracha as
saying.
	   ``Burma and Laos have no problems because they are making money
and their laws allow them to do so,'' he told reporters after
meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to discuss the issue.
	   Amphetamine abuse has become so rampant in Thailand that two
years ago laws were amended to make the penalties for trafficking
the drug as severe as those for smuggling heroin.
	   Both Myanmar and Laos are poor countries with large ethnic
minority populations, some of which have rebelled against the
central governments.
	   Some insurgents have funded their wars against the governments
by growing and trafficking in opium, the raw material for heroin.
Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of opium after
Afghanistan.

Tennis becomes afterthought in U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 12-13 with Ivanisevic-Martin match; Picks up
12th graf pvs. SHOULD STAND. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The roar of jets passing over the U.S. Open took
on a ominous tone Thursday. Players chasing Grand Slam glory
struggled with a tragic crash that nearly claimed one of their own.
	   While top-seeded Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis reached the
third round, tennis was mostly an afterthought as players reflected
on the dangers they face while flying around the globe.
	   ``That's certainly one of your biggest fears, to say goodbye to
your loved ones and not return,'' said Andre Agassi, who also won a
second-round match. ``When you travel the world like we do, you're
bound to have your share of travel difficulties. But you pray to
God you don't have to go through something like that.''
	   Hingis moved one step closer to defending her title with a 7-6
(7-4), 6-0 victory over Iva Majoli a few hours after hearing about
the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the Canadian coast, killing
all 229 people aboard.
	   Hingis, a national heroine in her homeland of Switzerland, said
she knows many Swissair flight attendants.
	   ``It was terrible to hear it,'' Hingis said. ``It's the airplane
I fly the most. When I heard I was like, `No way. Swissair seems
very safe.' It's terrible to know you don't have any chance up
there.''
	   Marc Rosset, the top Swiss male player, had been set to return
to Geneva on Flight 111 Wednesday night after losing in the first
round. Instead, he stayed an extra day to practice with players
still in the tourney.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you know you just realize that
for just changing your mind you are still alive,'' he said. ``I
think I am a little afraid, when you realize you were close to
dying.''
	   Sampras, seeking his fifth U.S. Open crown, had 23 aces while
overcoming early sloppiness to reach the third round with a 7-6
(7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Paul Goldstein.
	   Sampras had 43 unforced errors in the first two sets and double
faulted on set point to lose the second set, but settled down in
the final two sets. He will not face a seeded player before a
possible encounter with Agassi in the quarterfinals.
	   Agassi, seeded eighth, struggled midway through his match before
defeating Guillaume Raoux 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1, finishing
the match with his 10th ace.
	   The night match featured the talent and temper of the
tempestuous Goran Ivanisevic, who had 20 aces and a 132-mph (212
kph) serve in a 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 6-3 victory over Todd Martin.
	   The 14th-seeded Ivanisevic muttered to himself in Croatian and
banged his head on the court after missing points. But he also won
a point with a spectacular shot between his legs with his back to
the net.
