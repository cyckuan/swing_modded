FBI, LAPD QUESTION 17-YEAR-OLD HACKER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A New Hampshire teen-ager who boasted to
investigators that he hacked into Web sites has been questioned by
the FBI and Los Angeles police, officials said Thursday. The
17-year-old, self-described hacker named ``Coolio'' told FBI agents
he had broken into more than 100 Web sites, including ones run by
the federal government, an Internet security company and a Los
Angeles anti-drug campaign, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had used computers since he was 3 years old and
spent 16 hours a day on the Internet,'' said LAPD officer Joe
Buscaino. ``He admitted to compromising over 100 sites on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities expect to meet today to discuss whether to file
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said detectives got involved in the
investigation because the DARE Web site is based in Los Angeles and
authorities in a New Hampshire city asked in mid-December for the
computer crimes unit's help and expertise. They could not say when
the alleged vandalism of the DARE site had been reported to
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police and federal officials offered conflicting
accounts of whether the youngster was under arrest. Authorities are
expected to meet today in an effort to determine whether to seek
charges against the teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have said that the New Hampshire boy could
be one of several computer users with the sign-on Coolio.
</P>
<P>
   The teen reportedly also acknowledged hacking into a government
Web site that gave rules for export of chemicals that could be used
in chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A hacker calling himself ``Coolio'' gained notoriety in
mid-February for redirecting visitors to an Internet security Web
site operated by RSA Security Inc. to another hacked Web site. The
hacker left the message ``Owned by Coolio'' on the screen. The
security company had announced earlier that it had developed
countermeasures to attacks like those directed earlier in February
on sites like Yahoo! and eBay.

FORMER GORE FUND-RAISER CONVICTED ON 5 COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert passage about Reno in 15th graf.)  
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maria Hsia, a longtime political fund-raiser for
Vice President Al Gore, was convicted Thursday of all five felony
counts against her for her role in arranging more than $100,000 in
illegal donations to the Democratic Party and its candidates in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $55,000 was contributed to the Democratic
National Committee in connection with the vice president's
much-criticized visit to a Buddhist temple in the Los Angeles area.
The event, at the Hsi Lai Temple in the community of Hacienda
Heights, has shadowed Gore throughout the current political season,
with a variety of his opponents referring to it in efforts to
remind the public of the Clinton-Gore organization's fund-raising
embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   As her federal jurors filed in Thursday, Hsia (pronounced shaw),
a 48-year-old Taiwan-born American citizen who works as an
immigration consultant in Los Angeles, consulted a Chinese
fortune-telling book to try to divine her fate. She then sat
impassively as the jury delivered its verdicts for what the
government had described as her masterminding an evasion of
election laws by disguising the true source of campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   All five counts against Hsia, who did not testify at her
three-week-long trial, charged her with causing finance officials
of the Democratic National Committee and Democratic campaigns to
file false contribution statements with the Federal Election
Commission. Although conviction on these counts can mean a
years-long prison sentence, federal sentencing guidelines make it
more likely that she will serve only a brief term, if any.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Buddhist temple, Justice Department
prosecutors charged that Hsia had arranged for nuns and monks there
to write checks to make it appear that they were the donors to the
Democratic National Committee. In reality, they were only ``straw
donors,'' reimbursed by the temple itself, which, as a religious,
tax-exempt institution, is prohibited from making political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the $1,000 limit on contributions to
presidential campaigns was evaded by wealthy Chinese-Americans who
testified at the trial that Hsia had helped them find straw donors
for their contributions to the Clinton-Gore re-election committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponents have noted that his 1996 fund-raising efforts
also included 56 telephone calls he made from the White House to
solicit donations for the party, in apparent violation of federal
law and longtime practice. When those calls became public
knowledge, he insisted that ``no controlling legal authority'' had
barred them. He has also been faulted for holding 23 ``coffees''
for wealthy donors at the White House in addition to co-hosting
eight others with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who is
challenging Gore for the Democratic nomination, has repeatedly said
that Gore will be especially vulnerable in the general election
because of his record on fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors portrayed the Democratic National
Committee, the Clinton-Gore committee and Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., who also received donations through Hsia, as unaware of her
actions and thus unwitting beneficiaries. Gore did not appear in
court but his name was mentioned throughout the trial and jurors
were shown a videotape of his April 29, 1996, visit to the Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   That tape could be troublesome for Gore during his presidential
campaign. Now that the trial is over, the tape is supposed to be
released publicly and Republican political operatives have already
asked for a copy, presumably to use in political advertisements to
embarrass Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had initially described his visit to the temple as
``community outreach,'' part of the Democrats' effort to build
closer ties to the Asian-American community. He later acknowledged
that he knew the visit was ``finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York Thursday, where he was campaigning in advance of
Tuesday's set of important primaries, Gore told reporters: ``The
jury has rendered its verdict. It's a hard day for her. She has
been a friend and a political supporter but since this matter is
still in the courts I am not going to comment on it further.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which came after nearly 10 hours of deliberations
over three days, was a much-desired victory for the Justice
Department's special task force investigating campaign finance
abuses that occurred in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia has been only the second figure embroiled in the Democratic
fund-raising scandal to face a full trial so far.
</P>
<P>
   Other party fund-raisers, including John Huang and Yah Lin Trie,
have pleaded guilty to charges growing out of the scandal, and
Pauline Kanchanalak, another fairly obscure figure, is awaiting
trial. But no senior Democratic National Committee officials have
ever been charged, and Attorney General Janet Reno was roundly
criticized for deciding against the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate the party's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The only other figure to be brought to trial by the Justice
Department task force was Franklin L. Haney, a Tennessee
businessman, who was acquitted last July on 42 counts of disguising
his own contributions by using straw donors to Gore's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Haney's case was unrelated to the heart of the larger
scandal about the Democratic Party's efforts to mine the
Asian-American community for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paul Friedman has yet to rule on motions brought by
lawyers for Hsia (pronounced ``shaw'') to dismiss the five counts.
Because of that, he did not immediately set a date for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, Hsia's lawyer, noting that it was extraordinary for
a federal judge to defer a ruling on dismissal motions until after
a verdict, said, ``It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Luque had argued that the reports filed with the Federal
Election Commission _ false reports, according to prosecutors _
were filed by the campaign treasurers for the DNC, the Clinton-Gore
committee and Kennedy's re-election committee, none of whom Hsia
had ever met.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five counts carries a five-year jail term and
$250,000 fine under the law. But if Hsia's conviction is upheld,
her sentence would be governed by complex federal sentencing
guidelines that weigh factors such as prior convictions, of which
Hsia has none. She would also benefit under the guidelines because
there is no allegation that any money was stolen. As a result she
could receive a relatively light jail sentence or perhaps even
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson said of the verdict,
``My faith in the jury system is once again restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson ridiculed the Justice Department's theory that the
vice president and the Democratic Party were unwitting victims of
Hsia's scheme. ``It's time to get beyond the small-fry and take on
the major players like Al Gore,'' he said in a statement.

SENATE BACKS EDUCATION SAVINGS MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday easily passed a bill that
would provide modest tax breaks for parents who save for elementary
and secondary school expenses, including private school tuition,
but it faced a likely veto.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1998, calling it
``bad education policy and bad tax policy,'' and is likely to do so
again this year if it reaches his desk. The House is expected to
take up the bill later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill, which comes at a time when polls
show that voters rank education as their chief concern, by a vote
of 61-37, securing a modicum of bipartisan support for a measure
that Republicans have pushed unsuccessfully for three years. Nine
Democrats voted for the bill this time around, but that left it
still short of the number needed to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this legislation, no one gets hurt, everybody gets
helped: public, private, parochial, home, whatever,'' said Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., who sponsored the bill with Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``No one is being gouged. No one is paying a
price at the expense of somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow family members, employers and other
sponsors to put as much as $2,000 a year for each elementary and
secondary school student into a savings account that could be used
for expenses related to education, including tutoring, computers
and parochial or private school expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The interest on the money and on the withdrawals from the
account would be tax-free and could be rolled over for college
expenses. The accounts, which would cost the federal government
$7.3 billion over 10 years, would be phased out for individuals
making more than $95,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans maintain that the bill simply expands on the popular
college savings accounts that Clinton signed into law with much
fanfare. ``This makes that account four times larger,'' Coverdell
said in a recent floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   And they argue that while the bill's small tax breaks do not
solve all the woes facing the nation's schools, it offers a fresh
approach that, at the very least, could persuade parents to save
and give them a greater say in their child's education.
</P>
<P>
   That tug between greater private or local control and greater
federal control is at the heart of the parties' philosophical
differences over education, and it provides endless fodder for
campaigning politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never argued that offering this special savings
account would solve every education problem in America,''
Torricelli said. ``But they are the opening shot in a revolution in
American education.''
</P>
<P>
   But most other Democrats, in what has become a perennial
showdown over the bill, said the savings accounts were nothing but
covert school vouchers that would redirect taxpayer money from
public schools to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made vouchers one of their crusades for
revamping ailing schools, arguing that by offering parents a choice
between public and private schools, public schools would be forced
to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is anathema to most Democrats and is staunchly
opposed by teachers' unions, which say it would simply drain
resources away from public schools, which teach 90 percent of the
nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to strengthen public schools, not abandon them,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has
spearheaded the bill's opposition in the Senate. ``Our goal is to
help all children get a good education _ not deny them the extra
help they need to meet the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Coverdell disputed the pronouncement that the savings
accounts were like vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a voucher,'' he said. ``It will help people in
public schools, but statistically insignificant is the number of
people who might, because they have a savings account, change
schools. I am sure it will happen, but it would be insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that voters view them as the guardians of education,
Democrats clearly relish the debate every year. They hammer away at
the bill, arguing that it benefits mostly wealthier Americans with
children in private schools since few low-income parents can afford
to sock enough money away to make the tax breaks worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say the money could be better spent on more
pressing needs, including building more schools, renovating
existing ones, hiring more teachers and improving teacher training.
Efforts by Democrats to address those issues through amendments
were defeated.

KINGS' TAYLOR GOES SHOPPIING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kings general manager Dave Taylor returned
Thursday afternoon from the NHL general manager's meetings in Palm
Springs without the gritty forward he is seeking, but he says he
expects plenty of action league wide before the March 14 trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, whose team is sixth in the Western Conference, has
softened his stance over not trading for a player that will be a
free agent at the end of the year. That means Montreal's Shayne
Corson and Atlanta's Kelly Buchberger, two players with
considerable playoff experience, is still being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can make a move to improve the team we will,'' Taylor
said. ``It will depend on how it will affect us financially in the
short term and the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, disappointing most of the season, made a move
late last month, but have dropped off lately. Wednesday night, they
traded disgruntled defenseman Vladimir Malakhov to New Jersey for
Sheldon Souray and a draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov was suspended by the Canadiens last month for skiing
while rehabilitating a knee injury, but the trade could mean
Montreal is ready to keep dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he recognizes the need for balanced scoring from his
top two lines. But he refused to confirm that the club has been
trying to move second line winger Donald Audette, who has struggled
since returning from six weeks on injured reserve (sprained left
ankle).
</P>
<P>
   The Kings second unit has faltered in the past two weeks and
Audette's return to the line has been questioned by some teammates.
Audette, earning $2.3 million this season, will be an unrestricted
free agent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it going: It wasn't surprising Carolina scored the first
goal Thursday night. They got four in the third period Wednesday
night in a 7-5 loss at Phoenix, the first of a three-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes fell behind 6-1 in the third and allowed a
short-handed goal to Jeremy Roenick. Rod Brind 'Amour and Gary
Roberts both were a minus 5 in the game. It was Roberts first
action since missing seven straight with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was back in the lineup Thursday against the Kings. Brind
'Amour, who came over from Philadelphia in exchange for Keith
Primeau, has been struggling, although he did have an assist in
Sami Kapinen's first-period goal. In his first 16 games with the
Hurricanes, Brind 'Amour had two goals, five points and a minus 11.

GROUP WANTS TO FORCE BELMONT CENTER'S OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A furious campaign to revive the abandoned Belmont
Learning Center has gained momentum in recent weeks as key Latino
political leaders threaten to hold hostage Los Angeles Unified's
billion-dollar construction program unless the nation's costliest
school is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino leaders, supported by a powerful downtown law firm
and an influential lobbyist it's hired, have brought mayoral
candidates Antonio Villaraigosa, Steve Soboroff and Xavier Becerra
aboard their effort to force the school board to reconsider its
decision to abandon the environmentally troubled site.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council is set today to consider a motion
by Councilman Mike Hernandez to withhold key funding and building
permits for all new schools unless the school board reverses its
stand on Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board, on its own, decided to abandon the school without
giving us any alternatives,'' Hernandez said Thursday. ``Now what I
got is a big eyesore and I need to know what they're going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm questioning their decision and the reasons they used to
make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the school board majority and top LAUSD
administrators rejected Hernandez's effort as an attack on the
entire educational system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of this resolution is to potentially punish all
students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, including all
students in the city of Los Angeles,'' LAUSD Chief Operating
Officer Howard Miller said. ``It is not clear to me why the city
would want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Julie Korenstein said she was utterly
appalled by the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just astounded that rather than looking out for the
safety of the city's children, that politics get so heavily
involved,'' Korenstein said. ``He's threatening us and that's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The school board voted Jan. 25 to scrap Belmont following a year
of startling disclosures about the dangers created by explosive and
toxic gases rising from abandoned oil wells under the school. The
health risks had been downplayed and inadequately dealt with before
construction began.
</P>
<P>
   Despite $175 million having been spent on Belmont, the board and
top officials decided to kill the school because they felt it could
not be safely occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has support in his save-Belmont endeavor from county
Supervisor Gloria Molina, City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers, the blue-chip law firm being sued by the LAUSD for its
handling of matters related to the planning and development of
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny, which could face massive damages if Belmont is not
finished, has hired the influential lobbying firm Rose &AMP; Kindel to
pressure politicians on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community and its leadership strongly support finishing
Belmont and O'Melveny &AMP; Myers and Rose &AMP; Kindel have met with
public officials with facts showing the school will be safe,'' said
Ralph Shapira of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Through an aide, Molina expressed support for Hernandez's motion
and promised to introduce a similar measure to the Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motion,'' Hernandez said, ``is no bigger a threat than the
threat the school district has imposed on every urban school
district in the state of California. By ignoring the state standard
for toxic cleanup, saying they don't believe Belmont is safe for
kids, they're setting a precedent ... If it's toxic, let's clean it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   His motion calls for the city to refuse to enter into any joint
power agreements with Los Angeles Unified or approve any
conditional use permits for new schools unless the school board
rescinds its decision.
</P>
<P>
   While the city has no direct authority over schools, the motion
could severely undermine plans to build more than 100 new schools.
</P>
<P>
   Joint power agreements between the city and district have been
seen as a way to join schools, parks and community centers on a
single site, especially in inner-city areas where little usable
land is available. Conditional use permits would be needed for
multiple-use projects.
</P>
<P>
   Interim LAUSD Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines wrote an open
letter to the Belmont community Wednesday, saying the district's
goal is to find 5,000 additional high school seats for students in
the Belmont area.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Daily News has learned the district is close to
finalizing plans to reconfigure its downtown administrative
headquarters back into a school. Officials also want to build a
middle or high school at the Ambassador Hotel site - a moved
opposed by Councilman Nate Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Molina's assistant chief deputy, Miguel Santana, said the
supervisor agreed to rally support to save Belmont at the behest of
parents in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are environmental issues that must be dealt with, but
they can be fixed in a safe, timely and cost-effective manner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Becerra, D-Los Angeles, has actively trumpeted his
desire to resurrect Belmont in his mayoral campaign. He declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont backers maintain that Belmont can be made safe, and
point to new estimates that a safety system could be installed at
the campus for $8 million. The district says an adequate fix would
cost closer to $60 million and would be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Molina has met with other influential leaders
to gain support, including Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, and
Assembly Speaker-elect Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg could not be reached for comment, but Villaraigosa now
says he is not satisfied with the board's decision to abandon
Belmont without detailed alternatives for a new school.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa had been supportive of the board, even vowing to
prevent the state from giving the LAUSD ``another dime'' for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Molina, he sent a Feb. 23 letter to Cortines,
saying the board ``should be prepared to reconsider its previous
action to abandon the project or offer a better alternative to the
students and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said he believes the school board acted hastily in its
decision to abandon Belmont. But he disagreed with Hernandez's
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's decision was not based on environmental issues,''
he said. ``The perception of the world is that it was. But it
couldn't have been. They made their decision before the state
completed its environmental report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate (Hernandez's) frustration, but I don't believe in
penalizing the kids because of Belmont. If we can use a good joint
use agreement in the San Fernando Valley or San Pedro, why should
those children be penalized because of what Mike's frustrations are
about Belmont?''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying efforts have failed to win support from City
Attorney James Hahn, a mayoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is startling new info, Hahn thinks the school
board has spoken and we should move forward,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, also refused to back
off his opposition to completing Belmont or to help others get
Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, and state Sen. Tom Hayden,
D-Los Angeles, to back off their strong criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an atrocity that any city councilman would threaten the
ability of the school district to build schools for children who
desperately need them,'' Wildman said. ``The school district is
actively looking for alternative sites. Putting kids on a toxic
site is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden added: ``They are putting up obstacles to all new school
construction if they can't have Belmont. That's blackmail. It's
disgraceful.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ General Motors Corp. said it was pulling the plug
on its first-generation electric vehicles, recalling about 900 cars
and trucks because they could catch fire while being recharged.
</P>
<P>
   About 450 Generation I EV1 electric cars are being permanently
taken off the road because of excessive heat that builds up while
their batteries are being recharged. They were primarily leased to
customers in California and Arizona between December 1996 and
August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the charge port on the Generation I EV1 is
not fixable,'' said Bob Purcell, executive director of GM's
advanced-technology group, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek, futuristic looking cars will be picked up from
wherever they are garaged. GM will also provide rental cars for EV1
owners until other arrangements can be made, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also recalled were 450 Chevrolet S-10 Electric pickup trucks,
which were sold to fleet customers between May 1997 and December
1999 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the S-10 electric pickups will be offered repairs to
their trucks or the opportunity to purchase, at a reduced price,
another GM vehicle, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The charge port on the vehicles has a design flaw that only
affects recharging and doesn't cause a problem during driving or
when the vehicles are parked, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   The defective part is a 10-pound piece that would have to be
redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find a space to package a fix into is very difficult,''
said John Hepke, director of propulsion engineering for GM's
advanced technology vehicle. ``Every inch is taken up in the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Generation I EV1, the charge port is located just below
the vehicle's hood, while on the S-10 pickup, it is below the front
license plate.
</P>
<P>
   GM has begun notifying owners of these vehicles and asked them
to disconnect their cars from the charging ports. The company
wouldn't estimate the cost of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few people ... used (the EV1) as their primary vehicle. Most
customers have more than one car at home,'' Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   GM's 1999 Generation II EV1s were not affected by the recall. GM
began leasing those vehicles in December, and they continue to
market the electric cars in several states, including California.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Assemblyman Scott Wildman of Glendale, an EV1 driver
who is campaigning for the 21st District Senate seat being vacated
by state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, said his first-generation
EV1 electric vehicle has been in the shop for more than a month
because the car's range had dropped from 70 miles to around 40
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware they were being recalled,'' said Wildman, whose
three-year lease was about to expire. ``I am now exploring hybrid
and other alternative fuel vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California Edison operates about five or six
first-generation EV1 models and about 13 Chevy S-10 pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just replace them (EV1s) with regular gasoline
vehicles until they are replaced,'' said Diane Whittenberg, vice
president of corporate communications for the company based in
Rosemead, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As for the utility's fleet of S-10s, Whittenberg said, ``We will
wait to see what they do to fix the charge ports.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ashuckian, supervisor of the light duty vehicle program for
the California Energy Commission, said the state operates more than
100 electric vehicles. He does not know how many are affected by
the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Van Amberg, vice president of marketing for CalStart, an
advanced transportation technology consortium headquartered in
Pasadena, said the recall is difficult for GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this recall is a tough one for General Motors,'' he
said. ``Toughest because they have a good product out there now
that isn't affected by the recall.''
</P>
<P>
   GM announced it was building the EV1 in 1996 and has spent $350
million to develop the electric vehicle. EV1 leases cost between
$400 and $600 a month, and for the money their owners get a range
of about 70 miles. The 1999 EV1s have about a 100-mile range.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike more conventional vehicles, the automaker's EV1
production has always been built in blocks of 500 cars. GM built
its first 500 vehicles in 1996 for the 1997 model year and built
another 500 in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain committed to advanced-technology vehicles,'' Purcell
said. ``While it (the EV1) may be small in number, it is large in
enthusiasm in terms of the customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Ward, an automotive analyst with Salomon Smith Barney
in New York, said the recall was ``not big enough to pay attention
to.''
</P>
<P>
   GM shares fell 31 cents Thursday to close at $73.31.

 BUSH AND McCAIN TRADE CHARGES OVER POLITICS AND RELIGION  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The setting was surreal, with Gov. George W. Bush
standing at a lectern and his main opponent, Sen. John McCain,
beaming from a television monitor a few feet away. Yet all the
bitterness of the Republican presidential race was on full display
on Thursday night as the rivals rehashed mutual recriminations in a
debate four days before a round of critical primaries across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Capping weeks of acrimony, McCain defended the telephone calls
that his campaign made to Roman Catholic voters in Michigan,
alerting them to Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University, while
Bush once more protested about being characterized as
anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to tell people exactly what Governor Bush had
done,'' McCain said, arguing ``I did not call him an anti-Catholic
bigot.'' McCain said he had simply pointed out that Bush appeared
at the school and waited weeks to repudiate its anti-Catholic
teachings, ``a factual statement and one that I stand by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly shot back, ``Yeah. I appreciate that. If you don't
think those phone calls labeled me an anti-Catholic bigot, then you
weren't paying attention to what your campaign was putting out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear message,'' Bush added, ``was I was an anti-Catholic
bigot. That's why people all over the country were wondering about
my heart for a while. The good news is that America rejects that
kind of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge and countercharge came even as each man started out
trying to stand above the fray and present a positive case for
himself in a debate that ranged across foreign policy, education,
gun control, the death penalty and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called himself ``somebody who's been a proven leader,
someone who has set an agenda, somebody who has risen above
politics.'' And McCain, who used a satellite link-up from a studio
in St. Louis to participate, turned a question about his
characterization of some leaders of the religious right as ``agents
of intolerance'' into a statement that ``ours is a message of
inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is struggling to win the support of core
Republicans, also took pains to say that he would not follow the
model of his hero Theodore Roosevelt by bolting the party if he was
not nominated, declaring: ``I am a loyal Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, the third candidate, was often asked questions
seeking his reflections on the nation's moral health, but he made
his most pointed remarks when he accused McCain of not vigorously
opposing abortion, and said he could never support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   By far the testiest moments in the hourlong debate concerned the
tussle between Bush and McCain over religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush once again said he regretted that he did not speak out
against the teachings of Bob Jones University when he visited the
institution in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about bringing people together,'' he said, ``so
America can achieve its greatness. I talked about lifting the
spirit and the soul of this country. I regret I did not speak out
against that school's anti-Catholic bias. I missed an
opportunity,'' he said. ``I make no excuses. I make no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he turned to McCain and said, ``What I regret is the
politics of smearing somebody's reputation. That's what I regret.
And I don't appreciate it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain asked for time to respond under debate rules
allowing rebuttals to attacks, Bush said, ``I didn't attack Senator
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain on Thursday night gave his most detailed explanation for
his sharp attacks on Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, by describing
how they differed with him in their views of President Clinton, for
example. ``I voted to impeach President Clinton,'' McCain said. ``I
don't believe he's a murderer. Mr. Falwell believes that he's a
murderer. Mr. Robertson has espoused some cockamamie theories about
the Freemasons. I believe they have led some very good and
wonderful people in a message of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush each seemed uncomfortable at times on issues of
domestic policy. Asked what he had accomplished on education across
18 years in Congress, McCain had to reach back to his years in the
House of Representatives to cite his service on the House Education
Committee and spoke vaguely of ``being involved in the effort in my
state for reform in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was so vague that the Bush campaign promptly put out
a statement mocking it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed equally uncomfortable on the issue of gun control.
Asked about whether trigger locks on guns should be mandatory, he
responded, ``Ask about education, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said that while he didn't mind trigger locks, ``the
question is, how do we enforce it? Are we going to have trigger
lock police knocking on peoples' doors, saying `Show me your
trigger lock?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also exchanged sharp words on the issue of
campaign finance. Bush repeated his charge that McCain, who rails
against the ``iron triangle'' of special interests in Washington,
was ``ringing it like a dinner bell with all those fundraisers with
lobbyists.'' McCain countered: ``I don't think so,'' and added:
``If I'm ringing it like a dinner bell, you've got both feet in the
trough.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked about his temperament, and whether he sought to
portray those who disagreed with him as not just wrong, but wicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be a source of worry,'' McCain said.
Speaking about his campaign, he added: ``I believe that I've
conducted it with honor, with dignity and a way that has made me
and the people surrounding me proud. That's why we have attracted
so many young people, so much enthusiasm to _ to our banner.''
</P>
<P>
   The face-off came four days before the critical Super Tuesday
primaries, including the powerhouses New York and California. With
polls showing Bush leading by nearly 2 to 1 among Republicans in
California and McCain pinning more of his hopes on New York, the
Republican race has become increasingly contentious, and the debate
itself, sponsored by CNN and The Los Angeles Times, almost became
the victim.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of feint and parry, McCain said he would not debate
because he had planned a campaign schedule in New York and New
England when Bush had earlier refused to commit. Then the senator
abruptly changed his mind and agreed to participate by satellite.

DOT-COMS ARE HAVING A DRAMATIC EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Although consumer e-commerce remains minuscule in
retailing's grand scheme of things, The Economist recently
conducted an exhaustive survey of the phenomenon and concluded that
``most companies must become Internet companies if they are to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough, the editors cautioned, to add a Web site to an
existing business, because ``the whole business needs to be
redesigned around the cost-saving, communication-easing properties
of the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the process of evaluating the Internet's
business potential, the magazine's in-depth exploration of
dot-commerce was a much needed extension of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of dot-commerce at this point in its history
isn't about its still modest sales volumes or the wild stock market
rides it provides investors in its fledgling ventures. One of the
key conclusions reached by The Economist is that the Internet's
importance in the here and now is its increasing influence on how
business is transacted.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted in America last year, for instance, showed
that while less than 3 percent of all new-car sales were made over
the Web, fully 40 percent of new-car buyers used the Internet to
research their purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes last month published a ``Best of the Web'' special
edition, including a segment about how ``car dealers are both
fighting the Internet and embracing it.'' Even as dealers pursue
state laws barring purchases direct from manufacturers, they still
must deal with better-informed consumers made savvier by Internet
comparison shopping. Forbes listed five Web sites under the heading
``Honk If You Hate Haggling'' and urged taking advantage of the
Internet to become a more efficient shopper.
</P>
<P>
   What most consumers probably don't realize is that Internet
commerce is still very much the province of the corporate world.
About 80 percent of last year's estimated $150 billion worth of
worldwide e-commerce was the business-to-business variety, The
Economist noted. Consumer e-commerce, meanwhile, is only about 1
percent of U.S. retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers no doubt have fooled some business managers into
not taking the Internet as seriously as they probably should. Even
though e-companies are for the most part hemorrhaging money serving
tiny market shares, the trend is what's important.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the early players don't survive, the trend points toward
a watershed event in marketplace history. The failures, after all,
of many pioneering enterprises in the railroad, auto and airline
businesses didn't make the rise of those industries any less
important to the progress of the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's likely to be with the Internet. Many business
traditionalists resent the dot-com companies for their otherworldly
stock valuations and blame them for what they perceive as a
misallocation of capital as their own stocks get hammered.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hards, however, ``ignore the Internet at their own peril,''
The Economist warned.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the dot-com bubble deflates, as it certainly will
sooner or later, the signals currently being sent by
Internet-related commerce should be heeded as an early warning of
future challenges.

AGENCY RULING JEOPARDIZES EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Business executives told a congressional subcommittee
Thursday that their companies would not offer stock options to
hourly employees if opinions expressed in a Department of Labor
advisory letter are put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory letter, issued last year in response to a company's
inquiry, said the value of employees' stock options should be
factored into their regular pay rates for the purpose of overtime
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion said in part that an employee's profit from
exercised options must be allocated over the period of time in
which it was earned, ending with the workweek in which the option
was exercised and going back to the date of the employee's right to
purchase the shares.
</P>
<P>
   J. Randall MacDonald, GTE's executive vice president of human
resources, was among corporate officers who prepared testimony for
the U.S. House Workforce Protections Subcommittee. MacDonald
warned, ``The practical fact is that unless this problem is fixed
quickly, nonexempt employees will lose access'' to stock option
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Human resource officials and labor leaders say the threat to
employee stock option plans is wrongheaded at a time when equity
stakes for workers are considered to be effective tools for
motivating and retaining employees.
</P>
<P>
   T. Michael Kerr, administrator of the Labor Department's Wage
and Hour Division, said the department did not intend to freeze
hourly workers out of stock option benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said the department would work to amend provisions of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets the overtime pay requirements
that influenced the advisory letter's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as GTE indicated they would stop offering
employee stock options rather than undertake the burdensome
overtime pay calculations that would be required.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis by the Employment Policy Foundation, a
nonprofit research organization, as many as 26 million blue-collar
workers could lose stock options if the costs and complex
calculations associated with implementing the advisory opinion
become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Policy Foundation says implementation of such a
ruling could mean an average annual loss of $1,737 in equity value
for employees who participate in equity programs such as employee
stock purchase plans, stock bonus and grant programs, or stock
appreciation rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a 35-year career, this loss amounts to $60,000 in nominal
stock'' for the average participating employee, the foundation
concluded. If stock values continue to rise at historic rates, the
loss for the typical worker could be worth about $470,000, the
foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department spokesmen say the intent of the advisory
letter, written last year to one company in response to a specific
question, was not to dissuade companies from offering stock options
to hourly employees. There could be other cases in which stock
option gains would not have to be included in retroactive overtime
pay calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department advisory letters do not carry the weight of
law, but they are often viewed as indicators of future policy.
</P>
<P>
   Public attention to such letters heightened earlier this year
when employers protested a different opinion. That advisory letter
indicated that companies were responsible for meeting the same
Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards for
employees working at home as they were for employees working in
their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks of national outcry caused the department to
withdraw the guidance letter and issue an overriding policy
statement. The statement said employers would not be liable for
meeting the same OSHA standards for employees working at home.

TRINIDAD-REID FIGHT IS INTRIGUING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fight between Felix Trinidad and David Reid tonight in Las
Vegas lost some of its drama when Oscar De La Hoya decided he'd
rather fight Shane Mosley than Trinidad in June.
</P>
<P>
   However, in purely boxing terms, this pay-per-view matchup at
Caesars Palace has intrigue to spare.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is Trinidad, the unbeaten Puerto Rican who ended
up on the fortunate side of a controversial decision against De La
Hoya last September. Trinidad (36-0, with 30 knockouts) won't admit
it, but he must resurrect, at least to some extent, the damage to
the pristine reputation he had built since he started his
professional career in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He was that bad against De La Hoya, who baffled his rival with
his boxing skills for eight-plus rounds only to throw the fight
away by running the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, the undisputed welterweight champion who will be
fighting at 154 pounds for the second time, would rather be seeking
redemption by fighting De La Hoya again, but the camps have been
unable to reach an agreement on a weight and how they would split
$80 million over two fights, said Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   So Trinidad, 27, is stuck with Reid and the opportunity to win
another world championship, Reid's WBA junior middleweight title.
</P>
<P>
   He's also left with a purse of $4 million, according to a
knowledgeable source, a pittance compared to the riches he might
never see if he doesn't beat Reid and meet De La Hoya again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I overlooked David Reid, I wouldn't be doing my job,''
Trinidad said. ``This is a very important fight and I'm taking it
very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Reid, whose very presence in such a fight is
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The kind-hearted street kid from Philadelphia, now 26, has the
amateur credentials: He won the United States' only gold medal in
the 1996 Olympics when he stopped Cuban Alfredo Duvergel with a big
right hand in a fight he was losing badly.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has only 14 pro fights - all victories, seven
knockouts - and hasn't looked spectacular in many of them.
</P>
<P>
   How can he hope to compete with a fighter of Trinidad's ability
and experience? With brawn, brains and De La Hoya-like quickness,
the last of which many believe will be the key in the fight in
light of the challenger's plodding performance against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers like Trinidad's experience - he's about a 2-1
favorite - while a poll of boxing writers and broadcasters give
Reid the edge: 26-21-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix is a good fighter,'' Reid said. ``But Oscar exposed him.
Oscar proved that he has trouble with speed. Felix comes straight
in to wear you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I won't run from him like Oscar did, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means anything is possible.

AUTHORITIES SEARCH FOR ANSWERS IN FATAL MEETING OF DEPUTY,
RUNAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIAWATHA, Kan. _ Law officers in Kansas and New York searched
for clues Thursday that might explain what led a runaway from
Buffalo, N.Y., to a deadly encounter with a part-time sheriff's
deputy halfway across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent A. Smith, 16, the son of a Buffalo police lieutenant,
apparently shot and killed Todd Widman, 21, a deputy sheriff in
Brown County, Kan., on Wednesday night in Hiawatha. About three
hours later, Smith was shot to death by two Kansas Highway Patrol
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was reported missing Tuesday afternoon by his father, Lt.
Thomas C. Smith, a 29-year police veteran in Buffalo. A
missing-person report said the youth had taken his mother's 1988
Ford Tempo and a Walther PPK semiautomatic pistol owned by his
father, according to Lt. Larry Baehre, a Buffalo police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all scratching our heads as to why he was heading that
way and what this was all about,'' Baehre said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no indication of problems in the Smith home.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo News reported that Smith apparently was distraught
over bad grades, but authorities in Kansas and Buffalo said they
could not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a nonviolent kid,'' said Sam Carroll, a classmate at
Buffalo's Bishop Timon-St. Jude High School. ``Never got in
scuffles. He was just easy to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brown County Sheriff's Department said early Thursday
evening that there were no reports that Smith was involved in any
other incidents as he made his way toward Kansas. His mother's car
was found abandoned just off Interstate 29 in northwest Missouri,
near the Kansas state line, according to Special Agent Scott
Teeselink of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday evening, Widman responded to a report of a
suspicious person walking along U.S. 73 north of Hiawatha, a town
of about 3,600 in extreme northeast Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believing the individual was a runaway juvenile, the deputy
attempted to transport the individual to the Brown County sheriff's
office for further investigation,'' Sheriff Lamar Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, about 7 p.m., Widman radioed from his car that he
had been shot. Emergency medical crews took him to the Hiawatha
Community Hospital, where he died from gunshot wounds, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Eichkorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol said Widman was
shot while in his car.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Smith had been searched before the
shooting. The gun may have been in a duffel bag Smith was carrying,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   State and local law enforcement agencies converged on the area
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was spotted near a Wal-Mart store at the west edge of
Hiawatha, and there was an exchange of gunfire. No one was hit, and
Smith escaped, Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Shoemaker said, Smith was seen walking west of
Hiawatha along U.S. 36. A Highway Patrol helicopter and airplane
joined in the search, and tracking dogs were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:45 p.m., officers who were searching the area were fired
on by the suspect after he emerged from a field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers immediately returned fire,'' Shoemaker said. ``In
this exchange of gunfire, the suspect was struck and fatally
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Two veteran Highway Patrol troopers have been placed on
administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. The
procedure is routine in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shootings, the American flag outside the Brown
County sheriff's office flew at half-staff, and officers wore
strips of black tape across their badges.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a midmorning press conference on Thursday, Shoemaker
said Widman had worked part time for the department for the last
several months, serving court papers and working in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   He was a 1997 graduate of Hiawatha High School and was
completing a degree in criminal justice at Washburn University in
Topeka, Kan. He had not yet taken the state-mandated law
enforcement training course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very fine young man,'' said John Severin, Hiawatha's
school superintendent. ``He was well-liked by the students in his
class and the students in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Widman's sister is a junior at Hiawatha High School, and his
mother is employed there.
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from high school, Widman had worked for the
school district's maintenance crew during the summers, Severin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors were available for students and staff at the school
and for Widman's colleagues in the Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Widman's colleagues, the sheriff said, ``They are
holding up as well as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichkorn said: ``We all tend to take law enforcement for
granted. It really shines light on the fact this is a dangerous
occupation.''

BUSH, KEYES, MCCAIN SPAR IN L.A. DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the pressure of ``Super Tuesday'' looming
over the Republican primary, the three remaining GOP candidates
clashed Thursday over who is most electable as they continued to
feud over issues ranging from campaign reform to religion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former
Ambassador Alan Keyes spoke at a debate hosted by CNN and the Los
Angeles Times, each seeking to make the case that they are the
candidate who can defeat the Democratic nominee. Bush and Keyes
were in Los Angeles for the session, while McCain appeared via
television satellite from St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach next Tuesday, which may be a seminal event in
this campaign, the question is who is the most fully prepared to be
president of the United States and who is the most capable of
wining a victory in November,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   California and 12 other states will be holding Republican
primaries and caucuses Tuesday in the first true national test of
the field of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is staking much of his campaign on the appeal he has made
to independent and moderate voters. In California, however, he is
faced with the prospect of winning the election but losing the GOP
delegates, because only Republican votes will be used to determine
who wins that party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes he also is capable of attracting
independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``America wants a proven leader,'' he said. ``People are looking
for a fresh start after a season of cynicism in Washington. I'm
going to reach out to Democrats and independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who complained he has been excluded from media coverage
of the race, said he is the one who speaks to conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I am the one who speaks for you,'' Keyes said. ``Why
don't you get in the voting booth and stand for what I believe
in?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking up most of the session were sometimes sharp exchanges
between Bush and McCain in their 12th debate of the campaign season
and the final one before the ``Super Tuesday'' elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to distance himself from some of the criticism he
has received for appearing at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, an institution that bans interracial dating and has
criticized Catholics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that I didn't speak out about that school's bias,''
Bush said. ``What I also regret is someone ascribing to me opinions
and views that are not my views, calling me an anti-Catholic bigot.
It is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to telephone calls to Michigan voters, paid
for by McCain, questioning his appearance at the university, and _
at first _ denying that the McCain campaign had paid for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked about his campaign's attack on the Christian
Coalition, in particular about his comments against Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact is I have rejected the leadership of those
two individuals, who have led the party in the wrong direction with
their message of intolerance and exclusion,'' McCain said. ``I want
to put out a message of inclusion. A message of, `Come to our proud
conservative banner. Come take part in this noble experiment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also differed over campaign reform, which McCain
has attempted to make a cornerstone of his campaign by eliminating
soft-money donations to political parties in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes part of the problem has been the lack of
prompt reporting of donations.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, McCain picked up the endorsement of Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, while Bush picked up the
endorsement of Orange County Sheriff Michael Carona, Ventura County
Sheriff Bob Brooks, Orange County District Attorney Anthony
Rackauckas and former San Diego County Sheriff Jim Roache.

   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Brian Fitzpatrick made the 913 mistake in
early December.
</P>
<P>
   Brian, a seventh-grader, couldn't access AOL when 10-digit
dialing started in the metropolitan area on Dec. 4. He clicked on
AOL and asked for access numbers. The software offered him three
numbers in Wichita and one in Leavenworth. He chose the Leavenworth
number, not realizing it was a toll call.
</P>
<P>
   Brian racked up $290 in toll charges with Southwestern Bell
before the bill arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the bill and just about fainted,'' said Brian's father,
J. Kevin Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick said a Southwestern Bell billing manager in Topeka
said the company has too many complaints from AOL customers to
waive charges.
</P>
<P>
   The toll charges aren't Southwestern Bell's problem, said Ellen
Pantaenius, a spokeswoman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do advise customers to go back to the (Internet service
provider) and make arrangements to get reimbursed or whatever,''
Pantaenius said.

GIRL RACKS UP $3,190 PHONE BILL USING AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ Wow, talk about a wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly Colclasure, 11, ran up a $3,190 long-distance telephone
bill in a little over a month using America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was caused by a software snag that can affect AOL
customers in Johnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   When Lilly, who lives with her parents in Shawnee, signed up for
an account in early December, AOL's software offered her only three
telephone numbers to access the service _ one in Leavenworth, Kan.,
two in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   All three were toll numbers. But Lilly didn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   And she used those numbers more than 320 times in 37 days
between Dec. 4 and Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows all about computers, but she doesn't know about
long-distance numbers,'' said her mother, Patty Colclasure.
</P>
<P>
   And Lilly isn't alone. Southwestern Bell doesn't keep statistics
but said the company gets enough complaints about toll charges
caused by online service glitches to say that it's a problem.
Thirteen-year-old Brian Fitzpatrick, for instance, ran up a $290
long-distance bill in December at his parents' home in Overland
Park, Kan., using the Leavenworth toll number supplied by AOL.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, used by an estimated 120,000 or more families in
the Kansas City area, contends the service isn't responsible for
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We repeatedly caution members they need to check with the
local phone company to ensure that the number they have chosen is
local for their calling plan and area,'' said Rich D'Amato, an AOL
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also questioned how the problem occurred, contending
that AOL offers subscribers telephone numbers in the 913, 316 and
816 area codes when someone in the 913 area asks for a number.
</P>
<P>
   When told it didn't do that for either the Colclasures,
Fitzpatricks, on three computers in The Kansas City Star's offices
or on a computer at a Star reporter's home, he said, ``That doesn't
describe what should be the user experience.''
</P>
<P>
   However, D'Amato said, it still is the customer's responsibility
to make sure he or she isn't tying into a long-distance line.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more kids are setting up these things, we
recommend that parents participate in every stage,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato noted that a disclaimer on the screen where members are
supplied phone numbers to access the service says: ``Note: members
may incur telephone charges on their phone bill, depending on their
location and calling plan.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the next screen tells the customer to select ``at least
two'' numbers from the list. In the 913 area, all three are
out-of-town numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Customers have to know to key in 816 and look for
a Kansas City number.
</P>
<P>
   AOL hasn't offered to reimburse the Colclasure or Fitzpatrick
families for the charges. And their telephone companies _ AT&AMP;T and
Southwestern Bell _ have refused to waive those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Colclasure said she allowed Lilly to use AOL for a
one-month free trial, primarily so she could download software for
the free NetZero Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, a sixth-grader, wanted online access for school, to
search for music, and to chat online with friends.
</P>
<P>
   When she received the bill, Colclasure said she thought it was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this must be a Y2K thing,'' she said, referring to
the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Colclasure said calls to AOL and AT&AMP;T left her frustrated and
angry. She said AT&AMP;T told her they attempted to call her home twice
to alert the family to the long distance charges, but couldn't
reach her because the line was busy. Those calls, on Dec. 14 and
Dec. 15, came when the bill had reached $890.
</P>
<P>
   Colclasure said the family's average long-distance bill is
closer to $10.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman LeAnn Kuster confirmed the company had tried to
call twice without success. Kuster said AT&AMP;T doesn't put dollar
limits on the accounts of customers in good standing unless they
ask for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incumbent on the customer to know how to set up the
service,'' Kuster said. She offered to work with the family for
extended payments.
</P>
<P>
   Colclasure said the bill is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a 1986 Honda Accord for $3,500 last year. They're
wanting almost a car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, free Internet provider NetZero does offer a local
number when a user keys in the 913 area code to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Internet can do it and AOL can't? That doesn't make
sense,'' Colclasure said.
</P>
<P>
   David Cassell, editor of AOLWatch, an online newsletter that's
critical of AOL, wasn't surprised by the Colclasure's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has shown a remarkable lack of responsibility for problems
like this _ blaming the phone company, blaming the customer,''
Cassell said. ``The bottom line is, AOL does things the way they
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL subscribers in other parts of the country have had similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Public Service Commission criticized AOL in January
1999 for a similar problem. Residents in both Maine and New
Hampshire complained that AOL defaulted to a toll number when they
signed up for the service. One consumer in Maine complained about a
$1,200 bill that resulted from the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   And a Florida woman filed a class-action lawsuit in February in
federal court in Tampa, Fla., accusing AOL of using unfair trade
practices, fraud and misleading advertising. Marguerite Miles said
AOL sells service where the company doesn't have access lines,
costing consumers long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is an old one for residents in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The metropolitan area straddles the state line. AOL's ``modem
pool'' for metro Kansas City is on the 816 area code side of the
line. Tens of thousands of AOL's subscribers are on the 913 area
code side. When customers sign up for AOL, the service asks them
for their area code, then automatically gives them a list to choose
from. MORE

to the division of the spoils in Austria among members of the
long-dominant Social Democratic and conservative People's parties.

Harrison, who considers himself a Christian conservative voter, was

The City as an icon for cultural globalization. In museum shows,
scholarly books and MTV dance marathons, not to mention tourism

   GUASTAVINO-CEILING (New York) _ In a Guastavino tile ceiling,
the sum of a thousand right angles is a curve worthy of nature.
True, the ceilings bespeak meticulous craftsmanship with their
intricate coursing, usually in a telltale basket-weave or
herringbone pattern. True, they evoke the architecture of
Catalonia, where the tradition grew of spanning large spaces with
thin, multilayered tile-and-mortar vaults. But what is most
appealing about the ceilings produced in New York in the early 20th
century by the Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino y Moreno and his
son, Rafael Guastavino y Esposito, is their sublime defiance of the
rectilinear city. Today New York has a chance to fall in love again

EXCERPTS FROM REPUBLICAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-DEBATE) 
(sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts of the debate among the Republican
presidential contenders Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and
Ambassador Alan Keyes on Thursday night, as recorded by The New
York Times:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q.: In view of all the recent tragedies we've had of . . .
children getting a hold of guns and killing other children . . .
what's wrong with requiring trigger locks on new guns?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I don't mind trigger locks being sold. . . . But the
question is how do we enforce it. Are we going to have trigger lock
police knocking on people's doors saying Show me your trigger lock?
I have no problem _ 80 percent of the guns sold today have trigger
locks with them and I think that's fine. I think there needs to be
laws that say that if a parent is irresponsible and a child ends up
with a weapon, the parent ought to be held accountable. I think
laws on the books _ I signed such a law in Texas _ we ought to
enforce those kinds of laws. I think we ought to have instant
background checks where guns are sold. . . . Law abiding citizens
should be allowed to protect themselves and their families, I
believe. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You've talked about . . . arming and paying for rebel armies
in countries like Iraq to overthrow governments that we don't like.
. . . If there's an insurrection in Iraq . . . they're fighting
Saddam Hussein, but they need just a little bit of help . . . and
if we don't help them, they may get wiped out, will we have a moral
obligation under your policy to send American armed forces to help
those folks out?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I think you have made a very narrow interpretation of
what I call rogue state rollback. And that means that you do
whatever you can, whether it be the use of propaganda, whether it
be used to organize groups outside the country, whether it be
arming and training and equipping . . . And . . . the Congress . .
. passed a _ the Iraqi Liberation Act, which calls for basically
exactly the same thing. So I'm sure that was taken into
consideration then.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is a _ this is an attempt to avoid U.S. military
involvement. We do what we can to overthrow these countries which
pose a clear and present danger to the security of the United
States of America. Clearly, Saddam Hussein . . . is attempting to
acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.
That's a direct threat to United States national security. So you
really kind of have two choices: you react militarily, risking
American lives, or do you try to overthrow that government, which
is, by the way, according now to existing laws. I would support
such. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You've never listed which states you're talking about. Does
this include Iraq and Iran and North Korea? . . .
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: When North Korea tests a three-stage missile over Japan,
they pose a threat. And when there's transfer of technology which
allows nations to acquire these weapons of mass destruction, they
are a threat. I'm willing to explore all options, all options, to
prevent that threat from ever being realized. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Is the temperament _ not temper, but the temperament _ of a
potential president fair game and should yours be a source of
worry?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Well, I don't think it should be a source of worry, but
anything is fair game . . . . I believe that I've conducted it with
honor, with dignity and a way that has made me and the people
surrounding me proud. That's why we have attracted so many young
people. . . . Enthusiasm and the commitment of the young people
show that my message and my temperament and my view and my vision
for the future of the country is something that they're able to
look up to, respect, admire and be part of. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Ambassador Keyes . . . what has gone wrong? . . . It is
Republicans you're appealing to. You've been very eloquent through
this entire campaign but they're not flocking to your standard. Are
they rejecting your message or are they rejecting the messenger?
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: I'd be willing to bet a great many of them have no idea
that I'm running, because of the media blackout on this campaign. .
. . . You guys play the game, put the mask over the eyes of the
people, and then ask why they don't see me. And I refuse to dignify
that little tactic with any more of a response than that. Other
people in the country know what you are like, and your colleagues
are doing. And I'll say CNN and people like this may not be _ these
debates have never occurred on the broadcast media, that reach the
mass of the American people. You guys do all right but you don't
get the numbers that ABC, CBS, NBC get, and they have never even
put on one of these Republican debates, and I think it's in part
because a lot of black people also watch what they do. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: If you're in this to carry on your message and maybe at this
point not get the job . . . . are you going to go out and support
one of these two and which of these two gentlemen is better
equipped to carry your message? . . .
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: I will never again cast a vote for an individual I in
conscience believe to be pro-choice, pro-abortion, not pro-life.
Based on the confession of his heart in New Hampshire, when John
McCain told us clearly that he would tell his daughter it was her
choice _ and every woman is somebody's daughter _ so if you tell
the daughters of America it's their choice, you're pro-choice. He
is pro-choice. He is not pro-life. I will not support a pro-choice,
pro-abortion candidate. So that's clear enough . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You have apologized this week to Cardinal O'Connor of New
York for not taking on the anti-Catholicism at Bob Jones University
when you were there and yet, there is, as you know, a long-standing
anti-Catholic strain among southern fundamentalists and evangelists
_ evangelicals. . . . Were you unaware of this history when you
made the decision to go to Bob Jones?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: You know, when I went to Bob Jones, I followed a long
tradition of both Republican and Democrat candidates that went to
lay out their vision. Ronald Reagan went to Bob Jones, my dad went
to Bob Jones, Bob Dole, the Democrat governor from South Carolina
the week before. I talked about bringing people together so America
can achieve its greatness. I talked about lifting the spirit and
the soul of this country. I regret I did not speak out against that
school's anti-Catholic bias. I missed an opportunity. I make no
excuses. I make no excuses. I was on one of those talk shows one
Sunday morning and the talk show host said, you know, one of the
Joneses referred to my dad in a very impolite way. I wasn't aware
of that. But I missed _ what I regret is somebody ascribing to me
opinions and views that are not my views, calling an anti-Catholic
bigot is not right.

RANK DOES HAVE ITS PRIVILEGES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ This is Pothole City, but I found one block
that is as smooth as a baby's cheeks. It's Clay, between Jones and
Leavenworth, recently paved, beautifully done, you could play
championship marbles on it.
<P>
   ``Driving this block used to be like an amusement park ride,''
says Nob Hiller Judi Basolo.
</P>
<P>
   The new pave job stops at the east end of the block. Going west,
Clay is only partially redone. This one block is the pride of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   By bizarre coincidence, the mayor lives on this block.
</P>
<P>
   THIS JUST IN from Gov. Gray Davis: Any California resident who
is not in philosophical and political alignment with the governor
is asked to turn in his or her license plates and guacamole bowl
and move out of the state ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   HAIL TO THE CHIEF and the Chef:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hosts a cozy fund-raising dinner Friday night
at the home of Susie Tompkins (former Esprit boss), with Alice
Waters on kitchen duty.
</P>
<P>
   The produce is from the Garden Project, crops raised by former
S.F. jailbirds. So it's dinner with a social conscience, featuring
French radishes and green garlic.
</P>
<P>
   No fried pork rinds, Alice?
</P>
<P>
   QUIT YER GRIPING. Gas is $1.9999 9/10 per gallon, but as one
e-mail spammer points out, Gatorade and Snapple go for about $10 a
gallon, milk for about $12, Evian for $21.
</P>
<P>
   And Paul Dombey, just back from England, notes that petrol there
is selling for just under $5 a gallon (though they don't call 'em
gallons and dollars).
</P>
<P>
   INVESTMENT TIP? Tanya Efremov saw a parked van, coated with dust
in which someone had finger-written ``washme.com.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HIP MEAT of the new millennium? Might be buffalo. At
Eastside West in Cow Hollow, owner/chef Scott Damman ships the buff
in from Wyoming, whips up ``a big old buffalo chop on a plate.''
Lean, high in iron, and gives you the urge to go out and trample
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL ALERT READERS (sorry, that's redundant) point out that
LSD was invented by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1943. The
innovation was accidental, the result of a lab spill.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A SMALL THING, but Stan Dorsey wishes the person who gives
the PA announcements at the Montgomery Muni station would not say,
``Attention, Muni patrions.'' (cq)  &LR; But what better name for
patriotic Muni patrons who have come to visit Metreon?
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD in a downtown elevator, by Kevin Crilly, two 20ish
women:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my friend's party, she works for Organic.''/``Dot
com?''/``Yeah.''/ ``Is it pre?''/``No, it's gone.''/``How long has
she been there?''/``Since before it went. She has plenty of options
and she's stoked ...''
</P>
<P>
   So who wants to marry a multimillionairess.com?
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW YORK, the new thing is Broadway theaters selling their
names to sponsors. The Selwyn Theater is now the American Airlines
Theater. Says Matt Regan, ``You check your coat, it winds up in
Frisco?''
</P>
<P>
   And when a production flops, the producers can find out what
happened by recovering the black box.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER TV LOW, lower than ``Who Wants to Marry'': They've
cheapened the sport of monster truck racing. It's a semi-legit
sport, enjoyed by kids and me.
</P>
<P>
   So this week there was a one-hour special _ five minutes of
racing and 55 minutes of soft-core T&AMP;A and hokey ``plots''
scavenged from the WWF writers' reject bin. Sad.
</P>
<P>
   NEWEST SINGLES CLUB: Desperate to get in on the new ballpark
action, more than 100 people have purchased one-seat season tickets
for Giants games.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S CHECKING those new dot-com company names for suitability
in public advertising? Like: mofo.com, and eFUCT.com.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE ELITE EAT: Liza Minnelli dining at the Black Cat,
after rehearsal for her local opening ... Robert Altman sipping
coffee (who gulps it?) at the Rose Cafe ... Kenny (Snake) Stabler,
who did a commercial for the stuff, ordering a Miller Lite at the
Fat Lady in Oakland, causing old Raider fan Bobby Reman to do
double-take. Be true to your brew.
</P>
<P>
   THE U.S. OPEN (golf) will be at Pebble Beach in June, and Darryl
Glen reports that homes near the course are offered for rental at
up to $50,000 for the week. Considering that you can sit on your
veranda with a quadruple martini and shout ``You da man'' at Tiger
Woods, that's a bargain.

19 CHARGED IN STOCK SCHEME TIED TO MOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scheme was straight out of a Hollywood pitch
meeting, the authorities said: ``Goodfellas'' meets ``Boiler
Room.'' For nearly three years, they explained, a cadre of
stockbrokers cheated unsuspecting investors out of $40 million _
with the support and muscle of the New York mob.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which was revealed in a federal indictment unsealed
Thursday in Brooklyn, even had the requisite action-movie ending.
In predawn raids, nearly 100 federal agents arrested 11 of the 19
people charged in the stock fraud scheme, including the
brother-in-law of Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia hitman turned
informer better known as Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   While federal law enforcement officials acknowledged Thursday
that Wall Street and La Cosa Nostra had a history of illicit
dealings, they said the current scheme, run from the offices of two
financial district brokerage firms, involved the most senior
members of the Mafia to date.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's brother-in-law, Edward Garafola, 61, of Staten Island,
was indicted along with five other people the authorities called
organized crime figures, including Frank Coppa, 58, of Manalapan,
N.J., who was described as a captain in the Bonanno crime family.
At least two members of the ``Russian Mafia'' were also charged,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D. Schiliro, the assistant director of the FBI in charge
of the New York office, refused to explain what role the Russian
mob had in the case, but he said, in general, that the Russians
``have the ability to bring in an international money-laundering
angle, particularly with overseas accounts.'' Indeed, the
indictment accuses some of the 19 defendants of funneling their
ill-gotten gains through Caribbean accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the scheme, which lasted from 1993
to 1996, was led by John Doukas, 52, of Cross River, N.Y., and
Walter Durchalter, 34, of Middle Village, N.Y., who together
controlled the brokerage firms of White Rock Partners &AMP; Co. and
State Street Capital Markets Corp. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a ploy described as a ``pump and dump,'' Doukas, Durchalter
and their partners secretly bought huge blocks of stock in four
companies, then artificially inflated the stocks' value by flooding
the marketplace with false and misleading information, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When a stock reached what the brokers assumed was its height,
they sold it swiftly and suddenly, the authorities added, ignoring
frantic phone calls from helpless investors who also wanted to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   All told, thousands of investors across the city were duped,
said Loretta E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. In some
cases, she added, the stocks these investors held plunged from
being worth tens of thousands of dollars to being worthless within
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the partners in the illegal scheme could hardly ask the
authorities for help if there were problems, they sought the next
best thing: turning to the gangsters for protection, said Jonathan
S. Sack, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight defendants not arrested Thursday, four were
expected to turn themselves in Friday, two were in custody on
unrelated charges and two were believed to be overseas.

 CANDIDATES' RECYCLED TV ADS GET POOR REVIEWS IN CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By JOHN KING 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As California's primary campaign enters its final weekend, at
least $8 million has been spent on television advertising by the
four major presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But as large as that number sounds, it pales alongside the
commercial barrages unleashed by other statewide candidates in
recent years. And what startles many political and media analysts
is how the money has been used: on a haphazard mix of ads either
aimed at a nationwide audience or left over from past primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something unexpected happens in the next four days,
analysts say the result could be ad campaigns remembered as nothing
more than expensive sideshows that most voters ignored _ or did not
even notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised you don't see any California-specific ads yet,''
says Evan Tracey, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group.
``Clearly, California's the big enchilada for all the candidates,
but there hasn't been an obvious strategy for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge that faces each campaign is daunting _ on two
fronts. In California, where conventional wisdom says that
television advertising is crucial, candidates must grab voters'
attention in a week when the airwaves already are crowded with
commercials for ballot measures. At the same time, Super Tuesday's
other 15 primaries demand attention and resources.
</P>
<P>
   But even if California cannot command the focused attention seen
in earlier primary states, such as South Carolina, observers say
they are struck that little effort seems to have been put into
anything beyond getting ads on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the advertising by any of the candidates breaks new
ground or provides new information to the voter,'' says Roy Behr of
Greer Margolis Mitchell Burns and Associates, a political ad firm
with offices in Los Angeles. ``It doesn't seem to be having much
impact at all.''
</P>
<P>
   According to tracking done by Tracey's Virginia-based firm, $8.2
million has been spent so far to buy television advertising time in
California by the presidential campaigns of Bill Bradley, George W.
Bush, Al Gore and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers put the figure higher. Bill Carrick, a political
advertising expert working on Dianne Feinstein's Senate re-election
bid in California, estimates that the amount spent by the
presidential campaigns already approaches $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   To put these admittedly large numbers in context, the 1998
primary campaign of Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Al Checchi
used roughly two-thirds of its $40 million budget on television
advertising. And the television budget for some of this year's
ballot measures should exceed $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a Checchi-like budget, it is impossible to blanket
California with ads. Instead, the individual campaigns are
concentrating on specific regions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush are focusing on Southern California, where most
of the state's Republicans live. Each has invested about $1.3
million there, according to estimates by Campaign Media Analysis
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, by contrast, McCain has a minimal presence. His
campaign has spent only $80,000 on television advertising here,
compared to Bush's $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Bradley and Gore, meanwhile, have almost ignored the
conservative San Diego area. Instead, Bradley has plowed $1.8
million in ads into the vast Los Angeles market, with Gore spending
$1.2 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Bradley has spent $650,000 and Gore has spent
$425,000. This translates to roughly 310 Bradley ads and 250 for
Gore. Large numbers _ but when the rule of thumb is that any ad
must be seen eight to 10 times to make a strong impression on a
viewer, they are hardly overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Spanish-language ads, all the commercials shown in
California so far were filmed for nationwide use or date back to
earlier primaries.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the haphazard approach to California is that the
lone Bush ad criticizing McCain is from the time of the South
Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   So California viewers may be mystified when Bush complains that
``John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
untrustworthy. That's over the line.'' He's discussing an ad that
aired _ briefly _ three weeks ago and 2,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're stepping into the middle of a novel,'' Carrick
says of the older ads and their themes. ``Presidential campaigns
come to town, and suddenly they realize they've got to get
something on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Applying such a one-size-fits-all method to a state as distinct
as California baffles observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think at some point you would see (Gov. Gray) Davis on
screen saying he supports Gore,'' Tracey says. ``And McCain has the
backing of the top Republican in the state, (Secretary of State)
Bill Jones. You'd expect to see McCain's campaign use him.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is questionable whether even a major burst of
ads could make a strong impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come in in the last two weeks, even with a heavy
advertising buy, and shake things up,'' says Behr, whose firm is
involved in ads opposing Proposition 28, which would roll back a
voter-approved cigarette tax. ``It's difficult for a campaign to
break through.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in South Carolina, where Bush and McCain
together spent $6 million on advertising in a market where $1
million buys 2,300 ads _ more than four times the number that a
similar amount of money would buy in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina, they had saturation between Bush and McCain
the last few weeks,'' Tracey says. ``You would have had to be
living in a trailer with a radio not to see those ads.''

 MCCAIN NEEDS VICTORY IN NEW YORK  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John McCain decided not to show up in person at
Thursday night's debate in Los Angeles, it was less a snub of
California than a bow to the state where he stands his best chance
of winning a big pot of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 states holding GOP presidential primaries or caucuses
Tuesday, none is as likely as New York to provide the Arizona
senator the opportunity to capture Republican votes and burnish his
image as the GOP candidate most able to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So when the sun rises in the East Friday morning, McCain will be
with the ``Today'' show's Katie Couric riding through the streets
of Manhattan on his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus, en route to a
live interview with radio host Don Imus, before holding a noon
rally on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush will not be far behind, racing from
California on a red-eye flight to attend rallies in GOP-vote-rich
Syracuse and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State has been losing clout to California since
before the Giants and Dodgers moved west, but it is in New York
that McCain has been forced to draw a line in the sand. Were McCain
to lose in New York and California, it is hard to see how his
Straight Talk Express could roll on to the following week's
primaries in Texas and Florida _ where the governors are named Bush
_ and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; McCain's New York Edge
</P>
<P>
   The polls, which show McCain down by as much as 20 percentage
points in California, give him a slight edge among registered New
York Republicans, who are the only voters eligible to participate
in the state's GOP primary. Bush leads in conservative strongholds
upstate, while McCain leads in New York City and the suburbs. New
Hampshire is the only other state where McCain has been able to win
a majority of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   After California, New York is the biggest prize on Super
Tuesday, with 101 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has to do something here to counter what may be a
not-so-hot showing in California,'' said New York pollster John
Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McCain's brand of politics is well suited for this
state, where many Republicans are pro-choice and pro-gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain is against legal abortions and gun control, his
opponents in states such as South Carolina and Virginia have
successfully portrayed him as wobbly on conservative issues.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Moderate N.Y. Republicans
</P>
<P>
   Those attacks may not work so well in New York, where Republican
Gov. George Pataki and Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York City both support legal abortions and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things couldn't look better right now,'' said Guy Molinari,
the Staten Island Borough president and former congressman who is
heading McCain's New York campaign. ``We think the spread may even
be greater. McCain's support is very, very hard, very dedicated,
very committed. We know the McCain people will come out and vote. I
don't think they have that intensity on the Bush side.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also has considerable advantages in the state,
including the backing of the party apparatus. Cumbersome petition
requirements make it extremely difficult for anyone without the
support of the party's leaders to appear on the ballot, which
explains why New York has not had a contested presidential primary
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made a spectacle of the restrictive rules, staging an
event in January outside the Russian consulate in Manhattan and
charging that voters in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more open
elections than those from Staten Island to Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The party bosses, headed by Gov. Pataki _ a Bush supporter _
backed down after McCain's huge victory in New Hampshire. Still,
the ballot favors the establishment's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply offering voters statewide a choice between
Bush, McCain or former U.N. Ambassador Alan Keyes, the ballots in
each of the 31 congressional districts offer three delegates
aligned with one of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the delegates _ who in Bush's case are well-known
GOP figures such as Teddy Roosevelt IV _ appear in large bold type,
while the name of the presidential candidate they support appears
in tiny type below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be bad, but I was appalled when I saw
it,'' said Molinari, who had just caught a glimpse of his wife's
absentee ballot. ``You can hardly make out McCain's name. You need
a magnifying glass to do that. And that's deliberate _ that's part
of the effort by the New York state Republican hierarchy to control
the outcome of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said state Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican
and a Bush backer. ``The names are easy to read unless you are
myopic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goodman, whose name is on the ballot as a Bush delegate,
concedes that after 16 terms in the state Legislature, there may be
some loyal constituents who vote for Bush simply because they
recognize Goodman's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' he said. ``That is why I think Bush
has a slight edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other primary voters, New Yorkers have focused less on
specific issues than on questions of character and electability.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics make up an astonishing 46 percent of registered
Republicans, a reflection of the state's history as a magnet for
immigrants from predominantly Catholic countries such as Italy,
Ireland and Poland and now Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither camp knows which way Catholics will go Tuesday, but
their importance doubtless underlies the continuing brouhaha over
Bush's visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina more than a
month ago, which has been followed by escalating charges and
countercharges between McCain and Bush about who is stirring more
outrage among Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that Bush directed his letter of regret over
the Bob Jones visit to New York's Archbishop, Cardinal John
O'Connor, saying he should have denounced the college's
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, Bush supporters have charged that McCain's
crusade against pork-barrel spending in Washington has been
disastrous to New York.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush TV commercial features the leader of a Long Island
breast cancer advocacy group who attacks McCain for opposing funds
for breast cancer research. Bush supporters also have faulted
McCain for opposing federal relief for a 1998 ice storm and a bill
to help the state's dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were such a thing as an anti-New York caucus, he
would be the head of it,'' said U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   New York political observers say the final days of campaigning
will be pivotal in a state that takes its politics seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, election day is an afterthought,'' said one
Republican official. ``In New York, it is a day of holy
obligation.''

BUSH, MCCAIN PUMMEL EACH OTHER OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM IN 
 LATEST DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John
McCain squabbled over education, foreign policy and campaign ethics
Thursday night, but saved their toughest punches for campaign
finance reform in the last debate before Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   A tightly controlled format left little room for interaction and
allowed the candidates to give their well-rehearsed stump speeches
on many contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hour-long event provided the candidates an
opportunity to rev up their war of words as they close out their
campaigns in crucial California, where 162 GOP delegates are at
stake for the winning Republican candidate in the blanket primary.
Fifteen other states, including delegate-rich New York, also have
primaries or party caucuses on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whom polls show to be 10 to 20 percentage points behind
Bush among GOP voters, continually stressed his Republication
credentials, which he said are rooted in Abraham Lincoln, Theodore
Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, whom McCain has recently accused of negative
campaigning, tried to portray himself as a reformer and a uniter, a
candidate who could provide ``a fresh start'' after an era of
political cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who appeared with Bush and former Ambassador Alan Keyes
via satellite, was severely disadvantaged by his own decision not
to participate in person in the CNN-Los Angeles Times forum held in
the Harry Chandler Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was seen by viewers in a surreal ``Max Headroom''
fashion via a television mounted on a third podium next to two live
participants. That allowed Bush to interact with both questioners
and the audience _ underscoring his presence by leaning on the
podium, emerging from behind it and, at one point, standing
mischievously next to Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   The former ambassador, whose campaign has become a virtual
footnote in the race, spent most of the evening lecturing both his
competitors and the press on issues of morality.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of the night belonged to Bush and McCain, who were
both forced to tackle recent religion-themed controversies that
have dogged their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in a question about his recent scathing criticism of
Christian televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, was asked
if he could win the GOP vote if he appeared to be declaring war on
a substantial faction in his own party _ the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have rejected the leadership of these two individuals, who
have led our party in the wrong direction,'' said McCain, who
decried what he called Robertson and Fallwell's ``message of
intolerance and exclusion, rather than inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, was forced to address the lingering
controversy over his visit to Bob Jones University, a private South
Carolina institution whose founders have voiced anti-Catholic
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I follow a long tradition of both Republican and Democratic
candidates (who went there) to lay out their vision,'' he said. ``I
talked about bringing people together so America can achieve its
greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush sidestepped the question about whether he regretted
going to the university, he did acknowledge: ``I regret I did not
speak out against that school's anti-Catholic bias. I make no
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he turned on McCain and said, ``What I regret is the
politics of smearing somebody's reputation. That's what I regret.
And I don't appreciate it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain asked for time to respond, Bush said, ``I didn't
attack Sen. McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another animated and contentious moment came over the issue of
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained that individuals must, as a matter of free
speech, have the right to donate any amount they want to political
campaigns. He argued that disclosure is the real answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my state ... individuals can give to a candidate what they
want to give, so long as there's disclosure,'' he said. ``We ought
to know who's given to whom (via the Internet) and we ought to do
it in real-time basis, (so there's) nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain _ who has made campaign finance reform and ``breaking
the iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation'' a
cornerstone of his campaign _ used that opening to call the Texas
governor's campaign finance reform plan ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that explains why there's been the sleepovers in Austin
of the Pioneers,'` said McCain, referring to Associated Press
reports of eight $100,000 Bush donors who have slept at the
Governor's Mansion in the Texas capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about people staying with me,'' Bush retorted.
``These are my friends, John, these are my relatives. ... You talk
a lot about the iron triangle, and you're ringing it like a dinner
bell with these all fund-raisers with lobbyists in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm ringing it like a dinner bell, you've got both feet in
the trough,'' McCain fired back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became almost passionate on questions of education, and the
issue allowed him an opportunity to pound the message that he is
``a reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he said, ``we hold people accountable'' for school
system improvements. ``You must prove the children are learning to
read and write and add and subtract. ... I won't accept
mediocrity,'' he said. ``A system without accountability is a
system that quits on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``I know what I'm talking about ... because we've
done it in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in contrast, seemed to stumble with a rambling,
unfocused answer when asked his most important contribution on
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in leading the effort in my, being involved in the
effort, in my state for reform in many areas,'' he said, without
providing many specifics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is ``certain Christian conservatives from all
over the country will flock'' to his reform banner, while Bush said
he would ``reach out to Democrats and independents'' if he is the
nominee, as he said he has done in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harshness of the nomination campaign, McCain said he
would support the eventual nominee and ruled out bolting the party
when asked if he might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loyal Republican,'' he said. ``The Republican Party is
my home.''

DISCORD AT UNIVERSITIES AS STUDENTS JAM INTERNET LINES TO 
 DOWNLOAD POP MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Universities across the country are pulling the plug on
music-hungry students who have clogged campus computer networks
using a new way of downloading and sharing songs on the Internet.
<P>
   San Francisco State University and the University of California
at Berkeley are among more than 100 institutions that have blocked
or limited access to a San Mateo Web site
 &UR; (www.napster.com)  &LR; that they say is largely to blame for the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Started last year by an 18-year-old college student, Napster
allows users an easy way to search through hundreds of thousands of
popular songs over the Internet and download them free of charge
using the company's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't bought a CD since I got to Cal,'' said UC Berkeley
freshman Julian Kapoor, 18, who acknowledges a song-a-day habit
with Napster.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say the software use is overwhelming campus
computer systems, disrupting e-mail and academic uses of the
Internet and sending connection costs soaring.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley officials blame Napster for a dramatic jump in the
residence halls' share of campus Internet traffic _ to 50 percent
in January and February from about 10 percent in November.
Connection costs have rocketed to $18,000 a month from $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The university decided to limit access to the site by capping
the traffic that the 6,000 students in the residence halls could
exchange with off-campus sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to break the budget this year, that is where it
was headed,'' said Cliff Frost, director of communication and
network services at UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State cut off access to the site after students
using Napster ate up the entire Internet bandwidth available to the
campus several times in November, preventing anyone else from using
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something,'' said Steve Smith, the campus network
analyst. ``We don't have an enormous pipe to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions from Brown University to the University of
Texas have taken similar actions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hawkins, president of EDUCAUSE in Boulder, Colo., which
represents computer systems workers at 1,700 colleges and
universities, said he has never seen anything on the magnitude of
Napster use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've had an application that has singularly
done something like this before,'' Hawkins said. ``There is no
doubt that this tool is disrupting the primary reason those
networks are on these campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Brooks, vice president of marketing for Napster,
called the popularity of the site ``wonderful.'' But she said the
company ``never had an intention of impeding academic traffic or
causing network havoc,'' adding that the company is trying to help
universities deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is a variety of solutions, including prioritizing
traffic on a network, putting academic use above entertainment, or
throttling the bandwidth, which is what UC Berkeley is doing.
</P>
<P>
   But students are angry that college administrators are
restricting their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Kapoor, like many of the other students eating in a university
dormitory cafeteria this week, did not know that Napster had caused
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not like the idea of the university deliberately
slowing down the students' connection. He said the slowdown, which
came while he was doing online research for a biology project, was
``irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should find another way. The Net is for the
students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Paulson, 19, a sophomore at Indiana University who started
an organization called Students Against University Censorship,
established a Web site to publicize the fight two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said that rather than limiting Internet traffic, the campus
administrators should do more to make students aware of the
implications of sucking up so much bandwidth and set use policies.
If students still misuse the system, then they should be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the students don't realize there are limits to it so
they just go crazy. They don't understand the impact,'' Paulson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the way the software works. It sends
users to music files on personal computers that have already
downloaded them. But in order to share music files, users must
leave the software running. Many students do so all night or while
they are in class.
</P>
<P>
   And with the high-speed Internet connections most universities
offer, they think nothing of downloading several songs at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week I came in, both my roommates sat in front of
their computers for weeks downloading songs,'' UC Berkeley freshman
Brian Chung, 18, said.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson has compiled a list of 106 campuses blocking Napster and
has gathered 5,059 signatures for an online petition to pressure
administrators to reinstate access on all campuses _ or at least to
talk with students about it.
</P>
<P>
   He said universities should not unilaterally limit resources for
students who pay thousands of dollars a year in tuition. ``I think
it is our right to see the Internet as the Internet and not the
university version of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, of the university computer workers association,
disputed the students' charges of censorship, saying universities
are not blocking content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nothing more than a tool. This is not like saying you
cannot see the Kinsey report or something else that someone finds
offensive,'' he said. ``When this thing is running, it uses so much
of the bandwidth that other people are kept from using e-mail and
the other Internet resources for teaching and learning.''

BRUINS BLOW TWO-GOAL LEAD

   A couple of programs, four hot dogs, four drinks: $40.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Chance of seeing the Bruins win these days: absolutely zero.
</P>
<P>
   The season isn't quite bankrupt yet, at least not
mathematically, but both spiritually and realistically, the
1999-2000 season came to a close Thursday night when the Bruins
turned a 2-0 lead into an inexplicable 5-2 loss to the Canadiens
before a sellout crowd of 17,565 at the Vault.
</P>
<P>
   Bedeviled by mental mistakes and a period-plus of poor
execution, the Hub's hard-luck hockey team turned fortune into
folly after Sergei Samsonov and Eric Nickulas posted the 2-0 lead
by midway through the second period. They botched passes, pinched
at the wrong time, left gaping holes in front of goalie Rob Tallas,
and overall made like lost souls from the Disney on Ice show that
recently departed Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly tardy for his postgame news conference, a perturbed Pat
Burns, after apologizing for being late, said he led his defeated
charges through a postgame question-and-answer session that didn't
produce much more than a chorus of ``I don't know(s),'' ``I blew
it(s),'' and ``Gee, got me(s).''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't screw up all the time,'' said Burns, sharing some of
the comments he offered his players. ``I'm telling you, we'll look
at the tape (Friday), and we'll see the same mistakes from the same
individuals . . . it's very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are now a stupefying 1-6-3 in the 10 games since the
February All-Star break. They are six points behind the Rangers in
the hunt for the final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference.
They have but 18 games to go in the 82-game season and are now a
grim nine games below .500. They have 19 wins, more than only the
Islanders, Thrashers, and Lightning in the 28-team NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't seem to get any answers,'' said Burns, at a loss to
explain how his club could play well for nearly a full two periods
and then so thoroughly collapse. ``Maybe you people can, but I
can't. How do you control a hockey game for 37 minutes . . . the
game plan can't be that bad, otherwise we would have been blown out
in the first 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet, funereallike dressing room, the players
continually said Burns was justified in his anger. The 2-0 lead
validated the game plan. They had the framework to win. Their
downfall could be traced mainly to two things: poor decisions and,
once more, an obvious failure to move their legs. Once Benoit
Brunet pierced their bubble with a shorthanded strike with 3:44 to
go in the second, they unraveled, outshot by the Habs, 16-11, the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fragile, just look at the way we play,'' said team
captain Ray Bourque, who made a nice one-handed feed in the first
that sent Sergei Samsonov off for a breakaway goal. ``We're having
a hard time holding it together for 60 minutes. It doesn't take
much to shake us.''
</P>
<P>
   The standing knockout punch came with 5.6 seconds to go in the
second. After Rob Tallas turned back a Saku Koivu belt from the
right circle, Shayne Corson snaked through a defense of Shawn Bates
and Hal Gill and potted the 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the third period was predictably morose. Ex-Bruin
Sergei Zholtok wristed in the winner with 8:11 to go in the period,
walking out front, faking a slap, and wristing in an 8-footer. The
Bruins resisted the play with their Dead Men Walking defense.
Corson then struck for his second of the night, taking advantage of
a Tallas-Dave Andreychuk miscue at the side of the net. With 1:18
to go, Martin Rucinsky finished off a shorthander for the 5-2
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We messed up,'' said dependable Don Sweeney, among the very
few positive contributors this season. ``We continue to make
mistakes, over and over, and sooner or later that's going to bite
you in the backside.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation, of course, could be as simple as saying these
Bruins just aren't good enough to compete on a night-to-night
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be here as a player believing that or saying that,''
said Sweeney. ``That would be a defeatist attitude, and you just
can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns bristled at the question/suggestion that perhaps the
players aren't listening to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me that (expletive) question,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The same questions, night after night. No real answers.
</P>
<P>
   When does the season end? April 9.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be any clearer than that.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN 
  c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Hakeem Olajuwon rushed to find Cuttino Mobley to make sure he
understood what had happened. Coaches had spoken to Mobley. Other
teammates had said a word or two. Mobley's hip was screaming at
him, the pain swimming upstream against the emotions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Olajuwon had to be clear. He had to know that Mobley knew
what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved the game,'' Olajuwon said. ``That was the game. That
play, that was the game right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley had made running jumpers. He knocked down 3-pointers and
completed breaks with dunks. For the fourth consecutive game, he
led the Rockets in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But he won the game with a mad, desperate defensive dash that
left him writhing in pain and the Rockets on their way to a 102-99
win over the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling him that saved the game,'' Olajuwon said.
``To do that without fouling, that was a great play. I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley had scored 10 of the Rockets' previous 13 points,
bringing them back down the stretch to a two-point lead. But when
he missed a jumper, he saw Jon Barry sneaking up the court and then
flying ahead of the Rockets to what seemed a sure layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Barry leaking after I shot it,'' Mobley said. ``I tried
my best to get down there and at least change the shot. He was
leaking the whole game. You get easy buckets like that. So I went
to try to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry left his layup short with 22 seconds left and the Rockets
leading 96-94. While Mobley crashed to the court with a strained
hip, Steve Francis rebounded. The Rockets made six free throws in
the final 21 seconds to close out the win with Mobley, and his
team-high 22 points, watching from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley said he planned to play in Saturday's 1:30 p.m. game
against the Nets, though he did not know what his injury is.
</P>
<P>
   But as he labored to dress, Mobley said the Rockets have applied
the lessons learned in their loss to the Lakers on Sunday. After
holding the Clippers to the worst shooting ever by a Rockets
opponent or even by a Clippers team, a defensive play against the
league's most prolific scoring team proved the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Rudy Tomjanovich) told us the other day after the
Lakers game, he wants us to play `D' and he wants me to start it,''
Mobley said. ``I try to take it upon myself to make it hard for
people to shoot. I didn't see it that way, but everybody said it
saved the game. I'm all for saving games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did not see it that way either, but for a different
reason. Heading back down the court, Barry called for a foul,
pointing to his right elbow. Forward Chris Webber raised his arms
as if stunned by the no-call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty easy call,'' coach Rick Adelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had been fouled, Barry said: ``I can't say anything.
If you pay my fine, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley said Barry said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too stupid,'' Mobley said. ``He'd better not say anything
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more the Kings could blame. On a day the Rockets
brought centers Kelvin Cato and Olajuwon back into the rotation,
the guards dominated and the team rolled to a 19-point first-half
lead. Francis regained much of his shooting touch and swagger. He
had 17 points and nine assists. Though he committed a foolish foul
in the last minute, grabbing Barry's shirt as Shandon Anderson
drove for a breakaway, he made four free throws in the final
seconds to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson set the early tone and finished with 19 points, his
best scoring game in more than two weeks. And Moochie Norris, who
signed for the rest of the season Monday, had a career game,
scoring 16 points and collecting five assists, four rebounds and
three steals in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Norris nailed a running 40-footer to end the first quarter with
the Rockets surging to a 30-19 lead. He dropped another bomb with
3:12 left, giving the Rockets a 91-88 lead they never would lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Moochie was fantastic,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He made
a lot of all-around plays. He was on the boards. He made a big 3
that gave us some breathing room. He's a great addition.''
</P>
<P>
   And between him and Francis, the Rockets forced Kings point
guard and highlight machine Jason Williams into his first scoreless
game of the season. Williams missed his only three attempts. He had
seven assists but also had six turnovers in 20 minutes, spending
all but five minutes of the second half on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets still had to sweat out the last minutes. After
leading by 19 in the first half and 12 at halftime, the Rockets
looked as if the Clippers disease so evident Monday had been
contagious. Within 2{ minutes of the fourth quarter, the Kings took
their first lead since the opening minutes with Scot Pollard
dropping a hook and Barry nailing a 3 to make it 78-77.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had made one of nine shots in the quarter. Francis
had missed a lauyp, a 3 and a dunk. But Francis pulled up on a
break to nail a trey before Mobley took over. But it was after he
missed that he made the play that had to be made. And in case it
wasn't clear, Olajuwon said it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved the game,'' Olajuwon said. ``I had to tell him. He
seemed to like hearing it. That play saved the game.''

SONICS WILT AGAINST HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The look on Gary Payton's face was perhaps most telling.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is the point guard's scowl replaced by a puzzling look,
but this was one of those nights.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Watching opponents make layups as if it were a practice drill
can have a dizzying effect. Especially when the spell reaches three
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   So it is safe to say that after a 101-83 loss to the Miami Heat
Thursday night at American Airlines Arena, the Sonics are
officially dazed and confused. However, Payton _ and he is not
alone _ isn't too punch drunk to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   When you allow a team to go from shooting a season-low 29.6
percent in one game to posting a season-high 58-percent, the snag
is clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could not have stopped anyone the way they defended
the Heat. Consequently, the matador defensive effort led to their
second straight road loss on a five-game trip that continues in
Atlanta tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play defense, we can't beat anybody,'' Payton
said. ``We're not concentrating. We don't trust each other. So
we'll keep winning one and losing one. Lose two and win one. We'll
keep doing that until we realize that we have to play defense.
Until then, we won't be a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the Sonics have been completely fraudulent on this road
trip, beginning with a poor game they somehow stole in Charlotte on
Monday. Thursday was the second straight game in which the Sonics
suffered through below-40-percent shooting. It was also the second
time this week they allowed their opponent to shoot 51 percent or
better, build a big lead and stiff arm any comeback attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Miami built a 23-point lead in the first half as Seattle scored
just 13 points in the opening period and shot 36 percent for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Curious was that the Sonics settled for outside shots when the
Heat played without starting center Alonzo Mourning. He did not
dress because of a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't shoot the ball, and I give their defense a lot of
credit for that,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``It's
disappointing. We were slow getting into our offense, and they did
a good job of making us go to our third and fourth option. We were
fighting the shot clock all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Vin Baker dismissed the notion the Sonics thought the
Heat would be easier to handle without Mourning in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played hard,'' Baker said. ``Coach (Pat) Riley is going
to get them to play hard every night. A lot of times when you don't
have one of your best players in the game, you're going to play
harder. For example, we beat them in Seattle without Horace
Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics actually got within 74-68 with 11:40 to play in the
game, mainly because they attacked the basket more in the second
half. Still, they never posed a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Miami answered every Sonics run the same, by forcing its way
around, through and over the Sonics to get to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was an F,'' Grant said of the Sonics' defensive
effort. ``The third quarter was a D-plus. The fourth quarter was an
F-plus. I keep saying we have to just play defense. It's like a
broken record. Until we learn how to play defense, we're going to
keep losing.,,
</P>
<P>
   Because the Sonics rely so much on scoring in transition,
defensive breakdowns disrupt their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely cause for alarm at this point in the season,''
guard Brent Barry said. ``... There's been no fast-break baskets.
The only fast breaks we're making is to Starbucks before the game
to get coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Ruben Patterson were the only ones who played in a
rhythm offensively. Baker had 23 points and nine rebounds.
Patteron's career-high 24 points were wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a great job on Gary Payton,'' Riley said after the Heat
held Payton to 8-of-23 shooting. ``We were able to prevent him from
making all of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat scrambled and trapped the Sonics, forcing poor shots
and miss after miss. Miami then turned those misfires into scores.
Even without Mourning, the Heat were just as effective inside with
his replacement, Clarence Weatherspoon, as they were from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we need to get slapped in the face for our
team to get it going,'' Barry said. ``We did it in Orlando and
couldn't come back. We did it in Miami and couldn't come back. This
is not good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ORLANDO, Fla., _ Sincerity doesn't come in 400 well-prepared,
double-spaced words.
</P>
<P>
   It comes from the heart, which John Rocker said was where his
apology to the baseball world Thursday came from. But his actions
said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Rocker sit there stone-faced and staring into the
distance in front of 22 cameras and some 140 reporters reading his
prepared text than he bolted from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerity doesn't come from awkwardly and nervously telling the
public you're sorry, like a rookie weekend anchor reading a
TelePrompTer for the first time. It comes from standing there face
to face _ not in the outfield playing catch with Braves teammate
Rudy Seanez, as Rocker did after his brief one-sided news
conference Thursday. It comes from talking. And listening.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Rocker's profanity-laced Sports Illustrated
denunciation of minorities, homosexuals, foreigners and everyone
else who doesn't look like Rocker, come from where Rocker comes
from and believe in what he believes in, Rocker said he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to baseball, showed remorse in a quick and quiet
five-minute speech, and then went out and acted as if everything
was peachy-keen again, working out in the bullpen and then signing
autographs for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not like everything is suddenly right again just
because that's what the script said. And it won't be until Rocker
does the very thing he said he would do in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology is no more than just words,'' he said, ``unless it
is followed by actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after uttering those words, Rocker announced he
wouldn't address the issue anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embracing the opportunity to begin stepping back into
the good graces of millions of people who squirmed at Rocker's
words last December, he went jogging into the outfield, leaving his
teammates behind to answer the questions he should have answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ball one.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ours is a forgiving society and one in which free
speech is among the truths we should hold dear. Rocker had every
right to say what he said, and even those who might believe Rocker
is a weak man, no matter his 96-mph fastball, could eventually
forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of talking, listening and answering questions
Thursday, Rocker read from a script and blew probably his greatest
opportunity to begin showing the public the John Rocker he says
will be different.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the seemingly racist views Rocker expressed in
December, we shouldn't forever be appalled by them if he shows
change, or at least an understanding and acceptance of a diverse
society. Everyone deserves a second chance, and, well, all Rocker
did was express his opinion, albeit one that could have severe
consequences for him, the Braves and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But what was indeed sad and appalling was the way Rocker made no
effort to answer questions, begin trying to understand other
people's viewpoints, reach out and let actions speak louder than
words.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest, classiest people of all on this tense day at
Braves camp were Rocker's teammates. They were all class. To a man,
they stood there answering questions for as long as they were
asked, hoping to ease the public's pain and explain John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker only hid.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones stood in the sun for more than an hour, with
rarely fewer than 30 reporters surrounding him. Jones was asked why
Rocker refused to interact, to back up his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe John's scared,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's scary. Baseball has been thrown headlong into as
touchy and hot an issue as any in America. But if you are sincere,
and you care and you hope to redefine yourself, you stand up to it
and begin taking those steps. Rocker didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Javy Lopez sat in the Braves' dugout, trying to let the
public know Rocker was not evil, only different and a man with
problems. But Lopez also wondered why Rocker didn't heed the advice
several teammates gave him in the Braves' closed-door meeting early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked to address this with (the public) straight-on,''
Lopez said. ``He has to show people that he's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said shortstop Ozzie Guillen: ``He's maybe immature or stupid or
ignorant or whatever you want to call it. But he has to try to
change that. We'll try to help him, but really it's up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had a chance to stand tall and make a sincere pitch to
the world Thursday. But like his first toss into the mitt as his
teammates answered for him, Rocker's effort was well out of the
strike zone.

NO NEED TO SHOW GATHERS' DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ (begin ital)``This was the scene about seven
minutes into the first half. Gathers with the stuff and LMU led
25-13. He goes back to play defense. You'll hear a whistle, and you
may want to turn your head. Some of you at home will not like to
see what's coming up. After the whistle, Gathers seemingly fine,
takes a couple of steps and collapses.''(en ital)
</P>
<P>
   -ESPN's Chris Berman on ``SportsCenter,'' March 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to show it the first time. There's no reason
to show it again.
</P>
<P>
   But ESPN Classic will do so Saturday at 5 p.m. as part of a
``SportsCenter Flashback'' series, a documentary on the life and
death of former Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers as it
happened 10 years ago to the date.
</P>
<P>
   The wrenching emotions brought in this less-than-30-second video
clip - watching Gathers go from finishing a dunk to fainting on the
court during a game, sitting up with that horrifying look on his
face, rolling over again and eventually dying from heart failure -
brings back the controversy of what went on behind the scenes at
ESPN with the producers who watched the video shot by a free-lance
cameraman and then had to decide in about an hour before the
``SportsCenter'' show which of it to air.
</P>
<P>
   The clip is a small part of the brilliantly presented hour-long
show on ESPN Classic. Bonded by interviews of some 20 people who
take us through that time, the result is an incredible effort to
cover every aspect of that story.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision then to run that tape is just as difficult -
and wrong - as it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust of the show is to revisit the news of the day of
the prism of `SportsCenter,' and that being the case, it seems to
me from a news standpoint that it is appropriate to show again,``
said Vince Doria, ESPN Classic's executive producer who, at the
time of Gathers' death, was managing editor of The National Sports
Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to those involved in the original decision and there
was much more of the video we did not show, such as the family
coming onto the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always weighing whether it's news versus causing pain,
and I know in Los Angeles, this is very painful to watch again. But
it's interesting that no one we interviewed (for this show),
including Gathers' mother and brother, requested we not use it.
That being the case, my feeling is to present it as it was then to
give people the sense of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you do this, there are valid arguments for or
against, but you have to come down one side or another. You go with
your convictions and hope you're doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports News' Keith Olbermann, working at KCBS Channel 2 the
night of Gathers' death, is one of those whose convictions go the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, who did a beautiful tribute to Gathers during his
``Freestyle'' segment on Fox Sports News on Wednesday, considers
showing the tape of Gathers' last breathing moments ``was, and
remains, barbaric,'' adding he never let them replay that clip in
any ``SportsCenter'' he did at ESPN in the years he was there.
</P>
<P>
   In the ESPN Classic show, most poignant to L.A. viewers are the
comments from former USC basketball coach Stan Morrison and
assistant David Spencer, who brought Gathers and Bo Kimble to
Southern California from Philadelphia and remained very close to
the two after their abrupt firing. Also, former KTLA Channel 5
sportscaster Ed Arnold, who had the two as interns at the station,
breaks down several times remembering Gathers' impact on his life
and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been that close to an athlete before, him and Bo,''
Arnold says in the show. ``Always as a reporter you try to separate
that, you try not to be so personal. This was a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, hosted by ESPN's Karl Ravech, who himself experienced
a heart attack recently, is followed by a replay of the Feb. 3,
1990 game 20th-ranked LMU played at 14th-ranked Louisiana State.
Gathers scored 48 points in a 148-141 overtime loss against LSU
freshman Shaquille O'Neal (20 points, 24 rebounds, 12 blocks) and
another future NBA big man, Stanley Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Pull up a tape recorder: Like it or not, today's Dodgers-Houston
exhibition opener from Vero Beach, Fla., is the first of weekday
games that will be delayed seven hours on radio, a 5 p.m. start, on
the team's flagship station AM-1150 as well as affiliates KAVL-AM
(610) in Lancaster, KBET-AM (850) in Thousand Oaks and KIIS-AM
(1220) in Santa Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   The games can be heard live on the Internet at the team's Web
site (www.dodgers.com), with most starts at 10 a.m. However, a
30-minute postgame show hosted by Ross Porter won't be taking phone
calls because it's part of the delay.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, starting with KTLA Channel 5's Saturday (10 a.m.)
and Sunday (11 a.m.) coverage of the Dodgers-New York Mets games,
the experiment of having Vin Scully do a simulcast of the first two
innings for radio and TV starts.
</P>
<P>
   To clarify: The plan is to have Scully do only those two innings
on radio. He'll spend the rest of the time on TV.
</P>
<P>
   During the O'Malley regime, Scully agreed to do the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings of radio. It was cut it back to two middle
innings for the last two seasons. And now, his call won't even be
exclusive for radio.
</P>
<P>
   For the regular season, Scully plans to miss about 45 games.
Aside from taking off road games that aren't televised (about 32),
he'll sit about a dozen home that are on Fox Sports Net. He'll also
miss some time in May when he gives the commencement speech at his
alma mater, Fordham University.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rick Monday has been mercifully replaced on weekend
``DodgerTalk'' by AM-1150's Jeff Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -The effect Los Angeles has on luring athletes into thinking
they have a future in TV and movies is one part of the latest
half-hour ESPN ``Outside the Lines'' (presented by AT&AMP;T, remember)
episode called ``Playing the Part: Athletes as Actors'' (today, 4
p.m., re-airing Saturday at 9 a.m.) The Lakers' Rick Fox and
Shaquille O'Neal are featured, as is former Rams great Fred
``Hunter'' Dryer. This should be a springboard for ESPN's next
``Lines'' special: ``Playing the Fool: `SportsCenter' Anchors Who
Wanna Be On Commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   -Joe McDonnell reports on his Web site (www.la-sports.com) that
he's actively looking to get back into sports-talk radio as well as
keep his afternoon weekday job doing sports updates on KFWB-AM
(980). ``For me to do talk again, it's either going to have to be
earlier in the day, on a weekend or on the Internet. If I was going
to bet on one, I'd say the Internet... And that's what I'm focusing
on right now,'' McDonnell writes.
</P>
<P>
   -ABC will end the season for ``Sports Night'' on April 4 so it
can't do any more ratings damage during May sweeps. According to
Entertainment Weekly, rival networks NBC and HBO are ready to take
the series if ABC dumps it.
</P>
<P>
   -No cracks about 7:15 gametime starts former Dodgers pitcher, TV
analyst and ``DodgerTalk'' host Al Downing has been hired as an
analyst on Fox Sports Net South's 30-game Atlanta Braves' TV
package.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -It's far from a marketing nightmare, but the Dodgers and some
members of the Jewish community who've shown support of the team
since the signing of !racepay!Shawn Green!off didn't find the first
advertisements about season ticket sales that ran in newspapers
last week very kosher. The ad presents an offer to buy two season
seats and get two more free in selected sections along with the ad
copy that reads: ``Use them with your kids, your clients or the two
schmucks down the street who swear they went to high school with
you.'' The Dodgers offices received calls the next day asking that,
aside from the fact this perpetuates the Jewish stereotype of
trying to get something free, the literal Yiddish translation for
``schmuck'' isn't appropriate. By the way, the marketing company
responsible for the ad, whom the Dodgers recently hired, is named
WongDoody. (begin ital)Oy vay(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   -Because concert dates at the Reunion Arena in the days prior to
the game cut into the prep time ESPN needed for the extra set-up,
the special ``NHL Rules!'' coverage of Sunday's Detroit-Dallas
contest had to be canceled. ESPN will still carry the game (5 p.m.)
with Gary Thorne and Bill Clement, but if it had gone as planned,
it would have been covered by two analysts (Clement and Darren
Pang) and no play-by-play man, and commentary and graphics would
have focused more on offensive and defensive strategies, explaining
rules and taking e-mail from viewers. ESPN's first attempt at this
kind of coverage drew rave reviews last month. A decision on the
next ``Rules!'' telecast will come soon.

USC CAN'T GRAB A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD - USC was so desperate for ways to stop No. 1-ranked
Stanford on Thursday night, injured forward Jarvis Turner lunged
off the bench in street clothes and grabbed Cardinal guard Casey
Jacobsen by the shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's ploy didn't work and he was quickly assessed a
technical foul by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing else the Trojans tried was remotely successful, as
the Cardinal breezed to a 111-68 victory before 7,391 at Maples
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points USC has ever allowed in a basketball
game, and the second-worst loss in school history. Only a 92-48
loss to Arizona in 1988 ranks worse than this debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's antics, which looked more like something out of a
cartoon or Marx Brothers movie, at least provided some
entertainment to a lopsided contest. And it was the first play he's
made in nearly five weeks since fracturing his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just out of frustration. I wanted to win and I got
carried away and caught up in the emotion of the game,'' Turner
said. ``It was real stupid. I shouldn't have done it. I was
frustrated sitting on the bench all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprised person in the arena was Jacobsen, who looked
stunned following the sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of that happening before,'' Jacobsen said.
``I was really upset, but he did apologize after the game. It was
very bizarre. I kind of turned around and looked at him and he
wasn't looking at me, like he was hoping nobody saw him. Luckily,
the ref saw it. If the ref hadn't seen it, I would be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the evening wasn't quite so funny for the Trojans.
Although forward Sam Clancy made his highly anticipated debut after
being out since Jan. 20 with a broken right foot, the Trojans lost
forward Brian Scalabrine late in the first half when he suffered a
right-hip flexor. He did not play in the second half and finished
with just four points.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby said the trainers told him Scalabrine
would be OK for Saturday's game at California, but Scalabrine was
limping badly as he left Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't know until I get back to the hotel for treatment,''
Scalabrine said. ``I stopped and changed directions on the floor
and it just popped. I don't know what's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's situation was much more upbeat, or about the only good
news possible, when you've lost by 43 points to the top-ranked team
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He played 18 minutes and had five rebounds, four points and two
assists and looked decent considering his long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt fine. (My foot) didn't bother me at all,'' Clancy
said. ``It's kind of sore now. I felt rusty out there. A lot of
shots I would normally make didn't go for me. I got tired a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss probably eliminates USC from NCAA Tournament
consideration. USC hopes to finish the season with three victories
and then pray on Selection Sunday that a 17-13 record would somehow
be good enough to earn an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   But a more likely destination is the National Invitation
Tournament, provided the Trojans don't suffer a complete meltdown
and fail to win at least two of their final three games.
</P>
<P>
   USC's fate was about the only distraction from the Cardinal's
complete domination. Stanford (25-1, 14-1) shot 57.6 percent from
the field and did not trail except when Brandon Granville hit a
3-pointer to give the Trojans a 3-2 lead to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen had 23 points and Harvard-Westlake graduates Jarron and
Jason Collins also had big games. Jarron had 19 points and 10
rebounds; Jason added 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Trojans struggled from the field (37.1 percent),
a trademark during their slump that has seen them lose seven of
their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't execute,'' Bibby said. ``We've had that problem
lately where we don't run anything, we just have Brandon or Brian
dribbling around. What bothered me tonight was that we didn't even
compete.''

UCLA MAKES BIG COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY - The directions to the NCAA Tournament said nothing
about this. They said nothing about reserve Billy Knight sparking a
rally and center Dan Gadzuric playing the game of his life and
fifth-place UCLA playing like the first-place Bruin teams of
seasons past.
</P>
<P>
   And they absolutely, positively said nothing about rallying from
a 19-point first-half deficit to defeat Cal 83-62 Thursday night
before 12,172 at Haas Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Bruins (16-11, 7-8) wear unpredictability like a
badge of honor. They can be hypnotically good and shockingly bad.
Sometimes, they're both in the same game, which explains their
unforgettable performance Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 33-14 with 6:30 left in the first half, the Bruins
responded with a 16-2 surge and then took command with their best
second half of the season. Maybe those double-digit losses to
Stanford, Arizona, Arizona State, USC and Oregon did some good,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down a lot, and we know what it feels like,''
Bruins guard Earl Watson said. ``Nothing shocks us...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no panic, no sign of frustration. We just said,
`(Cal) is a red-hot team, and they're hitting big-time shots.' We
stayed patient, and when the opportunity came, we took advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kapono scored 20 points and buried several critical
3-pointers. But Gadzuric was the hero, recovering from a wicked
elbow from Cal center Nick Vander Laan to score a career-high 22
points and grab 16 rebounds. A former McDonald's All-American,
Gadzuric played the game for which UCLA has waited almost two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave them some life when they needed it,'' Cal coach Ben
Braun said. ``He made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric's timing couldn't have been better. The victory enabled
UCLA to avoid its nightmare scenario - having to win at No.1
Stanford on Saturday to keep its at-large hopes alive. If the
Bruins beat the lowly Washington schools next week in Pauley
Pavilion, they'll reach the 18-victory plateau that should secure
an NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a roller-coaster ride emotionally,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said. ``To lose six of seven at UCLA doesn't play out
well. But the kids kept plugging away and working, and now we can
finish the season pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look that way when Cal bolted to 33-14 lead midway
through the half. Every flaw, every weakness the Bruins have shown
this season was on display - crammed into a brutal 10-minute
stretch. They took bad shots, threw ridiculous passes, failed to
execute their zone offense and played half-hearted defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't playing good team basketball,'' Kapono said.
``Plus, they were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, just like that, everything changed. The Bruins regained
their composure and their patience, then counterpunched. In the
final 6:30 of the half, UCLA sliced Cal's 19-point lead to five by
eliminating turnovers, moving the ball effectively and switching to
a zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the zone down 19 points,'' Lavin said. ``That's
something that's not usually done, but it's been an unusual
season.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the strangest twists came when Vander Laan's elbow
knocked Gadzuric to the floor with 17:25 left and the score tied
38-38. Gadzuric was down for several minutes, then wobbled to the
bench for treatment on his nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked some sense into me,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   He returned two minutes later and followed his own miss with
ashort jumper to give the Bruins a 52-47 lead. He converted another
offensive rebound, boosting the margin to 55-48, and his ferocious
dunk with four minutes left sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played like a beast,'' Kapono said.

STRUGGLING KINGS LOSE TO HURRICANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A week ago, the Kings were flying, and not just
across Canada on their longest trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They were no longer scratching for that final playoff spot, they
were taking it to teams. The question was not if but (begin
ital)who(end ital) they would play in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly they have only a tie to show for three games
against lesser opponents, including Thursday's dreary 5-2 loss to
the Carolina Hurricanes in front of a stunned crowd of 15,424 at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   This was a point in the schedule where they expected to solidify
their postseason position, the Kings got just one out of a possible
six. With 18 games left and Nashville in town Saturday, they should
be making a move. Instead, they are standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't think we're in,'' Ian Laperriere said.
``Because if we do, we won't be. This is a very critical point in
the season. We have to realize nothing has been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they not scoring, the Kings are taking bad
penalties, including two that led to power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got a power-play goal from Glen Murray with 1:38 left,
but it became even more meaningless when Rod Brind `Amour closed
out the scoring with an empty-netter with 18.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no way to be playing now,'' said Luc Robitaille, who
scored the Kings' first goal. ``We did not have that desperation
that we need. When we were on the road, we barely practiced and at
the end of the trip we started some bad habits. We still have a
little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Hurricanes, there was plenty of time for a comeback
when the Kings entered the third period trailing just 2-1. But when
Gary Roberts scored his second goal for Carolina just 25 seconds
into the third period, it was too late for a wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings now have two goals in the last two games and four in
the last three. Robitaille, who now has 33 and a league-tying
15-game scoring streak.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray spent much of Wednesday meeting with
members of the team's sluggish second unit. Center Bryan Smolinski
does not have a goal in eight games and just one in the past 12. He
had one shot Thursday and it came in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes (27-29-9) had just two victories in their
previous seven games and a 7-5 loss in Phoenix on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hurricanes, who end their trip Saturday in San Jose,
scored four goals in the third period of that game and appeared
ready to keep it going against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   After Sami Kapanen scored with 7:32 gone in the first, the Kings
needed almost an entire period to regroup. Carolina goaltender
Arturs Irbe made it nearly impossible with several outstanding
saves in the first period that built the Hurricanes' confidence. He
stopped 30 shots overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings finally tied the game at 6:05 of the second period
when Robitaille took a pass from Jozef Stumpel in the slot. But
much of the second period looked like the past two games, a loss to
San Jose and a tie with Vancouver. The Kings often looked out of
sync.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period, the Kings went on the power play when
Gelinas was whistled for roughing at 8:50. But only 38 seconds
later, Blake ended the man advantage when he was called for
elbowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst came after Smolinski was called for roughing at
12:31. The Kings were 18 seconds from killing the penalty when
Garry Galley was sent off for holding. The momentum was killed. The
Hurricanes quickly took a 2-1 lead on Roberts' goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those penalties were made out of frustration,'' Murray said.
``They came at bad times and they hurt us. We know we're not going
to get into the playoffs with 71 points.''

BIG 'CAP HAS SOME BIG STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA - To find the last Santa Anita Handicap with as many
first-rate horses as Saturday's edition, you'd have to flip back in
the chart book to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s were the most forgettable decade in the 62-year
history of the Big 'Cap. The 10 winners did not include a single
national champion, Breeders' Cup winner or Triple Crown race
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck gets some of the blame. The Wicked North, the champion
older horse of 1994, finished first in that year's Big 'Cap but was
disqualified in a foul call Chick Hearn would term ticky-tack.
Injuries and coaches' decisions kept Holy Bull, Cigar and Skip Away
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Locally based national champions Criminal Type, Pleasant Tap,
Bertrando and Silver Charm did compete but got outrun. For every
worthy winner (Farma Way, Best Pal, Free House), there was a long
shot (Sir Beaufort, Lucky Stuka, Mr Purple).
</P>
<P>
   Big 'Cap day slipped below Santa Anita Derby day attendance
three of the past four years, after the Big 'Cap outdrew the Derby
in 25 of the previous 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a change from the 1980s, when winners included Horses of
the Year Spectacular Bid, John Henry (twice) and Alysheba.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious problem is Santa Anita's inability to attract top
eastern horses other than 1997 sixth-place finisher Formal Gold for
a handicap race so early in a season made longer by the advent of
the Breeders' Cup in 1984. The Dubai World Cup, begun in 1996, is
more competition.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita racing secretary Michael Harlow, presiding over the
Big 'Cap for the first time, clearly isn't panicking, blaming the
bad luck for the weak decade. He rejected changing the schedule or
switching from a handicap to equal-weights format at least for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me another (race) that has the winner of the Breeders'
Cup Classic, the horse who finished second in the Breeders' Cup
Classic, and the horse who was favored in the Kentucky Derby,''
Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred, in order, to Cat Thief, Budroyale and General
Challenge. The eight-horse field also includes Malek, the 1998 Big
'Cap winner, Puerto Madero, who was the nation's top older horse a
year ago, and Dixie Dot Com, whose early speed is dangerous on his
best day.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the restart of something big.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita television commentator Kurt Hoover offered a fair
assessment when he told the audience at Thursday's post-position
draw ceremony: ``I'm supposed to say this every year, but this year
we really do have a top-class field for the Santa Anita Handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   The long shots: The last addition to the Big 'Cap entries was
Invitato Mio, a Brazilian-bred 8-year-old who won a Nov. 26, 1997
allowance race when he was trained by Richard Mandella and hasn't
won since. His latest trainer, A.C. Avila, has indicated it's owner
Jose Netto's decision to run.
</P>
<P>
   Invitato Mio, 30-1 on the morning line, will be the first Big
'Cap mount of Danny Sorenson's career.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshot, 15-1 on the line, represents John Toffan and Trudy
McCaffery, owners of 1999 winner Free House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a chance, but it's not the same feeling,''
said Toffan, whose better Big 'Cap prospect, Six Below, was injured
and retired last weekend. ``At this point, there aren't any
champions (among the opponents). I think when Bagshot ran second in
the Big 'Cap two years ago, that was considered a pretty good
field, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nose news: Most handicappers doubt equine nose strips, which
became legal in California on Wednesday, will generally improve
horses' performances. But it's hard to knock the results so far.
</P>
<P>
   Of nine horses wearing the breathing aids Wednesday, two won,
returning a profitable $33.20, and seven finished in the money.
Most outran their odds.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven horses wore the adhesive strips Thursday. One won, paying
just $4.20, but there were 9-1, 9-1, 9-1, 37-1 and 18-1 shots among
the in-the-money finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The other big race: War Chant, an impressive 2 for 2 for trainer
Neil Drysdale, makes his stakes debut on the Big 'Cap undercard in
the San Rafael, a steppingstone to the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-mile race also drew D. Wayne Lukas-trained Commendable and
Bobby Frankel's Cocky - promising colts trying the stakes level for
the first time - and Vladimir Cerin's Archer City Slew, coming off
a win in the 7-furlong San Vicente.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the week on the Kentucky Derby trail was the naming
of Jerry Bailey to ride Anees, the champion 2-year-old of 1999, in
the colt's 2000 debut, the March 19 San Felipe at Santa Anita. The
mount was up for grabs after Gary Stevens retired in December.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey gave up unbeaten Red Bullet, who's running in the March
19 Gotham at Aqueduct, to take The Thoroughbred Corp.'s Anees.
Bailey won the Derby with Sea Hero (1993) and Grindstone (1996).

ARNOLD TAKES LEAP OF FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dominique Arnold herds oversized carts. That's
what he does when he's not dreaming big dreams. Sometimes, like
with sprinting and hurdling, he can't dissociate the two acts.
</P>
<P>
   He can be pushing a stray cart to safety in the Home Depot
parking lot in Canoga Park and his mind will be a world away in
Sydney and the next thing Arnold knows he is racing to keep up with
the cart as though it were Mark Crear or 1996 Olympic gold medalist
Allen Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone put a camera on me I'd be fired,'' Arnold says with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   At least Arnold hasn't hurdled any parked cars in his path. But
then, the Sydney Olympics are half a year away yet. As the U.S.
trials in July draw nearer, there's no telling how carried away
Arnold will get in his pursuit of an improbable dream.
</P>
<P>
   For the sprint hurdles specialist, the road to this year's
Summer Games has been a labyrinth, full of dead ends and
switchbacks; dark passages and serendipitous connections.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken him from Long Beach to Pullman, Wash., to
Northridge. From budding to bygone to back and seemingly better.
</P>
<P>
   The road goes through Atlanta this week. Starting today Arnold
will compete at the U.S. Indoor Championships at the Georgia Dome.
He is the one everybody else will be chasing in the 60-meter
hurdles, the event he won last month at New York's Millrose Games
at the expense of Crear, the fastest hurdler in the world last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's is an endearing tale, prescription medicine for a
public sick of hearing about athletes bulking up on steroids and
IOC members getting fat on freebies and a modern Olympic movement
heavy on hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, 26, runs in sneakers he doesn't get for free; in meets
he isn't paid to grace; and until this year with nothing more than
a stopwatch's reading as his reward.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he has a better shot at making the Olympic squad
than anybody gave marathoner Christine Clark before she moved up 21
spots to win the U.S. trials last week in Columbia, S.C. Arnold is
trying to reinforce the image of topflight athletes that Clark, a
37-year-old working mother, portrayed in her victory:
</P>
<P>
   The Olympian as measurably more human than machine.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering for Arnold isn't hard. It's like rooting for spring,
for sentimentality, for simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about making the Olympic team all the time,'' Arnold
says dreamily, his delivery as hypnotic as the rhythmic tapping on
this day of raindrops on the roof of the Cal State Northridge
athletic office. ``Running fast and making the team and wearing my
country's colors and floating over the hurdles like they don't even
exist. Getting a medal and fulfilling a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold runs with an ease that belies the rocky path he has
taken. After distinguishing himself at Long Beach Wilson High and
Long Beach City College, Arnold went to Washington State and washed
dishes in the dormitory cafeteria to pay for the expenses not
picked up by his partial athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He won an NCAA title in the hurdles as a senior, in 1996. By
that time Arnold also had become a friend and sometime training
partner of decathlete Dan O'Brien. O'Brien opened his home to
Arnold and gave him advice on the track. One of his tips has proved
particularly helpful recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me how to sign autographs,'' Arnold says, grinning.
``I used to write my name out all slow. I'd make a nice, full loop
in the ``q'' and dot my i's. And Dan was like, `Man, you've got to
shorten your autograph. You've got to write like a doctor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold signed off on track not long after he failed to make the
1996 U.S. Olympic team. He finished that year with the 35th fastest
time in the hurdles but he might as well have been ranked 350 for
how good he felt about his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after completing work on his degree in fine arts,
Arnold returned to Southern California, moved in with a friend in
Encino and went about trying to find a ``real'' job in animation.
</P>
<P>
   After years of feeling like he was running in place, Arnold
thought he was ready to settle down to a life of drawing
continuously moving characters. With his sketchings riding shotgun,
Arnold made it as far as the front gate at the Disney Studios in
Burbank before being turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Animation's loss was American track's gain. With time to kill
one afternoon, Arnold got in his car and drove to the CSUN track.
Just for the fun of it, he set up some hurdles and started gliding
over them. It was just like riding a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff McAuley, the Matadors track coach, caught a glimpse of
Arnold, introduced himself to the hurdler and handed him one of his
business cards. Be it dumb luck or destiny Arnold had stumbled upon
the one place where he wouldn't be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting Jeff was like a gift,'' Arnold says. ``He's stuck his
neck out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuley would give Arnold room, board and a new lease on his
hurdling career.
</P>
<P>
   Some hurdles, though, remained Arnold's alone to bear. He needed
some source of income but had to keep his days free to train. So
Arnold jumped when a fraternity brother offered him a position as a
night clerk at a motel in Reseda in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift had its moments. ``A lot of
scary moments,'' Arnold says.
</P>
<P>
   There was the night he got in a little unexpected anaerobic
training chasing after some hoodlums who were trying to break into
cars in the motel parking lot. Then there was the time Arnold
returned from his break to find an inebriated kid fresh from his
high school Prom Night attacking the motel manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly what Arnold remembers of those lost seven months was
fighting fatigue. A bleary-eyed Arnold wondered more than once if
his dream was worth not getting any sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, McAuley trusted Arnold's stock would rise long
before Arnold effectively went public at last summer's U.S.
championships. He finished fifth in the 110-meter hurdles despite
clipping the second hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   His placing wasn't high enough to earn Arnold a berth in the
World Championships but it did gain him entree into the world's
top-10 list, the Pan American Games, the Olympic jobs program at
Home Depot, the Millrose Games and by virtue of all that, the
public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnold edged Crear in the race at Madison Square Garden,
the papers the next morning trumpeted the victory of the
``lightly-regarded'' hurdler. Oh well. The word will get out soon
enough about how tough Arnold really is.

KANSAS STATE BACKS OUT OF USC DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is searching to fill open dates on its
football schedule in 2001 and 2002 after Kansas State coach Bill
Snyder killed a home-and-home series between the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans and Wildcats had agreed in principle to play at the
Coliseum on Sept. 12, 2001, and Sept. 19, 2002 at Arrowhead Stadium
in Kansas City. But when Kansas State officials presented the deal
to Snyder, it was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Snyder deliberated and made a decision he didn't want to
formalize an agreement,'' said Jim Epps, Kansas State senior
associate athletic director. ``Coach Snyder has control of
scheduling. It's his call. It has been taken off the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was moving forward and had reached a point where we
mutually agreed to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a blow to USC, which has had trouble filling
those two dates. Last fall, Virginia agreed to play a home-and-home
series before backing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the deal was done with Kansas State,'' said Daryl
Gross, USC associate athletic director. ``They gave us every
indication they would play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC officials were surprised by Kansas State's reluctance to
play because Snyder has been criticized in recent years for playing
a soft nonconference schedule. Snyder could not be reached for
comment.
</P>

   Ironically, USC has begun talks with Kansas about replacing the
Wildcats on the schedule in 2001 and 2002. There might be a chance
that the 2002 game would be played at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it tough to find some in 2001; hopefully, we'll find
someone our fans will like,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, San Jose State has requested that its game with the
Trojans this season, originally scheduled for Sept. 16, be switched
to Sept. 23. This means USC could have two byes in the first four
weeks of the upcoming season.

A COSTLY NIGHT FOR KING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the epic monuments to American capitalism, Don King, is
on the line from Las Vegas, and I immediately cut to the core with
the notorious fight promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any federal indictments against you lately?'' I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Kirk, I can always count on you being concerned about my
legal welfare,'' responded King theatrically. ``Well, the good news
t that the federal government isn't still trying. Al Capone, Lucky
Luciano and John Gotti didn't get the unrelenting scrutiny that I
have over the years from our government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's what makes America such a great country. Yes, I've
been indicted more times than I can count, but each time I've been
as our great legal system has exposed the miscarriage of justice
that has been perpetuated against me. Still, there are times I feel
like Alfred Dreyfus, the French army officer who became a martyr
all around Europe near the turn of the last century because he was
wrongly convicted of treason. I feel as though my great country
doesn't appreciate uniqueness and greatness and too often believes
the scurrilous accusations made against me by my enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, boxing aficionados aren't appreciating King's
Showtime pay-per-view WBA match tonight between two undefeated
fighters, Felix Trinidad (36-0) and David Reid (14-0), that is
being staged in a newly erected outdoor stadium at Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, King's fierce rival, Bob Arum, who is putting on his
own show Saturday night at Mandalay Bay featuring Paulie Ayala
against Johnny Bredahl for the WBA bantamweight title, is
predicting that King will drop $6 million on this evening's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why suddenly is Bob Arum worried about my financial well
being?'' said King. ``First off, I don't go into any fight where my
own money is on the line. Any good businessman always makes sure he
takes out more than he puts in a venture. The site fees from the
casino and the money from the cable network pay the bills on my
show. And, secondly, I could stand to lose six million a year for
the next 100 years, and still not be broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't America just wonderful? Isn't America the only country
in the world where a Don King can jive and thrive and survive?''
</P>
<P>
   King believes Arum has attempted to sabotage his fight by
spreading rumors in recent weeks that it would be canceled because
of slow gate sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, reports of the demise of our show are slightly
premature, indubitably!,'' said King. ``We're definitely going to
have the fight. Arum wanted me to cancel it so as not to risk
Trinidad getting beat, but it's definitely coming off. They've done
everything to try to ruin my show. I originally made it way back on
November 13, and it was set to be on Saturday, March 4. But then
Dan Goossen (Reid's promoter) backed out of the fight, and the next
thing I knew Arum scheduled a show for March 4. And, when we made
Trinidad and Reid again, we had to put it back a day to March 3.
That's why we're having it on a Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Trinidad-Reid fight figures to provide far more
thrills and drama than last week's latest Oscar De La Hoya-scripted
farce his preordained, one-sided impalement of the unwilling,
chicken-jawed Darrell Coley at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all the makings of a classic fight,'' said King.
``You have a great Olympic hero in Reid who's a natural 154 pounder
fighting a great welterweight champion in Trinidad making his first
start at 154. Neither man has lost as a pro, and you can be sure
each will fight to the finish. You won't see one of these guys
kneeling on one knee as Darrell Coley did when he meekly
surrendered against Oscar De La Hoya.''...
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum insists to me that reports are true that he has made an
Oscar De La Hoya-Sugar Shane Mosley fight in June either at Staples
Center or Mandalay Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going to happen,'' said Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first serious mistake you've made with De La
Hoya,'' I told Arum, whose shrewd matchmaking and even shrewder
marketin turned De La Hoya into a fistic superstar even though De
La Hoya has done nothing in his well-choreographed career to
deserve such stature. ``Mosley isn't half as big as De La Hoya,
like Pernell Whitaker was. Mosley hasn't been inactive for two
years, like Ike Quartey was. Mosley won't allow De La Hoya to
dictate the fight, like Trinidad did for eight rounds. Mosley has
the speed and quickness and passion to actually beat De La Hoya.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know ... I know,'' replied Arum. ``That's what makes this a
great fight, and it should do great at the box office. Oscar just
got tired of Trinidad's father negotiating tactics. He told me on
Monday, `The hell with Trinidad, make the Mosley fight.' And that's
what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, De La Hoya and Mosley haven't signed a contract yet, and
Arum says that will happen next week, meaning the clever Arum might
just be posturing and waiting for the Trinidad-Reid outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad scores a spectacular knockout, you can be sure the
sporting public's yearning for a Trinidad-De La Hoya rematch will
be heightened and so will Arum's.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Trinidad and De La Hoya each will earn
$20 million if they fight each other again, while De La Hoya will
make only $7 million for Mosley and Trinidad will make a lot less
for whoever he fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Trinidad loses to Reid, he'll come begging for Oscar,''
says Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Arum might insist that De La Hoya's next fight will be against
Mosley, but I still think financial considerations will result in
it being against Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Bob Arum will make many more millions of dollars if
Trinidad and De La Hoya fight again, a compelling incentive for
Arum to make it...
</P>
<P>
   Arum reveals that Republican presidential candidate Sen. John
McClain, a boxing fanatic who has authored a bill for the federal
regulation of the sport, bought tickets and attended De La Hoya's
fights against Whitaker, Quartey and Trinidad. ...
</P>
<P>
   I find it one of the classic ironies of the insufferable
politically correct climate in which we're now forced to reside
that high-profile murder suspect jocks like Rae Carruth and Raymond
Lewis get treated far gentler in the national media than does an
immature 25-year-old left-handed Atlanta Brave reliever named John
Rocker, who has been drawn and quartered with relentless savagery
for making intemperate remarks to a Sports Illustrated reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, one doesn't condone Rocker's warped views on gays,
foreigners and minorities, but I was under the mistaken impression
that the American Constitution's First Amendment guarantees a
person freedom of speech, no matter how offensive it might happen
to be to some people.
</P>
<P>
   I thought just punishment for Rocker would have been for Bud
Selig to have mandated Rocker to cleanse his mouth out daily with
Borax for 73 days, instead of placating the frenzied mob who wanted
Rocker's scalp with that 73-day suspension and $20,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the sense proportion on this issue? Rocker is a
numskull who uttered a bunch of inane statements, granted. But he
didn't rape, shoot, knife, mug, rob, or murder anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator, Shyam Das, was right in reducing Rocker's
punishment. Indeed, Rocker has been punished enough in the shrill
court of public opinion and figures to suffer heavily for his crude
remarks for which, incidentally, he has apologized numerous times
for the remainder of his major league career. I find it so typical
of this morally preening era that those who have been most
unforgiving toward Rocker are the same hypocrites who preach
tolerance at the drop of a TV sound bite.

<P>
   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the
United States is preparing to commit lots of cash, military
hardware and advisers to a battle in a foreign jungle.
</P>
<P>
   This one is in southern Colombia, where an embattled president,
Andres Pastrana, faces daunting problems. These include left-wing
guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence caused almost 300,000 Colombians to flee
their homes last year; the better-off have been terrorized by
kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The country is also home to the world's biggest illegal drugs
industry: it accounts for about 80 percent of the cocaine and some
of the heroin imported by the United States, and has displaced Peru
as the world's main source of coca, the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the main front in the developed world's war against the
supply of drugs. And, to make matters worse, Colombia's economy is
reeling from its worst slump since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office in 1998, Pastrana boldly launched peace talks
with the FARC, the largest guerrilla group. But they have moved
slowly. The war continues, amid widespread skepticism about the
FARC's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pastrana has turned to the United States for
help. President Bill Clinton is sympathetic, and now Congress is
debating an administration request for more aid, which would take
total American assistance to Colombia to $1.6 billion over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana leads a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, and
deserves international support. But the proposed aid is ambiguous
in purpose, and its results may disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chunk is to set up and train three special
anti-drugs battalions, equipped with 63 helicopters, including 30
fast, modern Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to ``push into the coca-growing regions of
southern Colombia,'' in mountainous jungles now controlled by the
FARC. Once secured, the police would go in to wipe out the coca
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Its backers present this as a plan to staunch the flow of drugs
to the United States. But the motivation seems to be a fear that
the FARC's insurgency is now out of control, and is a threat to
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the new battalions' target will be the FARC. Since
the FARC gets lots of money (perhaps as much as $500 million a
year) from taxing and protecting the drugs trade, this new southern
push would not only help to prosecute the international war on
drugs but also weaken the guerrillas, persuading them to seek
peace.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the theory. Yet if the main aim were to
support the pursuit of peace, the aid proposal might look very
different. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To achieve peace, Colombia needs stronger democratic
institutions, capable of guaranteeing security and justice for its
citizens (including demobilized guerrillas). And it needs radical
reform of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pastrana's efforts, they continue to suffer from two
serious failings. First, they remain a largely reactive force,
lacking mobility and relying too heavily on poorly trained
conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many military commanders retain close links with the
paramilitaries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The belief runs deep that paramilitary violence will hasten
peace. In fact, it does the opposite. It is as unacceptable as the
violence of the guerrillas. Yet the American aid proposal looks as
if it will merely bolt three shiny new anti-drugs battalions on to
an abusive and unreformed military force. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance is familiar. After more than a decade of American
aid, Colombia's national police are capable of staging
sophisticated operations against drugs gangs, involving months of
surveillance and intricately coordinated raids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are incapable of acting as an efficient constabulary,
providing the average Colombian with security against crime,
kidnapping or assassination. That is not by chance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the Colombian police has been adopted as a political
cause by a group of congressional Republicans who believe that one
of the cheaper and more effective ways to deal with the United
States' addiction to drugs is to stop their production at source.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is also reflected in the annual ``certification''
process, which this week again saw the United States stand in
unilateral judgment over its neighbors' anti-drugs efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in supply-side remedies has come to be shared by some
officials in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the sharp fall in coca production in Peru and
Bolivia in recent years is proof that a combination of stepped-up
repression and programs to help former coca farmers can achieve the
complete elimination of coca in those countries _ and in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady vision, but a flawed one. In fact, these policies
have fueled Colombia's conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Colombian coca (and thus in the FARC's income)
is a direct consequence of its reduction elsewhere. That is just
the latest example of the ``balloon'' effect: squeeze the drugs
industry at one point, and it reappears somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Already drugs-trafficking gangs, with all their corruption and
violence, have spread across Latin America from Mexico to Brazil.
The reason is elementary. Demand calls forth supply.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition and repression merely increase the price; and, where
cocaine is concerned, they have failed to increase it enough to
have any significant effect in reducing consumption.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of the United States' war against
cocaine at the source, the price of the drug in the United States
remains stable, the supply abundant. The number of hard-core takers
remains stable, too, although casual consumption has been declining
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans pay a high price for the drugs trade: it
corrupts their societies from top to bottom. If this price is ever
to be reduced, Americans will have to look not just at the supply
but also at the demand for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That means they will have to consider alternative policies at
home, even at decriminalization. This is a war that will not be won
with helicopters. &QL;

   &UR; MUDDLE IN THE JUNGLE: U.S. NARCS VS. COLOMBIA'S FARC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the
United States is preparing to commit lots of cash, military
hardware and advisers to a battle in a foreign jungle. This one is
in southern Colombia, where an embattled president faces daunting
problems, including left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries
and the world's largest source of coca, the raw material for
cocaine. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation or
just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only question the
Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a
result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than
vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active
terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.
Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

   Doubtless, Caio Koch-Weser is a jolly decent fellow. Germany's
finance state secretary could probably do all sorts of jobs,
perfectly competently or even brilliantly. The trouble is that
running the International Monetary Fund is not one of them. What a
pity that the best man for the job _ Stanley Fischer, the IMF's
deputy managing director and, since Michel Camdessus stepped down a
few weeks ago, it's acting head _ probably won't get it. &QL;

   Willie Whitelaw, a British Tory grandee, once accused Labor
activists of going around the country ``stirring up apathy.'' That
has often seemed to be the essence of Bradley's campaign. He is
such a laconic speaker that one wonders whether the candidate or
the audience will fall asleep first. How did this former basketball
star and Senate veteran turn out to be such a dismal candidate? &QL;

   As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so Californians like
to claim. Only three times in the past century has a candidate won
the presidential election without winning in California. In
November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly Republican,
California seems a particularly crucial piece of the electoral
map. &QL;

   John McCain's behavior bears the hallmarks of reckless political
courage. Denouncing the Reverend Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition, in his own Virginia hometown, was a remarkable
moment in recent Republican history. Never before has a
presidential candidate nominee castigated the religious right like
that. It was not just a Sister Souljah moment, mimicking Bill
Clinton's 1992 attack on black extremism, it was a brother,
grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

<P>
   Three months after Elian Gonzalez, a six-year-old Cuban boy, was
rescued from the sea off Miami, his story resembles the fanciful
tele-novelas that Latinos love to watch. Call it ``The Curse of
Elian.'' But there is also a growing sense that the story is not
playing out in the way that Miami's hard-line Cuban-American
leaders had intended. Ironically, they may in fact be helping the
very man they detest: Fidel Castro. &QL;

   It is known as the ``February surprise.'' Every year, shortly

``certifies'' as willing allies in the war on illegal drugs, Mexico
unveils a new and bold anti-drugs initiative. This year, though,
the surprise was on Mexico. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As the news came through in the middle of the Santiago night
that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings, and that General
Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small group of his
supporters staged a celebration. It may very well be his only
welcome-home reception. During his detention, most Chileans quickly
became bored and baffled by the legal intricacies of the case, and
lapsed into indifference. Chileans discovered that life without
General Pinochet was not only possible, but preferable. &QL;

   As the worst floods in living memory continue to swirl, parts of

help to prevent the death toll from escalating. The floods have
pushed back into poverty large numbers of Mozambicans who had
recently begun to lift themselves out of it. And just as bad, the
flooding has almost certainly dislodged thousands of landmines and
carried them into places previously considered safe. &QL;

what he thinks of Austrian right-winger Joerg Haider. ``I'm certain
Austria will stay democratic. But demagogues are frightening.

question.'' Indeed, if the politics of hate were to make a comeback
in lands to the east of the present EU, Gypsies would be prime
targets. &QL;

   It's the clash of the titans. Both young moguls, both cornering
the world market in photo archives, both now based in Seattle: Mark
Getty, grandson of oil magnate J.P. Getty, and Bill Gates, who
needs no introduction whatsoever. This week, with its 14th large
acquisition in five years, Getty Images increased its photo library
holdings to around 70 million images. That tops its main
competitor, Gates's Corbis, which has 65 million images. As Getty
says, ``Intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century.'' &QL;

<P>
   On the Internet, naming your start-up can be more arduous than
financing it. This is because most Internet addresses, known as
domain names, have been taken already. In the .com domain, the most
desirable online real estate, almost every recognizable name has
been claimed. Much is at state. If the name space of the Internet
cannot grow, e-commerce will suffer. &QL;

   &UR; THE RETURN OF A DIMINISHED GENERAL PINOCHET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the news came through in the middle of the Santiago night
that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings, and that General
Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small group of his
supporters staged a celebration. It may very well be his only
welcome-home reception. During his detention, most Chileans quickly
became bored and baffled by the legal intricacies of the case, and
lapsed into indifference. Chileans discovered that life without
General Pinochet was not only possible, but preferable. &QL;

flooding has almost certainly dislodged thousands of landmines and
carried them into places previously considered safe. &QL;

   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the
United States is preparing to commit lots of cash, military

in southern Colombia, where an embattled president faces daunting
problems, including left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries
and the world's largest source of coca, the raw material for
cocaine. &QL;

   To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation or

Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a
result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than
vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active
terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.
Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the
United States is preparing to commit lots of cash, military
hardware and advisers to a battle in a foreign jungle.
</P>
<P>
   This one is in southern Colombia, where an embattled president,
Andres Pastrana, faces daunting problems. These include left-wing
guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence caused almost 300,000 Colombians to flee
their homes last year; the better-off have been terrorized by
kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The country is also home to the world's biggest illegal drugs
industry: it accounts for about 80 percent of the cocaine and some
of the heroin imported by the United States, and has displaced Peru
as the world's main source of coca, the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the main front in the developed world's war against the
supply of drugs. And, to make matters worse, Colombia's economy is
reeling from its worst slump since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office in 1998, Pastrana boldly launched peace talks
with the FARC, the largest guerrilla group. But they have moved
slowly. The war continues, amid widespread skepticism about the
FARC's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pastrana has turned to the United States for
help. President Bill Clinton is sympathetic, and now Congress is
debating an administration request for more aid, which would take
total American assistance to Colombia to $1.6 billion over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana leads a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, and
deserves international support. But the proposed aid is ambiguous
in purpose, and its results may disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chunk is to set up and train three special
anti-drugs battalions, equipped with 63 helicopters, including 30
fast, modern Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to ``push into the coca-growing regions of
southern Colombia,'' in mountainous jungles now controlled by the
FARC. Once secured, the police would go in to wipe out the coca
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Its backers present this as a plan to staunch the flow of drugs
to the United States. But the motivation seems to be a fear that
the FARC's insurgency is now out of control, and is a threat to
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the new battalions' target will be the FARC. Since
the FARC gets lots of money (perhaps as much as $500 million a
year) from taxing and protecting the drugs trade, this new southern
push would not only help to prosecute the international war on
drugs but also weaken the guerrillas, persuading them to seek
peace.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the theory. Yet if the main aim were to
support the pursuit of peace, the aid proposal might look very
different. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To achieve peace, Colombia needs stronger democratic
institutions, capable of guaranteeing security and justice for its
citizens (including demobilized guerrillas). And it needs radical
reform of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pastrana's efforts, they continue to suffer from two
serious failings. First, they remain a largely reactive force,
lacking mobility and relying too heavily on poorly trained
conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many military commanders retain close links with the
paramilitaries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The belief runs deep that paramilitary violence will hasten
peace. In fact, it does the opposite. It is as unacceptable as the
violence of the guerrillas. Yet the American aid proposal looks as
if it will merely bolt three shiny new anti-drugs battalions on to
an abusive and unreformed military force. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance is familiar. After more than a decade of American
aid, Colombia's national police are capable of staging
sophisticated operations against drugs gangs, involving months of
surveillance and intricately coordinated raids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are incapable of acting as an efficient constabulary,
providing the average Colombian with security against crime,
kidnapping or assassination. That is not by chance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the Colombian police has been adopted as a political
cause by a group of congressional Republicans who believe that one
of the cheaper and more effective ways to deal with the United
States' addiction to drugs is to stop their production at source.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is also reflected in the annual ``certification''
process, which this week again saw the United States stand in
unilateral judgment over its neighbors' anti-drugs efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in supply-side remedies has come to be shared by some
officials in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the sharp fall in coca production in Peru and
Bolivia in recent years is proof that a combination of stepped-up
repression and programs to help former coca farmers can achieve the
complete elimination of coca in those countries _ and in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady vision, but a flawed one. In fact, these policies
have fueled Colombia's conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Colombian coca (and thus in the FARC's income)
is a direct consequence of its reduction elsewhere. That is just
the latest example of the ``balloon'' effect: squeeze the drugs
industry at one point, and it reappears somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Already drugs-trafficking gangs, with all their corruption and
violence, have spread across Latin America from Mexico to Brazil.
The reason is elementary. Demand calls forth supply.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition and repression merely increase the price; and, where
cocaine is concerned, they have failed to increase it enough to
have any significant effect in reducing consumption.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of the United States' war against
cocaine at the source, the price of the drug in the United States
remains stable, the supply abundant. The number of hard-core takers
remains stable, too, although casual consumption has been declining
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans pay a high price for the drugs trade: it
corrupts their societies from top to bottom. If this price is ever
to be reduced, Americans will have to look not just at the supply
but also at the demand for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That means they will have to consider alternative policies at
home, even at decriminalization. This is a war that will not be won
with helicopters. &QL;

AMERICA'S RIGHT. STANLEY FISCHER IS BEST BOSS FOR THE IMF

<P>
   Doubtless, Caio Koch-Weser is a jolly decent fellow. Germany's
finance state secretary could probably do all sorts of jobs,
perfectly competently or even brilliantly. The trouble is that
running the International Monetary Fund is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Summers, America's Treasury secretary, was both brave and
right to insist this week (via President Bill Clinton) that he will
not accept Koch-Weser in that post. Now he, together with his
European and Asian equivalents, need to agree upon a better way to
choose a new boss for the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or loathe it _ and it is easier to find people in the
second category _ the IMF is the world's most important
multilateral financial institution. At times of crisis, whether
global or regional, all eyes turn to the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   And, although getting domestic policies right should be the main
solution to financial instability, the IMF is also the best
multilateral hope for helping countries to avoid such crises in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   That is why finance ministers, from all around the world, have
recently devoted so many speeches to the topic known mind-numbingly
as ``international financial architecture,'' and which has at its
heart the future of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   So it is a disgrace and a pity that when it comes to choosing a
new boss to run that vital body, those same ministers have become
hopelessly paralyzed by national prejudice and regional vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The further pity is that there is little real room for dispute
about who is the best person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   It is Stanley Fischer, who is currently the IMF's deputy
managing director and, since Michel Camdessus stepped down a few
weeks ago, its acting head.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant economist but also a crystal-clear articulator of
policies and an adept diplomat, Fischer is even the favorite of
many developing countries, which is quite something for a man with
three disadvantages: being American, being an economist, and being
from the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He is actually a naturalized American, who was born in Zambia,
and there lies his undoing: the Europeans think the job is theirs
by right, and another naturalized American already heads the World
Bank, the Australian-born Jim Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   So what is to be done? On March 2, after The Economist went to
press, there was to be a straw poll among the IMF's executive board
over the merits of the three candidates: Koch-Weser, Fischer and
Eisuke Sakakibara, a former Japanese finance-ministry official
nominated by his own government.
</P>
<P>
   That is at least a semblance of democracy. But the likeliest
result was stalemate, with the Europeans loth to relinquish the
post and the Americans unwilling to push Fischer's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, all precedent suggests, will be some sort of
compromise, less good than appointing Fischer but (it is to be
hoped) not disastrously so.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Europeans may agree to offer a
heavyweight politician instead of Koch-Weser, and then all will try
to persuade Fischer to stay at the Fund and run it from day to day,
while the politician deals with grand strategy and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be a bad solution, since poor PR is part of the
Fund's problem, and since as well as having a good person running
the institution it is also desirable to have European support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is also an opportunity to exploit that compromise.
Even as Summers magnanimously accepts a European candidate, he
could still insist on a change in the way the heads of bodies such
as the IMF are chosen in future.
</P>
<P>
   The best way would be to hand the task to a selection committee
nominated by the organization's governing body or by governments.
This would be charged with finding a short list of candidates and
interviewing them, perhaps in public.
</P>
<P>
   It would not eliminate politics, or national jealousies. But it
would make such forces less dominant, and provide a chance to
challenge the cozy idea of a permanent regional hold on particular
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Go on, Mr. Summers, take the opportunity. &QL;

<P>
   To bomb or just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only
question the Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it plumped for bombing, cutting off power to most
of the country. Last week, it settled for mere threats of bombing:
any retaliation against towns in northern Israel, said David Levy,
Israel's foreign minister, would mean that Lebanon would ``burn _
blood for blood, soul for soul, child for child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, recruited his French
counterpart, Lionel Jospin, to label as terrorists the Lebanese
guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists they used to be, of course. Nowadays, though, things
are not quite so simple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after a spate of Israeli air raids had killed some 200
Lebanese civilians, both the Israeli army and Hezbollah, its chief
adversary in southern Lebanon, agreed to restrict their battles to
uninhabited areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides now often accuse the other of cheating. Hezbollah is
said to use villages as cover to launch its attacks; Israel is said
to shell houses and farms along the front line.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas Hezbollah turns its fire on Israeli civilians only
when Lebanese bystanders have been injured or killed, Israel seems
to view any minor infringement of the 1996 deal as a reason to hit
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli
hands than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 23 Lebanese civilians died, compared with just two
Israelis. And Hezbollah launched the rockets that killed those two
only after Israeli jets had started dropping bombs on Lebanese
bridges and power plants yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The former hijackers and hostage-takers have dropped their more
questionable activities and concentrated instead on battlefield
training and hitting Israeli soldiers and their militia allies in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   They can now fire a missile or mortar inside one of the Israeli
forts in south Lebanon at the first shot. During the recent
flare-up, Hezbollah killed seven Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon
without sending a single bullet over the border. The best the
Israelis could do, it seems, was to put out the lights in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's sorties against Lebanon, both verbal and airborne,
are not just destructive and dishonest. They are also futile.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Beirut will not stop Hezbollah attacking Israeli
soldiers, or their allies, in south Lebanon. If anything, it will
strengthen Lebanese resentment and steel Hezbollah's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, to prove their indifference to bombing, the
guerrillas killed an Israeli soldier the day after the fiercest air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if the Lebanese government wanted to rein
Hezbollah in, it does not have the power to do so. Syria dominates
Lebanese politics and controls the flow of weapons to the
guerrillas. It has long used Hezbollah as a means to press Israel
into concluding a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian regime does not care a jot if Beirut burns. In fact,
the Syrians treat Lebanon as a handy testing-ground, where they can
needle the Israelis without suffering any consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak and Levy really want to end attacks on Israel's
soldiers in Lebanon, they must pursue a diplomatic offensive
against Syria, not a military one against the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Should that prove impossible _ the current, suspended, talks are
expected to start again in due course _ the Israeli government does
have another option. It can pull its troops out of Lebanon
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Israel has occupied Lebanese territory for almost 22
years in defiance of umpteen resolutions of the U.N. Security
Council, and Barak himself has said he wants to put an end to the
adventure by July. Many anguished Israeli mothers and conscripts
are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some of the most militant guerrillas might make
attacks over the border even after an Israeli withdrawal. But then,
at least, Israel would have better justification for retaliation _
and Levy more grounds for bellicosity. &QL;

THE SELF-DESTRUCTION OF BILL BRADLEY

<P>
   SEATTLE AND SPOKANE _ Four weeks ago Bill Bradley came within
four percentage points of beating a sitting vice president in the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29 he trailed behind Al Gore in another stronghold of
independent voting and campaign-finance reform, Washington state,
by a humiliating 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington primary is an eccentric affair: a ``nonbinding
beauty contest'' that does not do anything so pedestrian as
allocate delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to spend six consecutive days campaigning
there _ against the advice of his staff and leading supporters,
such as New York's retiring senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan _ not
only reduced the amount of time he could spend campaigning in the
bigger states that go to the polls on March 7. It turned what
should have been a minor contest into a major test of virility.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Democratic Party elders are urging Bradley
to end his agony and pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to broadcast a five-minute-long appeal to voters on
CBS on Thursday night (appropriately at the same time that most
viewers tune into ``ER'' on NBC) suggests that he will remain in
the race, albeit as a spent force, until Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this former basketball star and Senate veteran turn out
to be such a dismal candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of money. Bradley, a darling of Wall Street,
had more cash on hand than Al Gore after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of infrastructure. The Bradley campaign
spent a small fortune in Washington state on television advertising
(including ads questioning Gore's environmental record). Every day
it sends a torrent of e-mails and faxes to anyone who has ever
expressed a polite interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And not because of a lack of ideas. Bradley courageously tried
to make health care an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that Bradley was simply mugged. A less
honorable man might have been quicker to respond to Gore's
truth-twisting attacks on his health-care policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also partly a victim of his party's electoral
timetable, which left a month between New Hampshire and the next
Democratic primary. That period has given the vice president a
chance to armor-plate his lead, while the media have focused
exclusively on the helter-skelter of Republican races.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Bradley is the fact that his
style is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Whitelaw, a British Tory grandee, once accused Labor
activists of going around the country ``stirring up apathy.'' That
has often seemed to be the essence of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a laconic speaker that one wonders whether the
candidate or the audience will fall asleep first. And he is such a
self-involved figure that he is incapable of connecting with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The omens were bad last year when he gave a speech in Los
Angeles lamenting the growing divide between blacks and whites. The
audience, many of whom were Hispanic or Asian, looked on in
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he attended one of those churches where everybody
claps their hands and sways their bodies. The impassive Bradley
could have been attending a Senate hearing on U.S.-Icelandic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with a group of sympathetic reporters in New Hampshire, he
would not even say what book he was reading, for fear of opening
up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's failings have been rendered all the more transparent
by John McCain's successes.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley mumbles that Al Gore is not entirely honest,
McCain promises to beat the vice president like a drum on the
campaign-finance question; while Bradley bows the knee to Al
Sharpton in New York, McCain taunts the religious right for being a
bunch of bigots.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that floating voters should flock to the
charismatic arsonist rather than the dithering professor. Bradley
is an insurgent who has not bothered to insurge. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In general, Bradley's failing campaign has left Gore in a
remarkably strong position. Gore has proved that he can survive a
challenge by a well-funded and well-respected rival.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived it without leaving too many hostages to fortune
(forcing senior army officers to support gays serving openly in the
armed forces being an exception). And the Democratic machine is
solidly behind Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few doubts remain. The fact that Bradley, a man whose ear
for politics now seems so tinny, could come so close to toppling
the vice president in New Hampshire suggests considerable
discontent about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And, whatever else, the two Republicans have both been through a
ruthless examination.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from McCain, Bush distanced himself from the bigotry
of Bob Jones University; Gore has failed to condemn the bigotry of
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, who denounced ``white-boy
attitudes'' as a synonym for ``I must exclude, denigrate and leave
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore may yet come to regret Bradley's disdain for street
fighting almost as much as Dollar Bill's supporters currently do. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley types who would otherwise be natural Republicans
fume about the party's position on some moral issues, notably
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 35 percent of the registered
Californian electorate _ around ten percentage points less than the
Democrats _ which makes them even more dependent on the growing
number of independent voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first seemed the dream candidate for the Californian
Republicans: a conservative with new ideas. In early 1999, a
delegation of Sacramento Republicans wrote to the Texan governor
asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a conservative who had won the trust of Latino voters
in Texas; he had tackled education, the top Californian issue, so
successfully that the state had sent several delegations to Texas
to study its approach to schools; and he looked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a South Carolina university that forbids interracial
dating was hardly likely to win Bush broad popularity in
California, where miscegenation is something of a state sport. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls now suggest that Gore would beat Bush in
California; but he would lose to McCain. The other thing is that
McCain has made the Republicans seem hip again. After falling for a
decade, the party's membership has surged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernd Schwieren of the Republican Assembly Caucus
in Sacramento, 21,000 new Republicans registered in the month
ending on Feb. 7. The party had lost 600,000 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pleasingly, the Democratic registration tally fell by
93,000. &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two
main parties, however, will allocate their delegates on the basis
of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>
<P>
   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won
California'' has the makings of a Republican nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be yet another agony in store. The current
two-count system is an awkward compromise between California's
voters, who have twice voted for propositions requiring open
primaries, and the parties, which have passed rules trying to close
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Quinn, a Republican demographic analyst, the
legal stitching on this piece of political patchwork is weak: you
can amend an initiative only with another initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the beauty contest, he might take his challenge
to the courts. Such a clash would do little for the bid by
California's Republicans to reclaim a position at the front of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the fact that California is already far more
multi-ethnic than most states will be in even 50 years' time, is
starting to make some people say that the state can no longer hope
to march at the head of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   That still seems wrong. First, the sheer weight of numbers
(California's population of 34 million today is projected to grow
to 50 million by 2030) is bound to make this a state with clout.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the basic political question in California _ how to
attract suburbanite voters who are mostly conservative on fiscal
issues but liberal on issues like abortion _ is the same question
that politicians everywhere in America are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for them, it is a question to which the Republicans have
yet to come up with a clear answer. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ One of the most remarkable features of the
presidential campaign so far has been the change in the scope of
John McCain's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator began his quest for his party's
presidential nomination by attacking the ``iron triangle'' of
lobbyists, zillion-dollar political contributors and corrupted
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   He is ending it (assuming next week's national primary does
indeed end it, one way or another) by attacking influential members
of his own party as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most paid-up members of the Republican Party establishment (that
is, elected officials in national and state governments) have a
ready explanation for what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, they have known all along, is mad, bad and
dangerous to know.
</P>
<P>
   The party will close ranks around George W. Bush. And the
Arizonan maverick's attacks will have no effect on Republican
electoral prospects come November.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are right about one thing: McCain's behavior
bears the hallmarks of reckless political courage.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the Reverend Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian
Coalition, in his own hometown of Virginia Beach, Va., was a
remarkable moment in recent Republican history. Never before has a
presidential candidate nominee castigated the religious right like
this.
</P>
<P>
   There were tactical reasons for doing it, of course. Most
Christian conservatives are voting against McCain anyway, so
branding their leaders as bigots helps reduce the legitimacy of
some of Bush's victories.
</P>
<P>
   But still, McCain was addressing the foot soldiers of the
Republican Party. They account for around a fifth of all party
members and a third in many states' primary electorates.
</P>
<P>
   This was not just a Sister Souljah moment, aping Bill Clinton's
1992 attack on black extremism; it was a brother, grandmother and
indeed entire Souljah family moment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are surely wrong when they imply that the
episode is merely an example of McCain going over the top. In fact,
there is a direct link between his attacks on lobbyists and his
attacks on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Christian organizations have been among the most ferocious
critics of McCain's campaign-finance proposals because they see his
reforms as a threat to their political survival.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to be worried. Over the past few years, a cozy
back-scratching arrangement has grown up by which the religious
right helps get Republicans elected; Republicans set up various
fund-raising mechanisms and these bodies give money to religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposals would tear down these whited sepulchres. The
logic of his campaign means that there would have been a
confrontation between the two sides whatever the senator's own
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   That logic applies not just to the religious right but,
increasingly, to other sections of the Republican Party. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For weeks it has been clear that the Arizona senator _ without
understanding exactly how _ has been seeking a ``new governing
majority'' in his quest to reinvent Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind his actions _ or at least his angry gut
instinct _ is that to attract moderate voters in the suburbs (and
win elections), you have to break the control of the
special-interest groups that dominate the party.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear how, in McCain's mind, the religious right is one
such group. They have regularly caricatured him as a traitor to his
party and a friend of abortionists. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for McCain is that, as the election season has gone
on, the entire Republican establishment itself has come to look
more and more like another special-interest group.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how completely the establishment rallied behind
Bush, it was inevitable that McCain would have to confront it at
some point.
</P>
<P>
   What was not so inevitable was that when he did so, they would
have the backing of so many ordinary Republicans, who have voted
for Bush in primary after primary by margins of two to one.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, has been an extraordinary outcome. The Republican
Party has always been a fractured and fractious coalition. It
contains Protestant evangelicals and Catholic moderates;
country-club businessmen and moral ideologues; fiscal conservatives
and supply-side tax cutters.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable is not that these divisions have widened in
the wake of the party's electoral troubles in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that the establishment and two-thirds of
the party have held together in the face of the biggest challenge
to Republican orthodoxy for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   This coherence does not guarantee that Bush will win his party's
nomination, though it must make that outcome more likely. But it
certainly means that whoever wins the nomination will then find the
task of going on to take the presidency harder than he would
otherwise have done.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain prevails, he will face a huge task of damage
limitation inside his own party. The religious right may well have
written him off already.
</P>
<P>
   After his attacks this week, many of their leaders would prefer
to lose with Bush than win with McCain. But the party establishment
too may be reluctant to support a man who is running so openly
against them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is right: this is a hostile takeover of the party. That
does not mean it is unjustified. Hostile takeovers justify
themselves if they increase shareholder value (i.e., voter appeal).
But as with all such bids, this one would require a good deal of
managerial skill afterwards if it were to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, his position will be akin to that of many a
struggling chairman who has just survived a takeover bid: once the
battle is over, he will have to start doing all the things he
denounced during the bid.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain is right, too: you cannot hope to win the presidency
with Republican votes alone (the party amounts to little more than
a third of the electorate). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has time to change course. He has started to distance
himself from his moral-majority supporters. And he has a record (in
Texas, at least) of attracting new voters.
</P>
<P>
   But if the campaign has shown anything so far, it is the deep
disillusion with Bush that exists among independent and Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Having dug itself in around Bush, his party is now less well
placed than it was to win back the swing voters it will need in
November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wrath may be instinctive; but it is not unjustified. &QL;

MEXICO'S CERTIFIABLY MAD WAR ON DRUGS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It is known as the ``February surprise.'' Every
year, shortly before the United States government announces on
March 1 which countries it ``certifies'' as willing allies in the
war on illegal drugs, Mexico unveils a new and bold anti-drugs
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the surprise was on Mexico. Two days after
President Ernesto Zedillo announced a new push against organized
crime and trafficking in the border state of Baja California,
gunmen killed Alfredo de la Torre, the police chief of Tijuana, the
state's largest city, as he drove to his office on a Sunday without
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego, Calif., is home
to the Arellano Felix gang, one of Mexico's two main drugs mobs.
Its leaders are thought to have ordered the murder of a previous
police chief six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The death of de la Torre, just three days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to certify Mexico again, cast an ironic
light on that cynical diplomatic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has never been decertified (which would mean a cut in
American aid), despite campaigns by some American congressmen and
its continued inability to make a dent in drugs-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   This year, trying to preempt the annual pantomime, officials on
both sides started hinting back in January that certification for
Mexico was a sure thing, and played up the extent of cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dialogue of the deaf '' was over, said Rosario Green,
Mexico's foreign minister. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the Tijuana shooting, Jeffrey Davidow, the
United States' ambassador in Mexico City, commented that countries
such as Mexico were to drug trafficking what Sicily was to the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials had remained mute when Barry McCaffrey,
Clinton's anti-drugs czar, noted that half the cocaine entering the
United States did so through Mexico. But Davidow's less tactful
comments provoked an inconveniently timed row.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is spectacularly sensitive to American criticism of its
struggle against drugs, which it sees as hypocritical given the
United States' poor record in stemming drugs consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials proudly trumpet that seizures of all kinds of
illegal narcotics were higher last year than in 1998. A truer
measure of success, though, would be progress in dismantling drugs
rings and putting corrupt police and officials in jail. There,
things are gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   As Senator Jesse Helms pointed out, the drugs barons continue to
operate ``with virtual impunity'' in the border cities.
</P>
<P>
   American drugs fighters wonder why Jorge Carrillo Olea, a former
state governor suspected of protecting kidnappers and traffickers,
is still free nearly two years after he stepped down, and why Mario
Villanueva, another state governor suspected of trafficking, has
not been found since he fled last March, just before his governor's
term (and immunity from arrest) ended.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of de la Torre is a timely reminder that the
impunity continues. Predictably, it triggered a new declaration by
the Mexican government of a new war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as predictably, it did not prevent President Clinton
this week from certifying Mexico, yet again. &QL;

<P>
   SANTIAGO _ As the news came through in the middle of the
Santiago night that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings,
and that General Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small
group of his supporters staged a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were dismayed. But after being detained for 17 months
in London, Chile's former dictator was returning much diminished
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest, General Pinochet loomed over Chile as a
dominant and divisive figure, who still wielded political influence
even after a decade of democratic government. But during his
detention, most Chileans quickly became bored and baffled by the
legal intricacies of the case, and lapsed into indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Across the spectrum, politicians discovered that life without
the general was not only possible, but preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extreme right-wing Independent Democratic Union party,
to which many former officials of the dictatorship belong, has said
that it will not be organizing a welcome-home ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, General Pinochet was likely to receive a subdued
reception, probably at a military air base, and then go to a
military hospital for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's center-left government, and especially Ricardo Lagos, a
moderate socialist who takes over as the country's president on
March 11, will hope that the general then retires for a long, and
preferably permanent, rest.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will the right-wing opposition, for whom he has become
a liability. But General Pinochet is an inveterate political
meddler.
</P>
<P>
   Even if only symbolically, he could attempt to take up again his
seat in Chile's Senate, awarded to him for life under his
dictatorship's own constitution.
</P>
<P>
   However, the general's legal troubles are not over. Over the
past two years, almost 60 cases have been filed against him in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is investigating the accusations, has
made far greater progress in the general's absence than even most
human-rights lawyers dared to hope. He has charged several senior
retired army officers allegedly involved in mass executions after
the 1973 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But charging the dictator himself would be a very different
matter. He is, of course, in failing mental health, according to
the medical report done for the British authorities, but in Chile,
to escape trial, he would have to be certified as insane by
government forensic doctors. That is a humiliation he would be
unlikely to relish.
</P>
<P>
   So will he face a court? As a senator, he is immune from
prosecution. The first test of judicial resolve will come,
therefore, when prosecutors ask the Appeals Court to lift his
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed, the Supreme Court might well overrule it.
The Supreme Court would require evidence that General Pinochet
ordered the executions, rather than just bearing the responsibility
of a commanding officer or head of state. That could be hard to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during Chile's summer holidays, the government has
been quietly pushing through Congress a new bill that would grant
blanket immunity to former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the general were somehow tried and convicted, an
amnesty law, passed by his own regime, still stands between the old
dictator and the inside of a Chilean prison.
</P>
<P>
   But for the man who once boasted that not a leaf moved in Chile
without his knowledge, political isolation now beckons. &QL;

ARE WARS ALL ABOUT MONEY?

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Making money and making war have long been related
activities. That soldiers loot and arms manufacturers turn a profit
is hardly new. But is competition for wealth and resources becoming
the major cause of new wars around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Where tribal violence, independence struggles or Cold-War
rivalry were once blamed for wars, now bandits, traders and some
businesses are being fingered, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Though some conflicts are ethnic or religious clashes (as in
Kosovo) or stem from scraps over influence (a concern of Uganda in
Congo), many of today's wars, especially civil ones, have a strong
commercial element too often ignored by analysts outside, though
not by businessmen willing to profit from war.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged internal violence in countries with rich natural
resources but corrupt or weak governments may best be understood as
battles for money or resources, suggests a report to be published
by the International Committee of the Red Cross this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some wars are caused in a large part by corruption and banditry
(Sierra Leone), whereas others which may have begun as ethnic or
ideological conflicts, are now sustained in part by illicit trading
(opium in Afghanistan, cocaine in Colombia).
</P>
<P>
   Rebels, governments and even peacekeepers have fought for
diamonds, minerals and timber in recent wars in Liberia and Sierra
Leone. In the latter, peace was won only when the rebels' leader,
Foday Sankoh, was given a say in the country's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
   A long-running war in Angola, once seen as ideological, is
condemned by its people, foreign observers and governments as, to a
large part, a scramble for oil (by the government) and for diamonds
(by the rebels).
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the rebels have even been offered
permission to operate the diamond mines legally, if they would come
to terms, which they would not.
</P>
<P>
   In Indochina, illegal logging can be as valuable as drugs: the
Khmers Rouges financed their later campaigns in Cambodia from
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in such countries serve some participants well. Violence
provides a cover for the extraction and smuggling of resources, and
armies, either private or national, give the means to control
workers, transport and territory.
</P>
<P>
   War itself can be the means of getting rich (for example, in
trading arms or by fighting as a mercenary) or of survival (bands
of ill-educated young men recruited into armies in Sierra Leone or
in Colombia make guerrilla warfare a way of life).
</P>
<P>
   Such participants may continue to exploit a war rather than win
it and end it. For outsiders who want to encourage peace, wars for
resources may therefore be particularly hard to bring to an end.
</P>
<P>
   If the belligerents have no political goals, they may have no
interest in negotiation. Those who benefit from war will not
welcome mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, international efforts to stop the supply of arms to
private armies, to forbid trade in diamonds mined in war zones, or
to tackle the demand for illegal drugs may be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   But sanctions offer the powerful _ those with guns and armies
again _ the chance to make even more money, by smuggling goods in
and out of war zones and then charging high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Busting sanctions can be a lucrative business. ``Remember, this
war is about making money,'' explained a Sierra Leonean journalist
in Freetown during that country's war, before ticking off the
interests of fighters, mercenaries, peacekeepers, aid workers and
other hangers-on at the war's edges.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of money in war, says the report, should be borne in
mind by outsiders whose spending may cause inflation, whose aid may
feed rebels and whose trading may prolong the fighting
indefinitely. &QL;

   BRATISLAVA _ Mikulas Dzurkinda, the Slovak prime minister,
winces when asked what he thinks of Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very hard question,'' he says after a long pause. ``I'm
certain Austria will stay democratic. But,'' he adds, ``demagogues
are frightening. Imagine the trouble they could cause if they got
hold of our Gypsy question.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. If the politics of hate were to make a comeback in lands
to the east of the present EU, Gypsies could be prime targets.
</P>
<P>
   When Haider's supporters deride Slovakia, they invariably have
Gypsies in mind. If Slovakia joined the Union, say some Haiderites,
incoming Slovakian Gypsies would become a problem for Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, several thousand of them have sought
asylum in the EU, particularly in Finland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Though Romania has the largest number of Gypsies (also known as
Roma) in Europe, Slovakia has the highest proportion: some say they
are nearly a tenth of Slovakia's population of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the average of 4.2 children per Gypsy family, compared with
1.5 for other Slovaks, means that by the last quarter of this
century there might be as many Gypsies as ethnic Slovaks.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Slovakia's Gypsies has long been grim. But since
communism ended, it has become even grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of five have no job. Life expectancy is falling,
illiteracy rising, crime rife. Tuberculosis is again common in
Gypsy villages. Large families, sometimes 14-strong, often cram
into squalid shacks that used to house three or four people.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy children are particularly vulnerable. Few get much
education. One study reckons that only 3 percent of them finish
secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   In primary school, they start off with social and linguistic
disadvantages that are hard to redress. Some speak little Slovak,
are ill-fed and do not know how to use soap or cutlery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, including bright ones, are summarily dumped in
special schools for the mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   An extra foundation year at the start of primary school, known
as ``zero grade,'' has been tried successfully in some places, so
the government hopes to offer it to Gypsy children across the
country, starting this autumn. But persuading their parents to keep
them at school after 14 is harder.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia's president, Rudolf Schuster, thinks that special
boarding schools might be set up. ``It's often impossible for Gypsy
children to learn at home,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1998, the ruling coalition government,
which replaced a more nationalistic one that included a virulently
anti-Gypsy (and anti-Hungarian) party, has tried to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the EU will not let Slovakia into its club
until it is satisfied that the country's Gypsies are being given a
fair deal. So Slovakia has held international conferences on the
matter, has listened hard, and doled out cash for schemes approved
by Gypsies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gypsies do not always help their own cause. Slovakia's
have at least 13 political parties, which spend as much time
fighting each other as trying to improve their people's lot.
</P>
<P>
   And, abject as most Gypsies are, for many of them theft is,
sadly, a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Dzurinda recounts, with evident sympathy, how poor Slovak
farmers often accost him with tales of how crops and animals, even
pet dogs, have been stolen by Gypsies. ``They have tears in their
eyes. They want to know who will pay for their chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, most Slovaks still seem loath to give their Gypsy
citizens a chance. Michal Vasecka, who studies Gypsies at a Slovak
think-tank, tells how people, in reply to his questionnaires, often
add their own suggestions: ``Send them to the gas chambers!'' or
``Back to India!'' or ``Kill them!'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the better-disposed sort of Slovak politicians, such as
Dzurinda and Schuster, flatly deny that their countrymen are
prejudiced against the Gypsies at all. &QL;

THE INTERNET IS RUNNING OUT OF ADDRESSES

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the Internet, naming your start-up can be
more arduous than financing it. This is because most Internet
addresses, known as domain names, have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the .com domain, the most desirable online real estate,
almost every recognizable word has been claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs often have no choice but to buy an address from
the person who occupies it, sometimes paying tens of thousands of
dollars in cash or shares. Such deals have become a sort of tax on
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A solution may be at hand. Next week, the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees the domain
name system (DNS), is meeting in Cairo, to discuss adding new
``top-level'' domains, the global designations such as .com and
country-specific ones such as .uk (for Britain).
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. If the name space of the Internet cannot grow,
e-commerce could suffer. Furthermore, this week's meeting could
make or break ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   If the organization can broker an agreement, it will establish
itself as a part of the machinery of Internet governance. If not,
many on the Internet will conclude that ICANN is beholden to
business _ and start thinking about an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet pioneers devised the DNS in the mid-1980s, their
goal was, in the words of the late Jon Postel, their leading light,
to create ``a reasonably large and appropriately structured naming
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to link user-friendly names to the baffling strings
of numbers that identify computers online.
</P>
<P>
   The top-level domains, such as .com, were subdivided into
second-level domains (networks), which were in turn split into
third-level domains (host computers), and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail in 1984 Postel wrote that his online address might
one day be ``postel &LR; isi.usc.edu,'' where ``.edu'' stands for
educational organization, ``usc'' for University of Southern
California and ``isi'' for Information Sciences Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Postel and his colleagues did not foresee the explosive
growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And many businesses and people wanted their own second-level
domains, in particular those ending with .com, a trend promoted by
Network Solutions, a company that until June 1999 had the monopoly
of supplying .com registrations.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999 there were about 7.2 million .coms, compared
with roughly 1.8 million .net and .org addresses. All this has made
the scarcity of names more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, companies can share a name, so long as they are in
different markets. Online, one name can serve only one company,
since a Web address is a unique locator.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, businesses need a good Web name, because it attracts
traffic. One reason why Barnes &AMP; Noble struggled against Amazon was
that its initial address, now www.bn.com, was ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, you can easily add new domains _ as happens
whenever a country claims its two-letter code. The DNS, experts
say, could safely support several thousand top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Postel proposed adding 150 new domains as early as 1996.
But his plan was fiercely contested _ for the very same reasons
that ICANN's plans could today come to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The main objections come from the owners of trademarks. They
have invested a lot of money in their names and have often fought
or bought off ``cybersquatters,'' people who register Web addresses
merely to sell them later.
</P>
<P>
   New domains risk diluting these brands and might also increase
the costs of policing them. So before ICANN creates new domains,
trademark-owners argue, all the names in existing domains should
first be used.
</P>
<P>
   But others retort that corporate intellectual property should
not be protected by unnecessary limits on the name space of the
Internet. Anyway, they argue, business exaggerates the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Domain disputes can be settled according to a set of rules,
called the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, which was established
by ICANN and has successfully resolved eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   Policing costs could be reduced if top-level domain registries
made their databases easy to search, so that potential conflicts
were automatically identified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, a working group within ICANN has
hammered out a consensus to create some new global top-level
domains. To start with, these would number only six to ten, and
more would not be created without careful study.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is still lots to disagree over. Trademark-owners
want certain safeguards, such as protection of famous and
well-known trademarks in all domains.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents want ICANN to declare that it will gradually add
500 new domains in the next three years. To complicate things
further, ICANN also faces disputes about the administration of the
new domains.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed arguments are likely over how ICANN should select new
domains and how to define which companies should keep the
registries of addresses that they contain.
</P>
<P>
   Should registries operate on a nonprofit basis? Can any firm
make a business from allotting names a new domain? Whatever the
outcome, ICANN should not forget the poor old Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   More top domains promises more choice and innovation. The
European Union could fulfil a dream by launching .eu as a
competitor to .com. Sites with .con could be for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami, is
proposing .tel, so that consumers could look up a number in a
telephone book, type www.(telephone number).tel into a browser, and
call up the subscriber's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, with too many domains, the Internet risks
becoming so confusing that consumers will react by sticking more
fiercely to the familiar .coms. Even online, governance is an
exercise in compromise. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When the Gettys sold the family business to Texaco
in 1984, Mark Getty, one of J. Paul's grandsons, realized they had
lost more than a company: they had given up the knowledge and the
contacts available only to an industry insider.
</P>
<P>
   He made up his mind to become an insider again, without knowing
what industry he would go into, and persuaded three-quarters of the
family _ his father, two uncles and 13 of 18 cousins _ to back him.
</P>
<P>
   He set up in London with a colleague from Hambros, an investment
bank where he had been working, and started to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many deals he was offered was the Telegraph
newspaper's library of color photographs. He liked the idea; was
outbid, and started looking at other libraries.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in his 14th acquisition in five years, he finally
bought the Telegraph library: it is part of Visual Communications,
for which he paid United News and Media $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   Once the takeover is complete, Getty Images will have around 70
million images, making it bigger than its main competitor, Bill
Gates's privately-held Corbis, which has 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Gettys who supported Mark have done better since Getty
Images floated in 1998 than they would have if they had left their
money in oil.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Getty like the idea of photography? Partly because of
its obscurity. ``There was this whole industry there, and nobody
had heard of it. Even the people working in it didn't think it was
a very interesting business.''
</P>
<P>
   Its fragmentation increased its appeal. Getty looked at the way
the business worked, concluded that there was no good reason for it
to be fragmented, and set about consolidating it.
</P>
<P>
   He also spotted that there was scope for increasing efficiency
by digitizing the business and putting it on the Internet _ and
that, as it was modernized, the economies of scale would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning images, giving them key words so that researchers can
find them, creating data centers and Web sites, building thick
pipes for downloading images, all raise the fixed costs of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Getty Images has spent around $30 million in the past two years
on building its electronic infrastructure. Scanning and giving key
words for each picture costs around $45. Some 1.2 million out of a
planned total of 3 million have been done so far.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms cannot afford that sort of investment. So Getty is
integrating the companies he has bought (with some difficulty,
since most used to be rivals), putting the most valuable images
online and building four Web sites through which different markets
will gain access to them: Gettyone for advertisers, Gettysource for
editorial, Gettyworks for small businesses and art.com for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on the Web sites will be offered not only photographs,
but also software and data _ a range of intellectual property, in
other words, all of it belonging to Getty Images.
</P>
<P>
   So is Getty simply doing what oilmen have always tried to do _
corner the market in a scarce resource?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see the vulpine grandfather in this friendly,
thoughtful 39-year-old, but Getty acknowledges some similarities: a
voracious appetite for irrelevant knowledge and a business dealing
in the lifeblood of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property,'' he says, ``is the oil of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the richest men a hundred years ago: they all made
their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. All
today's richest men have made their money out of intellectual
property.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there, he reckons, the similarities end, because the kind of
organization that was needed to drill oil was very different from
the kind of organization needed to generate and manage intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil business, the capital is in the ground; in the
intellectual-property business, it is in people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   J. Paul could afford to be autocratic (``One is very nearly
always let down by underlings,'' he said), mean (he once fired all
his employees and rehired them at lower salaries) and distant (for
the last 20 years of his life, he did not once visit his company
headquarters in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   Mark cannot. He has shifted his headquarters from London to
Seattle, keeps his family in London and travels to and fro about
once every two weeks. His employees are fulsome about him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, says Getty, you can't corner the market in photographic
imagery. Pictures are not a finite resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas we have more images than the rest of the market
put together. But libraries are being built up at a terrific pace.
A photographer in a lifetime will produce maybe a million images,
and there are about 15,000 professionals at work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the famous images, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson's
pictures, that form the bulk of the consumer business are in
limited supply. And Getty is busy building other barriers to entry
to his business.
</P>
<P>
   Just as scale was the barrier to entry in the oil business,
because of the high costs of finding the stuff, so it is in the
expensive world of digitized photography, because of the costs of
reliable technology, a big library and establishing a strong
brand. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the small libraries disappear, the rivalry between Getty
Images and Bill Gates's Corbis is getting as sharp as that between
the old oil magnates, especially now that Corbis is moving into the
profitable advertising market that Getty seemed to have conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after them,'' says Leslie Hughes, of Corbis
Images.
</P>
<P>
   Getty has the advantage of a roaring share price to finance
acquisitions. But Corbis has Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Given Getty's emphasis on the differences between him and J.
Paul, it seems curious that he has chosen the Getty name for his
brand. No other Internet mogul has done this. Nor, for that matter,
did any of the other oil magnates. Odd, that. &QL;

   A SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER OVER MOZAMBIQUE _ A scarlet
shawl on a stick poked out from the leaves and waved. The pilot saw
it and went down.
</P>
<P>
   The blast from the helicopter's rotors flattened the boughs to
reveal 22 Mozambicans clinging to a single tree to avoid the
churning waters below.
</P>
<P>
   South African airmen pulled them on board, where they huddled in
an exhausted daze clutching bags of half-rotten maize. They were
the lucky ones. There are not enough helicopters to reach everyone
who needs to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   As the worst floods in living memory continue to swirl, parts of
South Africa, Zimbabwe and especially Mozambique need help to stop
the death toll from climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Eline and heavy rain have swamped countless villages and
left perhaps 1 million people homeless. The usually placid Limpopo
and Zambezi Rivers have swollen to rushing torrents up to 125km (80
miles) wide, sweeping away buildings and hurling livestock into the
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   More storms are forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is supposed to fall on rich and poor alike, but this deluge
has hit hardest those least able to cope. Mozambique, the poorest
country in the region, is the worst affected.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cruel reward for all the efforts which had helped to
turn this unlucky country into one of the world's fastest-growing
economies, at last giving hope to a people who had been reduced,
many of them, by two decades of civil war to wearing tree bark and
eating wild berries.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have pushed back into poverty large numbers of
Mozambicans who had recently begun to lift themselves out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as bad, the flooding has almost certainly dislodged
thousands of landmines and carried them into places previously
considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican peasants usually plant some of their crops on low
ground, which is damper and more fertile, and some higher up, in
case nearby rivers flood. But this year's floods are so much
heavier than usual that not only have the low fields been turned to
muddy porridge but much of the hillside crop has also been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins sans Frontieres, a French charity, estimates that
220,000 Mozambicans will need food aid in the next three months, a
figure that will rise if the waters do not recede before the
planting season, which should begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozambican government estimates that 900,000 of its citizens
will need assistance of some sort, and has asked donors for $65
million. Only $13.5 million had been pledged by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Things in Zimbabwe are better, but not all that much. The floods
have killed at least 60 people and affected the lives of perhaps
another 250,000.
</P>
<P>

Zimbabwe declared a state of emergency in three of his country's
eight provinces on Feb. 24.

   At least 50 people have died, mainly from drowning, in the
Northern Province. Perhaps 80,000 are homeless, and several small

<P>
   South Africa, Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia have all opened
some of the floodgates on their dams to lower the water level
upstream. Unfortunately, this has released more water into
Mozambique, making the rescue work there even harder.

<P>
   Efforts to fly food and vaccines to the needy are hampered
because the victims are scattered in small groups around a vast
area, and are constantly on the move to escape the shifting waters.
</P>

   And water is not the only peril they face. The floods bring
disease with them. Vast stretches of new swampland are a
breeding-ground for malarial mosquitoes. Torrents of filthy water
can spread cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and exhaustion among those clinging to trees or bridges
lower their resistance to disease. And, since between an eighth and
a quarter of adults in the flooded countries are HIV-afflicted,
that resistance is often not very great to start with. &QL;

PAMPERED BRITISH BUMS ARE FUSSY ABOUT TOILET TISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Why does it cost more to wipe your bottom in Britain
than in any other country in the European Union?
</P>
<P>
   According to John Bridgeman, the outgoing director general of
fair trading, it is because British consumers are extremely fussy
when it comes to toilet paper. British bums, in short, demand and
get the best.
</P>
<P>
   Five-star treatment, however, comes at a price. A recent
government survey of international prices found that the British
pay twice as much as the Germans and the French, and nearly
two-and-a-half times as much as Americans for a standard four-roll
pack of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this discrepancy is that British consumers insist
on a softer, more luxurious texture than their less discriminating
continental and American cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The average British toilet roll is also 14mm longer and 2mm
wider than a continental roll. British toilet paper is four grams
heavier per square meter because it contains more fiber than
European tissues. The British product also has 40 more sheets per
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Plotkin, consumer sales director of Fort James, which
supplies British and European supermarkets, says these differences
are rooted in history.
</P>
<P>
   The market leader, Andrex, now owned by America's
Kimberly-Clark, with over a third of the market, has set standards
which private-label brands have had to copy.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups and extensive consumer testing have established
that British consumers are not willing to be fobbed off with less.
One other factor distinguishes the British toilet-paper-roll
market.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any supermarket and you will be confronted by an
extraordinary choice of more than 50 colors, sizes and brands.
Honeysuckle, warm pink, summer peach, pearl white, meadow green,
breeze blue and magnolia are just some of the shades on offer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this variety is apparently that the British
shopper insists that her toilet paper matches the color scheme of
her bathroom. On the continent, consumers settle happily for white,
with pink thrown in as a wild alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin waxes lyrical about the state of the market in Britain.
``It is 50 years of heritage and tradition,'' he says, insisting
that no one should underestimate the importance of toilet paper to
the nation's well-being. &QL;

 &HT;    How I created, then ended, the drought
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I believe that I am responsible for
creating the drought that has gripped Deep East Texas for a year,
and I hope to take the credit for ending it. I know the drought is
plaguing nearly all of Texas, but I can only bear responsibility
for my neck of the woods. Find another columnist to blame, or
credit, if you live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We built our house nearly two years ago. Building a house is
akin to childbirth, or so I'm told _ being genetically incapable of
that act and mighty thankful to boot. Building a house requires a
lot of pain, most of which you forget, which is why people are
willing to go through the process more than once. At the time, East
Texas was blessed with an over-abundance of rain, and since I was
rapidly running out of money I opted not to install a sprinkler
system.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it quit raining on the same day I had the sod laid
down, nearly an acre of it, and I nearly killed myself hauling
hoses around to keep the San Augustine grass alive. My grass went
the first three months without seeing a measurable amount of
unchlorinated water.
</P>
<P>
   But by late fall, we were back to our usual monsoon weather. It
was then I realized that my back yard was a natural swamp, being
about eight feet lower than my backyard neighbor. Funny how you
don't notice these things when the lot is covered with trees. From
the winter solstice on, the back yard had at least six inches of
standing water. By February of last year, I had two choices. Put in
a drainage system or buy a bunch of ducks and declare my back yard
a mitigated wetland area. I was leaning toward the ducks, but my
wife was afraid hunters would start camping out in the back yard,
disturbing her beauty sleep on the weekends with intermittent
blasts from 12-gauges. Once it dried out enough to dig ditches, I
spent, well, too much money putting in a French-drain system that
worked perfectly. Soon the back yard was actually traversable
again.
</P>
<P>
   The drought, a k a ``The Time It Never Rained: The Sequel''
began about 72 hours after the drainage system was installed. In
the last year, it has rained so seldom that my cheap glass rain
gauge cracked. There hasn't been much reason to buy a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. I reached the point of no-return and have poneyd up
the money to put in a sprinkler system. I can't pull hoses around
the yard for another season. My back hurts, and I'm getting cranky.
So I made my banker happy and borrowed the money to put in a
sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   The crew started digging on Wednesday. Understand, it hasn't
rained for more than 15 minutes since Thanksgiving. My grass has
been gasping for sustenance for months. My favorite TV show is the
Weather Channel, where smart-looking women promise a chance of rain
but rarely deliver. The weather people blame La Nina for the latest
drought. El Nino got the blame for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   I know the weather means a lot more to folks who actually depend
on it for a living. I'm worried about grass; they're worried about
their livelihood. If it doesn't rain, my lawn dies. Those in the
cattle business have a lot more to worry about. But we're all
praying for rain.
</P>
<P>
   So I decided to put in a sprinkler system. I am feeling hopeful.
It started pouring rain approximately two hours after work
commenced on the sprinkler system. I came home after lunch to find
the crew standing under the eaves on the front porch, smoking
cigarettes and staring at the water. Several days later, work is
progressing slowly, since the ground is wet. There's a 50 percent
chance of more thunderstorms on the day I'm writing this. My yard
now looks like a herd of giant mutant gophers has run amok.
</P>
<P>
   I know better than to complain about rain. I made a vow during
the drought of '98 to never complain about rain again, and I have
kept it. I would just like a little recognition for doing my part
to end the drought. That's all.

 &HT;    She wants to see Egypt, but I'm pushing for Alabama
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ This is the time of the year I begin to
get two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Is your wife going to let you plant another garden?''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``What trips does she have planned for you?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to No. 1 is: ``We're currently in negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to No. 2 is: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   We spend late winter evenings sitting beside the fire, perusing
our favorite publications. I thumb through seed catalogs while she
studies travel magazines and brochures, which arrive so steadily I
can intercept only a few at the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   I was engrossed in an item about Burpee's new disease-resistant
English peas when she brought up the subject of travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go somewhere different this year,'' she said. ``I'd like
to know more about how people lived before modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea,'' I agreed. ``We've never done much
traveling in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about something more exotic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama has Indian burial mounds,'' I answered. ``I doubt
there's a lot of difference. Dead is dead. Besides, the pyramids
are such a long way off in Egypt. We could see Indian mounds in
Alabama and then stop over at one of the lakes for some fishing,
all on maybe two tanks of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're worried about expense, we better go see the pyramids
this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the election. If a Republican gets in the White
House, the country will have a terrible recession and we won't have
any money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where in the world did you get that idea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the newspapers and watch television,'' she replied.
``Don't you know about Bill Clinton giving us the greatest and
longest period of prosperity we've ever known?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's remarkable,'' I agreed. ``And to think he did that all
by himself while Al Gore was off inventing the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to take another long trip, we need to go while
times are good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were going somewhere far away, I certainly wouldn't go to
Egypt,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't you go to Egypt?'' she asked. ``People who have
been there say it's a very interesting place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be,'' I replied. ``But people who go there seem to
have a hard time getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a new excuse,'' she said. ``Where did you dig that one
up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Bible. Didn't they teach you about Moses in Sunday
school? I'd hate to get over there and have to go through all the
things he did trying to get back home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you were a biblical expert,'' she remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you have to get on a boat and sail up the Nile River to
see the pyramids?'' I asked. ''Didn't you read the story in the
newspaper about Muslim fanatics massacring 22 Christians in one of
those little Nile villages? I don't think Methodists are too
popular over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the story,'' she replied. ''It said Egyptians think
what happened in that village is an extreme case and not likely to
happen again. It's a situation sort of like Buckhead in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that the pope is going to Egypt to try to
help,'' I pointed out. ''I think we ought to wait and see how he
comes out before we make plans to go. We can always do the pyramids
after we do Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not getting any younger,'' she replied. ``We need to
make foreign trips while you can still get around without a cane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been talking to Claude McBride again?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some conversations and he sent a brochure.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude is one of my University of Georgia journalism classmates,
a retired Baptist minister who doubles as an alumni tour leader and
chaplain for the football team. He was once a trusted friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't go to Egypt with a Baptist preacher when
they're killing Christians,'' I said. ``Being a Methodist or even
an Episcopalian would be dangerous enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you think of any other excuses?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the need to save money for your Republican
recession and terrorists always hijacking planes in that part of
the world, I can't think of anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how things stand at the moment. Unless I can come up with
an exotic destination in Alabama or Mississippi, I'm afraid I'm in
imminent danger of making a trip to Egypt to see the pyramids. She
has rather firmly ruled out both Panama City and Elvis' place in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The best I can hope for is a larger garden and making sure we're
not away from home when the tomatoes and Silver Queen come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and order your English peas and the other garden seed
you want,'' she said. ``It's nice to have fresh vegetables in the
summer, and we might even put up some for the winter in case the
Republicans win.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again I'm being out-maneuvered, but in spousal
negotiations, you take what you can get.

 &HT;    Plane-ly speaking, use jointer to flatten
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The thread of messages on the Internet about whether
one needs a jointer for milling boards, which I wrote about not
long ago, continues.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how many folks think the only thing they'd use a
jointer for is jointing.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's because it's called a jointer, when in fact it
might more properly be called a flattener or a face leveler.
</P>
<P>
   You do not, in fact, need a jointer to square the edge of boards
for glueing. It's a simple thing to do using nothing but the
standard 22-inch jointer plane. At the risk of boring relatively
experienced readers, here's how it's done:
</P>
<P>
   Take two boards that are to be glued together (laminated) to
make a wider board and set them down in the position in which you
want to glue them, face side up, right and left side ends matched.
Now pick them up and swing them so they are back to back, face
sides out, matching edges down on the workbench. Clamp them
together, being sure to use scrap pads to avoid denting the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Now flip them over and clamp them in the vise. If they're long,
you'll want to clamp the other end to the bench using a pipe clamp
to keep the assembly from slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've got these boards where you want them, all you do is
joint both the edges at once (this assumes you're using 4/4 stock
or thinner. If larger, it's off to the jointer you go). Using a
hand plane is not difficult to learn, although the heavy jointer
plane isn't necessarily the one you want to learn with.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, when starting a pass, you put most of the pressure on
the forward end of the plane until the handle is over the wood;
then you use equal pressure fore and aft until you get to the point
where the forward knob is off the wood. Then you shift nearly all
the pressure to the handle. The object, of course, is to keep from
planing a convex edge into the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The point of doing both edges at once is that if you fail to
keep the plane exactly level, the edges will be mirror images and
will mate anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Make fine cuts until you are taking a shaving off the entire
assembly. At that point, the two boards should be ready to glue.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of gluing ...
</P>
<P>
   The question came up of preventing slippage while gluing. Anyone
who has glued two edges together knows that the glue makes the
boards want to slide around and, if allowed, slide out of
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Some woodworkers use biscuits or dowels just to keep the boards
aligned. This is a lot of unnecessary work. One correspondent had a
novel method; he said he sprinkles coarse sand on one of the edges,
and this stops the slippage. I can see that it would, but I'd
rather not get sand anywhere near my edged tools.
</P>
<P>
   If you have trouble with slippage, simply prepare a few scrap
boards with flat, or even slightly convex edges, cut to be an inch
or so longer than the width of the assembly. Run the glue on the
workpieces, put the clamps on and apply enough pressure to get some
squeeze-out. At that point, get some more clamps, make a kind of
sandwich out of pairs of the scrap boards, and clamp them together
edge-down, above and below the workpieces, using wax paper to
prevent them from getting involved in the glue.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three of these ought to keep the boards from shifting,
and then you can finish getting the pressure you need on the
glue-up clamps.

   PALSY _ A Fairborn girl's upcoming trip for an experimental
cerebral palsy treatment in Toronto has begun kindling some local
interest in clinically testing the procedure. Tiffany Foxx will
undergo about 100 hyperbaric oxygen treatments in June and August.
Her parents and doctors hope that breathing concentrated oxygen
will revive brain cells that have been inactive since she was born
five years ago. Few patients have tried the procedure, but doctors
who administer it tell of helping children walk, sit up, control
their arms or eat for the first time. (Dayton Daily News). WITH

   EPISCOPAL-REFLECT _ ATLANTA _ For almost 13 years, Frank Kellog
Allan has been Episcopal bishop of Atlanta, one of the country's
fastest growing Episcopal communities. Beginning Monday, he will be
a shopkeeper. Allan, who has retired from the episcopate ``but not
from life,'' is opening ``By the Work of OUr Hands,'' a store
devoted to folk arts and crafts, to display the work of about 200
North Georgia artisans and to benefit local Episcopal charities.
``You're never closer to God than when you're creating,'' said
Allan, whose woodwork will be sold in the shop. The new role is in
keeping with his belief that people should live simply and give
away much. Several years ago he and his wife sold their large
northwest Atlanta home and moved into a much smaller, and cheaper,
house near Emory. He has given away much of his $100,000 annual
salary as bishop. Recently, Allan sat down to reflect on religion
and life _ especially what he expects in the rest of his own.

 &HT;    Kabbalah seeks unity thorugh self-empowerment
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What the Beatles did for transcendental
meditation in the 1960s, Madonna, Elizabeth Taylor and Courtney
Love may be doing for the study of the Kabbalah _ the mystical
tradition that lies at the root of Jewish practice.
</P>
<P>
   Christians, skeptics, even atheists have found benefit from
these Jewish teachings, according to Rabbi Yehuda Shemtov, of
suburban Philadelphia. Shemtov has put together a national Jewish
seminar that offers an introduction to the broad range of mystical
texts that were passed down verbally for thousands of years, and at
one time considered to be a knowledge too powerful for ordinary
people to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Shemtov's program is called Inward Bound. The 4 1/2-hour course
includes group study and discussion, meditation, guided
visualizations and interactive exercises.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people across the country have gone through the
course since Shemtov started it about four years ago. That's not a
lot of people, but it's important to limit class size in order to
keep it interactive, he says.
</P>
<P>
   No one is asked about their religious background when they sign
up, but he knows that non-Jews participate because they tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for spirituality and not finding it in
organized religion,'' says Shemtov, an Orthodox Jew who
nevertheless believes that such labels are meaningless. ``Religion
has become rote and mechanical. We know that keeping the Sabbath is
one of the commandments, but what is the Sabbath all about? That
has become lost.''
</P>
<P>
   If Judaism is a practice of religion, then the Kabbalah is the
reason behind the practice. And that's what people hunger for,
Shemtov says.
</P>
<P>
   The Kabbalah, like other spiritual explorations that have become
trendy in recent years, is a means toward self-empowerment and
personal growth, Shemtov says. ``It's a key to open up your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kabbalistic literature and practice _ which includes prayer,
fasting, chanting, meditation and breath control _ can be found a
sensitivity to gender equality, environmental protection and
dialogue with other spiritual traditions, says Ron Feldman in his
book, ``Fundamentals of Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah'' (Crossing,
$12.95). That makes it an attractive option for contemporary
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   David Marcus, 62, a Dayton cardiologist, has been studying the
Kabbalah for about a year. He studies with Rabbi Nochum Mangel,
director of the Chabad Center of Greater Dayton, which is hosting
an Inward Bound presentation in Dayton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, who was raised in the Jewish tradition, finds that
Kabbalah study makes his prayer more meaningful and helps ``bring
down godliness into our physical world.'' As a physician, it is
easy to feel that his life's work has purpose. But the Kabbalah
helps him understand that ``it takes many, many talents to make the
world work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangel says the Kabbalah is the basis for everything he teaches.
His twice-monthly Torah discussions begin with the practical _ the
law, then take a Kabbalistic twist: ``What does this do to our
soul?''
</P>
<P>
   An example: The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself
means go out of your way to help other people. But the mystical
subtext is, ``We're all part of the same creation,'' Mangel says.
That total stranger is another part of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysticism tries to unite,'' says Rabbi Shmuel Klatzkin, also
of the Chabad Center. ``It teaches that we're not just little egos
walking around in boxes of skin and bones. We're not all so private
and different. We're all here because of God's purpose.''

 &HT;    Parents hope high doses of oxygen will heal cerebral palsy child
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A girl's upcoming trip for an experimental
cerebral palsy treatment in Toronto has begun kindling some
interest in clinically testing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Foxx will undergo about 100 hyperbaric oxygen treatments
in June and August. Her parents and doctors hope that breathing
concentrated oxygen will revive brain cells that have been inactive
since she was born five years ago. Few patients have tried the
procedure, but doctors who administer it tell of helping children
walk, sit up, control their arms or eat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth investigating, says Dr. John Bishop, medical director
of the Kettering Hyperbaric and Wound Care facility at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Bishop's facility cannot
administer experimental treatments unless they're part of an
approved scientific study, but he says, ``We would be interested in
collaborating with someone who treats cerebral palsy children and
would like to do hyperbaric research.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be easy, he warned. It probably would take a year of
planning and approval ``to even start it,'' and he hasn't even
looked into where the money would come from.
</P>
<P>
   So Tiffany's mother, Danielle, is trying to round up support
from doctors and patients' advocates at the same time she is trying
to raise $9,800 for Tiffany's trip and treatments. An auction on
Tiffany's behalf is scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
   In researching the therapy, Danielle and her husband, David,
have stumbled over the thin line that separates protecting
patients' families from quackery and discouraging them from hope.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle is angry at the national United Cerebral Palsy
organization's reluctance to support research on hyperbaric
therapy. It calls itself the principal sponsor of nongovernmental
U.S. research and its position paper says there's no evidence
``that the procedure fails to work,'' she points out, so why isn't
UCP doing more to see if it does work?
</P>
<P>
   UCP's position paper has the tone of someone who has had too
many offers to buy the Brooklyn Bridge. ``Unconventional
interventions,'' it says, follow a pattern of enthusiasm giving way
to disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hesitant at first,'' says David, who is retiring
as an Air Force technical sergeant this month to be a full-time
assistant pastor of the nondenominational Agape Family Worship
Center in Fairborn. ``I thought, `This is just somebody else trying
to sell us another medical treatment.' But the more she researched
it, the more excited she was. She said, 'The doctors are telling me
it doesn't work, but the people are telling me it does.'''
</P>
<P>
   The therapy makes logical sense, at least. Cerebral palsy is a
catch-all term for neurological disabilities resulting from a lack
of oxygen to the brain, short-circuiting its motor signals to the
body's muscles. Hyperbaric therapy delivers 100 percent oxygen at
more than atmospheric pressure, enabling body fluids to absorb
oxygen in higher concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reactivates dormant (brain) cells that are getting enough
oxygen to exist but not enough to fire electrically,'' says Dr.
Richard Neubauer, a pioneer in hyperbaric CP therapy at the Ocean
Hyperbaric Center in Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Fla. The high oxygen
doses ``jump-start the brain,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany needs a tracheotomy to breathe safely and a feeding tube
to her stomach to be nourished without choking. Dr. Uday Chada of
the CKC Hyperbaric Centre of Toronto has indicated the treatments
would make both unnecessary, Danielle says, and could enable her to
crawl and restore vision to her left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect her to become a miraculous 5-year-old
overnight, but if the extra oxygen jump-starts her brain, she'll be
able to start learning,'' says Danielle, who runs a day care center
and a beauty salon in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's mental capabilities now range from 7 months to 2 years
and the tracheotomy keeps her silent. ``But she's boisterous, even
though she can't cry out loud,'' Danielle says. ``She loves
television, she loves music and she loves her brothers (Garrick,
10, and Christopher, 7).''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle learned about the treatment from an ad in a magazine
for parents of handicapped children. On the Internet, she
researched the topic and contacted families who had used it. ``Once
you see it work,'' one mother told her, ``you'll do everything you
can to get your daughter back.''
</P>
<P>
   She met Tina Frederick of Huber Heights, who has taken her son,
Gary, to Canada for 55 treatments. Before that, ``If someone threw
him a ball, he would just sit there and let it hit him,'' Frederick
says. ``Now he bats it away.'' There's been a dramatic decrease in
the number of his seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The limited but promising research has prompted the Canadian
government to commit $1.8 million to further studies. Besides
improvements in motor skills, Neubauer says brain scans typically
show increased blood flow to the damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want every skeptical doctor to evaluate Tiffany before her
treatments, and then see the difference,'' Danielle says.
</P>
<P>
   She understands there are no guarantees. While Bishop says the
therapy should not be rejected out of hand, he adds, ``It's also
not something to sink your life savings into.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Foxxes and Frederick both say they have no choice but to
try everything they can. For Frederick's son, the treatments have
given some hope where there was none. ``Even if it makes his life
just a little bit easier,'' Frederick says, it's all worth it.''

 Here's a tip Hillary  
  &HT;     By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if she didn't have enough problems already, what with the
Puerto Rican thing and her husband being named the sleaziest
president in U.S. history, it now turns out that Hillary Clinton is
a lousy tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the first lady was served a $6 lunch by waitress
Trish Trupo at the Village House restaurant in Albion, N.Y. After
finishing her lunch, which the restaurant's owner paid for, Mrs.
Clinton left without leaving a tip.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, when this oversight was discovered, Mrs.
Clinton was slammed mercilessly by the local media. The U.S. Senate
candidate wound up sending an apology and a $100 savings bond to
the waitress's son, all of which could have been avoided if she had
just plunked down the customary 15 percent, which in this case
would have amounted to a measly 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   (Being the high-roller that I am, I would have rounded the tip
off and left the waitress a whole dollar. However, I also would
have pocketed a fistful of mints and at least half a dozen
toothpicks to compensate for my generosity.)
</P>
<P>
   I do not know if there were any extenuating circumstances that
might have given Mrs. Clinton reason to stiff her waitress. Perhaps
her cheeseburger was not cooked medium-well, as she had requested,
or maybe her iced tea came with sugar when she specifically
requested Sweet 'N Low.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the waitress was one of those annoyingly chirpy types
who came up the table and said, ``Hi! My name is Trish! I'll be
your server today! And perhaps now would be a good time for me to
mention that I'm a good friend of Paula Jones!''
</P>
<P>
   Or, worse yet, maybe someone leaked out that it was Mrs.
Clinton's birthday and Trish and all of her fellow waiters and
waitresses descended, clapping and stomping, on the first lady's
table just as she was taking her first bite of undercooked
cheeseburger and launched into a loud and off-key version of
``Happy Birthday,'' spoiling not only Mrs. Clinton's appetite but
the appetite of everyone else in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   This last scenario is not likely given the fact that the lunch
was a planned campaign stop and was therefore attended by dozens of
handlers, media-types and various and sundry gawkers, crowding the
place to the point that a full-blown Happy Birthday! production
would have been impossible. (This is, as far as I'm aware, the
first and only redeeming quality of handlers, media-types and
gawkers. You may want to hire some the next time someone threatens
to take you out for a birthday dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that things would have to get awfully ugly
_ I'm thinking in terms of a terrible accident involving the
``Happy Birthday'' singers that resulted in Mrs. Clinton's hair
catching on fire _ for someone to deny a waitress a paltry 90-cent
tip.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Mrs. Clinton did not fail to leave a tip
because she is cheap or malicious or was dissatisfied with the
service. Being a politician's wife all these years, she's probably
just unfamiliar with the practice.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that I am the husband of a restaurant critic
and one of my many jobs (stealing menus and remembering the doggie
bags) is figuring out the tip. This is not as easy as it sounds.
Fifteen percent is a difficult number to manipulate in one's mind,
particularly if you've had a glass of wine two. I tried using a
pocket calculator once, but it was one of those solar-powered jobs
and there wasn't enough light in the restaurant to make it work. I
wound up taking it into the restroom and holding it under the light
above the sink. It worked OK then, but I got a lot of funny looks
from the other guys in the restroom, including one who scolded me
for bringing a cell phone into a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So now I just take the coward's route and ask the waiter or
waitress to add 15 percent to the bill. They don't seem to mind
doing it and everyone walks away happy.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of pathetic, I realize, but it beats getting your name
dragged through the mud by the press and having to send a $100
savings bond to your waitress's kid, who didn't so much as fill
your water glass.
</P>

 &HT;     Ouch, where did that come from?   
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone was explaining about malaria and how even when you're
seemingly cured you can suffer sneak return attacks that wallop you
with a feverish replay.
</P>
<P>
   I think Arizona Sen. John McCain's use of the word gook to refer
to his Vietnamese tormenters was like being revisited by a nasty
affliction. Without warning, the old poison came spewing back and
turned on him.
</P>
<P>
   Racism runs deep. You can't just assume that it's been wiped out
in yourself or your community simply because it's known to be bad
for people. Since there's still no cure we need to report every
outbreak like a public health alert. It's the only way we stay
attentive.
</P>
<P>
   A very powerful man who aspires to greater power uses a term
that even backyard bullies know is taboo. When he doesn't apologize
some people are shocked. It's just as shocking when some act like
they could care less.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks hark back to a time when just about every
ethnic group and religion came with a slur word for a nickname. I
learned a few from my father, who was from the ``some of my best
friends are ...'' club. That was the qualifier he used when telling
a joke or making some disparaging remark about Jews, Blacks,
Catholics, Italians or Japanese. Then he'd invoke the ``best
friend'' exemption, thus counting himself as tolerant but still
holding onto his prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   When my sister and I would call him on it he would rationalize
that this was how some people came to feel about certain groups of
other people during his time of history, that being World War II
and the Great Depression. He seemed to believe that if you were
going through a war or tough times someone just naturally ended up
being despised.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain learned to hate a certain group of people during the
Vietnam War just as some of them learned to hate the group that
included John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gook is a war word, according to my slang dictionary. Likely of
Filipino origin, it was adopted by U.S. armed forces during the
Filipino Insurrection of 1899 as a contemptuous term for Filipinos
and then spread by American troops to Japanese, Koreans and
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ugly words come from war, hate talk being almost as
effective as bullets in targeting an enemy. But the war is over and
the word has been out of favor for a long time now, so it was
unbelievable to hear it slip from the lips of someone like John
McCain. The words smarted, but what was worse was he stuck by them.
And then his defenders stuck by him.
</P>
<P>
   They said that it was just an example of his glib and colorful
speech, as if he were auditioning for a comedy club instead of
leader of the free and fair world.
</P>
<P>
   Someone even suggested that his irreverence might win him some
votes with young people who think it's funny to be anti-PC. If he
follows that line of campaign strategy, he won't want to miss the
party 'til you puke scene.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of media went looking for comments in the Asian-American
community and of course people thought it was shabby, but you
didn't have to be Asian to be offended. A remark directed at Wops
or Krauts would have been equally disturbing. Hate talk embarrasses
all of us.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad he blew it. While he had our attention he could
have turned his words around and said what he said was stupid, the
word is stupid and so is racism. He could still have made the point
that his torturers were dirty rats and that he would never forgive
those particular sadists, but that he surely didn't want to smear
an entire country, a huge part of the world and all the fine
contributors to the great American melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   He could have said it takes as much strength of character to
admit a failing as it does to survive a war and now he had done
both. School children, the guys at the end of the bar watching
wrestling, Democrats, even _ we all would have cheered.

&HT;     MAKING TRACKS IN UTAH'S POWDERY PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>

   PARK CITY, Utah _ The first lesson about skiing in Utah is this:
Never get between a powderhound and his fresh-snow fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champagne powder'' is what the locals call the huge,
feather-light snowflakes that often fall in Utah's Wasatch mountain
range. Many say it's the greatest snow on Earth because the
softness and lightness make turning easier. At some resorts, 500
inches fall between November and May, a far greater amount than in
Colorado or California.
</P>
<P>
   For some Utah skiers, the 500 inches is still barely enough.
</P>
<P>
   Witness, for instance, a morning of powder at Park City Mountain
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Two feet of snow had fallen overnight. All morning long, the
mountains echoed with muffled explosions as workers used mortars to
trigger avalanches and make the steep slopes safe for skiers.
Finally, at 10 a.m., the mountain opened the mile-wide,
1,000-foot-high Jupiter Bowl, a huge cirque of double-black-diamond
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing rush to reach the lift was worse than a New York
City subway entrance during rush hour. At one point in the mad
dash, a skier turned to a friend and said, ``If you see anybody who
looks stupid, knock them down so we can get ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   I think he was kidding, but it was hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Powder does strange things to people, according to Julie Rawl, a
friend of mine in Park City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, nice skiers turn into devils,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few runs in Utah powder and you'll see why.
</P>
<P>
   For the skier or snowboarder who knows how to handle it, there
is no thrill greater than riding through powder. It is an ethereal,
dreamlike experience, a combination of floating and sinking,
jumping and turning that burns fire into your legs and joy into
your heart. On a good day you can't even see your skis, buried as
they are beneath the delicious white stuff. On a good day, you grin
without knowing it. It is so much fun that it's a wonder the
government hasn't made it illegal.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a wonder more people don't come here.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, which for years issued license plates saying ``Ski Utah,''
had about 3.1 million skier-visits last year (the total number of
the skiers on the mountain each day during the season), compared
with about 12 million in Colorado and 8 million in California.
Nevertheless, several Utah resorts are preparing for the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City by expanding their terrain and
adding an unprecedented number of new lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Some locals fear the secret powder stashes of Utah may soon be
discovered by the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happened, I wanted to see what Utah powder skiing
was all about. So last week, my snowboarding friend Ethan Chase and
I went to the Wasatch Mountains to find some.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be as easy as the ski resorts would have you
believe.
</P>
<P>
   We flew into Salt Lake City, a medium-sized metropolis
surrounded by snow-clad, 10,000-foot peaks. From the airport, 10
world-class ski resorts are less than an hour away.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Brighton, a family-oriented ski resort
located in Big Cottonwood Canyon, a half-hour east of the city.
There was little powder to be seen, but the tiny parking lot still
filled with cars soon after the resort opened. This 10,500-foot
mountain still sports a 1,700-foot vertical drop and a surprising
amount of challenging terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we headed to Park City, a half-hour away from Salt
Lake City. This former mining town is the closest Utah comes to
glitz, with a main street lined with stores selling southwestern
crafts and framed, 30- by 40-inch wildlife photographs that go for
$995.
</P>
<P>
   I expected to be turned off by Park City Resort, especially as
we made our way through the multitiered resort base filled with
restaurants and ski shops.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as we took the six-passenger lift from the base, we
discovered a huge mountain with plenty of solitude. The mountain
was built by the United Park City Mining Company in 1960, a few
years after their silver mines closed, and the resort is filled
with mine tailings and rusty metal buildings that add a sense of
history to the skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, skiers were even lifted to the top of one slope
on an old mine rail car and a 1,600-foot elevator ride.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, our rest day, a huge storm was approaching. The
next day, the snow was deep and light. Two days later, we went to
the huge Snowbird Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon. After traffic
slowed the six-mile approach to 45 minutes, we reached the huge
concrete-and-glass resort base _ only to find that two-thirds of
the mountain _ including its famous 125-person summit tram _ was
closed because of avalanche danger. The powder was two feet deep,
but there was no way to get to it.
</P>
<P>
   Joining thousands of snarling skiers, we waited in half-hour
lines for three unsatisfying runs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, we discovered a 100-foot-high slope that still
contained untracked powder. I skied, snow flying up my chest, and
stood at the bottom to take a picture of Ethan. As he came down,
another skier _ spying the tiny stretch of untracked snow toward
which Ethan was headed _ cut him off and blasted through.
</P>
<P>
   After this mess, we decided to head to some less-crowded areas
near Ogden, a half-hour north of Salt Lake City. In Ogden, the
mountains are lower, but the snow falls just as hard.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin, home to the future Olympic downhill and Super-G race,
is a large mountain with a tiny base area. Workers there recently
added two new gondolas, opening a terrific amount of formerly
backcountry terrain, and are working on a $70 million development
project that will create a new base lodge and a road that will cut
13 miles off the trip from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Snowbasin may become a destination resort on par
with Park City or Snowbird. For now, the undulating terrain hides
plenty of powder ``shots'' that kept us busy all morning.
</P>
<P>
   For our last day, we headed to Powder Mountain, perhaps Utah's
greatest skiing secret (and, at $33, one of the best deals around).
This family-owned mountain has only four chairlifts, but there are
other ways to get to the snow.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can hike across a ridge, pay $5 for a snowcat
ride _ you grab a rope trailing behind the tractor-like machine for
a ride to a hidden ridge _ or pay $120 for a helicopter ride to a
nearby peak. Even more backcountry terrain empties onto a road,
where a bus from the mountain brings you back to the base lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain at Powder Mountain is so vast that the mountain
provides a crew of about 150 volunteer hosts whose job is to ski
with first-timers. Our guide, Clint, spent the entire day helping
us search for powder. The snow was somewhat heavy, but two days
after the storm there were still plenty of untracked shots left.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, I was at the top of yet another powder
stash that was free of tracks. The next day, we would be flying
back to New York, where the snow was melting and spring seemed on
its way.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the next day. Today, there was still one more run.
And we had a job to do.
</P>
<P>
   I started down the slope, grinning.

CANCELING `THE DARVA &AMP; RICK SHOW'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger ever go away? Shouldn't the
clock have run out on their 15 minutes of fame about two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   I know what some of you are thinking: Who the heck are Rick
Rockwell and Darva Conger? OK, for those who've been traveling in
outer space _ or who tuned out pop culture and the tabloid media
way back in the O.J. era _ Rick and Darva are the instant
celebrities created by last month's TV game show, ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell was the multimillionaire who wanted to find out who
wanted to marry him. Conger was the aspiring bride who wanted to
marry him _ or thought she did, until she got a look at him.
</P>
<P>
   Darva hasn't come right out and said it, but you don't have to
do much reading between the lines to figure out that the previously
unseen groom's appearance onstage after he chose Conger as his
bride did not produce the magical attack of love at first sight
that the show's producers _ and Rockwell _ had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   It was more like an attack of nausea. Revulsion at first sight.
Rick wanted to hear Darva say, ``I do'' but it seems that the only
words she could think of were, ``I think I'm gonna be sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger later told interviewers that Rockwell wasn't the sort of
person she could ever have a relationship with, which raises the
question: How would she know what kind of person he was when she'd
never even met him?
</P>
<P>
   What she meant, obviously, was that he didn't look like the kind
of person she could have a relationship with. He wasn't handsome
enough.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Rockwell had some problems that were a lot
more damaging than his failure to be a good-looking son of a gun,
notably allegations of abuse by a former girlfriend who obtained a
restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Darva didn't know anything about Rick's background when she
instantaneously concluded that she wanted no part of him.
</P>
<P>
   So. At least we know that Conger isn't merely a gold digger. She
is apparently a shallow gold digger who is every bit as interested
in a prospective husband's looks as she is in his money.
</P>
<P>
   I'm proud to say that I didn't watch the program that produced
this lovely couple, but I've been watching the ensuing interviews.
Conger seems like an intelligent person at first glance, but she
must be dumber than a rock if she thought that a man who was
shopping for a bride on a TV game show would look like Brad Pitt or
Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, meanwhile, might as well start wearing a sign around
his neck: ``I'm a moron.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointed groom _ disappointed because, among other
reasons, he and Darva spent the honeymoon in separate rooms _ has
been telling interviewers that he figured no one would find out
about his problem with the ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He said he assumed that records of such run-ins with the legal
system ``were purged after seven years or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger no doubt wishes that some of her records were purged as
well, particularly those military records that refuted her claim of
being a Persian Gulf War veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Now. Back to the original question: Will these people ever go
away?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: Not as long as the media remain preoccupied
with the story.
</P>
<P>
   The longer answer: Rick and Darva will eventually go away, but
their saga will soon be replaced by some other freak show that
fascinates the public and obsesses the media. Rockwell and Conger
are just the momentary beneficiaries _ victims? _ of a culture that
seems to glorify the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   If Rockwell and Conger had hit it off, had come back from their
honeymoon pledging eternal devotion to one another, the media and
the public would have dumped them in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares about happily-ever-after anymore? Here on the edge of
21st-century America, we want heartache. We want lies. We want
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you suppose we elected Bill Clinton to two terms as
president?
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell and Conger will go away.
</P>
<P>
   And their successors are waiting in the wings.

THE QUESTIONABLE HEROISM OF EXPATRIATE PRESTON KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preston King returned to the United States last week for the
first time in 39 years. His arrival, made possible by a pardon
issued by President Clinton, was trumpeted as some kind of a heroic
triumph over a racist wrong done lo, those many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the draft dodger didn't stick around long enough to
visit the Korean War memorial in Washington, or walk by The Wall,
where the names of more than 58,000 of this nation's true heroes
are inscribed _ none of them beginning with the word ``Mister.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps memories of American servicemen of all colors coming
home in body bags were fresh in King's mind back in the mid-'50s,
when he asked for and received two educational deferments from
military service so he could study abroad. He didn't have any
problems with the manner in which his local draft board referred to
the African-American when it was granting those requests.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1956, after King returned home to Albany, Ga., from his
studies, he received another notice from the draft board. This
correspondence addressed him as ``Preston,'' not as ``Mr. King.''
</P>
<P>
   This use of the man's given name reportedly held unpleasant
racial implications, particularly for a Southern black. Apparently
the all-white draft board wasn't aware of King's race when it
granted the first two deferments, but now that its members knew he
was black, it used his first name as a way of exhibiting disrespect
for him.
</P>
<P>
   King reacted by notifying the board that he would refuse to
respond to any further correspondence that addressed him as
``Preston.'' In 1958, the 22-year-old went back overseas to
continue his postgraduate studies at the London School of
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The next trip home, in 1960, was consequence time. He was
arrested and tried before Judge William Bootle. The jury convicted
King of draft dodging, and Bootle sentenced him to 18 months in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   King never served a day _ in the military or in jail. Out on
bail while the case was being appealed, King abruptly fled to
England in 1961, where he lives comfortably to this day.
</P>
<P>
   While King worked to build a life and a career as a political
theorist in England, hundreds of thousands of American men answered
the call to duty when their local draft boards sent out those
``Dear Preston'' letters. They were called by a lot of names other
than the ones their mamas gave them as they grunted and strained
and sweated their way through basic training. On the good days,
they were called ``Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of them died in the jungles of Vietnam while
King was ascending the ladder of success. Their arrivals back home
didn't draw crowds, didn't result in the hero's welcome that King
received last week, although they were so much more deserving of
the honors.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things were unfair in the United States in the late
'50s and early '60s for people of color. The nation stood at the
cusp of the civil rights upheaval that, without question, needed to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the assertions of King's supporters through the
years, there was nothing unfair about the charge of draft dodging
leveled against him. He willfully refused to respond to his call to
duty. Call it civil disobedience if you like, or _ as King has
asserted _ staying true to his convictions. In this case, the
conviction had nothing to do with abhorrence of war or a religious
prohibition against violence. His conviction required being treated
with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, as long as one accepts the consequences
of one's actions. The consequence of King's refusal to serve was
jail time. The consequence of fleeing justice was not being able to
come home without risking arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence for 58,000 people whose convictions meant
serving their country when called was an early death in a distant
land.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the situation is that if King hadn't come back in
'56, he probably would have qualified under President Carter's
blanket pardon of all draft dodgers in '76. He could have been home
24 years sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Some may view King as a hero for standing up for what he
believed. In my eyes, the true heroes can be found along a
much-too-long black granite wall in Washington.

OLDSMOBILE'S ALERO A WORTHY COMPETITOR TO HONDA ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Introduced just last year as Oldsmobile's import-busting,
mass-market compact sedan, the Alero already has become the choice
for many consumers who otherwise would have bought a Honda Accord,
Nissan Altima, Mazda 626 or other import in this market segment.
</P>
<P>
   My weeklong test drive of the top-of-the-line Alero GLS
immediately followed a week in the Honda Accord, which gave me a
great perspective. The Accord, of course, has been the top choice
of many compact/midsize buyers for more than a decade, and it has
perennially vied with the Ford Taurus and Toyota Camry for the
honors of top-selling car in the U.S. market, having won that
battle on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the driver's seat of the Alero right from the Accord
made a believer out of me: General Motors really has built a car
that is every bit as good as _ and possibly even better than _ some
of its Japanese competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero had a much more solid feel than the Accord, with
roadhandling that was surprisingly nimble and athletic. I almost
couldn't believe I was driving an American sedan, let alone an
Oldsmobile _ one of those GM brands that was known for decades for
its big, boatlike, wallowing sedans that appealed mostly to
consumers beyond retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile began re-inventing itself in the mid-90s with the
introduction of the Aurora premium sedan, which I have said before
is one of the best premium sedans that GM or any other automaker
has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   While the Alero isn't in the same class as the $30,000-plus
Aurora, it is well above the class of some of its competitors in
the compact/midsize segment, including the Nissan Altima,
Mitsubishi Galant, Mazda 626 and Chrysler Cirrus. Although
technically classified by the EPA as a compact because of its
overall interior volume, the Alero offers the roominess and
interior comfort of midsize models such as the Camry, Nissan Maxima
and Volkswagen Passat.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero, which replaced the ho-hum Achieva sedan and is on the
same basic vehicle chassis as the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac
Grand Am, comes well-equipped to compete with just about any car in
the compact segment, including the Infiniti G20 and Volvo S40. It's
certainly a cut above the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, the
closest competitors in the Ford/Lincoln-Mercury lineups.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy less-well-equipped Alero models that compete
head-to-head with the Contour, Mystique and Accord; the base engine
in the Alero GL and GX models is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder similar
to the base engines in the Contour, Accord and Altima. But the GLS
model ($22,095 including transportation) comes with a
170-horsepower, 3.4-liter V-6 engine and leather interior, moving
it up into the higher echelons to compete with the Maxima, Camry,
G20 and S40.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile says that the Alero and other vehicles in its current
lineup, including the midsize Intrigue sedan, Silhouette minivan
and Bravada sport-utility, have helped lower the average age of
Olds buyers by six years. Alero buyers are primarily women,
although I know of no reason why this car should not appeal to men
as well; and up to 50 percent of Alero buyers have told their
dealers that they would have bought an import if the Alero had not
been available. That's an important statistic for GM, because such
``conquest'' sales over imports is GM's primary marketing goal for
the Alero.
</P>
<P>
   What this car signifies most, perhaps, is that family sedan
buyers don't have to compromise on anything to choose the Alero
over an import. This car is a smart buy for saavy consumers who had
believed imports represent the best long-range value.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to dislike about the Alero. My only two gripes
had to do with the trunk. It's large enough to hold 14.7 cubic feet
of stuff, but the opening is somewhat limited, which restricts the
size of objects you can put back there. This is not unique to the
Alero. This is a problem found in many cars in this class. Also,
the trunk on our Alero had a weird catch that would not allow the
trunk to latch without first pushing a button on the side. Perhaps
this is some new kind of safety feature to prevent small children
from accidentally locking themselves in the trunk, but if so, there
is nothing in the Olds literature that mentions it. It was a bit of
a nuisance; if you try to shut the trunk without first pushing this
button, the lid just bounces back up.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of power with the V-6 engine, and the four-speed
automatic transmission shifts smoothly and seamlessly. For 2000,
Olds is offering a five-speed, Getrag manual transmission, but it
is available only with the four-cylinder engine. The GLS model
comes only with the V-6.
</P>
<P>
   Standard GLS equipment includes traction control, manual
air-conditioning, six-way power driver's seat, premium
AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo, leather interior, automatic
headlights, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, power
windows/mirrors/door locks, remote keyless entry, cruise control,
front bucket seats with console shifter, illuminated entry system,
and large (and readable) analog gauges.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-6 are 20 miles per gallon in
the city and 32 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 14.3 gallons of
gasoline, and unleaded regular is recommended.

&HT;     WAYFARERS IN `TUMBLEWEEDS' CARRY PLENTY OF SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of ``Tumbleweeds,'' a mother and daughter hit the
highway in a dusty blue jalopy when mother's fourth husband, a
rangy sort of lout, looks like he's prepping to hit someone.
</P>
<P>
   Mom and kid pack up quickly and drive _ first toward Missouri,
then California, searching for a better dream. But ``Tumbleweeds''
is not a road movie. Despite the car, the Thelma-and-Louise-ish
set-up and over-obvious imagery (thar goes a tumbleweed, rollin' in
the wind), Mary Jo (Janet McTeer) and her pubescent daughter, Ava
(Kimberly Brown), are acting out a different Hollywood fantasy.
They don't find epiphany in the metronomic passage of cracked tar
and motels; they find it at the end of the road, in the warm stasis
of everyday life. It is, in fact, a staying-put movie.
</P>
<P>
   Co-written (with Angela Shelton, based on her memoir) and
directed on a very thin shoestring by Gavin O'Connor,
``Tumbleweeds'' is surprisingly sunny for a film about lost souls.
Perhaps that's because they aren't truly lost: Mary Jo, despite her
affinity for loathsome men, manages to skitter out from under them
before any real damage is done. ``I know what comes next,'' she
says, as her newest fella works himself into a violent rage. Mary
Jo isn't a battered woman, and her daughter isn't abused. The
film's too upbeat to rake that kind of muck.
</P>
<P>
   Once Mary Jo and Ava have landed _ in a seaside idyll called
Star Lake Beach _ they start bumping up against other characters.
Ava makes friends at school, tries out for a part in ``Romeo &AMP;
Juliet'' and embarks on her first date. Mary Jo gets a job and sets
about landing a man. Nothing unfolds with any originality or sudden
eurekas (in fact, the whole thing may remind you of ``Alice Doesn't
Live Here Anymore'' and last year's ``Anywhere But Here''), yet the
film's tender optimism slowly prevails. (Less charming is Dan
Stoloff's pitch-and-yaw cinematography, which uses hand-held
cameras for no apparent purpose except to promote disequilibrium.)
</P>
<P>
   McTeer, whose performance earned her an Oscar nod for best
actress, brings both maturity and a blithe gamine quality to her
young mother burned by life. From the start it's clear that Ava,
not Mary Jo, is the grown-up here; Ava yearns to be settled, to
make a home and community, while Mary Jo drags them from state to
state and man to man.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the beauty of ``Tumbleweeds,'' the reason we care at all, is
that Mary Jo is also allowed to be a sensible, loving mother.
There's wisdom in her, whether she's teaching her daughter how to
kiss (with shiny red apples: ``Oh, Adam!'' smack, smack, smack) or
protecting her from Mary Jo's latest lunk of a beau. (``The future
ex-husband,'' Eva calls him.)
</P>
<P>
   What fine moments there are. Ava, clucking loudly at her pet
mouse while mom flirts with a friendly trucker; Mary Jo, stroking
Ava's head after a car thief snatches all their worldly goods; Mary
Jo and Ava, dancing like pagans after Ava gets her period.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer owes much to her young co-star, and it's a shame that
Brown didn't earn an Oscar nomination as well. She deserved one,
not for acting up a storm but the opposite _ for pacing so
naturally along the tightrope between childishness and precocious
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The cast's other stand-outs are Jay O. Sanders, who exhales
kindness as a friendly co-worker, and the
always-elfishly-interesting Michael J. Pollard as a ``short,
patronizin', peekin' pervert'' who serves as Mary Jo's boss. The
director himself appears as Mary Jo's California boyfriend, Jack,
to which he brings a cool, heavy-lidded arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   If the plot peters out near the end, the film's air of
hopefulness lingers; it's hard to condemn a movie for narrative
drawbacks when its characters are so well-etched and so damnably
sympathetic. ``Tumbleweeds'' is a small, imperfect and derivative,
but it's got a big fat thumper of a heart.

&HT;     AFTER DIALLO CASE, A FRIEND IN BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOAN STEINAU LESTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ I suddenly noticed the flashing lights
through my rear-view window as the police car came up behind me. I
pulled to the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling down my window, I saw a baby-faced young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how fast you were going?'' he asked me sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty,'' I replied as tears began to well.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been gathering since I'd dropped my son, his wife and
their baby daughter at the San Francisco airport a half hour ago.
Malcolm left my home at age 8 to live with his father. In the
decades since, whenever we part I feel a sudden tug of pain,
reminding me how hard it was to say goodbye each time we ended his
childhood visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 25-mile zone,'' he said. ``License and registration
please.''
</P>
<P>
   My tears began to flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a minute,'' I said. And started to sob. He looked at me,
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still a good person. It's not as if you robbed a
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   I cried harder while he continued to reassure me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I was able to see through my tears and reach into the
glove compartment for the manila envelope that had held these
documents so many years, awaiting a moment like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' the young man said kindly. ``You're still a good
person.''
</P>
<P>
   He took my papers and retreated to his car, while I sat and
sobbed. Soon I noticed him behind my car, writing the ticket. I
flashed on an image: What if it were Malcolm being stopped? Would
he be treated as sweetly as I _ a gray-haired white granny speeding
home to the Berkeley hills _ or would his visibly African-American
face bring another response, the kind received so often by my
dark-skinned friends?
</P>
<P>
   I've heard too many stories, firsthand, and worried for years
about Malcolm and the police. Light-skinned though he is, he could
easily be a target. My sobs increased.
</P>
<P>
   When the officer came to give me the ticket, I was still crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a good person,'' he repeated with great concern. ``It
happens to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He held up his right hand in a swearing-the-truth gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even me. I've gotten a speeding ticket. We all do. It's OK,''
he smiled at me.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to smile back, sobbing weakly. ``I guess it's good it
happened. I never knew this straight-away on Marin was a 25-mile
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children here; we've had complaints,'' he said. ``We
try to keep a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained what would happen: I'd get a ticket in the mail and
have to pay bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bail?'' I said, shocked that so many years after my life of
protest demonstrations that word could still apply to me. I might
not need to go to traffic school, he explained, since ``at your
age,'' he smiled indulgently, ``your insurance probably wouldn't
rise. Check with your insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Before we parted, as I sniffled a bit, he said once more,
``Remember, you're still a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   In farewell, I heard myself saying words that I never thought my
'60s-hardened heart could ever utter to a cop. Not after what I've
seen, and what I've heard. Melting under his kindness, I said,
``Thanks. I love the Berkeley police.''
</P>
<P>
   And I drove slowly away, praying that my son could say words to
the same effect next time he gets stopped by the police _ here, in
New York City, or anywhere else in these United States. After the
Diallo verdict, I'm increasing my prayers.

 &HT;    WHAT'S IN A NAME? FOR WOMEN IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, IT'S 'OVA'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scan the entertainment sections of any Czech magazine or
newspaper and you'll find Julia Robertsova and Meryl Streepova, not
Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   In Czech and other Slavic languages, the suffix ``ova'' is added
to the last names of all females. It's an ending long-ingrained in
the vernacular that quite literally means ``belonging to'' the
male, as in belonging to a woman's father or husband. (In English,
``ova'' is plural for ``ovum,'' a female egg cell.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any American feminist wince. But Europe _
and especially Central Europe _ has long fought against
American-style political correctness, a term often derided as
describing a tortured sensitivity resulting in ridiculous changes
to the language.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, even in post-Communist countries like
the Czech Republic, meaning the use of the suffix ``ova'' may soon
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation recently proposed by the Czech Republic's Ministry
of Interior would enable a woman to remove the suffix from her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, the legislation is expected
to pass and could take effect by the end of the year. They insist
the impetus for the proposal is not a rise in complaints, but is
simply the result of a changing world in which women are seeking
more control.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Kavkova, who runs Relocation Management International, a
Prague-based firm that helps companies relocate to the Czech
Republic, said some women have started to consider the use of
``ova'' demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they use it reluctantly because they accept it as part of
life here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, language is not as scrutinized in Europe as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, people who deliver the mail are still
called postmen, even if they are women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though British Prime Minister Tony Blair often speaks
out in favor of women's rights, no one bats an eye that the female
members of Parliament belonging to his Labor Party are popularly
referred to in the press as ``Blair's babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Czech Republic is even more traditional than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, the kind of country in which high-level
female involvement in business or government is rarely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic there are no women in the Cabinet, whereas
in Sweden, 12 of 20 Cabinet positions are occupied by women.
</P>
<P>
   But many post-Communist countries are introducing laws these
days to put them in line with the European Union, which they aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, legislation to combat sexual harassment
was recently proposed following the publishing of a study by the
daily, Lidove Noviny, indicating that almost half of the country's
working women had been sexually harassed in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Zuzana Roithova, one of just nine female members in the
81-member Senate, said Czech women have been slow to push for more
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family life is more important to many than their
rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women right's advocates said it's no surprise then that the
Czech government is just now considering giving women the option of
removing the suffix ``ova'' from their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not so popular in post-Communist countries as it
is elsewhere,'' said Jirina Ciklova, founder of the Center for
Gender Studies in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this new proposal is a positive one and that, as a
result, many women, at least many of those from the younger
generation, will change their names,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ciklova said, however, the change may not go over so well with
older women, who favor the suffix for making it immediately clear
whether someone is male or female.
</P>
<P>
   Even she agreed that some Czech names just won't sound right
without the ``ova.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she pondered, ``Can you imagine saying Martina
Navratil, instead of Martina Navratilova?'' She certainly can't.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ It came in a newspaper advertisement, but it
jolted Lebanon like a flashback from a forgotten nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a former member of a Christian militia took out ads
apologizing for war crimes during the 15-year civil war that ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize, apologize to all those whose executioner
I was or who were my victims,'' wrote Assaad(CQ) Shaftari. ``I
apologize for the ugliness of the war and what I did during the
civil war in the name of Lebanon, the 'cause' or 'Christianity.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope,'' he wrote, ``is that my call be understood as the
only way out of the Lebanese ordeal. Souls will then be purified of
hatred and rancor, from the pain of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari was an officer in the Lebanese Forces, the largest
Christian militia in the bloody sectarian fighting. He was high up,
though not in the top tier of Lebanon's war-makers.
</P>
<P>
   His ads were not the only reminder of a war many want to forget.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Lebanese government formed a committee to
determine the fate of 17,000 people who ``disappeared'' during the
long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even as hundreds of Beirut buildings still stand as
artillery-riddled shells, many Lebanese have adopted what they call
an ``amnesia'' about the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon still has no national war memorial for the tens of
thousands who died. Those involved gave themselves a blanket
amnesty for war crimes in 1992, and stayed in influential
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese here call the war the ``War of the Others,''
implying that responsibility lies with the Israeli, American,
Syrian or other armies that trooped through between 1975 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the lobby of a posh Beirut hotel, Shaftari spoke
with three foreign journalists for the first time since the
apology. Dressed in a dark blue suit and tie, with a white sweater
vest, the balding 44-year-old looked like the electrical engineer
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say it was the 'War of the Others,''' he said. ``It
was our real war.''
</P>
<P>
   But, there has been little effort to assess blame for the
massacres and destruction that took place. There is no talk of a
truth commission, as was used in South Africa or Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the war still wield power, sit in parliament or
occupy government ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no power base from which to launch this cleansing,''
said Paul Salem, a political analyst and candidate for the Lebanese
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the political reluctance to cast blame on the
powerful, many average Lebanese want to focus on rebuilding, rather
than the days of horrifying shellings and kidnappings. At the same
time, they remember who their enemies were and hold grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Salem and others believe it would be helpful to sort out the
ugly past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is a need in terms of social society and
rebuilding trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari said he was not a fighter in the war. He was a
commander whose orders lead to deaths. He would not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot. You don't want to know,'' he said, raising his
eyebrows. ``There is no difference between one and 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Shaftari was deputy leader of his militia.
</P>
<P>
   History records both sides committing civilian massacres, but
some of the most notorious belong to the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Black Saturday'' in 1975, Christians seized from the
streets and executed about 350 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari's boss, Elie Hobeika, was blamed for leading the
killing of more than 700 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps in 1982. That killing became notorious because
Israeli troops watched from a rooftop and aided with illumination
flares.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 years, Shaftari became involved with a European
peace group his wife, Marie, introduced to him.
</P>
<P>
   He said a tell-all book recently published by one of Hobeika's
bodyguards was too seedy and commercial a way to address the war.
He wanted to set an example for real reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored an immense blow in favor of memory,'' wrote
political commentator Michael Young in Beirut's Daily Star
newspaper. ``Lebanon has been built on a foundation of
state-sponsored amnesia. Yet, in a few hundred words, a former
militiaman exposed this as inane, disclosing how foul the wartime
legacy could be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, not all are as quick to praise Shaftari.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe him. He is a liar,'' said Subhiya Faris, 55,
whose husband and three sons have been missing since they were
taken from their car by Christian forces in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she joins about 35 other relatives of the missing who
demonstrate outside a government building once a week. They want to
know officially what happened to their loved ones, though most
figure they are likely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our constant struggle we have been able to bring about an
official admission that there is an issue of the kidnapped,'' said
Wadad Helwani, leader of the families group.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Mustafa, was taken from her home in 1982 by men who
claimed to be with the Lebanese military. He was a teacher, active
with the Lebanese communists. He also organized neighborhood bomb
shelters and neighborhood support programs during the 1982 Israeli
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks her husband was probably killed, but she and the
other survivors want the government to find out for sure. Until
that happens, apologies from people like Shaftari will not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough for him to apologize,'' she said. ``He has to
ask to be forgiven.''

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY'S SCARY AIR: CLEANER, BUT STILL FILTHY
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Shortly after the dawn of the new year, Mexican
authorities here proudly announced that in 1999 Mexico City had
experienced the cleanest air in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the city was choking on those words.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most polluted metropolises was again shrouded
in smog that clogged nasal passages, stung eyes and made throats
raw. For a few days in early February schools in the southeastern
part of the city were ordered to keep kids indoors to reduce risks
to their young, developing lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted mostly by skyrocketing levels of suspended particles _
microscopic solids in the air _ the government ordered some
industries to cut production by half, and used emergency laws to
pull more old cars off the roads. Officials completely shut down
more than 150 brick-making factories known to sometimes illegally
use old rubber tires as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   People crowded into emergency rooms with respiratory illnesses
as the levels of suspended particles soared to well more than
double what's acceptable for human health. Forest fires near the
city also contributed to the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that more than a decade's worth of reforms have
helped reduce some aspects of classic air pollution, said Adrian
Fernandez, the director-general of information and measurement
programs for Mexico's National Ecology Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like to act too triumphant,'' he hastened to add.
``There is so much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City and the Greater Valley of Mexico are cursed by a
ring of mountains that trap pollution inside a bowl teeming with
18.5 million people, 4.5 million vehicles and tens of thousands of
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are exposed to a sickening stew of car exhaust and
industrial emissions. Add to that the ingredients of soil blowing
from vast tracts of unpaved land and wind-borne fecal matter
dropped by legions of street dogs. The region's bone-dry winter air
makes pollution even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Relief usually comes only with the spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the World Resources Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based research group, estimated that Mexico City
may have the world's worst air for children under 5 years of age.
Researchers here are studying the damage pollution causes to kids;
meanwhile those residents who have the foresight and income buy air
filters and limit their kids' outdoors activities.
</P>
<P>
   When air pollution here began approaching apocalyptic levels in
the late 1980s, Mexico established one of the world's most
sophisticated pollution-monitoring systems and began to enact a
series of reforms. Last year, Fernandez said, measurements showed
that action had indeed paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Major contaminants like carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur
dioxide had dropped within normal levels with only a few exceptions
during 1999. As a result, the city experienced only five days of
full-fledged emergencies last year.
</P>
<P>
   What helped, Fernandez said, was the phasing out of leaded
gasoline use in Mexico. It was completely eliminated in 1997. Heavy
industrial oil, too, contains a third less sulphur now. Two power
plants and a number of other industries in the metropolitan area
have switched to the less-polluting natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   All cars produced in Mexico since 1991 have catalytic
converters. Because many Mexicans can't afford new cars, however,
only about 40 percent of vehicles are equipped with the
pollution-reducing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's 11-year-old ``Today You Can't Drive'' law pulls about
20 percent of the city's older cars off the streets every day. Five
years ago, officials decided to double the program whenever
pollution levels skyrocket as they did earlier this year, pulling
about 40 percent of old cars off the road during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, Fernandez said, is that ozone _ the product of
fuel emissions and sunlight - is still an alarming health hazard.
Ozone peaked and remained for several hours at levels considered
well above the healthy norm almost every day last year, Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone irritates noses, throats and eyes. People with colds, the
flu or chronic respiratory problems suffer diminished lung capacity
that leaves them gasping for air. When ozone is strong, illnesses
are prolonged and doctors report a higher number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day here seems more difficult, especially in the
winter,'' said Altagracia Flores, who is highly exposed to car
fumes six days a week in Mexico City while she sells newspapers at
a curbside stand. ``I've had a cold at least two times a month
recently and every day my eyes feel irritated. Headaches at this
time of year are also more common.''
</P>
<P>
   The other contaminant that still plagues Mexico City's air at
dangerously high levels are suspended particles, the product of
vehicle and industrial fuel emissions, dog droppings and soil
erosion from barren open space that's devoid of trees or grass.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended particles lodge in the lungs and cause acute or
chronic respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reforestation projects have helped reduce suspended particles
originating from soil, Fernandez said, but the city still needs to
do more work to fill in bare patches of land.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico City started a crackdown on pet poop, but
disregard for the law is more common than compliance. And with more
than a million stray dogs roaming the city, it's hard for
maintenance workers to keep pace with the refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said ozone and suspended particles should decline as
more industries and vehicles in Mexico City convert to using
natural gas. Two large natural-gas underground distribution centers
are under construction now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to have a very positive effect,'' he said. ``In
five years, about 90 percent of medium and big industries will be
using natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, say the prediction is a wild one. At current,
only 12 percent of factories in the Valley of Mexico use natural
gas and two centers won't be enough to fulfill the needs of the
rest, said Luis Manuel Guerra, director of the non-governmental
National Institute of Ecological Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be at least 100 centers,'' said Guerra, a
long-time critic of the government who believes it has moved too
slowly and too inefficiently to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
   If the government really wants to get serious about pollution,
he said, federal and city officials should team up to convert the
city's crazy-quilt system of above-ground mass transit to buses and
taxis that use natural gas. Right now, thousands of the
privately-owned mini-buses that careen through the city are some of
the worst contaminators.
</P>
<P>
   It costs at least $3,000 to convert a vehicle's gas tank to one
that can use natural gas, Guerra said. But the investment can be
recouped within a few months because the price of natural gas is
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Fernandez said, natural gas is heavily taxed in
Mexico, making it hard to persuade industries or vehicles to
convert. He's been wrestling with Mexico's Treasury Department over
proposals to reform the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra also suggested the government invest in the construction
of artificial lakes near clusters of industries so the humidity
could help capture suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guerra and Fernandez agree that more enforcement of Mexico
City's existing environmental laws is also a must.
</P>
<P>
   At least half a million of the 4.5 million vehicles circulating
in the city haven't gone through mandatory smog-control testing,
Fernandez said. Mexico recently gave regular police, rather than
special environmental officers, the power to crack down on this
massive flaunting of the law.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL MEN HOLD KEY TO PUTIN'S POLICIES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Imagine a presidential campaign without television ads
or tour buses, and a platform that arrives only after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe for disaster? Maybe in America. But in Russia this
strategy has kept acting President Vladimir Putin the runaway
favorite in the upcoming March 26 elections, when the world's
second-largest nuclear power is scheduled to elect a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Like Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, Putin has
made no bones about drawing policy plans from a tight group of
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers here say these men _ who to a large extent
are Putin's former college friends or colleagues and currently hold
key posts in his government _ are particularly important to
divining what Putin, a 47-year-old former KGB officer and political
novice, stands for.
</P>
<P>
   It is also these men whom Putin will pick to run the next
government, making them key figures to watch to determine how
Russia will develop policies at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is often described as a good manager that knows how to
select people and muster political will to get things done,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, the head of the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
``First, he needs to get elected. When that happens, he'll have a
proven group of men to run the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Putin has drawn around him have a common profile: Most
are men who have studied law, are in their late-30's or early 40's
and hail from the candidate's hometown, St. Petersburg. Among these
are Putin's Chief of Staff Dmitry Kosak, 41; Dmitry Medvedev, 34,
Putin's campaign chief; and the head of the Federal Security
Bureau, 48-year-old Nikolai Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
   However, the one man within Putin's circle who has an entirely
different background from the leader is the person tapped to become
Putin's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kasyanov, who has worked in the Ministry of Finance
since 1993, is a Moscow native with a post-graduate degree in
economics. A stocky, blond-haired man who speaks fluent English, he
currently is Russia's first deputy prime minister, and in that
position takes over the reins of government when Putin is out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin insiders say Kasyanov, 42, caught Putin's eye after
after the minister successfully negotiated a $10.6 billion debt
relief package for Russia in February. It was a deal extremely
important for the health of the country's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kasyanov meets all the requirements needed (in a prime
minister). He's experienced in domestic and international politics,
he's a consummate professional, he has no political ambitions and
he has a head on his shoulders,'' said Igor Bunin, the director of
the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Second in line after Kasyanov is Ilya Klebanov, 49, a close
friend Putin appointed deputy prime minister in charge of defense
last May. An experienced businessman who was chief executive at a
weapons-building company, Klebanov has been cited as one of
Russia's best mangers.
</P>
<P>
   In his current position, Klebanov travels abroad frequently to
negotiate military and trade deals with Russian allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's economic revival is one of Putin's buzzwords.
(Klebanov) knows what it takes to run a business, and Putin likes
his real world experience,'' a St. Petersburg-based friend of both
men said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In December, before becoming acting president, Putin established
an economic think tank charged with creating a 10-year economic
development plan for the country, a plan he made clear he would
adopt if he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization has yet to publicize the strategy (and
says it won't until after the elections), the president of the
think tank, German Gref, 36, is expected to become Putin's
Economics Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Gref and Putin have worked together since 1993, when they both
were members of the St. Petersburg city government. Gref, a nappy
dresser who sports a trimmed goatee beard, relocated to Moscow in
1998 when he became the deputy chairman of the State Property
Committee, the government agency in charge of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his economic views as moderately liberal, favoring
lower taxes and reform in Russia's aging industrial sector. These
ideas, he said would be spelled out in the 10-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) should be strong so that it can rather quickly
and effectively spell out new rules of the game ... rules of ethics
and taxes ... and ensure all citizens and market participants
followed these rules,'' Gref said in a Feb. 23 speech.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all cabinet positions will go to Putin's
entourage. Current Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is expected to stay
on in his position. The acting president is thought to favor a new
man to head the Defense Ministry, Valentin Bobryshev, the
55-year-old former commander of Russia's Southern Army Group.
</P>
<P>
   This mixture of experienced officials and new bureaucrats is one
strategy Putin's campaign staff is quick to tell reporters that
their candidate likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in favor of step-by-step reforms in the economy, while
revolutionizing the inner workings of the Russian government,''
said Mikhail Margelov, a Putin campaign consultant. ``We have a man
who wants to end corruption by making government more vertically
integrated and more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Putin's circle gets high marks from Western
business and political circles, the lack of detail they have given
Russian voters has made skeptics of some at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The team's) public pronouncements are pathetic in their lack
of detail. The words could mean one thing, or they could be a
liberal smoke screen,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, a Moscow-based
political analyst.

 &HT;    WHAT'S IN A NAME? FOR WOMEN IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, IT'S 'OVA'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scan the entertainment sections of any Czech magazine or
newspaper and you'll find Julia Robertsova and Meryl Streepova, not
Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   In Czech and some other Slavic languages, the suffix ``ova'' is
added to the last names of all females. It's an ending
long-ingrained in the vernacular that quite literally means
``belonging to'' the male, as in belonging to a woman's father or
husband. (In English, ``ova'' is plural for ``ovum,'' a female egg
cell.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make any American feminist wince. But Europe _
and especially Central Europe _ has long fought against
American-style political correctness, a term often derided as
describing a tortured sensitivity resulting in ridiculous changes
to the language.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, even in post-Communist countries like
the Czech Republic, meaning the use of the suffix ``ova'' may soon
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation recently proposed by the Czech Republic's Ministry
of Interior would enable a woman to remove the suffix from her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, the legislation is expected
to pass and could take effect by the end of the year. They insist
the impetus for the proposal is not a rise in complaints, but is
simply the result of a changing world in which women are seeking
more control.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Kavkova, who runs Relocation Management International, a
Prague-based firm that helps companies relocate to the Czech
Republic, said some women have started to consider the use of
``ova'' demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they use it reluctantly because they accept it as part of
life here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, language is not as scrutinized in Europe as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, people who deliver the mail are still
called postmen, even if they are women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though British Prime Minister Tony Blair often speaks
out in favor of women's rights, no one bats an eye that the female
members of Parliament belonging to his Labor Party are popularly
referred to in the press as ``Blair's babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Czech Republic is even more traditional than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, the kind of country in which high-level
female involvement in business or government is rarely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic there are no women in the Cabinet, whereas
in Sweden, 12 of 20 Cabinet positions are occupied by women.
</P>
<P>
   But many post-Communist countries are introducing laws these
days to put them in line with the European Union, which they aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, legislation to combat sexual harassment
was recently proposed following the publishing of a study by the
daily, Lidove Noviny, indicating that almost half of the country's
working women had been sexually harassed in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Zuzana Roithova, one of just nine female members in the
81-member Senate, said Czech women have been slow to push for more
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good family life is more important to many than their
rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women right's advocates said it's no surprise then that the
Czech government is just now considering giving women the option of
removing the suffix ``ova'' from their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not so popular in post-Communist countries as it
is elsewhere,'' said Jirina Ciklova, founder of the Center for
Gender Studies in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this new proposal is a positive one and that, as a
result, many women, at least many of those from the younger
generation, will change their names,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ciklova said, however, the change may not go over so well with
older women, who favor the suffix for making it immediately clear
whether someone is male or female.
</P>
<P>
   Even she agreed that some Czech names just won't sound right
without the ``ova.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she pondered, ``Can you imagine saying Martina
Navratil, instead of Martina Navratilova?'' She certainly can't.
</P>

lower taxes and reform in Russia's aging industrial sector. These
ideas, he said would be spelled out in the 10-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) should be strong so that it can rather quickly
and effectively spell out new rules of the game ... rules of ethics
and taxes ... and ensure all citizens and market participants
followed these rules,'' Gref said in a Feb. 23 speech.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all cabinet positions will go to Putin's
entourage. Current Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is expected to stay
on in his position. The acting president is thought to favor a new
man to head the Defense Ministry, Valentin Bobryshev, the
55-year-old former commander of Russia's Southern Army Group.
</P>
<P>
   This mixture of experienced officials and new bureaucrats is one
strategy Putin's campaign staff is quick to tell reporters that
their candidate likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in favor of step-by-step reforms in the economy, while
revolutionizing the inner workings of the Russian government,''
said Mikhail Margelov, a Putin campaign consultant. ``We have a man
who wants to end corruption by making government more vertically
integrated and more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Putin's circle gets high marks from Western
business and political circles, the lack of detail they have given
Russian voters has made skeptics of some at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The team's) public pronouncements are pathetic in their lack
of detail. The words could mean one thing, or they could be a
liberal smoke screen,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, a Moscow-based
political analyst.

&HT;     `PLANET': HARD-CORE DISAPPOINTMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   In another universe _ though it is difficult to imagine which
one _ Garry Shandling might be sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Earth, he's a mensch who presumably posted high SAT
scores. He has a face women are compelled to slap. His pursed lips
and constant squint double as a lewd come-on, the kind of
expression you'd dread looking up from a drink to see staring at
you from the other end of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The eventually flat joke in ``What Planet Are You From?'' is not
simply that Shandling appeals to women sexually, but that, with his
metallic, vibrating penis, he's God's extraterrestrial gift to the
fairer sex. Harold, Shandling's hyperadvanced species of man from
outer space, marries Susan (Annette Bening), a lovelorn real estate
agent he spies at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Their unending
honeymoon so wipes her out that she finally tells Harold, ``I had
so many orgasms some of them are stacked up waiting to land.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in an alien-sex farce could Shandling inspire a woman to
deliver a line like that. And Bening plays it for the
mock-breakthrough that it is. Though while it's not saying much,
``What Planet Are You From?'' is light years funnier than its
predecessors _ ``Earth Girls Are Easy,'' ``My Stepmother Is an
Alien'' or ``Starman.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film gives up on Shandling's slut from outer space,
stooping to domestic doldrums that soon drub a misogynistic, if
nebbish, sex machine into a loving husband whose name you'd have no
problem believing is Harold.
</P>
<P>
   The last shot of this movie _ which was directed by Mike
Nichols, written by Shandling and ``War of the Roses'' adapter
Michael Leeson (and revised by two other male writers) _ is a
dispiriting image of married nonbliss. Driving into the sunset
crammed into a new Volkswagen Beetle, Harold and Susan are
bickering like the Jetsons. Harold had bigger things in mind: He
was given a special penis and a mission by Grayden (Ben Kingsley),
his leader, to travel to Earth to impregnate a woman and bring the
kid back to breed more. When he arrives on Earth _ hurtling as a
ball of light into the restroom of an airplane in mid-flight _ he
uses his one-track mind to get close enough to a woman to ask her
if she'd like to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Back on his home planet, where the men have evolved beyond the
need to procreate, Harold (whose real name is ``H1449-6'') had
reached a personal best of 10 seconds of conversation before asking
a stranger, ``Can I put my penis in you?''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, where the film is set, he does somewhat better,
scoring with a stewardess and topless dancer (not at the same time;
this movie is many things, kinky is not one of them). He takes in
Corporate America and hangs out with the office Lothario, played by
Greg Kinnear as a frat-boyish game-show host with good lines. He
takes Harold to meet women at AA.
</P>
<P>
   That buzzing sound emanating from Harold's crotch is the
cleverest bit of mischief this movie ever gets up to. It's a
brilliant sound gag, but wears out its welcome as soon as you
realize it's all the film has to offer. Before the film bifurcates
into a distracting chase story that has John Goodman as an Federal
Aviation Administration agent trying to sleuth the in-air
disturbances, ``What Planet Are You From'' is relentless as it
wrist-slaps much-lampooned male behavior. It leans heavily on
Harold's vibrator, which goes off whenever he gets aroused, which
is pretty much all the time, and on Shandling's manic discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols has yet to meet a male in crisis he can't distrust. But
whatever cockeyed, fretful probing he was up to in cynical caveats
like ``The Graduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge'' gave way to paranoia
and suspicion from a decidedly female perspective in ``Silkwood''
and ``Working Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Nichols has fully divested himself of the darker
satirical edges in his chronicles of the difference between what a
girl wants and what a man wants to give her. Now his movies _
``Wolf'' and ``The Birdcage,'' for example _ come in adult pinks
and blues. When ``Planet'' tries to see things from Susan's
perspective, it feels obligatory. She's a doting pleaser, while her
girlfriends _ two of whom are played big and incisively by Camryn
Manheim and Nora Dunn _ are amusing harridans who may as well be
from Venus, or at least Oprah's studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The opening minutes set on Harold's planet are hysterical
evocations of absurdist mockeries like Woody Allen's ``Sleeper.''
Shandling's minimalist slapstick is as funny as Allen's. But when
Nichols comes to Earth, the film's angle on men gets broad like Mel
Brooks revising Neil Labute's ``Your Friends and Neighbors.''
Putting a goatee on cuddly Kinnear, for example, doesn't make him a
jerk, per se. It just certifies the fact that as insipid sex
comedies go, this one's pretty limp.

 WHAT THE NEW PRESIDENTS OF RUSSIA and THE USA WILL HAVE TO LEARN

distinguished monthly commentaries. To publish as a ``separate

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-798-0970; fax, By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In Russia, the March 26 presidential election offers no
alternatives. It seems that Vladimir Putin, the acting president,
has an obvious advantage. I know Putin. He is an intelligent and
serious man. But to hold any position on him, it is necessary to
see more: who he relies upon and in what manner he works and which
goals he sets. As yet, none of this is clear.
 &HT;    I make no secret of the fact that I regret that former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov pulled out of the race.
 &HT;    I had spent two years trying to persuade everyone and myself
that he would be the best choice for president. Primakov is well
known in Russia and the West and that is a very important
qualification.
 &HT;    More importantly, if Primakov, whom I have always supported,
were participating in the election today, at least he would pose an
alternative. But Primakov was unable to withstand the ordeal of
what the Kremlin-controlled media did to him during the
parliamentary election campaigns _ the blatant smear tactics. We
must call things by their names: His knees simply gave way.
 &HT;    Now, from my knowledge of all the candidates in the race, I
would say that critical questions must be asked of all of them,
primarily Putin. Nothing is known about the foundations of his
program. But as to the issues, and what must and must not be done,
certain things are quite clear.
 &HT;    First, dictatorship is impossible in Russia anymore under any
regime in the Kremlin, Putin's or anybody else's. This is the point
everyone raises, the question I am always asked, especially by
people in the West: Is it possible that Russia will turn back? No.
 &HT;    What I would say is that a system of effective authority is
needed, that law and order are needed; but that such an imperative
should not be confused with a dictatorship.
 &HT;    Today's political leaders are being confronted with new problems
for which they are unprepared and have no solutions _ not only in
Russia but also in the West. The confrontation of opposing blocs
has ended, the Warsaw Pact organization has dissolved and many new
independent states have appeared. We have lost the system of
relations that previously held the world together and organized it,
however defective that system was.
 &HT;    As yet there is no good replacement. We now have ``goods'' that
seem as threatening as evils. For example, freed from the threat of
a nuclear nightmare that hung over everyone's head during the Cold
War, and freed from the discipline imposed by each of the rival
blocs during that time, every country finds that it now possesses a
certain new freedom of action. And yet nowhere, despite this
``freedom,'' do we see nations fostering truly genuine democratic
and peaceful international relations.
 &HT;    The United States viewed the end of the Cold War as essentially
the removal of obstacles on the road to achieving longstanding
goals of American policy. Even though the United States spoke about
a new world order, it essentially meant a continuation of its own
policies. The existing order in world economic affairs was
essentially to Washington's liking.
 &HT;    And so, in this new century, while the Cold War on the whole has
passed into history, its legacy and many of its elements have
persisted, although in changed form. We still have the concept
that, somehow, the West ``won'' and Russia ``lost.'' No wonder,
with such viewpoints, the two ``partners'' are not closer than they
are.
 &HT;    Both Russia and the United States are on the eve of presidential
elections, but there is fear and tension. What does Washington have
in store for us? ask Russians who have become disappointed with the
West's promises and fiercely loyal to their own heritage. In turn,
the West tries to analyze whether Putin, or er the Berlin Wall has come down, why the
fact that the world has become pluralistic is not a greater cause
for celebration and respect and trust. Instead, the idea of various
``dangers'' coming from the East is expressed in Western
publications and sometimes in the speeches of Western political
leaders.
 &HT;    Still, Russia will not go back.
 &HT;    It is true that instead of the euphoria of 1989-90, a certain
pessimism has set in. In Russia and the former republics, any
leftover memories of that ``new world order'' are being considered
either a myth or a utopian idea.
 &HT;    But for an authoritarian or totalitarian system to flourish, as
we in the Soviet Union very well knew, there must be more _
something more sinister than disappointment. There must be closed,
secretive behavior relative to the outside world. When a regime
tightens the reins on its own population and uses any form of
coercion it desires, one result is that it will choose
confrontation as the most comfortable foreign policy.
 &HT;    And so it will be incumbent upon the two new presidents _ those
of Russia and the United States _ to raise to a qualitatively new
level the kind of international dialogue that played an
irreplaceable role in ending the Cold War. Without democratization
of international relations, we cannot arrive at any new, genuinely
peaceful world order.
 &HT;    Our people must hold the politicians precisely to these goals.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' is a filthy kick in the pants to the people of
Verplanck, N.Y. It's an intermittently funny assault on a place
that's never bothered anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bad haircuts, bad manners and bad vaguely Eastern
accents, it beats taking another billy club to the South. But the
actors crowded around this black comedy are having a grand old time
playing stupid, playing cheap and, in Bette Midler's case, playing
dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the shrew of the movie's title, she drives her Yugo into a
lake during the early minutes and spends the rest of movie in
flashbacks from the perspective of the town's elated,
guilty-looking characters who try to explain her death to the
sheriff (Danny DeVito). Midler, meanwhile, appears to be having a
flashback of her own to her ``Ruthless People'' days. But her Mona
looks so much like a woman whose breath stinks of Newports and Bud,
you believe that when she's standing beneath the summer sun on her
front lawn you can smell her sweat. Then everything around her is
remarkably stinky, including the story by Peter Steinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   As irrelevantly mixed-and-matched as the circumstances
surrounding ``Drowning Mona'' are, there's also some fine
tangential dialogue. In accordance with a flick about trash, the
lines here are practically thrown away in the cadences of normal
conversation as though the actors say such reliably stupid things
every day. Casey Affleck and William Fitchner do this most
adroitly. Affleck plays Bobby, the nice kid who runs a landscaping
business with Mona's dolt son (Marcus Thomas) and is engaged to the
sheriff's little girl (Neve Campbell). Softand understated in a
blond wig, he looks like a prematurely aged Gerber baby with the
baked intonations of a surfer. Fitchner is Mona's husband, who's
been hen-pecked into an affair with an equally shrill waitress
(Jamie Lee Curtis). With his bug-eyes, he's hapless, but
insinuating enough to play the live-action version of ``Simpsons''
barkeep Moe.
</P>
<P>
   Director Nick Gomez applies the same grittiness to these corny
backwoods machinations that he's brought to ``New Jersey Drive''
and episodes of ``The Sopranos.'' He also shows flourishes for
satire _ tattered American flags, a strategically placed
home-version of ``Wheel of Fortune.'' But what is he supposed to do
with them? There's nothing else here to lampoon than more poor,
classless folks.
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Alexander Payne (``Citizen Ruth,'' ``Election'')
may have found something redemptive in ``Mona'' rather than
encourage the cast to play this dumb. And, like most American
actors, the ones here tear into white-trash comedies the way some
Brits do their Shakespeare _ like they're starving. In this case,
blame the hair. There are enough mullets to win this movie a
Stanley Cup.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: No allergic reaction to game
warden
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A group of us _ a couple of women, a couple of
guys _ were sitting in the waiting room to see the allergy doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, if you sit in the waiting room of the allergy
doctor long enough, you're likely to see most everybody you know.
</P>
<P>
   We've got trees, we've got mold, we've got pollen, we've got
grasses, and we've all got allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was saying much in the waiting room. I was reading a
book. Maybe one or two people were flipping the pages of a
magazine. Others were just sitting there, staring off in space,
wishing they were somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the opening of a door, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, it seemed, the women were looking prettier and
the guys were looking friendlier.
</P>
<P>
   The game warden had walked in.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, everybody knows the game warden. You either know
him and fear him, or you know him and like him.
</P>
<P>
   You could tell most of our crowd was a law-abiding bunch. You
could tell everybody there liked the game warden.
</P>
<P>
   We were all shaking hands, smiling and nodding. One of the guys
started in right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know? I had to call him the other night to arrest my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, go on, you old thing,'' one of the women said, laughing in
spite of herself.
</P>
<P>
   The game warden just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' the first fellow insisted. ``She was beating me up
so bad I had to call the law on her and have her arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the game warden piped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I had to bring back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody laughed at that, and me, too.
</P>
<P>
   Game wardens have that effect on folks. For one thing, a game
warden is usually a nice looking fellow, at least he stays trim.
Being on the job amounts to tromping through the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there's that big gun on his hip. Something about it
gives a man stature, as much with women as with other men. Maybe
it's the air of danger.
</P>
<P>
   You never know when he just may have to shoot it out with
outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nowadays most anybody carries a concealed weapon in
Texas, all legal with the proper permit.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty ladies, who you'd never think of as pistol-packing mamas,
won't go anywhere without their chrome-plated, palm-size automatic
in their designer purses. They know how to shoot, too. Part of
getting the permit is going to school to learn gun safety and the
proper use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Drill a fellow right between the eyes at 25 paces, these women
can.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why in Texas we always say ``Yes ma'am'' and ``No
ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Men tend to keep their pistols in the glove box of their pickup
truck. I say ``glove box.'' A lot of people say ``pistol pocket.''
They're probably closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was glad to see the game warden. Never mind I didn't
have much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Someone took notice of even that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're staying mighty quiet,'' a fellow said to me.
</P>
<P>
   Another spoke up before I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always that way around a man with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody laughed at that, and me, too. More and more, nowadays,
I made it a point to stay quiet.

</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 20 headline in the Sunday Times of London was
spectacular: ``Lennon funded terrorists and Trotskyists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and other U.S. media presented their own garbled
versions of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the errors lies a fascinating and significant story
about a renegade former intelligence officer for MI5, the
top-secret domestic security service in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   David Shayler, a former officer at the Libya desk of MI5, is one
of those rare establishment whistleblowers. Starting in 1997 he
went public _ in interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp. and
other media outlets _ with his outrage over the abuse of power he
saw while working for MI5.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw included an MI5 file on John Lennon, the former
Beatle, and he told the Sunday Timesand anybody else who'd
listenwhat was in it: reports describing Lennon's financial support
for left-wing groups in Britain in the late '60s, along with a copy
of the lyrics to Lennon's song ``Working Class Hero,'' written in
what appeared to be Lennon's own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler made these revelations along with a much more serious
claim: that Britain's foreign intelligence service plotted to
assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the security services are prohibited from disclosing
information about their work; under Britain's Official Secrets Act
they can be prosecuted for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shayler fled Britain, but soon was detained in a Paris
hotel room by French police at the request of British authorities.
The French government put him in prison while Britain tried to
extradite him. Eventually Shayler was freed, and he now lives in
Paris. But if he sets foot in Britain, he will be jailed as a
traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, after so much time has passed, the Sunday Times
seems not to have considered the possibility that the MI5 files on
Lennon it described perhaps contain erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shayler, the files contained reports that Lennon
made large contributions in the late '60s to the Irish Republican
Army and the Workers' Revolutionary Party, whose best-known member
was Vanessa Redgrave _ among the ``terrorists and Trotskyists'' of
the headline.
</P>
<P>
   These reports are almost certainly false. Lennon never had
anything to do with the Workers' Revolutionary Party, widely
regarded as the looniest '60s left-wing group. In the late '60s
Lennon was friendly with the International Marxist Group, which
published the underground Red Mole, edited by Tariq Ali and Robin
Blackburn. But they had a completely different political
orientation from the Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even a former member of the Workers' executive committee, Roer
Smith, told the London Observer that the MI5 information was wrong:
``There was absolutely no link between Lennon and us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lennon provided financial support to the IRA is a bit
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon was an outspoken supporter in the late '60s and early
'70s of what he called ``Irish civil rights.'' He joined protest
marches in London organized by the highly visible ``Troops Out''
movement. Lennon appears in a well-known photograph marching in a
demonstration carrying a sign that said RED MOLE/ FOR the
IRA/AGAINST BRITISH IMPERIALISM.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, after British troops shot and killed 13 people in
Northern Ireland on Bloody Sunday, Lennon wrote and recorded a
song, ``Luck of the Irish,'' and sang it at a demonstration in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, recently denied that the
British-born musician ever contributed money to the IRA. Even if he
had, it would have been a lawful act. It wasn't until the 1974
Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed by the British government
that financial support for the IRA was criminalized.
</P>
<P>
   It's pertinent that in February, 1981, three months after Lennon
was gunned down outside his Dakota apartment in New York City, I
personally made a Freedom of Information request for Lennon's FBI
file. I wanted the dossier for research on a book I was writing
about Lennon, ``Come Together,'' which was later published by the
University of Illinois Press.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the FBI released only about two-thirds of the file
and many of the released documents were heavily censored _ with
large portions of text blotted out. As the plaintiff, represented
by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, I
sued for release of the whole file.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, represented by the Justice Department, fought
against disclosure. In July '91 the Federal Appeals court in San
Francisco directed the FBI to be more specific why the release of
the missing documents would be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in 1997 the Clinton administration released all but 10
documents from the Lennon file. The FBI has told the courts that
those 10 contain national security information provided by a
``foreign government intelligence agency.'' The FBI refuses even to
release the name of that government.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago (Feb. 18, 2000), at a hearing in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, Judge Brian Robbins ordered the FBI
to release two letters it received from the unnamed foreign
government _presumably Britain _requesting that the Lennon
information remain confidential. The FBI has 28 days to comply or
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Caravallo, a U.S. Justice Department attorney, says an
appeal is likely in order to defend the principle that national
security documents from a foreign government should be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Shayler recently provided a declaration for U.S. courts
describing the MI5 documents he has seen. Because of Shayler, we
already know the nature of the information being withheld. We know
that it consists of 30-year-old reports on the political activities
of a dead rock star. We also know that the information is
erroneous, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of legitimate national security issues, these pages _
like the pages of the Lennon FBI file that have already been
released _ record an abuse of power by the government, engaged in
illegitimate surveillance of dissidents engaged in lawful political
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Lennon in the headlines after all these years? He
personified the dreams of the '60s. ``Imagine no more countries,''
he sang. And yet the establishment press in Britain still seems
intent on discrediting him. Apparently the battles of the '60s are
not yet over.

</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 20 headline in the Sunday Times of London was
spectacular: ``Lennon funded terrorists and Trotskyists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and other U.S. media presented their own garbled
versions of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the errors lies a fascinating and significant story
about a renegade former intelligence officer for MI5, the
top-secret domestic security service in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   David Shayler, a former officer at the Libya desk of MI5, is one
of those rare establishment whistleblowers. Starting in 1997 he
went public _ in interviews with the British Broadcasting Corp. and
other media outlets _ with his outrage over the abuse of power he
saw while working for MI5.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw included an MI5 file on John Lennon, the former
Beatle, and he told the Sunday Timesand anybody else who'd
listenwhat was in it: reports describing Lennon's financial support
for left-wing groups in Britain in the late '60s, along with a copy
of the lyrics to Lennon's song ``Working Class Hero,'' written in
what appeared to be Lennon's own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler made these revelations along with a much more serious
claim: that Britain's foreign intelligence service plotted to
assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the security services are prohibited from disclosing
information about their work; under Britain's Official Secrets Act
they can be prosecuted for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shayler fled Britain, but soon was detained in a Paris
hotel room by French police at the request of British authorities.
The French government put him in prison while Britain tried to
extradite him. Eventually Shayler was freed, and he now lives in
Paris. But if he sets foot in Britain, he will be jailed as a
traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, after so much time has passed, the Sunday Times
seems not to have considered the possibility that the MI5 files on
Lennon it described perhaps contain erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shayler, the files contained reports that Lennon

TODDLER TIPS COME IN SHADES OF PINK AND BLUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: DELETES extraneous material before lede) 
 
 
By NANCY HEWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being the parent of a toddler is one of the most demanding yet
rewarding jobs you will ever have.
</P>
<P>
   If you check most bookstores, you will find shelves of helpful
books that address different phases of toddlerhood. But until now
there wasn't one comprehensive manual that included the most common
situations parents must deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Laurie Waldstein and Leslie Zinberg have put together a
colorful, informative book called ``The Pink and Blue Toddler and
Preschooler Pages.'' ``We wanted to write a book by parents for
parents,'' says Waldstein. ``When our children were toddlers, we
didn't have the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of two years, both women did their research,
including soliciting responses from those in fields such as
nutrition, psychology, education and dentistry. Waldstein's husband
is a pediatrician, so she was able to tune in to questions he was
being asked when she worked at his office. ``We took questions we
had as parents,'' Waldstein continues, ``and included them with
questions others had, then put it together as a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is not organized in order of importance nor is it
alphabetical. Sections range from caregivers and toilet training to
behavior and safety. Sprinkled through the book are helpful hints
such as: ``Take your child to the store and let him pick out his
new underwear,'' found in the toilet training chapter. Or ``If your
child is not ready to use her manners, do not make it a power
struggle,'' in the chapter on behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The book also presents both sides of an issue as well as the
hints and tips. ``It's a book for busy parents of today,'' Zinberg
emphasizes. ``It is not a cumbersome book. It's comfortable. We
want it to be like you're calling a friend, especially since many
of us are separated from family.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldstein agrees. ``We didn't want people to be intimidated.
Parents need it simple and want it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Both authors encourage parents using the book to use common
sense for most situations because ``you know your own child.'' But
Waldstein adds: ``We give the most comprehensive information
available. But you should always defer to your pediatrician for
other questions you need answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldstein and Zinberg will be making local appearances this
week: 11 a.m. Monday at Borders Books and Music, 125 W. Thousand
Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. Information: (805) 497-8159; noon March
11, Borders Books and Music, 14651 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks.
Information: (818) 728-6593.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also available online at barnes&AMP;noble.com,
amazon.com and pinkandbluebooks.com. Suggested retail price is
$14.95. &QL;

 &HT;     By CYNTHIA BASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ This is a year, the presidential candidates
would have us believe, for outsiders; whichever their party,
whatever their background, they distance themselves from ``politics
as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Each goes on and on about how he isn't a Washington insider.
Each stresses his willingness to take unpopular stands. And they
push interesting aspects of their biographies to show they're not
cut from common political cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one can gainsay John McCain's heroism. Or Bill
Bradley's career in the NBA. Or, for that matter, significant
success in politics by George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when viewed with a historian's perspective, Bush (a),
Gore (b), McCain (c) and Bradley (d) can hardly be viewed as
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   No (a) two-term governor, (b) vice president, (c) current
three-term senator or (d) retired three-term senator, who attended
(a) Yale, (b) Harvard, (c) the U.S. Naval Academy or (d) Princeton,
and is the son of an (a) president, (b) senator, (c) admiral or (d)
bank president, can ever be very ``outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have any of the candidates taken particularly unpopular or
courageous stands _ being a pro-choice Democrat or a tax-cutting,
Clinton-bashing Republican is hardly gutsy.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, let's recall Sam Houston (1793-1863), a real
outsider with a truly unusual biography, a man who did take gutsy
(and ultimately costly) political risks.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Toqueville, the French author of ``Democracy in
America,'' called Houston ``one of the unpleasant consequences of
popular sovereignty.'' But he was a uniquely American character: a
soldier, frontiersman and hard _ very hard _ drinking (and possibly
opium-smoking) hell raiser.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a brilliant orator who wrote his own speeches. He
was the only man to be governor of two states. He was a man who set
up a republic, then slipped it back into his native land. He was a
visionary who saw just how great a future Texas (now the world's
11th largest economy, as Bush often reminds us) could enjoy with
American statehood.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston was just 14, he left his home to happily live with
a Cherokee tribe _ an unusual move, and undoubtedly at least
partially responsible for his support of Indian treaty rights
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when such support usually meant political suicide,
this was the first of several of Houston's highly unpopular and
extremely resented positions.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had two political lives. A soldier, teacher and lawyer,
he was elected to Congress in 1823; in 1827, at the ripe old age of
34, he became the golden-boy governor of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   While governor, he married a lovely maiden 15 years his junior.
Three months later, for reasons still unclear, she left him. So
ferocious was the scandal, he quit the governorship. He went back
to live with the Cherokees for the next three years, most of which
he spent drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Like many outsiders, Houston eventually drifted to Texas to
start a new life in what was then a province of Mexico. Soon he
became involved in the rebellion of 1836 and because of his
military experience became commander-in-chief of the ``Texian''
forces.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate victory made him a hero and the first president of
the Texas Republic. In 1845 he engineered its annexation to the
United States, became one of its first senators (for 14 years) and,
in 1859, was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life in Texas, Houston had the remarkable ability
to take unpopular positions and have time and history prove him
right.
</P>
<P>
   He argued strenuously against defending the Alamo, predicting
exactly the military disaster which eventually happened. After
winning the Battle of San Jacinto and forcing the surrender of
Mexico's forces, he ignored the popular wish to kill Mexican
General-President Santa Anna, arguing this might feel good in the
short term but really would only prolong hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas, against his advice, chose to join the Confederacy,
he foresaw ``civil Broil'' _ a sadly precise prediction. Although
governor of a state he had helped create when he said this, his
doleful vision so incensed his own war-hungry legislature, it
demanded _ and received _ his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What does Houston's life say to us during this political season?
Just this: We have four strong presidential candidates, for which
we should all be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give them all the credit they deserve for their real
accomplishments. But let's not indulge them (or ourselves) by
heaping adjectives such as ``outsider'' or ``maverick'' or
``colorful'' or ``politically courageous'' on any of them. Because
as history _ and Sam Houston's life _ shows us, they're all good
examples of ``none of the above.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ I saw that a plane carrying mail crashed a
couple of weeks ago in Southern California. Maybe George W. Bush's
apology to the NAACP was on it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, surely the Republican presidential hopeful wouldn't
apologize to Catholics for his ill-advised speech at Bob Jones
University and not do the same for African-Americans. He's a
``compassionate conservative'' and ``a uniter not a divider,''
right?
</P>
<P>
   As badly as Bob Jones University has slimed the Catholic Church
(Bob Jr., son of the school's founder, called the pope ``the
anti-Christ'' and the church ``a satanic cult''), the school has
done equally poorly by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Just a generation ago Bob Jones University flat-out refused to
admit black students, a policy that cost the college its tax-exempt
status. Here, in the Third Millennium, the school still prohibits
interracial marriage and dating.
</P>
<P>
   (This bastion of enlightenment in Greenville, S.C., also
notified its alumni that any gays or lesbians among them would be
arrested everywhere on campus but the religious art museum. Why the
museum? Because it was established as a separate entity from the
university so that it COULD maintain a tax-exempt status.)
</P>
<P>
   As just about everyone knows by now, George W. knew all this
when he chose to salve his New Hampshire primary wounds by
addressing about 5,500 Bob Jonesians on Feb. 2. He answered the
initial flak by basically blowing it off.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is a free-speech country, he said, and just
because a person visits a university doesn't mean he subscribes to
all its beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, Bush lost the Michigan primary amid much Bob
Jones mud-slinging by his GOP rival, John McCain. So Bush decided
to make something ``crystal clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject bigotry, I reject prejudice, I repudiate
anti-Catholicism and racism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice try. But it didn't stop McCain or the media.
</P>
<P>
   So more than three weeks after his address, Bush's campaign
generals apparently accepted the fact that the Bob Jones
controversy was not going away. Last weekend, Bush delivered a
full, bended-knee mea culpa to Cardinal John O'Connor, pastor of
one of the nation's largest Catholic flocks: New York's 2.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal tone of the apology, it was not for
O'Connor's eyes only: The Bush campaign released the letter, very
publicly, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In it Bush reminded O'Connor that one of the Bush Brothers is a
Catholic convert with a Catholic wife. He reminded O'Connor that
he, W., and the cardinal had already talked about Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he was in error by not ``disassociating myself
from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice.'' His inaction,
he said, was ``a missed opportunity causing needless offense, which
I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could ask for more?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Catholic, nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Catholic and black. Which brings me back to the
Bush apology that has yet to make it to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I looked, it was legal in all 50 states for
interracial couples to date and marry. How can a prohibition by an
alleged institution of higher learning on either of those choices
not be seen as racist and bigoted?
</P>
<P>
   Why don't blacks rate the sort of big, public ``I'm sorry for
Bob Jones University'' that Catholics got? Is it something about
the NAACP?
</P>
<P>
   In January, during the nasty flap over the South Carolina
statehouse and its waving of the Confederate battle flag,
Republican state Sen. Arthur Ravenel referred to the National
Association for Colored People as the ``National Association of
Retarded People.'' (The NAACP is driving the attempt to rid the
statehouse of the flag.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initial assessment of that whopper: It was
``unfortunate.'' Asked several times if he thought Ravenel ought to
apologize, Bush finally allowed as how such statements were ``out
of line, and we should repudiate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked several more times if THAT meant Ravenel ought to
apologize to the NAACP, Bush said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe there was another mail plane crash somewhere
and ...

   EDUCATION-TAX _ WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., on
Friday celebrates Senate approval of an amended version of his bill
to give tax breaks to families that save up to $2,000 per child per
year to meet the expenses of going to a public, private, parochial
or home school. It would also give education-related tax breaks to
teachers, would-be teachers and businesses. But the bill passed by
too narrow a margin to guarantee an over-ride of the veto expected
from President Clinton, who has vetoed similar bills twice, and
wants Congress to pass his own package of education tax breaks
instead. Political scientist Joseph Cooper of Johns Hopkins
University explains why senators from both parties cheerfully spent
more than a week of floor time debating an education bill that
won't become a law. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 15.

   BRITAIN-NAMES _ LONDON _ Look in any newspaper in the Czech
Republic and you'll see Julia Robertsova and Meryl Streepova, not
Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep. That's because the suffix ``ova''
is added to all women's names to indicate the woman belongs to her
husband or father. But times are changing. Legislation proposed by
the Czech Ministry of Interior _ and expected to pass _ would
finally allow a woman to delete the ``ova'' suffix. This change is
a surprising one in Europe, where countries have long resisted
American-style ``political correctness,'' a term derided as
describing a ridiculously tortured sensitivity that has resulted in
absurd changes to the language. In Britain, for example, letter
carriers (American-style P.C.) are still called ``postmen,'' even
</P>
<P>
   if they are women. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-POLLUTION MEXICO CITY _ Mexican environmental officials
proudly announced in January that this crowded ? and usually
smog-filled ? had enjoyed the cleanest air in a decade in 1999.
Within a few weeks those officials were all but eating their words.
Just after they unveiled data showing that one of the world's most
polluted cities had made gains, the city was shrouded once again in
eye-stinging, throat-burning smog. Kids, who are at special risk
here, were ordered indoors in the southern end of the city. Brown
clouds hung on the horizon like frozen dust storms. Coughs and
respiratory ailments soared. From the World Trade Center, one of
the city's tallest buildings, the view was apocalyptic. A blanket
of smog rolled over the city 46 stories below, growing thicker by
the minute. Yes, the air is cleaner thanks to reforms. But problems
with industry emissions, traffic and even soil erosion are still
serious. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

13,000 feet in the Bolivian Andes, there isn't a lot of air to
start with. But Bautista's lungs were being squeezed by a bowel
obstruction the size of a basketball. The obstruction would either
rupture and kill him or squeeze the last breath out of his lungs
and kill him. A group of Franciscan nuns were determined that
wouldn't happen. (Reid, Palm Beach Post). 50. WITH PHOTOS.

   MARDIGRAS-PANTIES _ NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans cops have placed

Mardi Gras. The crackdown on festival bawdiness seems extra-serious
this year. A suburban city has banned obscene throws, like dildos,
from its parades, but voted that panties were OK. A city councilman
worried about the appearance of that: ''So,'' he said, ``we are on
the record as pro-panties?'' (Konigsmark, Atlanta

   NBA-WORLD (Paris) _ After the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when
millions of non-Americans were hypnotized by the artistry of Magic
Johnson, Michael Jordan and the rest of the Dream Team, the
National Basketball Association started pushing harder to make its
logo, and the superstars that populate its universe, household
images worldwide. By and large, it has succeeded. But if the NBA is
hurting a bit on the home court, many assumptions about global
growth have been cast into doubt, too. Sales of jerseys, balls and
backboards are flat, as is television audience growth, and
magazines about the NBA draw fewer readers than they used to. There
is no crisis, but as in the United States, the figures partly
reflect the impact of the owners' lockout that canceled 464 games
last season, as well as Jordan's departure. But they also
underscore the challenge of keeping fans who are an ocean apart
from spending their sports money elsewhere. By John Tagliabue.

   NBA-WORLD (Paris) _ After the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when
millions of non-Americans were hypnotized by the artistry of Magic
Johnson, Michael Jordan and the rest of the Dream Team, the
National Basketball Association started pushing harder to make its
logo, and the superstars that populate its universe, household
images worldwide. By and large, it has succeeded. But if the NBA is
hurting a bit on the home court, many assumptions about global
growth have been cast into doubt, too. Sales of jerseys, balls and
backboards are flat, as is television audience growth, and
magazines about the NBA draw fewer readers than they used to. There
is no crisis, but as in the United States, the figures partly
reflect the impact of the owners' lockout that canceled 464 games
last season, as well as Jordan's departure. But they also
underscore the challenge of keeping fans who are an ocean apart

A WOMAN, HER HOUSE AND A DECK OF FENG-SHUI CARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm just as interested in peace and harmony as the next person,
so when my sister sent me the Feng Shui Card System, I was eager to
get my home vibes in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy. If you can play Go Fish, you can do the Feng Shui
Card System in your home or office,'' the box for the oversize deck
of cards says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play Go Fish,'' I said, encouraging myself.
</P>
<P>
   If my home were properly feng-shuied, the cards say, I could
have a better marriage, improved health, increased creativity and
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Who couldn't use a little more money?
</P>
<P>
   As I flipped through the cards, I was happy to discover that I'm
attracting good energy with the curved path to my front door. I was
equally pleased to learn that my wind chimes ward off negative
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The good energy was rushing toward my house, and I just had to
share the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, honey, the cards say that since our home faces north, our
careers will benefit,'' I happily announced to my husband, who has
about as much regard for feng-shui as he does for Lifetime:
Television for Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, goody,'' he said as he rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the good energy wasn't flowing to his spot in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the good energy was having trouble making it
past the front door.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, I seemed to be a natural feng-shuier. Then I
started analyzing the inside of the house.
</P>
<P>
   My main entry faces my stairs, and the stairs divide two living
areas. That's bad, the cards say, because it splits the energy and
as a result, one room is rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   As I flipped through the cards, things got worse.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered that whoever designed my house didn't consider feng
shui at all when drawing up the plans. Nothing is where it's
supposed to be according to the five elements of earth, water,
fire, metal and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Two of my three bathrooms are in the center of the house, which
is apparently the precise location that causes my financial
resources to be flushed away. That creates stress, the cards told
me, and that can lead to poor health and a possible financial
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Very, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nothing a mirror can't solve. Just put one on the
bathroom doors, the cards say.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry room is in the wrong place, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's supposed to be on the north end of the house, where the
water element belongs, but it's in the middle of the house, toward
the east side, posing yet another threat to my financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, I need a mirror behind the washing machine. This time,
though, it has to be a bac-gua mirror, whatever that is. I put it
on my growing shopping list titled ``needed for better feng-shui.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it turns out that because my bed faces north, I'll have
more struggles of some unspecified variety.
</P>
<P>
   And the bed is aligned with the door, which the cards say ``is
like carting oneself off to death.'' But if I moved the bed over,
it would be too close to a window, which the cards say would make
my health suffer.
</P>
<P>
   I need another mirror, the cards say.
</P>
<P>
   For good feng-shui, I also need a bunch of plants placed in
strategic corners throughout the house. That's cool, except that
the plants have to be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   After going through the house, room by room, learning about my
bad energy with every step, I looked down at my long, long ``needed
for better feng-shui'' list.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, from a cursory review of my situation, that to fix
my feng-shui, I need: approximately 327 mirrors, at least one of
which is a bac-gua mirror; an aquarium that holds eight red fish
and one black fish; a kidney-shaped pond in my front yard; a
crystal in one of my downstairs windows; some bamboo tied with red
ribbon; and a pair of foo-dogs.
</P>
<P>
   And having a bathroom in the middle of the house flushes away my
resources?
</P>
<P>

or office from pyramidcollection.com for $19.95. They are
manufactured by Mae Chin Williams Inc.

THOSE BEHIND `WALLS' DO TALK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Sunday, March 5; tonight is SUNDAY in this story.
Fact box below) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the walls of a certain frame bungalow could talk, they might
whisper, pant and giggle about passionate, sweaty, sometimes
playful sex between women. Or they might tell in straightforward
fashion of three generations of lesbians struggling to live
regular, loving lives outside the scope of what society says is
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' HBO's follow-up to its very
successful 1996 film on abortion, addresses lesbianism in three
distinct time periods and some of the problems homosexual women
have faced in those eras.
</P>
<P>
   What a lot of what people want to know, however _ as a reason to
tune in or a reason to tune out _ is whether there are graphic
loves scenes between women. The answer is yes, in the latter two
segments of the trilogy. But Sharon Stone, a self-proclaimed
``expert on salacious material,'' said there is so much more to
``Walls'' than naked women between the sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if (a sex scene) draws someone to the project, and
they're obviously going to have to watch more than that to get to
that, then we have accomplished something with that, that has
value,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone co-stars with Ellen DeGeneres in the lighthearted third
story, written and directed by Anne Heche. As the current owners of
that bungalow, Stone and DeGeneres play a couple dealing with a
typical ``2000'' dilemma: How to conceive a child outside the
conventional method.
</P>
<P>
   The trilogy begins with ``1961,'' about an elderly woman
(Vanessa Redgrave) living in that house, dealing with the death of
her partner of 50 years, and the grief she suppresses because their
relationship was secret.
</P>
<P>
   In ``1972,'' the bungalow is home to Linda (``Dawson's Creek''
star Michelle Williams) and three other feminist gay college
students. Linda's housemates, angry at men on the whole, turn
against her when she gets involved with a butch lesbian (Chloe
Sevigny of ``Boys Don't Cry'').
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers and stars of ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,''
speaking to the Television Critics Association, struggled to find
the words to describe the importance of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was asked what she learned by playing a lesbian role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I learned that I'm exactly like a gay woman except I
don't have sex with women,'' she replied, drawing laughs and a
snappy retort from her comedian co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I learned that I'm exactly like a straight woman, but I
don't have sex with a man. We're kind of the same,'' DeGeneres
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone explained that she sees lesbians as people subjected to
the same type of discrimination racial and ethnic groups have
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just, you know, today's prejudice,'' she said. ``I didn't
feel that it was really any different than another prejudice that I
might find in the straight life. I really mean it when I say I'm
just like a gay woman except I don't have sex with women. ...
You're not different. The differences that happen to gay women are
as a result of people oppressing people and trying to make them
hide who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Coolidge, who directed ``1972,'' took a stab at it:
``Love is love, and couples falling in love is the same, and making
love is the same, but different for each one of us. But it's not
like it's different because of who we love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so delighted that we get to do these pieces,'' added Jane
Anderson, the openly gay writer-director of ``1961,'' ``that some
kid out in the Midwest can watch these films and finally, finally
know that there's normalcy and dignity and acceptance at the end of
this long, dark tunnel that we've had as a minority.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, back to that sweaty, passionate, playful stuff.
Real-life partners Heche and DeGeneres argued about whether a sex
scene was important to the ``2000'' piece, but the writer-director
won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing DeGeneres well, Heche realized the best way to get her
to relax was with a few drinks. So, she says, she had a
well-stocked bar set up in her star's trailer and suggested
DeGeneres and Stone, who also was uneasy about the scene, knock
back a few before filming it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, DeGeneres can kid about the ``secret handshake'' she
taught Stone. And she can quip about her short-lived disdain for
the Hollywood establishment after she came out of the closet in
that famous ``Yep, I'm gay'' Time magazine cover and her situation
comedy was canceled. (She said she and Heche changed their minds
about leaving Los Angeles for good after a bunch of reporters
showed up outside their house ``holding hands, singing
`Kumbaya.''')
</P>
<P>
   She is moving on professionally, looking forward to her first
stand-up comedy show in eight years and a CBS pilot for next fall
in which she plays herself hosting a traditional sketch comedy show
in the Carol Burnett vein.
</P>
<P>
   But DeGeneres isn't likely to forget the sting of seeing her old
show's ratings drop, having ABC give up on the series, realizing
that good projects that suit her new public image are going to be
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to visit that place again, because there was
depression, you know,'' she said. ``My show was canceled. I was
sad. I was going through a grieving period and there was a little
bit of bitterness and I made mistakes, publicly. ... There are
things that I acted out publicly that should've just been my
grieving period alone in my corner of my basement rocking naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the laughter, she added, ``Oh my God, I'm revealing too
much!'' &QL;

   MACHINES-HUMANS (Undated) _ Recent advances in airplane design
have energized a debate among designers and industrial
psychologists about how machines should relate to their human
operators. Two different approaches _ one that is fully automated,
the other that relies on human judgment _ illustrate the knotty
issues facing researchers and designers in a variety of fields.
Highly automated machines now automatically administer drugs to
hospital patients, produce sophisticated semiconductors and operate
complex power plants, transforming technicians from machine
operators into supervisory controllers. How the human masters are
best kept ``in the loop'' so they know what the machines are doing

&HT;     OAKLAND SEEKS A MORE CUDDLY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATTHEW YI and JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ City officials trying to enhance Oakland's
image on a global scale say a pair of cuddly pandas from China
could certainly do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Henry Chang announced Thursday that the city is
zeroing in on a deal to bring two pandas to the Oakland Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about this,'' Chang said. ``If we can get
pandas to come to Oakland, Oakland will be on the map, world-known,
because this is an international thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The councilman got the idea eight years ago while visiting China
on a trade mission as an Oakland port commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're working in China, you have to nurture and you have
to cultivate a relationship first. You can't just go in and say,
``I want a panda,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, city officials signed a letter of intent to bring
two pandas, a male and a female, from the town of Pingwu in China's
Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
   Although that step was important, the deal is far from being set
in stone because Oakland officials still face a slew of obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited,'' Allison Lindquist, assistant zoo
director, said Thursday. ``But we're guardedly optimistic because
there are some big hurdles that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang wants to set up a panda research institute at the Oakland
Zoo working with the School of Veterinary Medicine at the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is that we are not just trying to get it here for
exhibit purposes,'' Chang said. ``What we have proposed is to bring
the panda here for research. We want to help the species.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Parrott, executive director of the Oakland Zoo, said ample
space and mild weather are two key advantages offered by this
Northern California city of 370,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The weather ``makes it very amenable to the outdoor,
naturalistic living that's so beneficial'' to the pandas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, money is the biggest problem. The city has not budgeted
a penny for importing the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably cost us $10 million to build a facility here
and another $1.5 a year to maintain it,'' Chang said. ``We would
have to raise all of that from private sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The councilman said he has lined up several corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have big corporations that underwrite this, it can be
very fast,'' said Chang, a native of China.
</P>
<P>
   Zoos in other cities are working on deals to import pandas. The
National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is seeking two after its pair
died recently. St. Louis and Memphis, Tenn., also are seeking
pandas.
</P>
<P>
   David Towne, president and founder of the North America Panda
Foundation, sounded a note of caution amid the euphoria. He said it
can take many years and millions of dollars more than anticipated
to bring a panda into this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hellish expense and some zoos are not equipped to take
on the financial burden,'' Towne said from Seattle, where he is
director of the Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to dampen Oakland's party,'' Towne said.
``There are at least 12 other zoos that have similar agreements,
but it's a long haul from there until you get your panda.''

``The Bold and the Beautiful's'' Adrienne Frantz, holding one of

``It's a great place to wake up in the morning.'' Charlotte

By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Adrienne Frantz's alarm goes off, she awakens to see
squirrels skittering up and down the towering pine tree outside the
window of her airy bedroom, and the Valley laid out before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being up in the trees,'' the soap star said,
cuddling one of her four cats, Angel Larue. ``It's a great place to
wake up in the morning. It's so peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet is something Amber Moore _ the teen-age hellion
Frantz has played on the daytime soap opera ``The Bold and the
Beautiful'' for the past three years _ doesn't know much about.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet-faced little golddigger worked as the rag-trade-rich
Forrester family's baby-sitter, seduced the young heir to the
family fortune, got pregnant, married him (even though he was in
love with another girl), gave birth to his (or !ital!was it his?)
stillborn baby, buried it in a desert grave and stole her cousin's
baby to pass off as the Forrester grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Amber sick of her life of lies and dealing with the
consequences, Frantz is playing the kind of scenes she loves _
meaty and filled with emotion. The role brought her a nomination
for the Outstanding Younger Lead Actress at Friday's Soap Opera
Digest Awards.
</P>
<P>
   When Frantz gets totally out of character, she settles into her
new home in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   The three-level, renovated 1925 house, which she and her mom,
Vicki, a clinical psychologist, moved into in October, is still a
little bare, but that's to be expected. It's the 21-year-old's
first house, a maze of 26 white-carpeted rooms on three levels,
built up the side of a hill criss-crossed by meandering paths and
dizzying staircases, punctuated by a lush garden, terraces and
decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I came to L.A. three years ago, I've wanted a house,''
Frantz said, comfortably ensconced on the sandstone hearth of her
art deco carved fireplace, amid candles and bowls of rose-petal
potpourri collected from her garden. ``It always was my goal, and I
just started putting part of my paycheck aside for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, I just said, `Today I'm ready to buy a house,'
and this is the first one I looked at. I walked through the gate
and said, `When can I move in?' It just felt like this was !ital!my
place. This was where I was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a comfortable fit. The actress lives on the two upper
floors, accessible from one street, and mom has a separate
residence on the bottom floor, with its own garden and entrance on
the street behind. The two share the actress's kitchen and upstairs
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have it set up so we can be in the same place, but in two
different houses,'' said Vicki Frantz, who took photos and
magazines to the bank to show that her daughter had a responsible
job and was capable of paying off a hefty mortgage, despite her
youth. ``But if we want to watch a movie together, we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be on the big-screen TV on the home's upper level.
Upstairs also is the living room, with a cushy, buff-colored
leather sofa, a mirrored bar and a tiny dining alcove overlooking
the Valley. The room's centerpiece, a Christmas gift from a friend,
is a funky painted game table: In its everyday incarnation, it's a
chessboard with stylized painted wooden dogs and cats as the chess
pieces. Turn the chess board over and it's a handpainted Monopoly
board.
</P>
<P>
   Cats, in fact, are becoming a theme throughout the house, from
the punched-tin lantern on the bar to the carved, painted
Indonesian table in the living room. Angels _ from the blown-glass
ones on the mantel to the delicate silver charm Frantz wears on a
chain around her neck _ run a close second.
</P>
<P>
   Guest bedrooms are undecorated as yet, but the window-lined
formal dining room _ on the middle of the home's three levels,
reached by a climb down a wide, steep staircase _ is anchored by a
long, dark-wood trestle table. A Venetian glass chandelier, which
Frantz brought home from a recent location shoot, hangs over the
table. Nearby are two early 20th-century china cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was finished by my grandfather and has been in our
family for years,'' said Michigan-born Frantz, indicating the
larger of the two cabinets. ``I love antique furniture and old
stuff. I pick it up whenever I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bedroom _ an airy confection whipped up in tones of white
and silver _ is the room that appears to be the home's real living
room, as in, actually being lived in. There's an alcove with a
wicker sofa, books, teddy bears and pictures, a 1920s vanity Frantz
refinished herself and a 150-year-old dresser, another family
heirloom, which she plans to sand down and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like refinishing furniture,'' she said. ``It's something I
do in my spare time _ if I have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days not filming ``B&AMP;B'' are spent doing interviews and
photo shoots, making personal appearances, writing and recording
songs (named best female vocalist at the 1997 Los Angeles
International Music Awards, she's working on her first rock 'n'
roll album) and reading scripts, looking for just the right movie.
</P>
<P>
   She has already filmed two _ ``Jimmy Zip,'' which won best
feature at the Hollywood Film Festival, and ``Speedway Junky,'' Gus
Van Sant's dark tale of runaways living on the streets of Las Vegas
_ both of which are due out this year. She plans to begin filming
an indie, ``The Child Manuela,'' a remake of a 1931 German film,
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Frantz wants to do the same kind of intelligent movies her role
model, Meryl Streep, chooses to do, so she's turned down roles
offered her in the latest teen-scream flicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my house; now I can play the roles I want,'' Frantz
said. ``I don't want to do anything cheesy. I want to be in this
for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same kind of determination she showed at age 3, when
she announced that she wanted to take dancing and singing lessons,
and at age 16, when she wanted to try her acting wings in New York,
said mom Vicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for her to do what she wanted to do and
follow her dreams. She's always had this dream of being an actress,
and she goes about it in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how she got her house, Frantz says: deciding what's
responsible rather than what's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people my age, they get some money and they blow it on
clothes or drugs or alcohol. And they have nothing to show for it.
I try to follow my goals, but sometimes it's hard. It's a fine
line: Do I really want those boots, or would I rather have a coffee
table? Sometimes I buy the boots, but I'd rather save for the
bigger goal.'' &QL;

   MACHINES-HUMANS (Undated) _ Recent advances in airplane design
have energized a debate among designers and industrial
psychologists about how machines should relate to their human
operators. Two different approaches _ one that is fully automated,
the other that relies on human judgment _ illustrate the knotty
issues facing researchers and designers in a variety of fields.
Highly automated machines now automatically administer drugs to
hospital patients, produce sophisticated semiconductors and operate
complex power plants, transforming technicians from machine
operators into supervisory controllers. How the human masters are
best kept ``in the loop'' so they know what the machines are doing
will ultimately affect hundreds of millions of people's lives. By

&HT;     RESEARCHERS SAY CEREBELLUM MAY PLAY ACTIVE ROLE IN SENSATION

<P>
   Scientists are rethinking long-held notions about the
cerebellum, a structure at the back of the brain whose function for
years was believed to be limited to coordinating body movement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, however, research has begun to show this
brain structure plays a vastly more sophisticated role in how the
body perceives sensations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest studies, by scientists at the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio and the University of
Melbourne in Australia, indicate the cerebellum plays a major role
in the sensation of thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments using positron emission tomography, or PET scans,
showed the cerebellum crackles with activity both during the onset
of thirst and during the satisfaction of that thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Parsons, an assistant professor at the health
science center's Research Imaging Center and one of the lead
authors of a study on the cerebellum, said the new findings offer
additional evidence that the brain section helps direct and
interpret information from the senses.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing an analogy from the world of high tech, Parsons compared
the cerebellum to a computer server that passes information to
other computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the cerebellum is involved in that it helps organize
all these thoughts and related sensations that are streaming up
into the highest levels of the brain,'' Parsons said. ``It makes it
easier for the higher level of the brain to do its work.''
</P>
<P>
   The study published this month in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences backs up other research that has
pointed to cerebellum involvement in the perception of timing, the
ability to group words logically and mentally rotating objects.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, studies have suggested defects in the
cerebellum are involved in the learning disorder dyslexia. Other
research suggested the cerebellum tells the brain what to expect
from its own movement. Thus, volunteers who tickled themselves got
no thrill from the sensation.
</P>
<P>
   In Parsons' experiments, brain scans were conducted on 10
volunteers while researchers made people thirsty by injecting salty
fluids into the bloodstream. Volunteers also were scanned after
they drank water to satisfy their thirst.
</P>
<P>
   The scans showed the cerebellum was active during the onset and
satiation of thirst but turned off when thirst was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said that suggests that the cerebellum was active in
passing information to other regions of the brain but was not
responsible for the sensation of thirst itself.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, he said, is research involving other sensory
systems. Parsons said he and colleagues are now looking at patients
with damaged cerebellums to see how well they discriminate between
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also want to study cerebellum functions in
alcoholics, since that brain structure is strongly affected by
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the work could provide doctors with a new way of
looking at patients who have body movement problems, Parsons said.

JERUSALEM BOMB SQUAD BATTLES TERROR, TEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem Bomb Squad is said to be the busiest of its kind
in the world, rivaled only by Belfast's in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours with Bomb Squad Team No. 362 Thursday provided a
glimpse into a world that involves hours of tedium, punctuated by
flashes of intensity and brushes with absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   The day began at dawn in the Old City at the Ottoman-era police
station known as ``Kishle'' in the shadow of the Citadel, the Roman
fortress that protected this city for more than 2,000 years. In the
squad room, floor-to-ceiling shelves are crammed with the artifacts
of terror from past missions _ coffee containers, cans of beans,
egg crates, shoes, books _ all hollowed out and intricately rigged
with timing devices and explosives. On the wall are photographs
honoring two from the unit who were killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The six teams of bomb technicians get a daily briefing here, and
this particular morning brought bad news.
</P>
<P>
   In Taybeh, an Israeli town bordering the West Bank, a cell
within the militant Islamic organization Hamas had just been
uncovered making a bomb that allegedly was to be detonated
somewhere in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Police and bomb squad units had foiled the plan. At least three
Palestinians were killed during a raid on the house, and the device
they had been building exploded during the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means we are on a very high alert right now,'' a 23-year
veteran and senior commander of the unit told the morning shift of
his 36-member squad.
</P>
<P>
   The partners of Team No. 362, Sergeants Maoz and Roy _ it is
strict departmental policy not to disclose the last names of squad
members for fear it could endanger their lives _ headed for the
white bomb squad van, a vehicle as familiar to Jerusalem's
residents as a mail truck or a yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   All over Jerusalem and other cities of Israel, bomb squads work
around the clock, rummaging through trash and opening parked cars
deemed suspicious in the daily search for bombs. The ritual of
blocking streets to investigate and often blow up suspicious
objects is as common as traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The van carries a British-made robot used to investigate
suspicious objects. There is a viewing screen for the robotic
camera and racks of intricate tools and gadgets of the trade. The
remotely operated robot can be used to ``disrupt'' a possible bomb
with a small, controlled explosion, or it can fire a shotgun-like
device to open locked bags and briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   As the van plied the busy streets, squad members eyed
suspiciously everyone wearing a bulky coat or carrying a heavy bag.
Every garbage bag, unattended briefcase, and cardboard box took on
an ominous quality.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the radio dispatcher broke in: ``Suspicious object on
a bus at the central bus station.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Maoz flicked on the siren and began a dash through red
lights, heading the wrong way on one-way streets, and screeching to
a halt at the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Police were clearing the area already, but Sergeant Maoz barked
into a loudspeaker for people to ``clear the area now.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers waiting for buses moved along, obediently accepting
the scare as a fact of life in this volatile city. The van pulled
to within 40 yards of the bus where a ``suspicious object,'' a
canvas bag, had been left in storage.
</P>
<P>
   Roy helped Maoz dress in a full-body protective suit and a
helmet with a one-inch thick plexiglass visor. They uncoiled a
climbing rope to attach to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 60 times a day, the squad receives calls on ``suspicious
objects.'' Israelis are understandably jittery about bombings after
decades of attacks on buses, crowded streets, cafes, and markets. A
campaign by police encourages all citizens to keep their eyes open
for suspicious devices.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 200 daily calls nationwide, only 1 percent turn
up actual explosives, but every one must be approached as if it
were a live bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have seen the effects of a bomb, once you have walked
through the carnage and the shattered glass and the screaming and
the chaos, you look at life differently,'' said Maoz. He was the
first one on the scene of the 1997 Ben Yehuda Street attack by
three suicide bombers who activated their devices in sequence in
the city's busiest shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   It is with these scenes in mind that Maoz approached the striped
canvas bag, delicately attaching clips to the handle. Slowly, he
backed away, then pulled the ropes to jiggle the bag, in case it
was booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Confident that it wasn't, he slowly tugged it out of the storage
hold. Delicately, he used a pair of pliers to open the zipper.
</P>
<P>
   The tension broke with a smirk and a knowing look toward his
partner. Inside were red peppers, a head of lettuce, carrots, and a
few onions. He pulled the bag toward him, spilling everything to be
sure no bomb was hidden amid the produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must look absurd with all this gear and taking part a bag
of vegetables,'' Maoz said later. ``But this is the job. We have to
stay alert on every instance, on every day, on every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing a city like Jerusalem, site of ancient hatreds and
modern enmities, is difficult. It only adds to the squad's tension
that these days most bombs are the work of suicide bombers intent
on destroying the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for peace,'' said Maoz at the end of a long day.
``It's strange, you know. We end up hoping that we can be out of a
job someday.''

MCCAIN'S PITCH IS RESONATING IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ It isn't about his leanings or his stands. It
isn't about Social Security, taxes, or even campaign finance
reform. With John McCain, the pull is more visceral, emotional.
Almost wishful.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the view from the college-town coffee shop
where Christopher McDonald, a doctoral student in social justice
education, explains his unlikely feelings about the presidential
race. McDonald, 30, is no conservative. He hates McCain's vote
against a bill to ban job discrimination against gay people. And
yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I would vote for John McCain,'' he said. ``I think he could be
engaged. I think he would listen to people. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, do thousands of other Massachusetts voters. As
Tuesday's primary approaches, an informal, unofficial, unscientific
sampling of the state's residents confirms what the formal,
scientific polls are saying. There are voters moved by Gore,
Bradley, Bush, McCain, and None of the Above. There are voters
committed to the issues, bound to support a candidate who's for
abortion rights or against them.
</P>
<P>
   But a wide range of voters, across age, race, and party lines,
is moved not by facts but by feelings. And many of them say McCain
has a hard-to-articulate appeal _ even if logic suggests they
should despise him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's not so strange in Massachusetts, where
independents outnumber Democrats and Republicans, and Yankee
individualists love to boast that they ``vote for the man, not the
party.'' Still, some lifelong Democrats seem genuinely surprised
that they're drawn to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Scott, 34, an auto mechanic in Grafton who unlike McCain
opposes the death penalty, said he can't explain the candidate's
attraction; it's ``just the way he is.'' Henry O'Mally, 53, an
odd-jobs man at a Dorchester restaurant, wants McCain because he
figures ``we don't need another puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   And a weathered Vietnam vet, resting on the steps of the New
Bedford Library after a five-day fishing trip, mused on the
candidates and came up with this explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was back in the service again, I would take McCain in the
foxhole with me. He's the only one I'd trust. The others would all
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the issue briefings and position papers. It's the
fuzzy, personal qualities _ perceptions on bravery, forthrightness,
spunk _ that are far more likely to decide an election. Despite an
avalanche of media coverage, many voters aren't paying more than
glancing attention to the campaign. Less than a week before the
primary, more than a few admit they still need to figure out who's
running. Many say they need to learn more about the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the details scarcely matter, anyway; a presidential
race is only partly about platform. You're not just checking off a
list of ideas from a menu, voters say. You're choosing a person, a
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that isn't so wrong, says Manny Louro, 38, a systems
salesman from South Dartmouth who wears a company ring and is
inclined to believe that leadership is salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling is communicating, communicating effectively,'' Louro
said. ``This is all kind of theatrics to a large extent.''
</P>
<P>
   But theatrics can be deceptive, said Peter D'Errico, who teaches
legal studies at the University of Massachuetts at Amherst. The
notion that McCain is a different sort of politician, he said, is a
delusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so bizarre. Nothing that he actually says, none
of those involve any real change,'' D'Errico said. ``He's business
as usual. Reagan is his favorite president. I mean, by God, how
does that change anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if McCain doesn't represent a radical departure from the
system, he also doesn't represent a close link to it the way
front-runners Al Gore and George W. Bush do. Bush still trots out
his dad and ever-popular mom on the campaign trail. And as much as
Gore tries to distance himself from Bill Clinton's misdeeds, he
also benefits from Clinton's broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Singleton, a UMass-Dartmouth education professor, said he
favors Gore out of loyalty to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore President Clinton's civil rights accomplishments,''
Singleton said. ``He has done a lot for civil rights for blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But June Long, 73, of Sandwich, said the last eight years have
left her disenchanted. ``The moral fabric of this country has gone
down,'' she said as she watched her husband play cards. ``Taxes
should be at a standard where people can afford to pay. A mother
should be home for awhile. They can't anymore. Kids are latch-key
kids today. . . . It's a lot of little things'' that she figures
Bush can fix.
</P>
<P>
   But as the campaign unfolds, the real-life Bush _ as opposed to
the idealized one _ has disappointed many. At Peg's Diner, a tiny
Whitinsville cafe where patrons hold court at the counter, owner
Peg Gagner says they've been talking a lot about Bush. When the
handlers first hawked George W., she said, they made him sound more
. . . presidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never do that. You can't fool people,'' she said while
frying a hunk of bacon on her griddle. ``They just figured he was
going to be like his father, and he's not his father.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not much of a candidate at all, said Shawn Gunderson, 31, a
system engineer from Northampton, who calls Bush ``The Prince of
Idiocy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a wind-up toy. He just does what he's told,''
Gunderson said, lounging on a park bench on the Plymouth shore and
turning an invisible key.
</P>
<P>
   And Brendan Maher, 24, an Internet worker from Cambridge, had
similar complaints about Gore, who he said looks like he ``went to
a learn-how-to-speak-in-public seminar and he left after the first
class.''
</P>
<P>
   But voters irked by Gore aren't necessarily drawn to Bill
Bradley, the would-be Democratic insurgent who has struggled in
every state. To Andrea Young, 18, who manages a Worcester
baseball-cap store, Bradley's race-relations rhetoric rings hollow:
``Yeah, I played for the Knicks. Yeah, I know where you people come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Fiato, 32, who works with teenagers in Lawrence,
didn't take a second look at Bradley until he read an article about
him in Vibe magazine. But as Bradley surely knows, not everyone
reads Vibe. And Peg Gagner blames the candidate for losing the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need somebody that's going to pound their fist and get
your attention,'' she said. The sort of thing McCain has done so
well.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the maverick Republican's lead is staggering; a recent
University of Massachusetts poll showed him leading Bush, 66-21,
among probable voters in the Republican primary. Among likely
Democratic primary voters, Gore leads Bradley 54-34.
</P>
<P>
   But ``likely voters'' doesn't mean a lot of people; in
Massachusetts, presidential primaries tend to be low-key events.
When Clinton faced Dole in 1996, turnout was 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials say there is unusual interest this year and
they have prepared for high participation. But even when turnout
reaches record levels, as it did in 1980, 6 out of 10 voters still
don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   Already, won't-be voters give a lot of reasons why. Some say
they're waiting for the general election. Some say they're too
disillusioned. And some say they lack the inclination, or the
energy, to think about campaigns. Even a roving news event like
Hurricane McCain, after all, can't compete with the little tempests
of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   So said Denise Esposito of Pembroke, who wheels two infants in
her stroller, and admits she hasn't paid much attention to the race
_ or watched any debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a whole heck of a lot of time,'' she said. ``I
watch `Teletubbies'.''

WHAT HAPPENED TO BRADLEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it only five weeks ago today? It seems like a year.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain was holed up in the Manchester Holiday Inn,
preparing to burst forth for his final, frantic weekend of New
Hampshire campaigning. Texas Governor George W. Bush was atop the
Republican world. McCain's crowds were building in size and fervor,
like coastal chop before a thunderstorm. But no one knew then the
Arizonan would blow the doors off the Bushmobile four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians, particularly the first-time-arounders, are
incredibly egocentric in the climactic stages of a grueling
preprimary campaign. But McCain, who's survived enough scrapes and
stress to enliven a dozen normal lifetimes, was curious about some
pols other than himself when yours truly was hailed into his room
to chew the political fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Bill Bradley?'' was his opening query.
Jarrin' John and Battlin' Bill were the Bobbsey Twins of campaign
reform, one from the left, one from the right, joined in symbolic
handshake at Claremont, N.H., pledging their troth to smite the
evil of soft money in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Each started from Ground Zero in New Hampshire, but McCain's
support built steadily as Bradley's faltered. Al Gore's own polls
had him 11 points behind Bradley among most-likely voters. Bradley
oozed confidence, money rolled in. But Gore closed the gap and then
some and with little more than a week to go, Bradley went down to
what he now says was an 18-point deficit, a swing of nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says his mistake was not getting tougher sooner on Gore.
``I did correct that in New Hampshire,'' Bradley told a San Jose
newspaper, eight days before the primary. We went from 18 points to
4 points behind, the margin of Gore's New Hampshire victory. ``If
we had another three or four days,'' lamented Bradley, ``we would
have won, because that's where everything was moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Four points in the first primary may be as close as Bradley will
ever come to Gore, whose methodical sweep through the rest of the
calendar looks destined to doom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In their 10th TV debate Wednesday on CNN, Bradley was dignified,
polite, occasionally eloquent on lofty talking points like race,
leadership, goodness in America, etc. But it will be remembered as
the ``no mas'' debate: no more punches, no more jibes, no more
harsh words about lying. Argued out, tired out, punched out,
Bradley treads docilely to the guillotine, holding his head high,
saying all the right things. but plodding glumly toward Jerusalem
with no real hope of deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Bradley? McCain happened to Bradley. There was
only one volcano this election cycle, delivering the white-hot lava
of urgency on political reform, and that was Mount McCain. McCain
has meant more to the process than all of the other candidates
together. Bradley had some spark early on; his elocution on race
and health care a vague appeal to a more seemly political morality
than that of the Clinton White House struck a chord.
</P>
<P>
   But for the lack of a lot of things that a successful campaign
requires _ energy, experience, allies, urgency, a break on the
issues, and the absence of a charistmatic rival whose star
outshines your own _ Bradley never got rolling. His challenge, his
early media halo, and his brief New Hampshire lead rattled Camp
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But campaigns are all about growing: your crowds growing; the
media attention growing; the money flow; the interview requests;
the number of camera tripods set up for your events. But the thing
that has to grow fastest and sturdiest is your appetite for the
fray, your ability to get rocked and roll with the punches.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley didn't grow. His heart flutters didn't help; he seemed a
quart low in the energy level department; Bradley never exuded the
joy of combat that McCain radiates.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens elsewhere on Super Tuesday, whether McCain gets
skunked in the South again, or gets jobbed in California because
they won't count the Democratic or Independent votes when awarding
the 162 convention delegates to the winner of
Republican-votes-only-please, McCain is the man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   He won't get to be man of the year unless he wins the whole
shebang. But he's already the man to whom most credit is due for
enlivening the political year, elevating the process, inspiring the
young and the disaffected, dragging the debate back to the center,
and striking most boldly for reform of the corrupt money pit that
rots out the foundation of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   He's ahead in Massachusetts and the rest of New England, he's
close in New York, and he's already flown higher and faster than
most of us thought likely. Win or lose in the end, he's still the
story now.

CANDIDATES GIVE SHORT SHRIFT TO FOREIGN CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a campaign dominated by domestic issues and personalities,
how the candidates would handle the foremost responsibilities
vested in the president by the Constitution _ to be commander in
chief of the armed forces and oversee foreign affairs _ has hardly
been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial here, a flurry in a debate there, a few speeches
early-on is about all there has been, and none of it has excited
much public interest. The country has drifted through two
presidencies and a dozen years since the need to redefine America's
role in the post-Cold War world was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Issues in international relations that will challenge the next
president already are simmering: development of antiballistic
missile systems that could protect allies like Taiwan, Japan, and
Israel but antagonize Russia and China; a drug war in Colombia that
could become an El Salvador-style quagmire; continuing erosion of
support for sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   All are intertwined with the need to redefine why, how, and when
the country uses its power, but none of the candidates is saying
anything specific in that regard. They simply say America's
national interest would be a key to decision-making, and this, say
diplomats and other foreign affairs specialists, is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of national interest is about as elastic as chewing
gum,'' said Stanley Hoffmann, longtime head of Harvard University's
center for European studies. ``It's whatever they say it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In foreign affairs, perhaps more than in other realms, Vice
President Al Gore would continue the policies of the Clinton
administration, while Texas Governor George W. Bush would revert to
the Republican internationalist policies that characterized the
presidencies of his father and Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain advocates the more-activist
Republican strain of the Reagan years with his rogue-state rollback
policy, which endorses aid to insurgencies fighting US enemies.
Former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley emphasizes developing the
capacity of NATO and other international organizations to act
without the involvement of US forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have laid the groundwork for increases in military
spending, while McCain and Bradley would hold the line on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Former ambassadors and scholars at a Simmons College conference
on global security this week said the candidates' positions
regarding deployment and use of US power abroad correspond strongly
to their relationships with the Washington power elites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two candidates are deeply in the bubble'' of their party
establishments' thinking, ``and two are refreshingly outside of
it,'' said Trusten Frank Crigler, who was ambassador to Rwanda
during the Carter administration and ambassador to Somalia during
the Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Bush and Gore are shrink-wrapped _ it will be more
of Bush the First or more of Clinton'' if one of them is elected,
he said at the conference. ``McCain and Bradley are prepared to
encounter new problems and think about new approaches. . . . What
we don't need to do is pretend we know solutions'' to the complex
ethnic conflicts proliferating in the post-Cold War ``and try to
impose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy advisers to all four leading candidates said any
decision about using American force abroad would depend on the odds
of success, whether there are any alternatives, and the if other
nations are willing to help.
</P>
<P>
   On a spectrum with traditional, materialist calculations at one
end and moral considerations of human suffering at the other,
``George Bush is very much toward the side of the cold, clear-eyed
calculation of our national security,'' said Richard L. Armitage, a
foreign policy adviser to the Texas governor and a veteran of the
last two Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, values are important,'' Armitage said, and
``interventions to support our values will occasionally occur.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most cautious of the campaigns is Gore's, which
carries the Clinton legacy for better and for worse. The
president's first-term record was marred because Clinton was forced
to back off of a strident posture toward China adopted during the
campaign, and by flawed attempts to improve US positions in Somalia
and Bosnia that he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Leon S. Fuerth, the vice president's national security adviser,
said, ``There is going to be a lot of continuity'' from Clinton to
Gore. ``People at top have learned. What we learned in Haiti was
applied as lessons in Bosnia. What we learned in Bosnia was applied
as lessons in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of reduction in military spending, the
administration increased defense outlays in the current budget, and
Gore has embraced the idea that US forces should be prepared to
fight wars on two fronts without assistance.

   The Bush camp asserts the military has not had the capacity to
wage two major engagements simultaneously for years, but arrives at
its rationale for rebuilding forces along traditional lines by only
a slightly different route.

   ``The United States has interests in every part of the globe,''

   McCain's focus is much more activist. Randy Scheunemann, the
McCain campaign's foreign policy and defense coordinator, said it
amounts to a ``21st century version of the Reagan doctrine'' _
supporting opponents of dictators like Saddam Hussein and Slobodan
Milosevic as much as Reagan supported the opponents of communist
regimes in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates' differences seem to make too much
difference with the electorate. Diplomats, scholars, and partisans
agree on some reasons: The United States is at peace; the
candidates are not challenging one another on foreign policy; and
debate moderators rarely pursue the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Nevetheless, ``many people in the United States have feelings of
unease'' that could quickly alter the political debate if a crisis
arises, Armitage said. ``Unease about five-year shelters (now being
discussed) for the Kosovo troops, unease about the continued
bombing of Iraq, unease about an intervention in Haiti that does
not seem to have left Haiti in a better situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a general unease,'' he said, ``not a major malady in
their minds.''

DEPTH IS ALIEN TO `WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?'

WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM? 
Directed by: Mike Nichols 
Screenplay by: Garry Shandling, Michael Leeson, Ed Solomon, Peter
Tolan 
Starring: Shandling, Annette Bening, Greg Kinnear, Ben Kingsley,
Linda Fiorentino, John Goodman 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' takes the
men-are-from-Mars-women-are-from-Venus thing to new distances, if
not new heights, then walks away. In this new Mike Nichols comedy,
Garry Shandling's character is from another planet, three solar
systems away. Annette Bening's character isn't from Venus, she's
from Earth. But he's sent to Earth because his cloned species
consisting solely of males can't reproduce. His mission is to
impregnate a woman and bring the baby back to his home planet so
they can keep the species going. The film is almost as shaky as the
science, but Nichols knows how to get the most out of what amounts
to a one-joke comedy, and Bening works virtual miracles, keeping
the scenes with Shandling's admittedly emotionless alien afloat.
``What Planet Are You From?'' isn't the comedy it could and perhaps
should have been. Its ambitions are too timid. But, as Mercutio
said of that blade through his ribs, `` 'twill do, 'twill do.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke, of course, is that male dumbness is intergalactic. The
alien has barely landed and slipped into a false identity as a
banker before he's behaving like his colleague, a philandering
lightweight played by Greg Kinnear. What keeps Shandling alive in
the role is that of the two classic comedians' expressions _
absolute certainty and absolute befuddlement _ he is a prince of
the latter. Shandling's face always looks as if it's about to melt,
even when he and Bening's Susan marry, have the baby, and he turns
into a couch potato, who instead of fondling his wife, fondles a
remote control. And this after a torrid honeymoon in which the film
skips a chance for satire by taking only the most perfunctory
swipes at Las Vegas by linking it to newlywed sex via shots of an
erupting fountain and a faux Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The daze in which Shandling's alien stumbles through the film
can be rationalized by the fact that he's supposedly untouched by
anything like human feeling, to the increasing distress of his
wife. Still, it's she who keeps us watching ``What Planet Are You
From?,'' not only because she's simpatico, but because the
precision and sheer juiciness of Bening's line readings are so
gratifyingly savory, even if they constantly remind us that nothing
else in the film comes remotely close to matching them. The
subsidiary characters, who could and should have provided
counterpoint, are insufficiently developed in the screenplay by
Shandling and three others, stranding Kinnear, John Goodman's
government snoop, and especially Linda Fiorentino, who's utterly
wasted in the role of Kinnear's neglected wife.
</P>
<P>
   I may perhaps have made ``What Planet Are you From?'' sound more
glum and less diverting than it actually is. It's not that there
aren't laughs to be had, but the humor too infrequently breaks out
into any really wild or unpredictable territory. It's too lazily
like TV sitcom, with excessive reliance on penis jokes, including a
little glitch involving the reproductive organ with which
Shandling's alien is fitted _ it emits a loud hum when he's
aroused. This means he's forever trying to pass the noise off as
something coming from some appliance or other. Nichols's direction
is clear and shipshape, but the problem is that the Mars-Venus
stuff is scanted once the alien male establishes his urgent need to
have sex and Bening's character voices her need for emotional
context. In view of her flawless performance in ``American
Beauty,'' Bening gets the biggest (perhaps inadvertent) laugh when
she tells the alien upon meeting him that she works as a real
estate agent. Would that this thinly veiled Viagra fantasy had a
fraction of that earlier film's bite.

BOSNIAN EXPATRIOT'S `BEAUTIFUL' CLASH OF CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 
Written and directed by: Jasmin Dizdar 
Starring: Edin Dzandzanovic, Charlotte Coleman, Danny Nussbaum,
Gilbert Martin, Siobhan Redmond, Nicholas Farrell, Frauk Pruti,
Dado Jehan, Nicholas McGaughy, Linda Bassett, Charles Kay, Rosalind
Ayres, Roger Sloman, Heather Tobias 
Running time: 107 minutes 
Rated: R (drug use, language and some violent content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People'' is a comedy of cultural collisions in which
a gaggle of Londoners are jolted out of their usual patterns by
Bosnian refugees and become better for it. It's a spirited and
essentially optimistic film, but it's also simplistic, with most of
the characters seeming scarcely more than stereotypes on both sides
of the cultural divide.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian-born, London-based expatriate filmmaker Jasmin Dizdar
asks audiences to take a few too many Olympics-sized leaps of
faith. We can believe in a romance developing between stranded
Bosnian basketballer Pero (Edin Dzandzanovic) and a free-thinking
medical intern named Portia (Charlotte Coleman) from a stuffy Tory
family. They're fresh and appealing. But the ongoing and
increasingly tedious byplay between two warring Bosnians from the
same village, constantly trying to kill each other from adjoining
beds in a hospital ward, quickly runs out of comic steam. Wouldn't
the busy, overworked staff simply separate them?
</P>
<P>
   There's also a lot of parental disapproval that plays as if it
were transferred intact from a British sitcom. When Portia brings
Pero home to meet her parents, they predictably look down their
noses at him, while he, of course, is miles more sensitive and
proves it by excusing himself from the table, going into the next
room, and playing Chopin on the piano. Lower-middle-class parental
hand-wringing is provided by the despairing dad and mum of a
teenage kid (Danny Nussbaum) who's actually more sensitive than the
pub-crawling, coke-sniffing soccer thug yobbo he works so hard at
being. While Coleman's nurse Portia fights to open up the English
home front, Nussbaum's Griffin becomes separated from his National
Front pals en route to a soccer match in Amsterdam and is airlifted
drunk on a UN plane to Bosnia, where, not surprisingly, exposure to
the suffering he sees makes a big difference in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People,'' set in 1993 when the Bosnian conflict was
at its height, sets up a few situations with which it's impossible
not to empathize, most notably when an obstetrician whose marriage
is falling apart shelters one of his patients, a pregnant Bosnian
woman who was raped. Then there's Gilbert Martin's BBC
correspondent who loses a leg in Bosnia and does not experience an
easy return home. Among the film's many plot strands _ too many to
handle adequately _ these provide a welcome gravity as counterpoint
to what often is a welcome light-handedness and avoidance of
sermonizing on Dizdar's part. It would be heartening to believe
that Bosnia's refugees indeed met with such an across-the-board
outpouring of empathy, but more than this film's will to happy
resolutions is required to convince us that this was the case.

THE CLOSER YOU GET 
Directed by: Aileen Ritchie 
Screenplay by: William Ivory 
Starring: Niamh Cusack, Sean McGinley, Ian Hart, Ewan Stewart, Sean
McDonough, Cathleen Bradley, Pat Shortt, Deborah Barnett, Risteard
Cooper, Ruth McCabe 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief language and some sexual material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Closer You Get'' is an overextended little Irish comedy
that relies rather too heavily on local color and an assumption
that the retrograde sex lives of a bunch of bumpkins in a Donegal
backwater is of more than passing interest. It's hardly ``The Full
Monty,'' or the full anything, as we watch a bunch of Irish Peter
Pans with too much testosterone and free time place an ad in the
Miami Herald, hoping to attract the contemporary equivalent of
American mail-order brides. As their heads dance with visions of an
American babe invasion, they ignore even more than usual the local
women, which only increases the already long odds against the lads.
</P>
<P>
   The film essentially consists of them getting it wrong until the
end, when some of them finally get it right. Meanwhile, the film's
views of an unspoiled corner of Ireland and several engaging
performances can carry the slender and often excessively arch and
inescapably dated material so far after the town goes bonkers when
the parish film society _ the village's only source of movies _
projects Bo Derek's ``10'' by mistake, instead of ``The Ten
Commandments.'' In the aftermath of the uproar, the small-town guys
spend a lot of time stewing in the only pub, with most of the
simmering coming from Ian Hart's butcher, blind to the charms and
the spirit of his pretty young shop assistant, Cathleen Bradley's
Siobhan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ewan Stewart's ex-footballer, now running the pub,
has grown oblivious to his wife, played by Niamh Cusack in one of
the film's subtlest and most glowingly charming performances. Sean
McGinley's balding sheep farmer hasn't though. Given his penchant
for romantic bumbling, he's hardly the one to be dishing out advice
to his younger brother the butcher, although he's improbably
sympathetic all the same. So are Ruth McCabe's sternly moralistic
and censorial postmistress, who steams open any mail she feels may
be sex-connected, and Deborah Barnett's 11-year-old daughter of the
pub-owning couple, who calls her father an idiot for even thinking
of leaving. Although the film presumably is contemporary, its
attitudes and its characters' behavioral patterns are cluelessly
anachronistic. You won't find even the smallest hint of the new
go-go Ireland here.

`AGNES BROWNE' TOO SWEET FOR ITS OWN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AGNES BROWNE 
Directed by: Anjelica Huston 
Screenplay by: John Goldsmith, Brendan O'Carroll (based on
O'Carroll's novel, ``The Mammy'') 
Starring: Huston, Marion O'Dwyer, Niall O'Shea, Ciaran Owens,
Roxanna Williams, Carl Power, Mark Power, Gareth O'Connor, James
Lappin, Ray Winstone, Arno Chevrier, Tom Jones 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Agnes Browne'' is ``Angela's Ashes'' Lite. Not that Anjelica
Huston's second directorial effort lacks authenticity, at least not
when it comes to local color. As the title character, a suddenly
widowed woman with seven children, Huston's Agnes soaks up the
Dublin locations like deep breaths of air in this story written by
an Irish journalist turned novelist, Brendan O'Carroll. Certainly
there's room for an upbeat take, if not a downright cheerful one,
on a struggling family. But, endearing as Huston's gallant widow
and mom in septuplicate may be, ``Agnes Browne'' is a bit too
candied for credibility. There's more liveliness and mischief
shining forth from the faces of the kids on the cover of the
paperback edition of ``The Chisellers,'' second in the trilogy of
which ``The Mammy,'' source of ``Agnes Browne,'' is the first.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and there's always something coming at Agnes. Part of her
survival skills involve not fully knowing exactly how bad the
trouble is, like the way one of her kids falls into the clutches of
the neighborhood loan shark that Agnes herself has told off. Ray
Winstone's thuggish money lender thought he had Agnes under his
thumb when she needed money fast to pay for her husband's funeral.
But she paid him back quickly with her late husband's death benefit
before he could squeeze much exorbitant interest out of her. The
funeral, which does not exactly go off with clockwork precision,
provides one of the film's funniest scenes because it's one of the
few unsentimental ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although sentimentality intrudes on it in a big way, the most
rewarding relationship is between Agnes and her pal, who has the
stall alongside the one from which Agnes sells produce in an
open-air market. Marion O'Dwyer is an Irish stage actress who, so
far as I know, has not appeared in films. She'll appear in plenty
from now on. Any actress who can talk out loud to God at regular
intervals, as her character (also named Marion) is asked to do
here, and still compel us to care what happens to her, is a
presence to be reckoned with. Another engaging newcomer is Arno
Chevrier, as the neighborhood's beefy but gentle French baker,
who'd like to be Agnes' boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The film's slightly dated quality may be explained by the fact
that it takes place in 1967. The kids, all seven of them, are
filled with rambunctiousness and effortlessly convince us they
reciprocate the love their mother showers upon them. Singer Tom
Jones puts in a good-natured appearance toward the end, becoming a
sort of fairy godfather after he learns that Agnes has been
yearning to attend his concert. There's nothing really wrong with
``Agnes Browne,'' except a tendency to take a few easy, convenient
outs. It's content to deal in melodrama rather than drama or
penetrating characterization. It's as mild in its achievements as
it is in its ambitions.

`DROWNING MONA' MAKES A COMIC SPLASH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
DROWNING MONA 
Directed by: Nick Gomez 
Screenplay by: Peter Steinfeld 
Starring: Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Neve Campbell, Jamie Lee
Curtis, Casey Affleck, William Fichtner, Marcus Thomas, Peter
Dobson, Kathleen Wilhoite, Will Ferrell 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some thematic elements, language and brief
sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' is a rudely funny comedy of lowlifes in a
Hudson Valley town that immediately proclaims its collective
loserdom when a title card flashes onscreen at the start and tells
us that tiny, exhausted Verplanck, N.Y., was a test market for
Yugos, which the locals snapped up at giveaway prices. The
recurring sight of everybody tooling around in those boxy little
tin cans on wheels, including the police, lends a surreal tinge to
a film that suggests a cross between ``Throw Momma From the Train''
and ``Murder on the Orient Express.'' Bette Midler's belligerent
harridan named Mona is indeed drowned early on when the brakes on
her bright yellow Yugo stop working and she's plunged off a cliff
and into the Hudson. Despite all those Yugo jokes, it was not a
manufacturing defect.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sorry to see Mona go, including her husband and grown
son. As we see in flashbacks, she was such bad news to so many
people that Danny DeVito's police chief, the only calm, sane person
in town, is faced with the fact that virtually everybody is a
suspect in what can enthusiastically be described as foul play. The
fun comes from watching the deftly juggled ensemble expand the
meaning of foul play from mere murder to the horrific banality of
their daily routines and escapades, sexual and otherwise. A lot
involve landscaping, into which Mona's son, a brutish lout named
Jeph, and his partner, a sweet, dimwitted male bimbo named Bobby
Calzone, introduce surprising amounts of gruesomeness. That Bobby
is the brains of the outfit probably says it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' is executed on a pretty broad level, but if
characterization is slighted, the ensemble is so rich, with such
depth, that every few minutes another juicy turn keeps coming our
way to divert us. It's centered by DeVito's methodical cop, who's
personally involved in the case because he's the father of the
fiancee of one of the suspect landscapers. Casey Affleck makes a
strong impression as the weak pretty boy, Bobby, and Neve Campbell
strides confidently into comic territory at his side, although one
of her funniest scenes occurs when she's introduced to an alternate
reality by Kathleen's Wilhoite's garage mechanic, whose service
station sensibly bears a sign that reads: ``We specialize in
Yugos.'' The town's signage, of which this is hardly the only droll
example, reflects some really heads-up production design.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Thomas makes a favorable impression as Bobby's
Neanderthal partner, but then one of the pleasures of ``Drowning
Mona'' is the way it gives everybody a chance to take a few swings,
and the way most connect. Jamie Lee Curtis is one of the plusses as
a hard-bitten waitress unfussy about her bed partners, and Mark
Pellegrino shines as Bobby's clunky but loyal older brother. And I
wish a few more of the actors had tried to match the wacko gleam in
the eye of the town undertaker, played by Will Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' doesn't finish as strongly as it begins. It
opts for convenient resolution rather than ongoing crude vigor,
dissipating the initial impact of Peter Steinfeld's cheekily
misanthropic script. On the other hand, it marks a welcome return
to film for director Nick Gomez, after a few years of TV work.
Obviously he has learned to juggle large casts and lots of traffic.
His gritty ``Laws of Gravity,'' ``New Jersey Drive,'' and
``Illtown'' were impressive. ``Drowning Mona'' proves he has a
future in black comedy, too.

`THE NEXT BEST THING' IS NOT MADONNA'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE NEXT BEST THING 
Directed by: John Schlesinger 
Screenplay by: Thomas Ropelewski 
Starring: Rupert Everett, Madonna, Malcolm Stumpf, Benjamin Bratt,
Michael Vartan, Josef Sommer, Lynn Redgrave 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (mature thematic elements, sexual content, partial
nudity, language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madonna is a better actress than she's been credited with being,
but ``The Next Best Thing'' isn't one of the films that's going to
prove it. As a single woman who hooks up with the gay best friend
who becomes the father of her child after a martini-drenched night
of Fred &AMP; Ginger routines, she never seems comfortable in the skin
of her character Abbie. Then, a little more than halfway through,
Abbie becomes downright unappealing after she meets an almost
unbelievably nice guy and gets into a ``Kramer vs. Kramer''-style
custody fight with Rupert Everett's gay character, Robert, who has
turned out to be a devoted father and family man. The audience's
sympathy flies to him like iron filings to a magnet, especially
after he has been discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the problematic nature of a subtext suggesting that
heterosexual life brings out the worst in a single mom, the film
has more serious problems, starting with a script that invariably
chooses, with unerringly fatal consistency, the wrong fork in the
road. ``The Next Best Thing'' has a split personality. Never having
decided whether it wants to be comedy or a sentimental
hand-wringer, it tries to be both and winds up being neither.
Certainly Madonna has reason to seem uncomfortable. If her
instincts were telling her that something was missing during the
shoot, they were right, most notably in the scene where the
friendship between Abbie and Robert becomes something more. Instead
of seeming giddy, the cinematic equivalent of bubbles rising to the
top of a flute of champagne, it's flat.
</P>
<P>
   There are other manifestations of flatness. Superficially, the
role has been tailored to accommodate several aspects of Madonna's
offscreen lifestyle, such as Abbie being made a yoga instructor who
exercises a lot. But the actress who seemed so attuned to her own
body in ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' and ``A League of Their Own''
here seems stiff and stilted. Lines fall leadenly from her lips,
conspicuously so in her exchanges with Everett. Whenever Abbie and
Robert engage in a verbal volley, it's painfully obvious which of
them has been trained to speak lines and which of them has not.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna is famous for being disciplined. Her work ethic is one
of the things I like about her. Physically, she's in great shape.
Such great shape that I couldn't help feeling that she'd be better
advised to spend a little less time on the treadmill and a lot more
time in the company of a demanding vocal coach. But the blame for
the absence of chemistry in ``The Next Best Thing'' can hardly be
placed entirely on her doorstep. Madonna's activism on behalf of
gay causes is well-documented, and the film does make an effort to
promote open-mindedness on behalf of nontraditional family
configurations. There's smooth work here as well as tolerance,
especially from the ever-suave Everett as the put-upon partner;
from Benjamin Bratt's Prince Charming; from Lynn Redgrave and Josef
Sommer as his parents; and from Malcolm Stumpf as the 6-year-old
caught in the crossfire. But they can't keep ``The Next Best
Thing'' from deflating, then going sour.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MY DOG SKIP 
Directed by Jay Russell. 
Screenplay by: Gail Gilchriest 
Starring: Frankie Muniz, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson, Kevin Bacon.  
Running time: 95 minutes. 
Rating: Rated PG. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The constituency for My Dog Skip is families, dog-lovers, and
anyone who's a sucker for coming-of-age stories _ but it goes even
beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   In its own quiet, poignant, character-driven way, it's a movie
for almost anyone of any age who's hungry for 95 minutes with a
beguiling story. Youngsters can relate to its authentic depiction
of the agonies and thrills of growing up, or, more accurately, the
struggles and pitfalls of trying to grow up. Adults, particularly
parents, can look upon it from their own perspective, recalling the
agonies and thrills of watching children struggling to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in the 1940s in the deceptively bucolic, sleepy
community of Yazoo, Miss., the hometown of Willie Morris, a former
editor of Harper's, from whose memoir the film is adapted.
</P>
<P>
   My Dog Skip delineates the relationship between an 8- going on
9-year-old boy and his dog in a way that reflects on his sometimes
shaky and even traumatic relationship with his parents and his
peers. The film also subtly etches the unresolved contradictions
and hypocrisies inherent in a small southern town increasingly
compelled to engage World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Willie, played by Frankie Muniz, is an only child, a ``sissy''
who's bullied and ostracized by schoolmates until he takes matters
into his own hands, stands up for himself, and demonstrates his
fortitude. He's intimidated by his father Jack (Kevin Bacon), an
embittered veteran who lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War of the
1930s. He's watched over by his mother Ellen (Diane Lane), who
defies his father and sets the plot in motion by buying him a puppy
for a birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   Skip, a Jack Russell terrier primarily played by a three-year
old named Enzo, is just too cute for words. Occasionally, he
threatens to upset the equilibrium of the film when encouraged by
the script to show off his winsome tricks.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a simplification to say that Skip, with his eagerness
to please and be loved, emotionally rescues Willie and solves all
of his problems. Still, Skip and Willie's parents work mightily on
each other's behalf to keep Willie on track. Until, that is, in a
fit of tense pique, Willie cuffs Skip, inadvertently driving him
away.
</P>
<P>
   The war's impact on Yazoo and Willie is personified by Willie's
friendly all-American next-door neighbor Dink Jenkins (Luke
Wilson), a high school football hero going off to war. Dink's
departure seems ominous but he returns home, albeit a quite
different guy than the one who left.
</P>
<P>
   The film's vintage setting is as much a character as any other.
Some of the best moments evoke the best parts of easygoing small
town life in a bygone era. The relationship between Jack and Ellen
simmers with occasional tension but never erupts into anything
melodramatic.

A FIRST-GRADE LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday is my day to help out with the book-of-the-week in my
daughter's first grade class.
</P>
<P>
   This week, my group read a story about a red hen. Then we picked
out words to look up in the dictionary. One boy, unconvinced that
the task was fun or worthwhile, used the dictionary to hit himself
on the head _ not hard enough to hurt, just hard enough to distract
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   I walked out thinking how tough it could be to teach first
grade. Soon afterward, I learned what happened that day in another
first grade class. A 6-year-old boy shot and killed a 6-year-old
girl in a school near Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of a shooting incident happening at a school near you
is statistically remote. Because of the ages of the children
involved, this is an especially extreme example.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistical remoteness did not stop my daughter from
hearing the news on television and asking some difficult questions
before she left for school the next morning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, why did the boy shoot the girl? How did he get a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old who shot Kayla Renee Rolland will probably never
be able to explain why he did it, although we are already drawing
some conclusions based on what we know about him so far.
</P>
<P>
   Before this incident, his life was a shambles. He had a father
in prison and a mother who sent him to live in a crackhouse. He had
no real home, let alone anyone to teach him values.
</P>
<P>
   The story forces us, once again, to analyze a culture that not
only celebrates guns and violence, but allows some unfortunate
children to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but this story also forces me to do
something else: focus more clearly on issues during this
presidential campaign. That is something I have avoided, not unlike
the little boy in my daughter's class who refused to open the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Why does a .32-caliber bullet fired into the chest of a
6-year-old do that? Because it pierces the bubble of superficial,
even irrational, thinking about personality and style that has
permeated so much of the presidential campaign to date. Such
thinking is surprisingly seductive, even to someone who never
stepped foot on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Character counts. So does heroism, although heroes do not always
choose that role; often, fate foists it upon them.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, issues must count, too, issues like a
person's feelings about guns and what that person is willing to do
to control them.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the special interests, the country's gun lobby remains
incredibly potent, stronger, it seems, than the will of its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be the one-year anniversary of the 12 shooting
deaths at Columbine High School, an execution carried out
methodically by two teenage boys who easily obtained guns.
</P>
<P>
   None of the publicity about that horror, nor any other shooting
to date, has made it any harder for anyone in America to get a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the Michigan first-grader prompted President
Clinton to appeal to the American electorate to make tighter gun
control laws an issue of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore advocates registration for all new
handguns. Bill Bradley, his Democratic challenger, has called for
the registration of every handgun in America _ and why not? We
register cars. Why not guns? Texas Governor George W. Bush and US
Senator John McCain oppose all handgun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Gun registration is not the solution to violence, but it is a
piece of solving the puzzle, along with safety requirements like
trigger locks and laws to make adults criminally responsible for
their children's violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are generally deft at turning the debate away from
gun control and toward theory _ the impact of violence on
television, the movies, video games, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty to theorize about when it comes to trying to
figure out why a 6-year-old boy would think of a gun as a solution
in his young, sad life. As the Michigan prosecutor investigating
the case put it: ``He is a victim in many ways. It is very sad, we
need to put our arms around him and love him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing theoretical about the gun that killed
Kayla. It was loaded and lying in a bedroom. A little boy picked it
up and took it to school. Now a little girl is dead. A gun, not the
circumstances of anyone's life, killed her in what should be the
safest of havens _ a classroom.

RAITT USES INDUCTION INTO HALL TO PRAISE COLLEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bonnie Raitt has inducted four artists into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame _ Ma Rainey, John Lee Hooker, Ruth Brown, and Charles
Brown. On Monday in Manhattan, Raitt will finally be inducted. It's
hard to believe she has been eligible for five years and just
getting in now, but she's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised to get in, actually,'' she says. ``I
didn't get to be a big deal until just 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Raitt had been a big deal in blues circles for years before that
_ dating to the early '70s, after she learned from blues masters
who passed through Cambridge during her Radcliffe days. But she
didn't become widely known until her ``Nick of Time'' single topped
the charts a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people don't think of Raitt as a hit machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be getting in because of who I am, and not because
of how many records I've sold,'' says Raitt, who will be inducted
with Eric Clapton, James Taylor, and others.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known activist as well as singer, Raitt couldn't let the
opportunity pass to suggest other artists who should be inducted.
One is Johnnie Johnson (Chuck Berry's pianist), the other Ritchie
Valens, the ``La Bamba'' singer who died in a plane crash with
Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper. There has been a major movement in
recent years to induct Valens, but so far, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's typical for Raitt to publicize deserving artists _
something she's also done as a longtime trustee of the Rhythm and
Blues Foundation, which gives annual pioneer awards. Says Raitt:
``I'm all for honoring people who have gone before. My fame is all
about shedding light on performers and issues that don't always get
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, she's upset that the R&AMP;B Foundation's Pioneer
Awards ceremony, which usually takes place the day after the
Grammys, was postponed this winter because of lack of sponsorship.
She's hoping that sponsors will come forward so the awards can be
held this fall. As a trustee, she's also been a key figure in
lobbying record labels to pay royalties to many pioneers who never
got them in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   As for political activism, Raitt continues to perform many
benefits for causes ranging from Native American rights to
environmental issues. She's also endorses the Green Party, whose
presidential candidates are Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no chance to win, but they give us the chance to get
issues discussed,'' says Raitt. ``And I'm pleased that there's a
lot of amazing action going on at the grass-roots level in this
country, versus the dog-and-pony show of the presidential
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Raitt ever think of running for a political office?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``I'm in a unique position in the culture to
raise money and I wouldn't want to lose that. It's better for me to
be outside the culture in some ways. Plus, without campaign reform,
the political scene is disheartening. Elections are just bought
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Raitt has also been enjoying some personal time (she doesn't
plan to release an album this year). She's going through a divorce,
but not moaning about it. ``We just grew apart, and our schedules
made it difficult to see each other,'' she says of her marriage to
actor Michael O'Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is she remaining static in her music. She just spent three
weeks in Mali to meet Afro-pop musicians, as part of an excursion
organized by World Music Productions in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a week ago, I was hiking up a mountain to a village in
Mali,'' she says. ``I have a great life and I know it.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Toni Lynn set to fly: Susan Tedeschi is in the national
spotlight now, but her label-mate, Toni Lynn Washington, is primed
for national attention herself. Both artists are signed to
Tone-Cool Records, which just released Washington's striking new
CD, ``Good Things.'' It's a keen mix of contemporary blues and soul
_ and the best thing that Washington has done in a career
stretching back three decades to the days when she opened shows for
Jackie Wilson and Sam &AMP; Dave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with it,'' Washington says. ``It required a
lot of time, but was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort shows. Washington opens it with the richly soulful
(and aptly titled) ``Good Things Come to Those Who Wait,'' a love
song she cowrote with her bassist, Bruce Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully produced by local legend Bobby B. Keyes (who has
worked with Jerry Lee Lewis), the CD combines finger-popping
grooves with smoldering ballads that evoke the likes of Irma Thomas
and Etta James. There are songs by Percy Mayfield and Johnnie
Taylor, plus a pair from Washington's guitarist, Tim Gearan, who
formerly worked with Tedeschi and also plays with his own band at
Toad in Cambridge every Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who has often put her career on hold to raise her
two sons and two daughters, is such a modest person that, when
asked about her own style, she says, ``Style is something I didn't
know I had until I heard it on this CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust us, she's got it _ and her humility only makes you love
her more.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who was born in North Carolina but raised in Boston,
sang with Boston Baked Blues in the '80s, before she and Bears
formed the Toni Lynn Washington Band 10 years ago. She has played
about every local club since then _ and often with Tedeschi in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd come to most of our gigs,'' Washington says. ``She was
such a vibrant young lady. When I'd see her in the audience, I'd
ask her to come up and sing. Sometimes she wouldn't want to, but
she'd always come up in the end because she's so courteous. And
now, I'm blown away that I know somebody who started out like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is lining up more national gigs herself, and plans to
tour Europe. She is giving up her day job as a telephone
receptionist to tour. ``It's time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>

   Carlos Santana's ``Supernatural'' album, after winning a record
nine Grammy Awards last week, has set another record with the
all-time greatest post-Grammy sales ``spike'' (increase) in
history. This past week over 1.1 million copies were sold
worldwide, including 583,071 in the United States. That's 166
percent increase (nearly 365,000 units) over the previous week's
sales of 219,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural,'' produced by Clive Davis and Carlos Santana,
has sold a total of more than 9 million copies in the United States
and 13 million worldwide. The album also is the top-selling album
of all time by an artist of Latin heritage.

MAKING DARWIN SPEAK OF MADNESS

A Natural History of Rape 
Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion 
Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer 
MIT Press, 251 pp., $28.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science can seem like a reductive world, full of clean lines and
pinpoint inquiry. But, in reality, it can sometimes be as
politicized as any presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with this treatise on the dark side of Darwin
by Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer, ``The Natural History of
Rape.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornhill and Palmer hold that the ultimate causes of human rape
are to be found in the evolution of male and female sexuality. Men
often desire numerous sexual partners during a lifetime, they note,
while women are more choosy. True enough, by most accounts. But
neither gender fares well in this explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``If human females had been selected to be willing to mate with
any male under any circumstances, rape would not occur. On the
other hand, if human males had been selected to be sexually
attracted to only certain females under certain limited
circumstances, rape would be far less frequent. Indeed, if human
males had been selected to desire sexual intercourse only with
females who showed unmistakable willingness to copulate with them,
rape would be an impossibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not their use of animal and insect studies that subtracts
from their science _ that kind of field work is a necessity in
anthropology or evolutionary biology. It's their portrait of man as
predator and woman as, well, Betty Rubble.
</P>
<P>
   If our encoded history affects the way we live our lives, so
does the fine moire of civility we've layered over it. Thornhill
and Palmer mention sociologist Emile Durkheim and his work on
religious life, but leave him hanging. And what about our impulse
to art and intellect, language and government _ all sometimes
successful at tamping down the primitive fires inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their research simply seems cruel, especially their
attempts to establish a scale of psychic pain for rape victims. ``A
rape victim's degree of psychological pain depends on her age (more
psychological pain if she is of reproductive age), on her mateship
status (more psychological pain if she is married), on the nature
of the sex act (more psychological pain if penile-vaginal
intercourse occurred). . . '' Does an 80-year-old widow really feel
less pain when she is raped because she is infertile?
</P>
<P>
   Thornhill and Palmer come to the thumping conclusion that rape
is about sex, not violence, and excoriate feminist scholars such as
Susan Brownmiller who hold the opposite view. But can't it be about
both? Violence and sex, power and sex, are entwined throughout
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Thornhill and Palmer seem too intent on settling
scores. Midway through their book, they interject a chapter that is
bound to puzzle most lay readers, despite whatever urgency it holds
for the academy: ``Why Have Social Scientists Failed to
Darwinize?''
</P>
<P>
   They continue: ``Why have researchers attempting to discover the
evolutionary causes of rape been denied positions at universities?
Why have organizers of scholarly conferences attempted to keep
papers on evolutionary analysis of rape from being presented? Why
have editors of scholarly journals refused to publish papers
treating rape in a Darwinian perspective?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a reader hoping to understand humanity's primal
roots and the role of evolution is better served by earlier works,
such as the evocative book ``Demonic Males'' by Dale Peterson and
Harvard scholar Richard Wrangham.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's march of the species certainly holds keys to
understanding _ of nature, of nurture, of personality, of human
development. Those questions deserve more dispassionate inquiry. In
the end, this is science befogged.

THE PICK OF THE THEATER CROP IN THE BIG APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much consternation has been expressed this year about
the dearth of new plays on Broadway, and how anyone out for a
``substantive'' theatrical experience has to go off-Broadway. If
one takes four of the hottest tickets in New York and adds in the
about-to-conclude successful run of Arthur Miller's ``The Price,''
it's not clear such an analysis is justified.
</P>
<P>
   If you accept that a top ticket of $75 to $80 is not going to
get any lower _ and it isn't _ then it's reasonable to expect a
theatrical experience that pays some significant intellectual or
emotional return on that investment. The three Broadway shows I saw
last week _ ``The Price,'' ``James Joyce's The Dead,'' and ``Kiss
Me, Kate'' _ are theater-going experiences of such intensity that I
doubt many in the audience of any of them are begrudging their
money on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The two hot off-Broadway plays _ ``Dinner With Friends'' and
``Fuddy Meers'' _ are well-written, well-produced, recommendable
pieces of theater. But along with ``Fully Committed,'' another hot
off-Broadway show, they don't seem like they belong on Broadway,
not because they take so many risks but because they take so few.
Next to the other three they seem like the theatrical equivalent of
situation comedies.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that there aren't big, bombastic nothings on
Broadway or excellent theater that comes from off-Broadway like
``The Vagina Monologues.'' ``The Dead,'' in fact, began life
off-Broadway, but ``The Dead,'' ``The Price,'' ``Contact'' and
``Copenhagen'' show that there is something of a natural evolution
taking place. (``Contact,'' like ``The Dead,'' just moved from
off-Broadway to Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   Because there is such a high cost for the failure of new plays
on Broadway it makes sense that producers look for plays to make
their mark somewhere else. The Williamstown Theatre Festival,
whence came ``The Price,'' has been such a conduit. ``One of the
things we have access to,'' said Michael Ritchie, who runs WTF,
``is housing. We can bring up to 500 people here to do shows that
other theaters can't do, like two Shakespeare plays last season
with large-scale casts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``The Price,'' which had critics swooning,
Ritchie said that the producer David Richenthal, who produced last
season's ``Death of a Salesman,'' came up to see it with Miller.
``Arthur said to David, `I really like this production' and we've
known David for years,' so that fell into place pretty easily with
Arthur and David behind it. That moved to Broadway almost lock,
stock and barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   The swooning, not so incidentally, was entirely justified. This
is a gut-wrenching, emotionally draining production of a play that
explores the dynamics of sacrifice and independence within the
family structure while shaking its fist at the system that forces
people into such unsatisfactory choices. People come to Miller
expecting earnestness and didacticism, but ``The Price'' is funny
and ambiguous. Partly because Harris Yulin gives such a phenomenal
performance as the financially succesful brother who turned his
back on his father, there's no clear-cut right and wrong in this
play. It closes Sunday and if you're going to be in New York this
weekend, this should be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Another way for quality plays to get to Broadway is to start at
a smaller theater and prove its worth, which is how ``James Joyce's
The Dead'' moved. One can imagine the skepticism of a producer
hearing about turning Joyce into a musical, but five minutes into
it you wonder why nobody ever thought of it before.
</P>
<P>
   The short story is full of music as it takes place at the Misses
Morkans' annual dance. Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey have done a
fine job embelleshing Joyce's music with a selection of
traditional, operatic, and new seletions of ballads and
toe-tappers. The musical is a bit warmer and cozier than both the
story and John Huston's movie, but it still captures the
magisterial nature of the mystery of ``The Dead.'' At the same time
it more than hints at Joyce's rebellion against the narrowness of
Ireland while acknowledging the comforts within such a world.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Brown, Sally Ann Howes, Marni Nixon, and Stephen Spinella
live up to their accolades but Chrisopher Walken as Gabriel has not
been universally admired for his edgier (isn't that a surprise?)
performance. I thought he made the show with his nervous, or nervy,
command of the stage and his ability to suggest some of the darker
and more complex forces at work in the story. He may not have the
vocal chords of the others, but his delivery of the final song
based on the last paragraph of the story is the most indelible part
of the show. Brown, incidentally, will soon be leaving this show
for Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' which follows ``The Price''
into the Royale Theatre. ``Copenhagen'' follows another path to
Broadway. It began at the Royal National Theatre in London,
transferred to the West End, and now leaps across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' or its
path to Broadway. Revivals are reviled by those clamoring for new
musicals but the public is entirely justified in preferring to fork
over 80 bucks for a show with this kind of energy over the
enervating tunelessness of ``Side Show'' and ``Parade'' (and
``Marie Christine'' if the reviews were accurate).
</P>
<P>
   One of the only musicals in the past 10 years that can keep
company with the oldies was ``Ragtime'' and ``Kiss Me, Kate''
reunites two of the stars of that show, Brian Stokes Mitchell and
Marin Mazzie. Mitchell is a rioutous Fred Graham, the producer
staging a musical version of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' with his
ex-wife. There's an infectious energy to his presence and Mazzie's
more operatic voice provides a suitable counterpoint although when
she lets her hair down in and when she lets her hair down in ``I
Hate Men,'' there's nothing not to love.
</P>
<P>
   A score with the likes of ``Another Op'nin' Another Show,'' ``So
In Love,'' ``Too Darn Hot,'' ``Where Is the Life That Late I
Led?'', ``Always True to You (In My Fashion,'' and ``Brush Up Your
Shakespeare'' has enough going on in and of itself. When you add
production values like Michael Berresse scaling the scaffolding in
pursuit of his Bianca you have a musical that gives revivals a good
name.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Off-Broadway
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all the virtues of ``Dinner With Friends'' and ``Fuddy
Meers'' they simply don't provide that sense of being taken out of
oneself that the three Broadway plays and musicals do. ``Dinner
With Friends'' makes you think about relationships; ``The Price''
shakes you to the core. ``Fuddy Meers'' gets some laughs out of the
dysfunctional family; ``The Dead'' doesn't settle for anything half
as easy.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that ``Dinner With Friends'' and ``Fuddy
Meers'' aren't worth the trip outside of Midtown (check). In
``Dinner With Friends'' Donald Margulies (``Collected Stories'')
pits one divorcing couple against a stable one to explore some of
the issues that Miller explores in ``The Price.'' Is it better to
leave an unhealthy family life behind and set out on one's own or
stay and do the best one can?
</P>
<P>
   Margulies engages the debate with a winning sense of humor and a
smart sense of story-telling. Each of the four characters feels
like a real, flawed human being with whom it's easy to identify and
Neil Patel's sets feel wonderfully lived in, particularly the
kitchens. Relationships come together, relationships fall apart,
but we all need to keep eating. If ``Thirtysomething'' had been
well-written it would have come out like this story of
fortysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuddy Meers'' has an engaging sense of humor of the more
absurdist variety. Every day Claire (J. Smith-Cameron) wakes up she
has almost completely forgotten what has gone before. And if you
had a family like hers perhaps you would too. One day someone
claiming to be her brother kidnaps her from someone claiming to be
her husband. Bro has a John Candy-ish accomplice who often speaks
through his hand puppet and Claire's mother has had a stroke that
makes her say things like ``fuddy meers'' instead of ``funny
mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Pinter used similar memory problems in ``A Kind of
Alaska'' to explore the vagaries of identity. David Lindsay-Abaire
is content to tickle the funny bone, albeit with an off-center
feather. Marijuana jokes abound and ``Fuddy Meers'' has a kind of
potty sensibility about it, for better and worse.
</P>
<P>
   The ``for worse'' is that there seems like there's nothing at
stake in ``Fuddy Meers.'' These five plays may be a flawed snapshot
in time, but these days in New York it seems like you get what you
pay for.
</P>
<P>

   ``The Price'' closes Sunday at the Royale Theatre. Open-ended
runs continue for ``James Joyce's The Dead'' at the Belasco
Theatre, ``Kiss Me, Kate'' at the Martin Beck Theatre; ``Dinner
With Friends'' at the Variety Arts Theatre; and ``Fuddy Meers'' at
the Minetta Lane Theatre.

MY GARDEN (BOOK) 
By Jamaica Kincaid 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 229 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Jamaica Kincaid really writing about gardening? If not, what
is she writing about?
</P>
<P>
   This book is a challenge to her fans, who may wonder why they're
wading through complaints about wisteria _ and also for gardeners
who share her preoccupation with this vine, but who may become
confused by her digressions into the evils of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Though this memoir uses gardening as a metaphor for conquest and
slavery, and as a general jumping-off point for random musings, it
is indeed about gardening. But it's about the feelings gardening
evokes, rather than how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening does tend to attract perfectionists, who are doomed to
be (mostly) dissatisfied with the results of their efforts even as
they create beauty for everyone around them. Like garden writers
Christopher Lloyd and the late Henry Mitchell, Kincaid assumes the
well-worn persona of the curmudgeonly gardener who experiences
continual irritation interrupted by moments of ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid's style requires patience. Her serpentine repetitions
approximate the trance-like altered state that gardeners fall into
when they've lost themselves to planning and planting their
paradises. But her voice becomes something abruptly new and
different when she frames her gardening passion with an angry Third
World political perspective. A native of the former British colony
of Antigua, which was built on slave labor, Kincaid describes
herself as ``of the conquered class and living in a conquered
place,'' and launches salvos against the unspoken assumptions and
conventions of the gardening-writing genre.
</P>
<P>
   The white and the wealthy could play at working the land for
beauty and looked down on the black and the poor who worked it for
food and supposedly lacked aesthetic sensibilities. If you are from
the ``conquered class'' who labored in the fields without choice,
Kincaid writes, to garden for the pure joy of it is a form of
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid also shares an outsider's perspective on the four
seasons, and particularly winter. To grow up on a Caribbean island
and then become a gardener in frigid Vermont may seem a misguided
choice, but this is probably seminal to her passion. It is long
winters, not endless summers, that make people obsessive gardeners:
Out of the months of dark and cold is born the longing to grow
things. Kincaid evokes the deprivation of winter, and how gardeners
live in anticipation of an imagined future that is sweeter than the
reality could ever be. This book may be the best ever written about
the gardener in winter, for Kincaid is inspired by that season's
discontent and longing more than by summer's successes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, Kincaid is so front and center in this
memoir that she sometimes blocks our view of the people and
landscapes she visits. This is too bad, because she goes places
most gardeners only dream of, such as the Chelsea Flower Show in
England and a plant-hunting expedition in China in the company of
some world-class horticulturalists.
</P>
<P>
   But her book is also about a struggling beginner on a quest. She
is terrific when writing about the willful plans that sway like
opium poppies in the fever dream of the typical novice gardener.
It's all here: the continual bewilderment, the strong but baseless
opinions, the flipflops of taste, the enthusiasm that goes dancing
off in a dozen directions, unrestrained by knowledge of what is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jamaica Kincaid has written a book about gardening!
When you are bitten by the gardening bug, when you have this
obsession through which you see the world, and when it's winter,
why would you write about anything else?

STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With sugar this sweet, John McCain's campaign was headed for
diabetic shock. It came this week. In a speech intended to bust
some chops on the Christian far right, McCain called Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson ``agents of intolerance'' who are ``an evil
influence'' over the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and task on the forces of evil, that's my job . .
. You're supposed to tolerate evil in your party in the name of
party unity? That's not what the party is all about. That's not
what Abraham Lincoln said our party was about.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain confectionery has many moderate Democrats and even
Massachusetts liberals crossing over to vote for this Republican in
the primaries. Like ``There's Something About Mary,'' the movie in
which an eclectic group of guys woo a woman merely on her sweet
looks, McCain's town hall rapport, POW record, and railings against
big money have voters salivating for more sugar. Few are yet
reaching for the insulin.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about McCain. But it is not sweet or pretty.
Here is the real ``straight talk.'' He opposes abortion, bans on
assault weapons, gun waiting periods, hate-crime laws, affirmative
action, federal funds for the arts and public broadcasting, and
bans on job discrimination against gay people.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says his favorite current Supreme Court justice is its
most conservative, Antonin Scalia. He supported the Contract With
America, which would have given massive tax cuts to wealthier
Americans while slashing Medicare and Medicaid for the poor and
elderly and cutting aid to education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke about intolerance and evil in the Republican Party,
yet he tolerates intolerance and evil in his own campaign. Two
weeks ago in the South Carolina primary his top campaign strategist
was Richard Quinn. Quinn, a guru for the likes of Ronald Reagan,
Strom Thurmond, and, yes, Pat Robertson, is the editor of the
quarterly magazine Southern Partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Partisan clearly wishes the South could return to a
civilization before civil rights and the Civil War. A few
newspapers and magazines and the People for the American Way have
taken an interest in Quinn's employment by McCain. But the
connection has not yet forced him to weather the national scolding
that forced George W. Bush to issue a statement of regret about his
speech at the racist, homophobic, and anti-Catholic Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   This is interesting, since employing Quinn is at least as bad as
employing Falwell or Robertson. Quinn has said that slave masters
kept slave families together for their ``peace and happiness.'' He
has said that ex-slaves who stayed tied to their former masters,
assumedly as demeaned sharecroppers, were better off ``than their
cousins who ended up sleeping with rats in Harlem.'' Southern
Partisan has said that ex-Ku Klux Klan leader and politician David
Duke was ``a populist spokesperson for a recapturing of the
American ideal.'' It recently praised a book that said, ``No one
can doubt the effectiveness of the original Ku Klux Klan. Without
it we might never have shaken off the curse off the carpetbag,
scalawag governments which bound us hand and foot.''
</P>
<P>
   A Partisan column said, ``Negroes, Asians, and Orientals (is
Japan the exception?); Hispanics, Latins, and Eastern Europeans;
have no temperament for democracy, never had, and probably never
will.'' Quinn called the Martin Luther King Day ``vitriolic and
profane.'' While praising Duke, Quinn called Nelson Mandela a
``terrorist.'' His magazine said God gave South Africa to the
Afrikaners against the ``bloodthirsty savages.'' Another column
said AIDS is God's way of punishing homosexuals, ``the most
repulsive desecration in the sexual order.''
</P>
<P>
   With Quinn around, it is no wonder that McCain matched Bush's
lily liver in refusing to criticize the Confederate flag. McCain
says the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln. But Southern
Partisan says Lincoln was a traitor, selling Lincoln T-shirts with
the ``Sic semper tyrannis'' (``Thus always to tyrants'') that John
Wilkes Booth shouted in assassinating Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, McCain has screamed a ``Sic semper tyrannis''
against big money and politics as usual. But his association with
Quinn might put a chill in people the next time McCain is referred
to as the ``insurgent'' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain claims to know nothing about Southern Partisan and
Quinn's views. This worked in South Carolina. But he did not quit
while he was ahead. Having been a mere coward in South Carolina, he
now speaks about intolerance as if he wants to steal the label of
compassionate conservative from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might consider that sweet food for thought, given
the Republican Party's aid and comfort to bigots. Until McCain
stops doing business with the likes of Richard Quinn, his words are
empty calories.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed something about McCain. Promising us sugar, he
delivers to us at least one top campaign strategist who would
return America to a sour, bitter yesteryear. So much for ``straight
talk.''

BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS WEB SITES FUEL HOT SEGMENT OF E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Within the forest of tall construction cranes that
tower over Boston's Big Dig highway project, electronic-commerce
entrepreneur Dominic Johnson sees a bright future for himself.
</P>
<P>
   His vision is made up of the backhoes, cranes, and hoists that
now are at work here, but when no longer needed could be sold to
contractors on jobs in other cities _ through AssetLine.com, the
Web auction site that Johnson, 25, a former securities broker, is
launching from offices in Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Burlington, meanwhile, Paul Baier, a veteran of
e-commerce, is overseeing development of another business vision _
an online bazaar of brooms, floor cleaners, fuses, fans, electric
motors, and tools.
</P>
<P>
   Baier's Web site, PurchasingCenter.com, is aimed at factory and
building managers, who regularly buy these goods to keep their
facilities running. The start-up got $26 million in venture capital
last month, and expects to launch its online catalog, with 250,000
product listings, on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   If 1999 was a milestone year for retail e-commerce, 2000 is the
year for business-to-business Web sites _ B2B for short.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest of these are the ``hub'' sites, or Web addresses
that bring together many suppliers in one place that offer a range
of products and services to targeted groups of customers.
</P>
<P>
   For all, the attraction is B2B's potential to cut costs by
reducing time spent by salesmen on the road and writing up paper
orders, and providing a way for buyers to instantly comparison-shop
among a world of suppliers. Sellers say lower overhead costs should
lead to lower prices, while buyers expect such a wealth of
information will give them better bargaining leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive illustration of business-to-business
e-commerce's promise is the announcement last week by Detroit's Big
Three automakers for an online purchasing exchange for the $200
million worth of parts and materials that the auto industry
collectively buys each year. Two global retail giants, Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. and Paris-based Carrefour SA, followed this week with
a plan to match retailers and their suppliers online.
</P>
<P>
   Online ordering of parts and supplies is, in fact, an idea with
some history, pioneered by defense industries in the 1980s. James
A. Manzi, after leaving Lotus Development Corp. following that
company's takeover by IBM Corp. in 1995, tried popularizing the
concept with an early B2B site, Industry.Net. But the company went
bankrupt in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of software that automated online buying and
selling changed the picture. After Amazon.com and others put these
tools to work at the consumer level, other entrepreneurs quickly
figured that trading carload lots of industrial goods could roll up
profits faster than selling books one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of this year, more than 1,000
business-to-business hubs were online, according to Erica
Rugullies, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   Some B2B companies, such as Ariba.com, FreeMarkets.com, and
CommerceOne.com, are hits on Wall Street and focus on large
companies' needs for industrial parts and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as SupplierMarket.com of Burlington and
PurchasingCenter.com, aim to fill a similar role for smaller
companies. Baier has drawn an even smaller target market for
PurchasingCenter.com _ plant maintenance engineers and shift
foremen _ people who, he says, ``stand on cement floors eight hours
a day and wear safety goggles, and need halogen lamps and floor
waxes to keep things running smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside these are hundreds of even more tightly focused sites
serving single industries or single product categories. This list
includes PaperExchange.com of Boston, serving the paper industry;
GoFish.com of Portland, Maine, an online exchange for seafood;
Bulbs.com of Worcester for lighting supplies; and MRO.com of
Bedford for business software.
</P>
<P>
   By next January, Rugullies thinks 10,000 B2B hub sites could be
operating in the United States. ``Everyone and their brother is
building hub sites,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And many are attracting big investors. PricewaterhouseCoopers
found 268 business-to-business start-ups nationwide shared $2.6
billion in investment from venture funds last year _ six times more
companies than in 1998, and 10 times the money.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge forecasts
business-to-business online deals in the United States alone will
reach $2.7 trillion a year in 2004, about 15 percent of all online
sales.
</P>
<P>
   David Delande, an electrical supplies distributor in Peabody,
who has signed to sell products through PurchasingCenter.com,
explains: ``The conventional route would be to write a requisition,
send it to purchasing, which would send it to my salespeople, who
would do more paperwork, and we would do the billing.'' Delande
says eliminating such steps will let him discount the prices he
posts online.
</P>
<P>
   Changing buying habits could take time. ``A lot of purchasing
directors fear their jobs are on the line,'' says Christiane Loup
of the Purchasing Managers Association of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lohse, e-commerce research director at the Wharton School
at the University of Pennsylvania, says this fear is overblown, but
is based on a kernel of truth. ``People who don't add much value to
a transaction will be displaced and replaced by new intermediaries
that are more efficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies that don't now have Internet connections will
have to get them and train employees how to use the Web. At
E-wood.com, a start-up auction site for the lumber and wood
products industry, founders Lincoln Alden and Arnold Kraft have set
up classes to teach loggers, sawmill operators, and wood products
manufacturers about computers and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing agents, while cost-conscious, also worry about
breaking relations with trusted vendors and salespeople. Lisa
Bankowski-Call, purchasing director at Zoom Telephonics Inc. in
Boston, says the Internet has proved very useful in finding
hard-to-get items like flash-memory chips, applauds the chance to
save money. ``But I think for most purchases in companies like ours
you will always need a person . . . who understands your
business,'' she said. ``It comes down to loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industries lend themselves better to electronic commerce
than others. Lohse, at the Wharton School, cites Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co. research predicting aerospace, electronics, and the computer
industry itself will be big online buyers and sellers. Paper,
steel, health care and the coal industry scored lower. But, Lohse
said, ``When you look at the efficiencies that even these
industries can gain in terms of dollar value, you still are talking
about a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Manzi, while bruised by his Industry.Net experience, had it
right. Only his timing was wrong. After the bankruptcy, the Web
site name ended up with Information Handling Services Group, a
privately held Denver company that publishes online databases for
25 industrial sectors _ and makes a profit.

``The Bold and the Beautiful's'' Adrienne Frantz, holding one of
her cats, Lulu, in the bedroom of her new home, loves it here:
``It's a great place to wake up in the morning.'' Charlotte
Schmid-Maybach/Daily News 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Adrienne Frantz's alarm goes off, she awakens to see
squirrels skittering up and down the towering pine tree outside the
window of her airy bedroom, and the Valley laid out before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being up in the trees,'' the soap star said,
cuddling one of her four cats, Angel Larue. ``It's a great place to
wake up in the morning. It's so peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet is something Amber Moore _ the teen-age hellion
Frantz has played on the daytime soap opera ``The Bold and the
Beautiful'' for the past three years _ doesn't know much about.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet-faced little golddigger worked as the rag-trade-rich
Forrester family's baby-sitter, seduced the young heir to the
family fortune, got pregnant, married him (even though he was in
love with another girl), gave birth to his (or (BEGIN
ITALICS)was(END ITALICS) it his?) stillborn baby, buried it in a
desert grave and stole her cousin's baby to pass off as the
Forrester grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Amber sick of her life of lies and dealing with the
consequences, Frantz is playing the kind of scenes she loves _
meaty and filled with emotion. The role brought her a nomination
for the Outstanding Younger Lead Actress at Friday's Soap Opera
Digest Awards.
</P>
<P>
   When Frantz gets totally out of character, she settles into her
new home in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   The three-level, renovated 1925 house, which she and her mom,
Vicki, a clinical psychologist, moved into in October, is still a
little bare, but that's to be expected. It's the 21-year-old's
first house, a maze of 26 white-carpeted rooms on three levels,
built up the side of a hill criss-crossed by meandering paths and
dizzying staircases, punctuated by a lush garden, terraces and
decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I came to L.A. three years ago, I've wanted a house,''
Frantz said, comfortably ensconced on the sandstone hearth of her
art deco carved fireplace, amid candles and bowls of rose-petal
potpourri collected from her garden. ``It always was my goal, and I
just started putting part of my paycheck aside for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, I just said, `Today I'm ready to buy a house,'
and this is the first one I looked at. I walked through the gate
and said, `When can I move in?' It just felt like this was !ital!my
place. This was where I was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a comfortable fit. The actress lives on the two upper
floors, accessible from one street, and mom has a separate
residence on the bottom floor, with its own garden and entrance on
the street behind. The two share the actress's kitchen and upstairs
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have it set up so we can be in the same place, but in two
different houses,'' said Vicki Frantz, who took photos and
magazines to the bank to show that her daughter had a responsible
job and was capable of paying off a hefty mortgage, despite her
youth. ``But if we want to watch a movie together, we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be on the big-screen TV on the home's upper level.
Upstairs also is the living room, with a cushy, buff-colored
leather sofa, a mirrored bar and a tiny dining alcove overlooking
the Valley. The room's centerpiece, a Christmas gift from a friend,
is a funky painted game table: In its everyday incarnation, it's a
chessboard with stylized painted wooden dogs and cats as the chess
pieces. Turn the chess board over and it's a handpainted Monopoly
board.
</P>
<P>
   Cats, in fact, are becoming a theme throughout the house, from
the punched-tin lantern on the bar to the carved, painted
Indonesian table in the living room. Angels _ from the blown-glass
ones on the mantel to the delicate silver charm Frantz wears on a
chain around her neck _ run a close second.
</P>
<P>
   Guest bedrooms are undecorated as yet, but the window-lined
formal dining room _ on the middle of the home's three levels,
reached by a climb down a wide, steep staircase _ is anchored by a
long, dark-wood trestle table. A Venetian glass chandelier, which
Frantz brought home from a recent location shoot, hangs over the
table. Nearby are two early 20th-century china cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was finished by my grandfather and has been in our
family for years,'' said Michigan-born Frantz, indicating the
larger of the two cabinets. ``I love antique furniture and old
stuff. I pick it up whenever I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bedroom _ an airy confection whipped up in tones of white
and silver _ is the room that appears to be the home's real living
room, as in, actually being lived in. There's an alcove with a
wicker sofa, books, teddy bears and pictures, a 1920s vanity Frantz
refinished herself and a 150-year-old dresser, another family
heirloom, which she plans to sand down and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like refinishing furniture,'' she said. ``It's something I
do in my spare time _ if I have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days not filming ``B&AMP;B'' are spent doing interviews and
photo shoots, making personal appearances, writing and recording
songs (named best female vocalist at the 1997 Los Angeles
International Music Awards, she's working on her first rock 'n'
roll album) and reading scripts, looking for just the right movie.
</P>
<P>
   She has already filmed two _ ``Jimmy Zip,'' which won best
feature at the Hollywood Film Festival, and ``Speedway Junky,'' Gus
Van Sant's dark tale of runaways living on the streets of Las Vegas
_ both of which are due out this year. She plans to begin filming
an indie, ``The Child Manuela,'' a remake of a 1931 German film,
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Frantz wants to do the same kind of intelligent movies her role
model, Meryl Streep, chooses to do, so she's turned down roles
offered her in the latest teen-scream flicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my house; now I can play the roles I want,'' Frantz
said. ``I don't want to do anything cheesy. I want to be in this
for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same kind of determination she showed at age 3, when
she announced that she wanted to take dancing and singing lessons,
and at age 16, when she wanted to try her acting wings in New York,
said mom Vicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for her to do what she wanted to do and
follow her dreams. She's always had this dream of being an actress,
and she goes about it in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how she got her house, Frantz says: deciding what's
responsible rather than what's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people my age, they get some money and they blow it on
clothes or drugs or alcohol. And they have nothing to show for it.
I try to follow my goals, but sometimes it's hard. It's a fine
line: Do I really want those boots, or would I rather have a coffee
table? Sometimes I buy the boots, but I'd rather save for the
bigger goal.'' &QL;

PAPER FIRM TARGETS A NET NICHE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots and their new privately funded
$275 million stadium is how owner Robert Kraft and his family spend
money. A hot Internet start-up is one way the Krafts hope to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   The company is called PaperExchange.com.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by some of the biggest names on the Web, it's the
brainchild of Kraft and his son Jonathan, president and chief
operating officer of the family's paper and packaging business.
According to industry experts, it's poised to dramatically alter
the way paper is bought and sold across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their industry, PaperExchange could be the next AOL,'' Chip
Dillon, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``They're ahead of
the competition and backed by the right people. . . . I'd say these
guys could become the largest player in the Internet paper
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in the Back Bay, PaperExchange is an online
marketplace for the paper industry. Instead of an eBay-like
auction, the site allows large-scale buyers, sellers, brokers, and
shippers of paper and papermaking equipment to negotiate their own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the hottest Internet start-ups, the company is
targeting the white-hot business-to-business, or B2B, market. The
goal is to build a Web-based ``vertical market'' that can become a
one-stop shopping center for paper businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company is courting clients with the claim they can cut
costs by wringing out the inefficiencies that traditionally plague
the paper industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the inefficient B2B markets that stand to gain the most
from a Web-based exchange,'' said Bernie Jaworksi, an e-commerce
expert at the Cambridge-based Monitor Group. ``Especially with
commodity-like products like paper that don't need to be viewed or
touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Key industry leaders are already convinced. Two days ago, Asia
Pulp &AMP; Paper, the world's second-largest paper company, announced
it will sell its products on PaperExchange.com. Last week,
International Paper, the world's largest paper producer, announced
it will use the site and invest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   PaperExchange went online two years ago and today more than
3,000 members in 75 countries use the site to trade all grades of
paper. The company hopes to make money by charging a small
commission on each sale and by acting as bank for the capital
intensive industry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials won't discuss revenue, but given the paper industry's
$300-billion-a-year global sales, PaperExchange needs to capture
only a portion of the market to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft, 35, conceived of the company back in early 1990s
when he was pushing the Patriots to become the first team in
professional sports with a Web site. Charged with directing the
Kraft Group's investment strategy, he and other family members
backed about 30 Internet start-ups, including Andover-based CMGI
and the New York-based Internet Capital Group before it went
public.
</P>
<P>
   PaperExchange was spun off from International Forest Products,
the Krafts' paper-trading company and one of the nation's largest
exporters of paper. PaperExchange's directors are among the biggest
players in the paper and Internet industries.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only board that includes both ICG cofounder Walter
Buckley and his frequent rival, David Wetherell of CMGI. Robert
Kraft is chairman, and Roger Stone, former CEO of Stone Container,
sits on the board. Michael Dell of Dell Computers is a lead
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a marquee board that certainly would be hard to
beat,'' Dillon said. ``The names involved on both the paper and
Internet side may well discourage some players from trying to mount
a competitive exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Depite the prominence of their backers, the Krafts and other
company officials declined requests for more information about
PaperExchange, fueling speculation that the company is preparing to
go public.
</P>
<P>
   If the company is successful in executing its business plan,
analysts estimate the value of PaperExchange could range from $2
billion to $4 billion. Indeed, a special report on the e-commerce
market issued by Hambrecht and Quist last month specifically cited
PaperExchange as an example of a B2B exchange likely to be among
``2000's best investments in the overall Internet sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a key reason investors are bullish on the idea is
the paper industry's historically low profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a new paper mill can cost upwards of $1 billion, with
millions more needed for annual maintenance. It's also
prohibitively expensive to start and stop mill operations, meaning
that tons of surplus inventory is produced. And since the equipment
severely limits the width of paper that can be produced, more goes
to waste as rolls are trimmed to fit orders. Most mills are
concentrated in North America, Indonesia, and Scandinavia, but
demand for paper is worldwide. Filling the geographic gap is an
army of brokers who pair sellers with buyers and take on the
complicated task of arranging to ship tons of product across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   PaperExchange claims it can increase sales by finding a market
for surplus inventory and at the same time cut costs by eliminating
the middle men. The company is marketing its Web site as an
effective ``spot market'' where buyers can easily compare prices
and coordinate production and shipping schedules. Internet analysts
argue the paper market is tailor-made for the kind of improvements
a Web-based exchange can engender. They point to a recent Fortune
magazine survey rating 37 industries for return on equity, return
on assets, and return on revenue over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In every category, the paper industry ranked dead last. ``There
is a huge opportunity for e-marketplaces in the paper industry
because there are so many different steps in the distribution
chain,'' said B2B expert Bruce Tempkin of Forrester Research. ``All
those guys who have the word `broker' in their names are in trouble
as information becomes more easily accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial question is whether PaperExchange can deliver on
that promise faster and better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In the see-it-now world of the Internet, good ideas are quickly
cloned. At the moment, however, rivals are either focused on narrow
niche markets or aren't online yet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, PaperExchange eliminated its closest competitor the
old-fashioned way: It bought it. Officials then moved
Portland-based MPX to Boston and merged with PaperExchange.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and company also have bulked up by seeking out strategic
partners. PaperExchange recently increased the value of its Web
site by allying itself with VerticalNet, a Pennsylvania company
that provides editorial content and online portals in more than 50
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance also telegraphed the growing market power of
PaperExchange. Just last month, Microsoft announced it was
providing $100 million to help VerticalNet build new industry
specific exchanges. But even with Microsoft's might behind them,
VerticalNet chose to partner with PaperExchange rather than compete
_ a move analysts say underscores the Boston-based company's head
start.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the company hopes to make money by lending it.
</P>
<P>
   Given the large transactions common in the paper industry,
PaperExchange is setting itself up to act as a bank _ lending money
to buyers and checking credit for sellers who want to certify
potential bidders can pay on demand.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, plenty of possible pitfalls ahead. Like
other B2B start-ups, PaperExchange must first persuade industry
leaders to make the leap to Internet buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle is reassuring members that a site backed by huge
paper producers can remain neutral and confidential. Cyber experts
from Ernst &AMP; Young recently certified the security and neutrality
of the site, but concerns about possible conflicts of interest
remain a stumbling block for some companies.
</P>
<P>
   A Web-based exchange also represents a major shift in how the
paper industry operates. Persuading industry leaders to abandon
their traditional practices _ and cast off the hundreds of
thousands of salespeople and brokers currently employed buying and
selling in the offline world _ will require a massive marketing
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, institutional investors and bankers who heard
Jonathan Kraft pitch PaperExchange at an exclusive Goldman Sachs
seminar in California late last year said they were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early in the game, but PaperExchange is the clear
leader,'' said Dillon. ``With their expertise, contacts and
front-runner status, it's their game to lose right now.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS WORRIES THAT AIR FORCE HAS OVER-PRIVATIZED ITSELF
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Air Force is turning over so much of its
aircraft maintenance to private contractors that the military's own
repair depots are endangered, a U.S. senator charged Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of a Senate Armed
Services subcommittee on readiness, said that an increasing trend
of relying on private companies to maintain new weapons systems
could mean ``the eventual collapse of the public depots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has three major depots, or ``air logistics
centers,'' at Ogden, Utah; Oklahoma City, and Warner Robins, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   However, depots at Sacramento, Calif., and San Antonio are being
closed amid the post-Cold War shrinking of the military. At the
same time, the Air Force has increased the private share of
maintenance work from 36 percent in 1991 to 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Friday, Gen. George Babbitt Jr., commander of the
Air Force Materiel Command, attempted to reassure Inhofe that the
Pentagon wants to retain public depots even as it hires private
contractors for new weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of our program is to have that industrial base''
capable of providing parts and maintenance, he said. Contractors
can do some of the work, he said, but he added that they ``won't
hold the reserve capacity'' that the Air Force depots can provide.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns arose last month when Air Force Secretary F.
Whitten Peters told Congress he was waiving a requirement that at
least 50 percent of all maintenance work be performed by the public
depots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get aircraft back in the air,'' Peters told the
Senate panel. He said the Air Force needed the backup partly
because of the wear and tear on equipment from the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were dramatic increases of aircraft on the ground,'' he
said, adding that ``our mission-capable rates were going down very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said he was concerned about whether key
aircraft would still be maintained by the Air Force at Warner
Robbins. ``Is the depot system broken?'' he asked Peters.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force secretary responded one part of the system was
``broken,'' an effort to recalibrate crucial fighter plane parts at
the Ogden depot.
</P>
<P>
   Peters also told the panel that Air Force maintenance operations
have persistent problems, including ``dismal'' shortages of
experienced personnel and continuing challenges in retaining those
who become skilled. However, he said that a serious spare parts
shortage is now abating, after Congress granted $500 million in
supplemental funds last year.

FOR SOME, SYCAMORE STOCK'S TOO HOT TO HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its brief life as a public company, Sycamore Networks Inc.
has blessed investors as few, if any, other Massachusetts stocks
have ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore, which launched its initial public offering in October,
is scheduled to sell millions of new shares later this month, and
you can easily imagine investors lining up for a piece of the
action. The Chelmsford, Mass. company, its well-regarded managers,
and the white-hot interest in optical telecommunications networks
have proven to be a powerhouse stock story so far.
</P>
<P>
   A few words to the wise: Pay attention to the other Sycamore
stock line, the long queue being formed by early investors who plan
to sell a piece of their holdings. Dozens of early birds _ from
institutions such as Harvard and MIT, which are planning to move
hundreds of thousands of shares, to individuals who expect to sell
much more modest positions _ have publicly registered their
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing extraordinary about early investors selling a
portion of their stock after legal ``lock-up'' periods expire, but
these are no ordinary times.
</P>
<P>
   A surreal daily market for Sycamore stock has driven the shares
up a stunning 68 percent in the last week alone, apparently fueled
in part by investors who wanted to buy in front of an important
industry conference next week in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore shares weren't cheap to start with. Adjust the numbers
for a February stock split, and the shares Sycamore sold to the
public for $38 each four months ago were worth just under $570
Thursday (the actual closing price was 189 15/16). A company with
lots of promise and revered managers but few actual products is now
valued at $44.8 billion. This week, it passed Gillette Co. to
become the state's second-most-valuable public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it's worth, it's getting ahead of itself,'' said
Boston investment manager Fred Kobrick. ``If this stock doesn't
correct, that means the gravitational pull of the earth isn't
working anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick, who bought shares in the IPO, was upbeat about the
company's prospects, but reluctant to buy at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stressful dilemma when you really like a company and
want to buy it at a price you think is appropriate, but people are
driving it to the moon. We're in a market that doesn't know what
anything is worth and doesn't care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huge amounts of money are being invested in optical networking
companies in the belief they will become the key suppliers in the
rewiring of America in a fiber-optic telecommunications age.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Few companies in Sycamore's category have real
products yet, and no one knows who is going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Investors love Sycamore in particular because it's run by Desh
Deshpande and Daniel Smith, who built Cascade Communications Corp.
and sold it for $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande and Smith each hold stakes in Sycamore worth more than
twice the entire sale price of Cascade three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande owns just under 49 million Sycamore shares, worth
about $9.3 billion; Smith's 44.1 million shares are valued at about
$8.4 billion. Their investment in a two-year-old company places
them at a level of wealth, at the moment, that may be eclipsed only
by Abigail Johnson's, of Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande and Smith plan to sell a sliver of their holdings,
240,000 shares each, in the upcoming company stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sycamore's potential, the company also faces real risks.
</P>
<P>
   There are competitors with deep pockets and long relationships
with big customers, such as Nortel Networks Corp. and Lucent
Technologies Inc. Cisco Systems, likely to become the world's most
valuable company any day now, is lurking. And Ciena Corp. is
another legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   How many winners can there be?
</P>
<P>
   Maribel Lopez, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, predicts the top three will emerge with most of the
business, a fourth company will win a little market share, and
everyone else will fight for table scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to make a call, in the foreseeable future Sycamore
will be one of the top three,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore has made impressive progress since it went public. The
company signed up Enron as an important new customer, signed
contracts with two European telecommunciations providers, pushed
new products out to field trials, and earned a modest profit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is preparing for a public sale of 15 million shares
(including 2.6 million offered by insiders) that will generate
hundreds of millions in new cash.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more institutions and others who invested very
early through venture capital funds are planning to take some money
off the table.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of that money would tell you their
investments were always earmarked for venture capital and, besides,
endowments demand diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Probably they wouldn't tell you that Sycamore stock has gotten
much too expensive for now. That's our job.

PITINO'S CELTICS SHOW LITTLE PROGRESS AFTER THREE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Shot was just the beginning. No sooner had Vince
Carter's improbable game-winner Wednesday night settled through the
net than the Toronto Raptor was surrounded and congratulated _ by
FleetCenter fans.
</P>
<P>
   Across the floor, Celtics coach Rick Pitino was in a crouch,
unwilling to move, staring at the recently replaced parquet floor,
the one that was around for the franchise's 16 NBA championship
banners. The optimism for a 17th is now long gone. Making the
playoffs is the lofty goal now, and Pitino Thursday acknowledged
that the chances of ending the team's five-year, non-playoff run
are ``slim.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pitino finally did stand and make his way to the locker
room, he was jeered by some of those fans. Shortly into his
postgame news conference, Pitino vented. He defended his sagging
team, which has lost four straight at home and 14 of 18 overall. He
blasted the fans and the city of Boston for its history of
``negativity.'' He reminded fans that the Big Three _ Larry Bird,
Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish _ the most recent links to the
Celtics' storied era, were ``gray and old.'' That was then; this is
now. Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   That is both the truth and the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years into his precedent-setting 10-year,
$50-million deal, Pitino presides over a team that has made scant,
if any, progress. In his first year, he had a young team that by
all accounts worked hard and overachieved by winning 36 games. In
1997-98, that Celtics team filled the FleetCenter 28 times. This
year, Pitino still has a young team that works hard, but is on a
pace to win 33 games. The FleetCenter has been sold out only six
times in 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Pitino left a championship-caliber program at the
University of Kentucky and took over the Celtics' basketball
operations in what only could be described as a coronation at the
FleetCenter. He was given money, power, titles, and all the help he
wanted. Wednesday night, 34 months later, a coach who rarely saw
his college team lose anywhere watched the Celtics fall at home to
Toronto and get booed in their own building. He then launched into
a rambling, bitter monologue that instantly became talk-radio
fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with anything I said,'' he insisted
Thursday, having slept on the remarks. ``Everything I said was the
gospel truth, according to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Gospel According to Rick. The gospel according to the
NBA is that the Celtics will, in all likelihood, not make the
playoffs this season. Once Pitino promised results, now he preaches
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't change overnight,'' he said Thursday. ``There are no
overnight solutions. You start from the bottom and inch yourself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two games in Boston crystallized Pitino's frustration
and sent him into his Wednesday night rant. On Monday, the Celtics
led by 20 points with less than 19 minutes to play and lost by 8 to
the Dallas Mavericks, a team they had bowed to only once in Boston
in the previous 18 years. The Mavericks have been synonymous with
failure in the 1990s. But in two years, they'll have a new arena
and as much as $20 million to spend on players. They already have a
young, enthusiastic new owner who's willing to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   But if the loss to Dallas was disheartening, and it was, then
Carter's basket was the metaphorical dagger in Pitino's chest. In
Pitino's first year, the Celtics went 3-0 against Toronto. The
Raptors were an NBA joke, winning only 16 games. Now, thanks to
sage moves by management, the Raptors are on pace to make the
playoffs with one of the game's young, dynamic players in Carter.
They have hope. They have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Does Boston?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have a young, hard-working team, but as Kevin McHale
_ that ``gray and old'' Boston veteran _ is fond of saying, ``Hard
work will only get you so far. If all I wanted was hard workers,
I'd hire 12 plumbers. You need talent.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Celtics are a team Pitino flatly predicted would
make the playoffs, a team he has said he loves to coach, even if
that love often appears unrequited. It is a team that, he said this
week, needs patience and understanding, two words never associated
with Pitino and his coaching history. He was always the one who
quickly turned teams around.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a team loaded with too many mediocre players pulling
down big salaries, most of them signed by Pitino and many of them
untradeable. He frequently complains about being unable to compete
with big-spending teams in the league while neglecting to note that
several teams with better records _ Toronto, Charlotte, San Antonio
_ are spending much less than Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Pitino's own free spending, he put the Celtics in a
position where he could not afford to re-sign one of his best
players, Ron Mercer. He traded Mercer for Danny Fortson last
August. He then traded Fortson, complaining that he, too, was too
expensive to keep. (Fortson came back after the player he was
traded for flunked his physical; it remains to be seen whether he
even wants to re-sign with the Celtics.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Pitino who promised this team would make the playoffs. It
wasn't a hedge. It was a flat-out guarantee. He made the promise
last year. He made the promise while he still had Mercer and while
Adrian Griffin, this year's surprising newcomer, was playing in the
Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Pitino dragged out ancient history. The Celtics
troubles, he said, are not just the fault of the salary cap, of all
those big spenders, of the ``negative'' Boston fans. What about the
1997 NBA Draft Lottery? Wasn't that lottery supposed to deliver Tim
Duncan and return the Celtics to prominence?
</P>
<P>
   Pitino accepted the Celtics coaching job 10 days before that
lottery. He could have waited to see if the Celtics got the first
pick. He didn't wait; he jumped at the $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's all moot now. He has what he has and, right now, what he
has just isn't nearly good enough.

FOR PITINO, IT'S RANTS BUT DEFINITELY NO RAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Day 2 of Pitino v. Boston, the plaintiff (or is he
now the defendant?) got off to a horrible start. I kept expecting
someone to call for a recess, pull the coach of the Celtics aside
and say, ``Dude, what are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino was not arrogant when he spoke Thursday, but he did
not retract a word of his absurd Boston sports rant from Wednesday
night. He would not relent on even the simplest issues.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Pitino was asked if he could understand fan
``negativity,'' considering the 23-34 Celtics lost to Toronto
because they couldn't make free throws. That has nothing to do with
youth and greatness, it was suggested to the tough witness. He
responded by saying that Shaquille O'Neal, Bill Russell, and the
late Wilt Chamberlain weren't great free throw shooters, either.
</P>
<P>
   I think that's a silly argument because if you were to trade any
Celtic for Shaq, the team's record would be reversed. In fact, give
me the 66-year-old Russell, the Big Three, and the best available
point guard _ probably Tyus Edney _ and I'll take my chances, as
long as my aged boys don't have to play on back-to-back nights.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely agree with Pitino, but there are times when we meet in
a blissful, Rodney King-inspired, ``Can't We All Get Along?''
wonderland. Surprisingly, one of those moments arose Thursday.
Pitino said that many have critiques of Celtics problems but few
offer solutions. He acknowledged that ``there may not be a solution
in certain scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   So this is not the time to resurrect all the familiar Pitino
ghosts (Mills, Knight, Mercer, Billups). It is not the time to
bring out the itemized reports so we can pinpoint his poor
budgeting. No, the question of the day is this: How can all of
this, including the anatagonistic Pitino rant, be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   You can start by either empowering current general manager Chris
Wallace, or luring/hiring another GM such as Geoff Petrie or Wayne
Embry. If you strip away Pitino's constant spin of his work and the
performance of the imbalanced team he built, you will see that this
is his most significant weakness.
</P>
<P>
   What's the biggest difference between Pitino now and the coach
who was so successful with the Knicks? Pitino didn't have final-say
power in New York. It was the best thing for him. He didn't share
GM Al Bianchi's views, but he had to adjust to the team Bianchi
gave him. That may have annoyed Pitino during his two seasons in
Manhattan, but it forced him to concentrate solely on his coaching.
Remember, pro coaching is where Pitino has never failed.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Pitino has developed a Draconian personnel style. His
love affairs with players have a Dennis Rodman-Carmen Electra
longevity. Not only does it affect how his rent-a-players relate to
each other, it affects how he relates to them. If he were put in a
position where he had to embrace the flaws of everyone, from Pervis
Ellison to Antoine Walker, I think he would be a better coach for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Pitino would probably find it hard to relinquish his
veto power to Wallace, the man he hired. That's too bad. Wallace is
a smart basketball man. A power swap would be good for both men
and, hey, Pitino would still have his $7 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   But I would not be surprised if Wallace became the innocent chip
in a political tug between owner Paul Gaston and Pitino. The owner
has almost no leverage against the big-time coach with the
small-time (41 percent) winning percentage. Gaston does have a
trump: Pitino's hire, Wallace, is in the last year of his contract,
and the owner doesn't have to offer a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of politics leads us to another correctable problem:
Pitino's exaggerated words.
</P>
<P>
   Really, I still can't believe the coach complained about the
negative treatment of a team that is a half-game behind the New
Jersey Nets in the Atlantic Division. He complained about
negativity on a night when more than 17,000 people were in the
arena to see, frankly, a sorry team. His players, all professional
adults, were booed during the same week for blowing a 20-point
third-quarter lead and missing six of eight fourth-quarter free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   A person who doesn't pay attention to sports will see Pitino's
comments about Boston negativity and how ``it sucks'' and think,
``Maybe he's right about Boston.'' He is not right. Pitino grew up
in New York. I wonder how New Yorkers would respond to a 23-34
team. How about folks in Philadelphia? Would Pitino prefer to have
audiences such as the ones in Cleveland, Oakland, Calif., and
Atlanta, places where basketball is now met with indifference?
</P>
<P>
   True negativity is when fans shrug on draft night; when they
lose hope; when they stop suggesting trades and stop caring about
the games. Pitino knows this. He also should know that bickering
with fans during and after games is nonproductive.
</P>
<P>
   I can't keep a straight face when it comes to Pitino's comments
on Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. I don't know about
you, but I hear more people speaking wistfully of Tim Duncan rather
than the Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   What Pitino has to understand is that most fans can see that he
is engaging in politics. This must stop. There would be less rage
directed at the coach and his team if there was more honesty coming
from him.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been avoided last year if Pitino had said, ``You
know, I misjudged this situation. My original projections were
inaccurate. Right now, my team will be fortunate to make the
playoffs next year.'' Instead, he made excuses about the lockout
and his team's inexperience. It was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursady, Pitino had another chance to offer some refreshing
words. If he said he was frustrated from a bad day, a lot of people
would understand. If he said that he generalized about Boston _
which he did _ people would understand.
</P>
<P>
   But he remained inflexible. Pitino mentioned solutions to the
problems. Solutions are out there. I'm not sure Pitino is willing
to listen to them.

WEIGHT SWINGS AMONG BOXERS CAUSING CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There was $40 million sitting on a table waiting for
Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya. All that was standing between
them picking it up was a few pounds of suet.
</P>
<P>
   Everything necessary for them to sign for a June rematch at
Caesars Palace was in place with the exception of one weighty
problem. De La Hoya insisted he's a 147-pound welterweight.
Trinidad said he's a 154-pound junior middleweight, even though he
presently holds two of the three welterweight titles. Friday (March
3) Trinidad will try to prove his point by fighting World Boxing
Association champion David Reid at Caesars Palace. If he wins, he
claims that title and would have fought De La Hoya at what is
called a catch weight.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters had agreed to fight at 151 pounds originally but
De La Hoya insisted that the two make weight the day of the fight,
not 24 hours earlier as has become the norm for weigh-ins at
big-time fights in recent years. Trinidad's promoter, Don King,
wanted his fighter to weigh in 24 to 36 hours earlier and then use
that time to go up from 151, but when representatives of the two
sides sat down, Trinidad's father actually kept insisting the
weight be 154, which to De La Hoya's counselors meant he could
weigh as much as 170 pounds by fight night, 18 pounds more than De
La Hoya's normal 150-152.
</P>
<P>
   It was a weighty problem and one that had come into the
forefront of people's minds this week in part because of the way
Maine's Joey Gamache was destroyed last Saturday night by Arturo
Gatti, who who came into the ring at Madison Square Garden weighing
19 pounds more than Gamache. It was originally reported the
difference on fight night was 16 pounds, but it turned out to be an
even wider disparity, 160 to 141, and the result was that Gamache
was flattened three times in two rounds and rocked by nearly every
punch that landed before he suffered a serious concussion and was
hospitalized for several days.
</P>
<P>
   After De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, saw that fight and read
of the huge weight disparity by fight time, he decided what he
would advise De La Hoya to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the articles about that fight I was stunned,''
Arum said. ``I can't have Oscar go into the ring at 151, 152, and
fight a guy who's 170 pounds or more. Oscar's a hell of a lot
better fighter than Trinidad, but I don't want to spot him that
kind of weight. We agreed he'd make 150 the day of the fight and
King is saying 151 plus or minus, which means 152, but the father
keeps saying 154 day before, which could mean 170. You saw the
Gamache debacle. Where not going to let that happen to Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Monday, De La Hoya agreed to fight Shane Mosley, the
former lightweight champion, at 147 June 10 or 17 at 147 pounds
give or take nothing. De La Hoya will earn the same $20 million he
was likely to get fighting Trinidad while Mosley agreed to $5
million, with promoter Cedrick Kushern getting 15 percent. So, at
least in their case, weight was an issue. To the guy known
throughout boxing as ``The Fight Doctor,'' it always should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest crime that we've done in boxing in the last 10
years is to allow a guy to gain 19 pounds and get into the ring
with a 141-pound opponent,'' Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's old doctor,
said. ``It makes it the most futile thing in the world (to fight
such a weight disadvantage). Why do you weigh guys in? To keep
160-pound guys from fighting 140-pound guys. You couldn't make that
match legally if you tried but they let a guy weigh in 36 hours
early and get him down to 141 and then let him weight whatever he
wants on fight night?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the result. They almost killed (Gamache). It was like
adding a piece of iron in the glove like (Jack) Dempsey did with
Jess Willard. It wasn't negligible. It was criminal and the people
in charge of overseeing the sport allowed it. How many times do
they have to see this?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they saw with Arturo Gatti's weight is what De La Hoya will
not allow himself to face with Trinidad, yet it has become a
growing trend in the sport that fighters scramble to make weight,
knowing they have 36 hours or so to revitialize themselves. So
beyond mere hard training they take an assortment of laxatives,
even the veterinary medicine Lasix, to purge their bodies of all
fluids at the last minute. They sweat out every drop of water in
their bodies in saunas, by working out in rubber suits, by taking
appetite suppressants, by eating and drinking little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then they step on a scale for as short a time as possible, leap
off and drink a gallon of water to begin a process called
rehydrating. For some it takes too much of a toll and they enter
the ring with nothing left inside. Others end up like Gatti,
looking like a giant in the Land of Lilliputians. In fact, Gatti's
trainer, Hector Rocha, said Gatti gained back much of his weight on
a pasta and water diet. It seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   For James Toney, on the night he faced Roy Jones Jr. several
years ago, it did not. At that weigh-in, Toney looked like a man
ready to pass out, but he made 168 pounds. By the next night, he
weighed 15 pounds more but was an empty shell, his body used up,
dried out, weak.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen that way just as it can happen the other way as it
did in Gatti's case. Gatti came into the ring looking twice as big
as Gamache and after he landed one straight right hand that put
Gamache down and through the ropes, everyone knew it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was too strong for him in the first round,'' Gatti
would say later.
</P>
<P>
   That's not always what happens to a fighter who puts himself
through this, but the process of rehydration is always the same.
The results will vary from fighter to fighter, but the rest of it
is unchanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay a price when you do that to your body,'' Pacheco said.
``You deplete your body of all water and the fat goes with it. It's
cruelty to the body but it gets your weight down. Then you step on
a scale, get off and all your cells are like dry sponges. Any drop
of water they suck up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything goes in for the next 36 hours and nothing goes out.
It's almost like a kidney shut down. The body is thirsty so it
retains every bit of fluid and your weight just increases rapidly
to get back to where you should be. To what you really are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Athletic Commission was the first to begin reweighing
its fighters in the locker room on fight night. It has been
recording the varying weights of thousands of fighters and the
results from those fights. Statisticians at the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas are studying the results.
</P>
<P>
   After Marc Ratner and the Commission get the results, they plan
to alter how much weight they will allow a fighter to gain the day
before a fight. Although they will continue to have weigh-ins 24-36
hours before a match, Ratner said they see a need to reduce the
amount of weight fighters are allowed to put back on to avoid what
happened in New York with Gatti and Gamache.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' Ratner said. ``We need to limit what
they can gain the next day (after a weigh-in). Maybe we'll have a
second weigh-in the day of the fight and tell the fighters they
can't regain more than a certain percentage of what they first came
in at, say 7 or 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I recall, moving to the day before weigh-in started with us
after a fight in which Steve Cruz struggled to make weight on the
day of one of his title fights. He made it but was so dehydrated he
could barely move and he was badly beaten. The fact is, severe
weight loss on the day of a fight just to make weight is also
dangerous, and could cause serious injury to a fighter because
there's no fluids in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doctors discussed this and we went to the day before
weigh-in because medically it's better and safer for the fighter to
have more time to rehydrate. The theory was the guy still had
punished himself to make the weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 12 years ago, I remember, there was a fight between
Nigel Benn and Iran Barkley. Barkley weighed 160 at the weight in
and nearly 180 for the fight. It was the greatest weight gain I'd
ever seen. We acknowledge these things are happening and it's
become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge that gaining 20 pounds like that is taking
advantage of the weigh-in rules and it has to stop. Gatti-Gamache
made that obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to everyone in boxing it didn't.

   TAKE-BOS  
 LAS VEGAS: ... it didn't.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran trainer Teddy Atlas watched that fight, heard of the
huge weight disparity and the fact that at the weigh-in there had
been questions about the scales and whether Gatti ever balanced
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache's handlers now claim they argued with the New York State
Athletic Commission officials in charge of the scales but were
rebuffed and the fight went on to its inevitable conclusion.
Knowing that, Atlas doesn't see weight as the real issue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he really weigh that weight or was he heavier to begin
with?'' Atlas said. ``He got on and off fast and they say the scale
never balanced. If that's true, then somebody should have said,
`Get back on the scale or you can go get another fight for HBO.'
They didn't, so why say it now?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to weight, all things are relative. If you can
fight well enough it doesn't matter. You might not win but you
don't have a result like you had with Gamache. When Toney went up
so much in weight in the Jones fight, nobody made anything of it
because all he did was lose every round. He didn't get blown out so
nobody made anything of the weight gain he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offense to Gamache, but if he was a better opponent, the
weight wouldn't have made a difference. Look at his line by line
(record). He's only got four losses but they were all blowouts
against top guys. I don't care if Gatti weighed 400 pounds or 120
pounds, the weight difference didn't make Gamache easy to hit. He
got hit clean because of the fighter he is now. If you want to add
the weight in after that, go ahead, but Toney added more weight
against Jones and it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``So before we throw the book at this weigh-ins the day before,
look at the situation first. The fact is, it's safer for the
fighters to weigh in the day before the fight. It allows you to
regenerate the guy right, using electrolights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can make the argument that if you can't make the
weight on the day of the fight, you go to another class and the
fight is off but the fact is that would cause havoc with
postponements. How could anyone be in reasonable control? What does
a TV network or a promoters do? Advertise four fights? These are
the two we hope to show and these are the two over the weight
fights just in case? You can't do that. You can't put television in
that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of all this talk about the weight gain, look at
whether the guy should have been in there with the other guy. When
there's a blowout like that, I always look at the opponent, not the
weight, because if both guys can fight, it's not usually an issue.
It's an issue if it's a bad match to start off with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many have charged that the move to early weigh-ins was a move
not to protect the fighters, but the cable networks that pay
millions to broadcast major bouts and the promoters who stage them.
As with most things in boxing, the truth lies in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, it is safer for a fighter battling to reach a certain
weight to have the most time possible to reactivate his body. That
was a large part of the reason the sport went away from day-of-the
fight weigh-ins. But, so too was it a move to ensure that the
people paying for major events got what was advertised.
</P>
<P>
   So to Al Mitchell, the responsibility of protecting the fighter
from an overweight opponent no longer goes to the commissions
because they have a vested interest, as do the television networks,
in finding ways to make the fights.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it falls on ``the coach,'' as Reid's trainer likes to call
himself, to be responsible for the scales as well as the weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the coach has got to protect the fighter,'' Mitchell
said. ``Gatti awlays has been big (on fight night). They knew he'd
been coming in that way. I'm surprised Gamache's people didn't know
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the first punch was thrown, it was a mismatch.
Nineteen pounds is a lot of pounds. I don't fault anybody else but
the coach. They know an 18-pound difference is a mismatch. Gatti
had a history of that. I know that I don't take the fight. Not when
my kid is going to be 141. This ain't the first time Arturo did
this, so if I've got a 140-pound fighter, he ain't gonna fight with
Gatti. Don't blame the commissions or TV. Who's supposed to be
accountable for the fighter? His corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco wouldn't dispute Mitchell's belief in the cornermen's
responsibilities, but he also has as good an understanding of the
two sides of the question as anyone because he has long served in
the corners of great fighters and more than a few times had to
bring their weight down in a desperate, last-minute fashion.
Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, he has long been a television boxing analyst, too,
and is well aware of whose interests often come first in the sport
and whose come last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to blame television, but they got to have the guy fight
they say is fighting,'' Pacheco said. ``In the old days, you always
had day-of-the-fight weigh-ins. You didn't make weight the fight
was off, and you replaced it with someone else, or you fought over
the weight for less money and no title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have that now with the big money that's being paid.
I can see no reason, no real justification to have the weigh-in 36
hours early except for the convenience of the promoter and the TV
executives to ensure on the day of the fight, they have a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night they had one. In June, they won't, in part
because of what happened to Gamache. The one thing you can be
assured of is that in the latter case, there won't ever be a
19-pound difference between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why, go watch tape of Joey Gamache's last
fight.

MAKING SENSE OF THE MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that it is officially March, we can get past the business of
the regular season _ and deal with the madness known as the NCAA
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a week early to be getting into projections and
serious tournament seeding, but it is not too early to take a look
at the conferences and which teams should feel comfortable about
playing past the Ides of March.
</P>
<P>
   --America East (1) _ Hofstra won the regular season and the
Flying Dutchmen should prevail in the America East tournament,
which starts Friday in Newark, Del. Hofstra will have the
home-court edge in the championship game next Saturday if it takes
care of business this weekend. If Hofstra gets upset, it is the
only America East team with a chance to play in the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   --Big Sky (1) _ Eastern Washington is the front-runner, but
watch out for red-hot Northern Arizona, which knocked off Eastern
Washington last week. First-place team hosts the postseason
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   --Big South (1) _ Regular-season champ Radford is the favorite.
Winthrop, one of the two teams to beat Radford during the
conference season, is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   --Big West (1) _ Utah State is the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   --Colonial (1) _ George Mason is the front-runner, but James
Madison also could be a factor. Dark horse? UNC-Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   --Ivy (1) _ Penn continues to roll along.
</P>
<P>
   --Atlantic Coast Conference (3) _ Duke, Maryland, North
Carolina. Virginia needs help. ACC coaches will say this is
blasphemy, but everyone else is well under .500 in the league,
which isn't that great.
</P>
<P>
   --Atlantic 10 (3) _ Temple, Dayton. St. Bonaventure. That's all
the conference deserves, barring an upset, which puts another team
in the tournament champion's role. And St. Bonaventure is iffy.
</P>
<P>
   --Big East (6) _ Miami, Syracuse, St. John's, Seton Hall, UConn,
Villanova. Notre Dame's losses to Providence and Pittsburgh sealed
the fate of the Irish. Villanova has an outside shot, but will have
to win at least one game in the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   --Big Ten (5) _ Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue, Indiana,
Illinois. Wisconsin has wins over Temple and Texas, but five of the
Badgers' seven wins have come against the bottom half of the
league. It will take a significant run in the NCAA tournament to
get the Badgers out of the NIT field and into the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   --Big 12 (5) _ Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Kansas, Iowa State,
Texas. Missouri is very close with 10 league wins, but a
first-round tournament loss could doom the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   --Conference USA (3) _ Cincinnati, Louisville, DePaul.
Cincinnati and Louisville are givens, but after that, where do you
go? Tulane has a shot if it can make the championship game. DePaul
has some quality nonconference wins over Florida and St. John's,
giving it an edge.
</P>
<P>
   --Metro-Atlantic Athletic Conference (1) _ Sienna is again the
runaway favorite.
</P>
<P>
   --Mid-American Conference (2) _ Kent, Bowling Green. The MAC has
become a decent league in recent years and deserves two spots. Both
Kent and Bowling Green have more than 20 wins and decent RPIs
(ratings percentage index). Kent is 28, Bowling Green 46.
</P>
<P>
   --Mid-Continent (1) _ Oakland won the regular season, but is
ineligible for the tournament since it hasn't been in Division 1
long enough. Second-place Valparaiso looms as the heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   --Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (1) _ South Carolina State and
Coppin State are running neck and neck. One of them should get the
bid.
</P>
<P>
   --Midwestern Collegiate Conference (1) _ Butler is the heavy
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   --Missouri Valley Conference (2) _ It's a tossup between Indiana
State and Southwest Missouri. Creighton could sneak in as a team
with a strong tournament run.
</P>
<P>
   --Mountain West (2) _ Utah, UNLV. Utah is a lock and Nevada-Las
Vegas should get in, although it has a shaky RPI (52). The
tournament is played in Vegas, though, which should help.
</P>
<P>
   --Northeast (1) _ Central Connecticut has had a fabulous season
and should win the tournament and get a 15 seed in the East, which
will probably earn it a first-round game against Temple.
</P>
<P>
   --Pac 10 (4) _ Stanford, Arizona, Oregon, UCLA. Stanford,
Arizona, and Oregon are locks. UCLA is going to have to make a
strong run in the next week, but has a superior RPI (27), which
could be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   --Ohio Valley (1) _ Southeast Missouri State and Murray State
tied for the regular-season title. The winner will get the bid. If
either falters, they'll have to settle for an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   --Southeastern Conference (6) _ Kentucky, Auburn, Florida,
Tennessee, LSU, Vanderbilt. The best conference this season will
get the most teams. Vanderbilt has slipped some, but should still
make it.
</P>
<P>
   --Patriot League (1) _ Lafayette or Navy. Take your pick. The
winner gets the bid. If it's someone else, both will be hoping the
phone rings with an NIT bid, but don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   --Southern (1) _ College of Charleston remains the team to beat
because of its past history, but it is not as invincible as in past
years.
</P>
<P>
   --Southland (1) _ Sam Houston State won the regular season, but
Louisiana Monroe could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   --Southwestern Athletic Conference (1) _ Alcorn State is the
pick here.
</P>
<P>
   --Sun Belt Conference (1) _ South Alabama tied with Louisiana
Lafayette for the regular-season title, but swept the season series
between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   --Trans-America Athletic Conference (1) _ Either Troy State or
Georgia State should emerge.
</P>
<P>
   --West Coast Conference (2) _ Pepperdine and Gonzaga are the
front-runners, but the Zags are fading.
</P>
<P>
   --Western Athletic Conference (3) _ This league is doing better
than expected. Tulsa is a genuine threat to reach the Final Four;
Fresno has 20 wins; and SMU is coming on strong.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Irish ire not smiling
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fan behavior has been a problem all season. Notre Dame's 73-71
loss to Syracuse in South Bend Wednesday night is a case in point.
With Notre Dame trailing by 2, 70-68, with 8.8 seconds left,
Syracuse's Ryan Blackwell was fouled. It was a close call that drew
the ire of the Notre Dame fans, who had been warned twice about
throwing things on the court. When a water bottle hit the court,
official Jody Silvester hit the Irish with a technical foul.
Blackwell made one of his two free throws to make it 71-68. The
Irish should have had the ball. But the technical foul voided that.
``They could have won the game,'' said Syracuse guard Jason Hart.
``You don't know what would have happened. They gave us two free
throws and the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stop the silliness
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The business with the NCAA and players who received financial
support to attend prep schools is getting silly. You can go down
the list of most major Division 1 rosters and find some connection
between a player and a benefactor who gave him financial aid before
he arrived in college. The NCAA has to find a way to implement a
workable policy regarding AAU programs and players. The NCAA also
made a major mistake when executive director Cedric Dempsey made a
public statement criticizing St. John's for statements made in the
Erick Barkley case. ``I don't believe it's in anyone's best
interest that there be public disagreement about issues taking
place between the NCAA and a member school,'' Dempsey said. ``The
university's accusation of an NCAA guilt before stance is
inaccurate.'' It's also not in the NCAA's best interest for its
head to make a statement criticizing a member school during an
investigation . . . Barring a run through the Big East tournament,
the Irish are almost certainly headed for the NIT now instead of
the NCAA tournament . . . Word has it that Tulsa coach Bill Self is
high on the list as Bobby Cremmins's replacement at Georgia Tech.

NCAA TOURNEY BAFFLING EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Clark Kellogg is normally cool and conservative as CBS's college
basketball analyst. But even he is excited about the upcoming NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wild and wacky,'' said Kellogg, who added
that has not seen a dominant team emerge this season. Stanford is
big and deep and Cincinnati has added perimeter shooting and depth,
but neither of those teams has struck fear throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg cited a handful of teams that with a little luck could
end up in the Final Four in Indianapolis. According to Kellogg,
Tennessee, for one, has as much talent as anyone in the country but
has a tendency to get selfish with the ball. Florida has a great
pressure defense and 3-point shooters. Michigan State has
experience and poise, and, according to Kellogg, is the hottest of
the Big Ten teams. That's not to say that Kellogg's alma mater,
Ohio State, doesn't have a shot. Or even Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut has not played as well as
expected, but Syracuse, and possibly St. John's, has a chance, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg said the Southeastern Conference could have six or seven
teams in the tournament. He also mentioned Auburn (depending on the
Chris Porter situation), Tulsa, Iowa State, and Oklahoma State as
potential Cinderella teams.

   There will be plenty of college basketball action this
league-championship weekend.
</P>
<P>
   CBS tops the ticket with tripleheaders Saturday and Sunday. Tim
Brando and James Worthy will call Saturday's noon game between
Florida and Kentucky; Ian Eagle and Jimmy Spanarkel have
Syracuse-UConn at 2 p.m.; and Jim Nantz and Billy Packer will
handle UCLA-Stanford at 4. Kellogg and Greg Gumbel will work the
CBS studio throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has North Carolina-Duke at 3 p.m., with Brent Musburger,
Dick Vitale, and Brad Dougherty calling the game from Cameron
Indoor Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Sunday coverage starts at noon with Verne Lundquist and
Bill Raftery calling the St. John's-Miami game. Kevin Harlan and
Jon Sundvold will call the 2 p.m. Missouri-Kansas game, while Dick
Enberg and Al McGuire will handle Indiana-Wisconsin at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Starting 2 p.m. Saturday with the TransAmerica Athletic
Conference Championship, ESPN and ESPN2 will be carrying a total of
58 men's and women's games over nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale will be calling four ACC tournament games, including the
championship game on March 12 at 1 p.m., and will be studio analyst
on March 8, 9, and 12. Len Elmore also will be very visable, as
analyst for the Southeastern Conference Championship and seven Big
East Championship games.
</P>
<P>
   CBS airs its ``Road to the Final Four'' on March 12 at noon,
followed by the SEC final at 1 and the Big Ten final at 3:30. The
NCAA tournament pairings will be announced at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Univision and Galavision, the Spanish-language networks, will
carry four Major League Baseball games this spring, starting March
11 with the 3 p.m. Red Sox-Houston Astros game on Univision. The
next day, Galavision has Red Sox-Astros at 1. The remaining two
games will be on Galavision and feature the March 18 contest
between the Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Devil Rays at 6 p.m. and
the March 19 Arizona Diamondbacks-Anaheim Angels game at 1 . . .
ESPN has an interesting ``Outside the Lines'' special on athletes
in movies. ``Playing the Part: Athletes as Actors,'' airs Friday
night at 7 . . . ``Nasty'' Nestor Aparicio, Boston's All Sports
1510 radio host, broadcasts live from Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas
6-10 Friday night. Aparicio is there to cover the Felix
Trinidad-David Reid middleweight fight. Patriots.com, the Patriots'
official Web site, has a new feature that will allow users to watch
construction of the team's new stadium, which is scheduled to open
in 2002.

 &HT;    EDS: EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, MARCH 5
 &HT;    Super Tuesday the crucial for Bradley
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democrat Bill Bradley calls it ``take off day.'' The
political establishment dubs it Super Tuesday. Whatever the label,
Tuesday's primary balloting in 15 states and American Samoa is
undeniably do or die day for the former U.S. senator from New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost four primary contests to Vice President Gore since
the Iowa caucuses just six weeks ago, Bradley must, as he says,
post some wins Tuesday to breath viability into his insurgent
campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that March 7 is the take off time,''
Bradley told reporters last week in California, where he trails
Gore five to one in the most recent poll. ``That's when we have to
win some primaries and that's when we are going to surprise some
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has spoken of surprises before. He promised a surprise
in Iowa, where instead he was defeated by Gore two-to-one in the
Democratic caucus. He promised a surprise in New Hampshire, but the
promise came up empty by fewer than 6,000 votes, the margin of his
defeat to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley invested six days of precious campaign time in
Washington state, which held a non-binding primary last Tuesday,
hoping for a lift. Once more he came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bradley again come up empty Tuesday he will be under
enormous pressure to drop out the race. And the end of the
nomination battle has important implications for Gore, who will
then be free to focus on the fall campaign against the Republicans
while the GOP candidates themselves may continue their own, bitter
fight.
</P>
<P>
   After months of sustained attacks on Bradley's health care
proposals and comittment to preserving Social Security, Gore over
the past week has turned away from Bradley and instead directed
more of his digs at Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked Bush Friday for not offering a forceful
endorsement of mandatory trigger locks for guns, a proposal that
both he and Bradley support. ``Is that what passes for courage on
the Republican side of this contest?'' Gore snipped.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that Bradley trails Gore in all the March 7
states, including New York, the second largest prize of the day
with 243 delegates at stake. New York and the northeast was to have
been Bradley's firewall. Bradley played ten years with the New York
Knicks and served 18 years as a U.S. senator from neighboring New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Georgia, California and most of the South and West,
Bradley was well known in the East and began his campaign with a
regional base of support. But Bradley's early losses hurt him here.
</P>
<P>
   To date only 68 delegates have been determined, 41 for Gore and
27 for Bradley. But those numbers will change dramatically on
Tuesday. Some 1,315 delegates _ about 37 percent of those at stake
_ will be allocated on Super Tuesday, based on primary returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven days that follow, the delegate count will jump to
two-thirds of the total at stake for the Democrats. Some of those
states holding primaries that week are in the South and Southwest,
where Gore holds a regional regional, as well as institutional,
advantage over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Tuesday's voting, Bradley campaigned
with the dogged determination of man fighting against the odds,
while Gore exuded the confidence of a candidate that is already
looking toward the Fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore added yet another endorsement to his long list of
established, Democratic supporters when Sen. Bob Graham of Florida
endorsed him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile said that it
is possible that Gore could collect the 2,169 delegates needed to
secure the nomination by March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, skipped across the Eastern seaboard, making
brief stops in New York, Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island. He
flew to his native Missouri Saturday before returning to the East
Coast todaySUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely mentioning Gore, Bradley sought to portray himself as a
bold leader who was the only true reformer in the race. He
delivered a foreign policy speech at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., Friday, and stirred a large crowd in Portland,
Maine, with a passionate plea for a new politics based on
conviction and belief.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, Bradley faced questions from local
media about his chances of winning, not his credentials to be the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in those places before, when nobody thought you can
do it and I did it. So it doesn't bother me,'' he said in interview
with a CBS affiliate in New York. ``After a moment's pause, he
added, ``I'd be less than truthful if I didn't tell you I wish I
was 30 up.''

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN TOOK A TWISTING ROUTE TO ITS EXPECTED DESTINATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, March 5.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What a long, strange trip it's been for Al Gore and
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, both were widely expected to stroll to their
parties' presidential nominations. And indeed, ``Super Tuesday''
primary victories this week could mark the fulfillment of their
political quests.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, this campaign has been like a political game of
Chutes and Ladders. Unexpected reversals of fortune raised doubts
at times whether either Bush or Gore would make it to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they do, both will be different _ some say vastly
improved _ candidates, fighting on a different battleground than
the one envisioned when the race began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destination was predictable, but the route was not,'' said
former GOP strategist Jack Pitney, now a college professor in
California. ``For Bush, it was like traveling from Savannah to
Atlanta _ via the Bermuda Triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore was shocked by polls showing Bill Bradley
running stronger than expected last fall, and even leading in the
first primary state of New Hampshire. ``Bad poll numbers are like
smoke detectors _ the sooner you get the signal, the better,'' said
Pitney.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, the Bermuda Triangle has been John
McCain, the Arizona senator, political maverick and Vietnam War
hero whose surge in the GOP contest has confounded Bush strategists
and political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   They are still trying to sort out the reasons for McCain's
victories last month in New Hampshire and Michigan. The
reawakening, stronger than ever, of Ross Perot's reform-minded
constituency? Resistance among rank-and-file Republicans to the GOP
hierarchy's anointment of Bush? Simple hero-worship?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's figured this all out yet,'' said Republican pollster
Robert Teeter, who worked for Bush's father in the 1988 and 1992
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's missteps have also aided McCain's success: his
unimpressive performances in early debates, his lack of knowledge
of foreign policy and his appearance at anti-Catholic Bob Jones
University during the hard-fought battle for hard-line Republicans
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But it's generally agreed that the primary battle, in which Bush
repackaged himself as ``a reformer with results,'' has left him
better prepared for a general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much crisper and much better schooled on all the issues
he's asked about. This primary scuffle is good for him,'' Rep.
Jennifer Dunn of Washington, a Bush backer, told The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Bush prevails, political historians will likely point
to a different reason: the unprecedented $69 million he has raised,
and mostly spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising prowess drove five candidates from the field
long before the actual voting: former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former Red Cross chairman Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan cited the power of Bush's
money when he left the GOP to seek the nomination of the
Perot-founded Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who stayed were easily dispatched. Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah dropped out after Iowa, former Reagan administration
aide Gary Bauer after New Hampshire and wealthy magazine publisher
Steve Forbes after Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush is opposed only by McCain and former ambassador Alan
Keyes, who refuses to end his campaign despite single-digit
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, like Bush, launched his campaign with clear advantages: he
was well-known, well-organized, well-financed and the overwhelming
favorite of the party establishments. In fact, Gore had the
unprecedented endorsement of the incumbent president he served.
</P>
<P>
   But like Bush, Gore found himself up against a candidate in
Bradley who seized the popular issue of campaign finance reform and
practiced ``the politics of authenticity'' _ disdain for
poll-tested campaign themes and a willingness to talk straight with
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   And like Bush, Gore found a way to respond to Bradley's strong
challenge and become ``a much better candidate,'' said Darrell
West, a presidential campaign expert at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign headquarters was moved from Washington's
lobbyist-haunted K Street to Nashville, and the candidate traded
his blue suit and speeches from a lectern for earth tones, a
wireless microphone and open meetings with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message became tighter and he positioned himself as a
fighter for the average person,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, fell back into the ``old politics'' mode by
attacking Gore's truthfulness in the final debate before the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bradley also fell victim to McCain's success. The
independent voters Bradley saw as his way to challenge the
``entrenched power'' of the Democratic Party chose the scrappy
McCain over the professorial Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with their party nominations within reach, Bush and Gore
may soon be free to concentrate on each other, and on the
transformed political terrain for the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The reform issue has energized a huge bloc of swing voters,
presenting a challenge to candidates strongly identified with the
status quo. Besides the expected battlegrounds of gun control and
taxes, other unforeseen issues have risen to prominence: health
care reform, abortion, and even religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable asking the questions,'' said Larry Sabato, a
nationally known author and political scientist at the University
of Virginia, ``but not in giving definitive answers about this
election.''

FARRAKHAN'S PEACE OVERTURES SCRUTINIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When minister Louis Farrakhan first declared publicly that he
had a change of heart, he gave us hope that we would see an end to
his diatribes against whites, Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   But we may be expecting too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Following an experience with cancer last year, the Nation of
Islam leader pledged to uplift ``lost and fallen humanity
regardless of their color, their race or their creed,'' Religion
News Service reported. Also, the powerfully magnetic leader who
drew multitudes to his Million Man March five years ago says his
movement is shifting toward traditional Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us hope his peace moves are the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan commands much influence and is a masterful speaker. He
could do much to bring reconciliation among all religious and
racial groups in American society.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace signals were mixed at Farrakhan's annual Saviors
Day Conference in Chicago on Sunday, attended by 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan did speak words of peace during the event.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, he embraced W. Deen Mohammed, leader of the rival
Muslim American Society, a much larger predominantly
African-American Muslim group that has moved away from earlier
teachings of white hatred and toward orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan asserts that his own Nation of Islam is moving toward
traditional Islam, too, and that he seeks closer ties with all
groups ``not for evil but for love, not for hatred but in good,''
The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation of Islam now observes traditional Friday prayers and
fasts during the month of Ramadan. Also, the Nation now
acknowledges that the prophet Mohammed is the final prophet, not
Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the original separatist black Muslim
movement.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some snags in Sunday's peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, who once called Judaism a ``gutter religion,'' said
nothing dastardly about Jews. But he allowed Rabbi Dovid Weiss, the
leader of a small fringe Orthodox Jewish group that opposes the
state of Israel, to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' group, known as Neturei Karta International, has the
extremely radical notion that the Holocaust was punishment for Jews
who created the state of Israel by secular means, rather than by
allowing it to be created by the hand of God through the promised
Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   And during a news conference the next day in which a Nation of
Islam leader was present, Weiss repeated his unpopular view that
most Jews today are not authentic Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Zionism, not Judaism,'' The Associated Press quoted Weiss
as saying. ``They are something which is an abomination of God. It
is a heresy of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Briskman, director of the Southwest Region of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said Farrakhan is just
changing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of attacking Jews personally, he used a radical
element of the Hasidic movement to do his dirty work for him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Briskman said his organization has taken a wait-and-see attitude
on Farrakhan's professed change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very suspicious when somebody claims they are changing
and then allows someone to attack Jews from his own podium,''
Briskman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ira Youdovin, executive director of the Chicago Board of
Rabbis, told reporters he was stunned by Farrakhan's decision to
allow the anti-Israel leader to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But Youdovin is willing to work with Farrakhan if the Nation of
Islam leader apologizes for past insults against the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might lose my job for saying so,'' Youdovin told the AP.
``But the Nation of Islam does a lot of good work in the black
community, too. It's a frustration not being able to participate
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan likely won't apologize for the appearance of the
anti-Israel leader. But many people of good will are praying that
Farrakhan's change of heart is sincere. What an impact he will make
for religious unity if his words of peace lead to action.

SANCTIONED VIOLENCE IN HOCKEY RUINS A ONCE-CHERISHED RITE OF
BOYHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One Sunday a few weeks ago, my 8-year-old son, Patrick, played
ice hockey (or a loose variation thereof) for the first time. He
proudly donned his new helmet, his new shoulder pads, shin and
elbow guards, his new skates, and took to the ice, stick in hand,
to chase after a puck with a couple of other kids his age. The
first time he shot the puck into the net, Patrick thrust his arms
toward the ice rink's ceiling, which is the way real hockey players
celebrate goals.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exhilarating day for him, as I was pretty sure it
would be, because it had been an exhilarating day for me 35 years
ago when I played hockey for the first time on a frozen pond in
Minnesota. For the balance of my childhood, that was how I spent my
winters, gathered with my buddies in subzero temperatures on
outdoor rinks, chasing pucks for hours, oblivious to frozen feet,
and earlobes, and noses, and fingers. Such was the force of the
game's hold on us. Each spring, when the ice melted, was a
sorrowful time.
</P>
<P>
   Then on that recent Sunday in Texas, the game was passed from
generation to generation, and in truth, my wife, Catherine,
deserves the credit. To me, hockey was the cherished ritual of
fishing hockey pucks out of snow banks on winter nights. To her,
hockey was the bloodthirsty thuggery of the professional game as it
was often portrayed on television.
</P>
<P>
   I think I was gradually able to convince her that hockey,
particularly as it was played by kids, was not that way, that
professional hooliganism was an aberration, that hockey was really
about speed and skill and camaraderie, and fierce competition
without the ugliness. So Catherine finally gave her blessing to
Patrick's participation, and on that recent Sunday, she was happy,
too, because her son was getting a chance to do something that he
loved, and that his father had loved before him.
</P>
<P>
   But her good feeling lasted only a few days, until Feb. 22, when
the National Hockey League and a player for the Boston Bruins named
Marty McSorley ruined everything. That night, my wife and I watched
a videotaped replay as McSorley nearly decapitated Vancouver's
Donald Brashear with a vicious two-handed swipe of the stick across
Brashear's head. Brashear tumbled to the ice beneath the blow,
unconscious. The image left us both nauseated and speechless. Tears
came to my wife's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much I don't want my son to play
hockey,'' she said a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could dismiss her feelings as those of an
overprotective mother. But I can't. After seeing what we saw, on
top of all the other NHL nastiness over the years, I can't blame
her a bit. I do resent the National Hockey League, which condones
and perpetuates a culture of violence that ultimately led to
McSorley's grotesque attack. The NHL doesn't seem to realize that
kids emulate the pros, ``in all things.'' The NHL doesn't seem to
realize that the ugliness of the pro game, with McSorley now as its
poster child, threatens to deprive kids like my son of their chance
to play a wonderful sport. Yes. That I resent.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Since the McSorley incident, the National Hockey League has been
gagging on its own hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The league quickly suspended McSorley for the rest of the
season, and decried the act as something that the NHL would not
tolerate. Missing from the statements of contrition, however, was
the fact that both McSorley, the perpetrator, and Brashear, the
victim, are hockey goons who make their living _ not with an
ability to skate, shoot and score _ but with their fists. In fact,
earlier in the same game, McSorley and Brashear had dropped their
gloves and bludgeoned each other. For this, there were no
suspensions or statements of contrition. Instead, the two were
allowed to dust themselves off, spend a few minutes in the penalty
box, and emerge to battle again. After the ill-fated game, McSorley
said that his intent was not to decapitate Brashear, merely to pick
a fight with him again. That, where the NHL is concerned, would
have been quite OK.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Such is the code of justice in pro hockey. The NHL is the only
major sport (pro football, baseball and basketball being the
others) that tolerates such behavior. It seems that hockey fighting
is the rough legacy of the Canadian frontier, where the game began.
It survives in a more civil time, some NHL players, coaches and
officials maintain, as a sort of safety valve, allowing combatants
in the high-speed, volatile sport, to blow off steam.
</P>
<P>
   Without such an outlet, the laughably disingenuous argument
goes, there would actually be an increase in the type of atrocities
like the one perpetrated by McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fighting is not tolerated in American high school hockey, or
college hockey, or in the Olympics, or in Europe. As best we know,
decapitations at those levels are at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the real reason fighting is allowed, even
encouraged in professional hockey, is something else altogether: It
has to do with marketing. The NHL knows fighting appeals to our
darker natures, and darker natures sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I'll admit to the perverse thrill of watching two NHL
heavyweights ``chucking knuckles,'' the same way I'll watch a
bullrider being gored, or a NASCAR driver smashed against a
retaining wall. The NHL knows the voyeur exists in us all, and the
league has not been able to resist perversities that have made
Jerry Springer and professional wrestling cultural phenomenons. So
the Marty McSorleys pair up with the Donald Brashears on a regular
basis in the NHL, and try to beat each other senseless. The crowd
roars, and officials wink, then profess shock and outrage when one
or the other gets carried away and commits aggravated assault, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that my son has not shown any desire to ride
bulls, or drive race cars, or wrestle professionally. He does love
hockey. I would love for him to play, to have the same experiences
that I had. But now, where his mother is concerned, I find myself
in the position of defending the indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   For help I went to Ken Hitchcock, head coach of the Dallas
Stars. Hitchcock is a thoughtful, articulate man, who demands
fiercely competitive play from his players, but has little stomach
for the staged muggings that remain part of the game. On the
morning before a Stars contest against Chicago, I asked him to help
me convince my wife that it was a good idea for our son to become a
hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Hitchcock said, leaning back on a bench in the Stars'
locker room, obviously warming to the task. He spoke of the value
of belonging to a team, the exhilaration, the speed, the unique
energy of the game. But he seemed to understand my quandary and my
wife's concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the game turns violent _ it's always going to be a
physical game _ but if it turns disrespectful, then there's no
place to play hockey,'' Hitchcock said. ``You can't play this game
if it turns the other way. It's a very emotional game. It's a
wonderful game, but it doesn't have a place for that. But if that's
the way the game's going, then I don't think a lot of people want
to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Our tickets for the game between the Stars and the Chicago
Blackhawks were Christmas presents from Catherine to Patrick and
me. Our seats were just a few rows from the ice, and after watching
the McSorley attack, I could tell my wife had regretted her choice
of gifts. In her mind, we would be sitting close enough to be
splattered by blood if the game turned ugly. I promised her that
Patrick and I would leave Reunion Arena if that happened.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't. Instead, the game was an advertisement for
everything that the NHL is, or at least could be, if they would
excise the game's criminal element. Sitting so close, the speed of
the game was breathtaking, the body contact often fierce, but
within the rules. The visiting team won in overtime, but everyone
in the disappointed crowd had been wildly entertained. My son left
the arena hoarse from yelling, and dreaming of the day when he
would dash down the ice like his hero, Stars superstar Mike Modano,
his sweater flapping in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   And he will get his chance, at least for now. We will continue
to make our weekly trips to the ice rink after all. The joy of the
game as it is played by kids will continue to outweigh the
lawlessness of professional hockey that borders on the immoral. At
least that's my hope. My wife might feel differently.

PEOPLE SELL THE DARNDEST THINGS ON EBAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Liz Stevens 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've never taken a virtual spin around the online auction
house eBay, you might not know that you can get a Mark McGwire
signed baseball ($950), a pair of Moser candlesticks ($356), a
Turkish rug ($250) or _ under ``Miscellaneous: General'' _ Bob
Eubanks (1 cent).
</P>
<P>
   ``BOB IS THE MAN!!!!!'' so goes the seller's description. ``Buy
Bob Eubanks and have him live with you. He's one groovy cat, I'll
tell you! Just check him out in the far out picture I've got
posted. Is he the king of cool or what?!?!? How could you NOT bid
on this item? Sorry, there's only one Bob so bid high and bid
often, cuz once he's gone, he's gone. Free shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 4 million items up for bid, eBay can't possibly
police all of its traffic _ making it the perfect target for
wisecrackers like this would-be merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Bob fans, the aforementioned auction closed in
August. Fortunately, this and dozens of other chuckle-inducing eBay
pranks (including the guy who tried to sell his soul recently) have
found a home on a quirky Web site called whattheheck.com
(www.whattheheck.com//ebay). Whattheheck is not affiliated with
eBay but has compiled a hilarious file of bizarre, comical and just
plain gross items that people (some of them spelling-challenged)
have ``really truly'' tried to auction off. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _Annoying little brother, $1.50
</P>
<P>
   _Irksome cat (throws up constantly), 1 cent
</P>
<P>
   _Your very own bobsled team (Olympic hopefuls), $3.6 million
</P>
<P>
   _Fairy dust (nontoxic), $1.75
</P>
<P>
   _Toenail clippings (freshly bitten off), $50
</P>
<P>
   _Hillbilly (plays the banjo, eats too much), 1 cent
</P>
<P>
   _Half-used tube of toothpaste, (''Keep your teeth nice and clean
with this almost full tube of prooven cavity fighting
protection''), $1
</P>
<P>
   Not everything on the whattheheck.com site is appropriate for a
family audience; the toilet humor is prominent. On the other hand,
if you steer clear of the questionable links, you'll find much
hilarity here. You might even stumble onto something to buy:
</P>
<P>
   Up for grabs: ``The Meaning of Life''
</P>
<P>
   Current bid: $3.26
</P>
<P>
   Description: ``I have discovered the reason for our existence
and will be happy to share this information with the highest
bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy shopping!

MOB HIT?: RADIO STATIONS WAKE UP TO SOPRANOS' THEME SONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, it's possible that you've heard A3's ``Woke Up This
Morning,'' the theme song to the HBO series ``The Sopranos,'' even
if you don't have HBO. Not only is it on a terrific soundtrack
album that also includes cuts from Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra and
Elvis Costello, it's starting to get airplay on radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   We like the song so much that we became curious about it,
wondering how it came to be ``The Sopranos'' theme song. Despite
this being a simple question, it took several phone calls before a
Columbia Records spokeswoman gave us the answer: ``Sopranos''
creator David Chase heard it one morning on KCRW, the public radio
station in Santa Monica, Calif. He hadn't even planned on using a
theme song for the series, but when he heard the A3 cut, he fell in
love with it, and it became the counterpoint to the opening titles
featuring Tony Soprano's long drive home.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it's not a new song. It's been around longer than
``The Sopranos,'' even though it sounds as it were written just for
the series. We found out some other interesting things:
</P>
<P>
   A3 is a British group, whose full name is Alabama 3. It's a
large, odd, roots-rock-worshipping congregation led by the Rev. Dr.
D. Wayne Love. That could explain ``Woke Up This Morning's''
gospel-style chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The group was a buzz band at Austin's South by Southwest
festival in spring 1998 _ months before ``The Sopranos'' premiered.
A3 was supposed to be a big deal, but went nowhere. For a while,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woke Up This Morning'' first appeared on a 1998 album called
``Exile on Coldharbour Lane,'' released around the time of South by
Southwest. ``In six months, they'll either be big or gone,'' the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram's Malcolm Mayhew wrote about the group in
a review of the album. He praised the songs ``Ain't Goin' to Goa''
and ``U Don't Dans 2 Tekno Anymore'' but said nothing about ``Woke
Up This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``Woke Up This Morning'' not new, it's not even a
new single. ``They worked it to radio before, and it got some
airplay _ but very little airplay,'' said Scott Strong, program
director of The Merge.
</P>
<P>
   The song has yet to show up on the Billboard Hot 100, even
though virtually everyone who hears it says it's really cool. It's
at No. 16 and rising on Radio &AMP; Records' adult-alternative chart.
``It's still comparatively early to judge how it's doing,'' Strong
says. ``The great thing is the reaction that it has from listeners
who are so into the show.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan is Jay Leno, who brought A3 across the Atlantic two
weeks ago just to sing ``Woke Up this Morning'' on ``The Tonight
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A3 has quite a Web site (www.elemental.music.co.uk
/alabama3/index.htm), on which the group shows a distaste for
corporate rock. Funny, since the album ``Exile on Coldharbour
Lane'' was released by Geffen and the ``Sopranos'' soundtrack was
released by Sony _ and the TV series runs on Time-Warner's HBO.
Guess you can be corporate when it suits you.

MADONNA'S GOT GUTS, STYLE, MUSICAL MOXIE ... BUT, GIRLFRIEND CAN'T
ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not difficult to write an appreciation of Madonna the pop
star, Madonna the shrewd businessperson or Madonna the woman. No
matter how much you love or hate her, there's no denying that she's
a cultural force, a woman who continues to be a ray of light in
music, videos and all things fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   She has an inimitable ability to reinvent herself and to grow in
her artistic endeavors _ except acting.
</P>
<P>
   An appreciation of Madonna the actress is not so easy. And her
look-at-me-I'm-acting turn in ``The Next Best Thing'' doesn't help
her case. The movie is just more proof that acting is not even the
next, next, next best thing Madonna does.
</P>
<P>
   I had honestly hoped that I wouldn't have to say that. My love
affair with Madonna has been a roller-coaster ride. It always
seemed that just when she had created something worthwhile, she
followed it with something utterly mediocre, musically speaking.
But I always stuck with her.
</P>
<P>
   When she first burst onto the scene during the '80s, I was
cautiously fascinated. Fast-forward a little bit. I disliked the
``True Blue'' phase and the white, short 'do. I loved everything
about ``Like a Prayer'' _ the videos, the look, the
autobiographical songs and, ooh, the Pepsi controversy. I didn't
care for the ``I'm Breathless'' and ``Dick Tracy''/Warren Beatty
period, and hated the Vogue craze that soon smothered the gay
dance-club scene. I enjoyed ``Justify My Love'' and the very cool
remix of that song in which she quoted from the Book of Revelation.
Then, I passionately hated ``Erotica'' and the ``Sex'' book, and
later kind of dug ``Bedtime Stories,'' although I didn't buy the
album because I had stopped caring.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ``Human Nature'' video. The declarative last line of
that song, ``absolutely no regrets,'' was cause for more ``You go,
girl'' snaps than anything she had done before.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Evita,'' and the event that seemed to make the most
noticeable change in her yet: little Lourdes. Becoming a mother was
probably the best thing for her. Next she produced her most mature
and personal album to date, ``Ray of Light.'' Whereas ``Like a
Prayer'' _ which is still my favorite Madonna album because of the
time in my life it represented _ was deeply personal in that she
tried to exorcise the ghosts that had driven her to rule the world,
with ``Ray of Light'' she made peace with them and, ultimately,
with herself. Motherhood and an introspective exploration of her
spiritual side through yoga, Hinduism and the Cabala (Jewish
mysticism), played no small role in this.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Ray of Light,'' the girl was not material anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowned World/Substitute for Love,'' the first song on ``Ray
of Light'' begins ``I traded fame for love/Without a second
thought/It all became a silly game/Some things cannot be bought/Got
exactly what I asked for ... And now I find/I've changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Other songs on the album are equally representative of her
change, and the atmospheric techno touches by producer William
Orbit perfectly backdrop her words and new life outlook. In
``Shanti/Ashtangi'' she adapts text from the Yoga Taravali.
``Little Star'' is a loving ode to her child: ``God gave a present
to me/Made of flesh and bones ... You make my spirit whole/Never
forget who you are/Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   With all this positive energy suddenly directed down an
enlightened path that made her seem more self-assured than ever, I
just knew her acting would improve. It had no where to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to the other side of her celebrity: her film
``career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hands down, the best movie she has starred in was ``Truth or
Dare,'' the expertly done documentary that followed her on her 1989
Blond Ambition tour. She, of course, was herself. No acting
involved. She wasn't bad in ``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' because
the title character ``was'' Madonna. In ``A League of Their Own''
and ``Dick Tracy'' she was decent, but those characters called for
overacting. There's no need to mention most the other films. I've
forgotten them, and you should, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``Evita.'' It was heralded as the highlight of
her acting career, and maybe it was, but that's not saying much.
She earned a Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical Golden Globe for
playing Eva Peron in Alan Parker's film version of the Andrew Lloyd
Webber musical. I think the movie was overrated, as was her
performance. She never really grasped the character. It was more
like a megastar had been asked to play an equally strong
personality, but couldn't give any humanity to the role because the
megastar had long stopped trying to be a real person.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Evita'' was a step forward. It was the closest she had
come to being a serious actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' could have been an opportunity to move
toward that goal. The film has some nice performances by a few
truly talented actors: Rupert Everett as the gay best friend, ``Law
&AMP; Order's'' Benjamin Bratt as the man who falls in love with
Madonna's character, and a brief appearance by Illeana Douglas as a
lawyer. It would be easy to say that playing next to such talent
highlighted her shortcomings. But an even bigger indicator of her
lack of acting finesse is that the movie is as exciting as a
backgammon match on television. Being surrounded by fine actors
does not a quality movie make, as Madonna should have learned in
``Body of Evidence,'' which co-starred Willem Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The character, Abbie, is even a little like Madonna. She's a
yoga instructor who loves gay men, and gay men love to love her
back.
</P>
<P>
   But every line she utters and every move she makes in ``The Next
Best Thing'' is so calculated it feels as if she's working on a big
chess board. She's convincing neither at physical comedy nor at
finding her pathos. This movie is proof that some people simply
don't have what it takes to be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Let me just break character for a moment. Madonna: I love you. I
love your gumption. I love your success as a pop star, a mother and
trend-setter. I love the way you constantly challenge yourself. I
love ``Ray of Light,'' and I'm happy that you have finally found
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But please, if you're going to star in another movie, make it a
documentary. The only character you excel at playing is yourself.

MARATHON RUNNER'S U.S. CITIZENSHIP IS ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi, the world-record holder in the marathon, has
still not given up hope of obtaining American citizenship in time
to compete in the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. If he
does gain citizenship, he is considering the unusual prospect of
running both the London Marathon on April 16 and the Olympic trials
three weeks later in Pittsburgh, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, a native of Morocco, and his wife, Sandra, have been
working quietly to have his citizenship expedited under a special
provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act used primarily
by spouses of American military personnel and businessmen. The
provision requires the applicant's spouse to be a U.S. citizen
living abroad and employed by the government, by an American
research institution or by an American corporation that promotes
foreign trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the sports world, the provision was used most notably by the
French defender David Regis to become an American citizen in time
for soccer's 1998 World Cup. Regis' wife was hired by a travel
agency that was an official tour provider for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In Khannouchi's case, the details are sketchy. He and his wife
are not speaking publicly about the issue, preferring to work
behind the scenes. Betsy Hill, a family friend who has been a
spokeswoman for the Khannouchis, said she could not discuss what
sort of job Sandra Khannouchi was seeking or even which lawyer the
couple had hired to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything more than the prospects look fine,'' Hill
said. ``We're optimistic that she will be able to obtain employment
overseas, but the time line is short.''
</P>
<P>
   An overseas job will have to come from someone other than New
Balance, the Boston-based shoe company whose apparel Khannouchi
endorses. Jim Davis, the chairman and chief operating officer of
New Balance, said that although the company wants him to become a
citizen quickly and supports his effort, the special job provision
seemed ``sort of contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something that's right,'' Davis said. Kathy
Shepard, a spokeswoman for New Balance, said the company was
reluctant because, ``It may appear to the outside we are trying to
put a team New Balance person in the running for a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Coogan, a New Balance runner who ran in the marathon at the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, said he supported Khannouchi's effort as
long as he was not given any preferential treatment in obtaining
his citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it the American way; he came here as a nobody and built
himself into a world-record holder,'' Coogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y. set the world marathon
record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds last fall at the Chicago
Marathon. He came to the United States in 1993 to participate in
the World University Games.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that he was not receiving sufficient support from the
Moroccan track federation, he took up residence in Brooklyn,
married Sandra Natal, a naturalized American, and applied for
American citizenship. Under normal circumstances, he would have
been eligible for citizenship on Sept 15, 2000, the day the
Olympics begin and two weeks before its men's marathon on Oct. 1.
However, the Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who
interviewed him was accused of taking bribes and left the agency.
The case fell into a bureaucratic crack and Khannouchi had to begin
the application process again, which would not give him citizenship
in time for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., has been assisting the
Khannouchis with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but
political and track officials say privately that his best chance
lies with his wife taking a job overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Another option open to Khannouchi is to compete for Morocco, but
he has said repeatedly that he would not run for a country that did
not support him. Asked if there was any chance that he would change
his mind, Hill said, ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he gained American citizenship in time, however,
Khannouchi would apparently have to receive permission from Morocco
to compete for the United States. An Olympic rule requires that an
athlete wait three years to compete for a new country in the Games
unless he has permission from his former country, said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the Moroccans would try to block him.
If they did, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, would
most likely attempt to solve the problem, given his stated desire
to see the best athletes competing in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth possibility would be to petition the IOC to run without
attachment to any nation. When the former Soviet Union
disintegrated, for instance, athletes from its republics competed
as the Unified Team in the 1992 Olympics and the Olympic Hymn was
played at medal ceremonies in place of any national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making it stricter to compete if an athlete changes
countries, and this would go against that trend,'' Servan-Schreiber
said. ``But the president may be amenable if this person sent a
letter saying, `What can you do to help me?' If a high-level
athlete misses the Games because of a bureaucratic problem, that is
too bad. Maybe President Samaranch would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   If he did acquire citizenship, Khannouchi would be faced with an
intriguing, risky proposition, to run the London Marathon for a
six-figure payday on April 16 and to run the American Olympic
trials on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Most elite athletes run two marathons in a year, not two in
three weeks, given the perils of injury and fatigue. But the
Olympic A qualifying standard is 2:14, more than eight minutes
slower than Khannouchi's world record. And he is so much faster
than any other American marathoner that he could very likely win
the trials, or place in the top three, at a pace less demanding
than an international race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not out of the question,'' Hill said of the possibility
of running both marathons. Another family friend also said that
Khannouchi's wife had been discussing the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for Sydney, Khannouchi would have to win the trials,

   ``The question is, if he wins London in 2:07 and change, three
weeks later can he `jog' to win the trials or be in the top
three?'' said Ryan Lamppa, a researcher at the U.S. track and field
federation's road running information center in Santa Barbara,
Calif. ``I think a guy at that level could do that. Five months
later is the men's marathon in Sydney. Will there be much
carryover? That's another question. He can't jog 2:14 at the
trials; he'd still be working at 90 percent. It's not recommended,
but he's a guy good enough to do it.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Early in ``The Arcades Project,'' Walter Benjamin's
recently published 1,073-page study of mid-19th-century Parisian
habits, there is the following observation: ``Making money becomes
the object of an almost sensual fervor, and love becomes a
financial concern. In the age of French Romanticism, the erotic
ideal was the working girl who gives herself; now it is the tart
who sells herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are not Benjamin's but are quoted from a German
writer, Egon Friedell, who goes on to conclude that the paragon of
fashion during the Second Empire ``was the grande dame who becomes
the coquette.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this were unfamiliar to you, and you happened to find
yourself a contestant on some very rarefied version of ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,''you might make an educated guess that the
quotations originated in the program notes of any of a dozen fall
2000 runway collections. That is, assuming that the program notes
were written by people who decided to abandon the usual drivel (``I
am. I am dawn. I am transparency.'') and to opt for musings meant
to telegraph what has, in fact, really driven the spirit of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The fall 2000 shows come to a close in Paris on Friday. By now
journalists and buyers have looked at women in heels and tight,
needle-wide skirts, or swaddled in fur, or draped with streams of
gold chains across bare breasts in four cities on two continents
over 27 days. In and out of taxis, from one show to another,
there's been a lot of chatter about the season's celebration of
money, but less about the tribute being paid to one kind of woman
who pursues it. The coquette, as Friedell would put it, who wants
to be a grande dame.
</P>
<P>
   This particular message blared the loudest at the Celine show
here on Tuesday night, where the theme music to ``Dallas,''
``Dynasty'' and ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' played. The
problematic notes handed out before the show indicated that the
muses here were ``stylish gamines from Leslie Caron to Chloe
Sevigny.'' One could no sooner imagine Sevigny _ who was recently
nominated for an Oscar and whose cool first came to the attention
of fashion editors when she was a downtown fixture wearing socks
with flip-flops like a Sicilian grandfather _ strutting about in
Celine's denim trousers with a built-in gold-chain belt, or in a
leopard jersey dress, than one could picture Patti Smith knocking
on the door of Nancy Reagan's closet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors, who designs the Celine line, took the signifiers
of wealth that are so trendy again _ herringbone, chevrons, blanket
plaids _ and cheapened them on purpose, one guesses, to appeal to
his own sense of camp fun. But nothing about the show felt like
fun. All that jumbling of sex and social ambition called to mind
Annette Bening in ``American Beauty,'' literally trying to vacuum
away her middle-class life in her slip and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Those who ventured to Veronique Branquinho's show immediately
afterward experienced relief. A Belgian, Branquinho generally holds
her Paris shows in gloomy places so far from the city center that
they might as well be in Brussels, and she has generally paid
little heed to what other designers might be doing. This time,
however, she showed at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts on the Left Bank, a
spot with all the romance its name implies. She worked with many of
the same signifiers of the good life that Kors and others have
appropriated: houndstooth, used on thick wool sweaters, and glen
plaid, cut into trousers in a perfectly fitting hourglass shape.
But she stripped them of their banality.
</P>
<P>
   Branquinho turned out trench coats with rich, contrasting lapels
and cut them long and narrow. Gone was the swishy ``I'm running to
Le Cirque and then to my collagen injection'' effect. She showed
chevron-pattern skirts, but cut on an A-line and worn over skinny
pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was probably thinking, This is how my mother dressed in
the '70s and this is how I'm going to do it,'' said Michel Botbol,
creative director of Harper's Bazaar, who was raving about
Branquinho's show as he awaited the start of the Chloe show on
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Botbol was also one of the first to notice that seated in the
front row was that rare celebrity one doesn't expect to see at a
fashion show, Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld was with his new wife,
Jessica Sklar. Asked what he was doing at a Paris fashion show, he
responded, ``I couldn't stay away any longer,'' in a kind of
fatigued monotone.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld got to witness much of what Stella McCartney, Chloe's
designer, does best. She had exquisite tops with 1920s-inspired
beadwork splaying from the collar. She ventured beyond her
signature girlishness too, with military-inspired coats thrown over
short silk Jacquard print dresses. Skinny jeans paired with high
heels are another of McCartney's trademark looks. It never looks
trashy in her hands, perhaps because it is a look plucked from her
own world of well-bred young Londoners. Still, she could have
benefited from showing fewer jeans this time around.
</P>
<P>
   At the Emanuel Ungaro show a few hours later, McCartney's
influence was hard to miss. He included a top made only of gold
chains, as McCartney did last season and so many other designers
have done since. And there were plenty of jeans and heels, and
models in aviator glasses.
</P>
<P>
   At his young age, Alexander McQueen, who scooted out at the end
of his show for Givenchy in a baggy denim jumpsuit, has a greater
claim to bad 1980s rock references than Ungaro does. Still, there
was little excuse for what he produced on Wednesday: blazers worn
as dresses over skinny ties, patent leather miniskirts that fitted
like swaths of tinfoil, an endless array of leather leg warmers
worn on just one leg, which reminded one of a controversial shoot
Helmut Newton did for Vogue in which he fixed braces to his model's
limbs. McQueen's show didn't come off as subversive, however; it
came off like the stuff 10th graders shop for on Eighth Street in
Greenwich Village. The clothes were poorly styled as well. Dark
hose and white shoes, the worst of all glamour don'ts, did not
achieve any sense of purposeful hip.
</P>
<P>
   If uptown shopkeepers, or any shopkeepers for that matter, found
little to meet their needs at Givenchy, they were to find little,
either, at Christian Lacroix, who despite all his gifts seemed to
be designing for a country of one: Bette Davis, in ``What Ever
Happened to Baby Jane?'' There were clownishly cut pants and models
with painted apple-red cheeks and oversize plastic bows in their
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are grateful for designers like Dries van Noten, who
turned out an inspired collection of full funneled skirts in mohair
and printed silk, tweed coats over sequined dresses and other coats
with playful ballooned lapels.
</P>
<P>
   Another Belgian, Olivier Theyskens, had some mishaps at his show
on Monday, which began inauspiciously 90 minutes after it was
supposed to. Theyskens is experimenting passionately, if not
altogether spectacularly, at the moment. He turned out some
questionable to-the-knee black leather parkas gathered at the
sides, which seemed to be designed for those with a need to scratch
their thighs. His high point, though, came in the form of
crinolined hoop skirts, which were striking for their vastness,
though he cut some of them too long, and as a result made the
models stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Theyskens said he worked on one of them, a green velvet version,
with the help of 10 friends. ``It's really like a tent,'' he said
of his creation. Despite his mistakes, it's hard not to give him a
break. ``I should go camping in it,'' he said.

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Abdul Hamid has a vision for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   It is, unfortunately, a vision that frightens his friend,
Ferdinand Obi Abbas, who works in a tiny electronics shop near
Hamid's office in the tumultuous maze of passageways that comprise
the sprawling Okoko market.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid, who works in an import-export firm, is Muslim and yearns
to see the edicts of his faith and the punishment for breaking them
_ the Sharia _ made the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the divine law of God,'' he says. ``When you steal, your
hand should be chopped off. When you take alcohol, you should be
stoned to death. Are we to follow the divine law of God or the laws
of human beings?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Abbas is Christian and fears Muslims want to subject
members of his faith to Islamic law. ``I would never be able to go
to the states in the north, where they have Sharia, with my sister
or wife or mother because of the rules of Sharia that are against
women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Abbas thinks Nigeria must remain under a government
that favors neither religion. ``It's not Islam as a religion that
we worry about,'' he says. ``We have a secular state, where people
are free to practice their own religions. And to keep one Nigeria,
this must not change.''
</P>
<P>
   But a roiling conflict between Muslims and Christians over the
push for Sharia in four Nigerian states threatens the country's
tenuous unity and is disrupting the nation's slow march to
democracy. This country of 115 million _ Africa's most populous,
and among its most influential _ is virtually split between Muslims
and Christians
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks an estimated 500 people have been killed
in clashes between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria's north, where
Muslims are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharia was introduced in the northern state of
Zamfara, causing an immediate reaction from fearful Christians and
human rights activists. In recent weeks, three other states _ Kano,
Kaduna and Niger _ declared their intentions to follow Zamfara's
lead, sparking the deadliest outbreak of violence since the civil
war in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has confounded Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's first
civilian president after 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   It also has undermined his campaign to convince the world that
Nigeria, long reputed to be one of the world's most dangerous and
corrupt countries, is now safe for much-needed investment.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   After touring areas devastated in the conflicts, a horrified
Obasanjo on Wednesday pleaded with both sides to restore peace. He
noted that Muslims and Christians have lived together for a century
with little friction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All so suddenly, people who had been neighbors for decades
turned on them and massacred them,'' he said in a nationally
televised address. ``And yet, those who were responsible for these
murders claim that they were acting in defense of faith or
religion. I cannot believe that any religion in this day and age
can sanction the taking of innocent life.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, a Christian and former general, last week called an
emergency meeting of state governors and announced that the group
had agreed to suspend the drive for Sharia.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslim leaders nevertheless vowed to continue their
campaign, throwing the fragile democracy in a perilous quandary.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Islamic courts have settled civil cases, such as
divorces and inheritances, among Muslims. However, the provisions
that sparked the violence extended Sharia to include criminal
courts with the power to punish violations of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders argue that the laws apply only to Muslims, but
Christians and human rights groups argue that a state government's
embrace of such a religious code violates the Nigerian
constitution's guarantees of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Muslim leaders invited that Christians who disagree
with Sharia are welcome to leave. ``The only thing they have to do
is to vacate the place and go where the climate is good for them,''
Datti Ahmed, a Muslim and former presidential aspirant, told
reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   While he is respected for his integrity, Obasanjo, who was
elected last February last year, has been criticized by Nigerian
journalists and political analysts for moving too slowly and
cautiously to head off the crisis before it led to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   These critics said Obasanjo should have mounted a legal
challenge when the first state sought to introduce Sharia. ``This
violent reaction was predictable, and one should be able to count
on the president and federal government to take action to prevent
it,'' said Ayo Obe, president of the
</P>
<P>
   Civil Liberties Organization in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict could have been contained if the Nigerian attorney
general immediately had challenged the constitutionality of
imposing Sharia criminal provisions, Obe said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ayo Adebanjo, a veteran political leader, compared the
conditions in Nigeria to the situation in Yugoslavia, a
conglomeration of distinct religious and ethnic groups held
together only by decades of autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   As democratic forces swept the former socialist state, it began
to disintegrate with the conflict in Kosovo only the latest chapter
in the deadly process.
</P>
<P>
   Adebanjo believes the country risks shattering if it isn't
reshaped to allow enough space for its diverse religious and ethnic
groups. ``Either we agree on a model for us to live together or
break Nigeria,'' he said.

   INDEPENDENT-ADS (Washington) _ Developing. A Texas businessman
who is one of Gov. George W. Bush's biggest campaign contributors
said Friday that he had paid for $2 million in television
commercials airing in New York and other primary states that
criticized Sen. John McCain and promoted Bush's record on clean
air. The businessman, Sam Wyly, who recently sold a software
company he co-owned for $3.9 billion and has close ties to many
other Bush supporters, said he and his family had paid for the
advertising to draw attention to environmental issues. But McCain's
aides flatly accused the Bush campaign of being behind the
advertising, and labeled the commercials a scurrilous attempt to
evade campaign finance laws and steal the election. By Richard W.
Stevenson and Clifford J. Levy.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-PROPOSITIONS (Los Angeles) _ On television and radio, the
pitch is made relentlessly. Every commercial break brings another
political come-on. But most of the time, it isn't the governor of
Texas or the senator from Arizona, the vice president of the United
States or the former New Jersey senator that they are asking you to
vote for. It's Yes or No. The 30-second spot clock never seems to
stop, whether it is for Indian gambling or against insurance
reform, in favor of clean water or opposed to gay marriage. So many
groups, in fact, are elbowing for television time to broadcast
their positions on one of the 20 initiatives and referendums on the
California ballot, that they are all but drowning out the political
advertising by the presidential candidates. By Peter Marks.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Job growth suddenly weakened in

a serious softening of the economic boom. ``I don't think there is
anything in this report that shows the economy is weakening,'' said
Alexis Herman, the labor secretary. Like various private
economists, she pointed to unusually warm weather in early January,
which caused a surge in jobs in construction and a few other
sectors _ and these jobs disappeared in the colder February
weather. But stock market investors took the report as a sign that
the Federal Reserve may not have to raise interest rates quite as
much in order to brake an economy that appears to slowing on its
own. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188 points, or 1.8
percent. By Louis Uchitelle.

   WATCHING-TIGER (Undated) _ When Tiger Woods plays golf,
television executives swoon. With his rare power to move ratings,
he is the sports version of ``E.R.'' or ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire,'' a singular, 24-year-old programming entity capable
of clubbing rival networks in their Nielsens in his pursuit of
tournament victories. Woods doesn't have to win. He simply needs a
chance at victory to stir viewers to watch. When he's out of
contention, or not playing, ratings for PGA Tour events are strong,
but not as formidable; players like Jeff Maggert, David Duval, Phil
Mickelson or Vijay Singh just don't carry the same weight. Woods
has become what Michael Jordan's appearances with the Chicago Bulls
once meant to NBC's National Basketball Association broadcasts: a
guarantee of higher ratings than any other team and a surefire
reason to ooh and ahh. By Richard Sandomir.

   CRIME-RATES (New York) _ With the city's stunning drop in crime
in the 1990s, many New Yorkers have come to assume that aggressive
police tactics and crime reductions are inextricably linked. But a
look at other cities around the nation suggests that large
reductions in crime can be achieved with less reliance on the kinds
of confrontational law enforcement measures New York has used. In
fact, some cities, notably San Diego and Boston, have recorded as
big or even larger drops in violence through strategies that rely
on close cooperation between the police and the community and have
ended up improving race relations. By Fox Butterfield.

WHERE JADED MUSCLES EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 5)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After spending seven hours at the new Sports Club/LA
at Rockefeller Center, I think I burned all of 50 calories, most of
them saying ``thank you.'' Despite its jock-like name, this place
comes closer to matching its publicity agents' billing as ``an
urban country club'' than a gym. But it certainly surpasses any
country club I ever visited, growing up in Scarsdale, where there
were two kinds: the Protestant ones with overstocked bars and
crummy food, and the Jewish ones with understocked bars and yummy
food. Both had the type of help whose manner hovered between
diffident and resentful.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Club/LA, all 90,000 square feet of it, cost $20
million to build and has turned the gym into a mini-resort where
fitness doesn't have to be the top priority. Members can shop on
the stationary bikes and get highlights at the salon or Botox shots
from the on-site dermatologist, or sip martinis with a prime view
of the ice skaters. Convenience and service rule here: A concierge
will get you into Daniel for dinner, and a massage therapist will
apply your self-tanning lotion. To call this place a gym is like
calling the Four Seasons a hostel.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the same company that owns the Reebok Sports Club/NY on
the Upper West Side, and the Sports Club/LA that is to open next
summer on the Upper East Side at the old Vertical Club, this branch
is teeming with crisp, professional help, each employee more
cheerful than the next.
</P>
<P>
   Good cheer doesn't come cheap, of course, especially in New
York. An executive membership, the top of the line plan, means a
$2,400 initiation fee and monthly charge of $330 (privileges
include personalized laundry service and membership at all New York
branches, the Sports Club/LA in Los Angeles and the others
scheduled to open soon in Washington, Houston, San Francisco,
Boston and Miami). The less deluxe membership entails a $1,200
initiation fee and a $180 monthly charge. Spa and salon services
are extra _ but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable about millennial New York of course, is the
number of people who seem to have no shortage of time or money and
are so starved for activities they are clamoring to fill these
luxury monoliths. Rande Coleman, an executive at Douglas Elliman &AMP;
Associates, signed up for the East Side branch six months ago.
``It's an urban situation where you can literally spend a day with
unlimited options,'' she said excitedly. ``It's like day camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Side branch promises to be even more imposing, with a
rooftop terrace encompassing a driving range and tennis courts,
five squash courts, meditation gardens and a 15,000-square-foot
weight training gym, which the company says will probably be the
largest weight room in the country.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say, I haven't belonged to a gym in years. I got sick
of waiting in line for the treadmill, sick of changing my schedule
to go at off-peak hours, only to have a workman spray the mirror in
front of me with Windex, as if I weren't there, sick of musclehead
guys in the weight room taking up all the space and drenching every
bench with sweat they barely bothered to towel off.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought I would play at being one of the not-so-idle rich
and instead of just working out, ``spend the day at the club.''
Though the afternoon I chose was on a deserted holiday weekend, I
could tell that no workmen were brandishing Windex and no member
needed to hog anything. There seemed to be miles of machines, many
hooked up to Netpulse, which means you can check your e-mail or
shop on eBay while working out; my favorite part though, is that
once you have your password, every minute you spend on the machine
accrues to a Netpulse account that rewards you with frequent flier
miles. Talk about incentive!
</P>
<P>
   I discovered quickly that the drawback of Netpulse is that it
won't work unless you, the exerciser, are in movement. I valiantly
tried to shop for dresses at Bloomingdale's while pumping away on
the Precor, an elliptical Stairmaster, but gasping for air made it
hard to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Charleene O'Connor, who trains the trainers here and showed me
around, graciously offered to pedal for me so I could shop, which I
did for about a minute before I was overcome by guilt.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on to another form of virtual exercise, the interactive
class video. This means you push a button and watch a clip of an
exercise class so you can decide if you would like it. I shunned
Extreme Games, described as ``military style'' calisthenics,
preferring Candlelight Stretch, in which people gather in a
darkened room with candles and a guitarist. (Kumbaya, my Lord?)
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly exhausted from watching other people exercise, I made
my way past the Pilates studio and a boxing class to the office of
Vicki Poth, the director of spa operations. The Splash spa is open
to the public, as is the Splash salon, and it is possible to
schedule a full day's activities for any event, including, say, a
bachelor party complete with barber shaves for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Poth introduced me to Dr. Steven Victor, a cosmetic
dermatologist affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital, who is on the
club's staff.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested I get a laser facial to ``rejuvenate the skin,'' a
process he described as ``vaporizing the outer layer of skin.''
This would cost $200, and most of his patients, he said, get one
every six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to squint,'' he continued. ``I would recommend
Botox.''
</P>
<P>
   When I objected to the idea of injecting botulism near my brain,
he scoffed, and went on to recommend electrostimulation for my
facial muscles once a week for 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I shook my head firmly. ``You do your hair, right?'' he asked.
``Why wouldn't you do your face?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I told him, lately, I've actually been looking at my face
as a sort of science experiment as it shifts into unforeseen
formations of lines, bags, puffs and creases. It fascinates me
enough to wait and see what happens next. Maybe one day it'll
sprout rings, like Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   His face stayed blank, but that could be because of his own
Botox shots, which he had readily admitted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I took my squinty eyes down to the spa and got ready for an
endermologie treatment. This is a machine equivalent of cellulite
massage, and Diana, my therapist, gave me a pair of nylon Dr.
Dentons to protect my skin. She applied what looked like a vacuum
cleaner attachment to my hips and behind, which actually felt
relaxing, and I drifted off once or twice. (P.S. Afterward, the
skin looked exactly the same, though it supposedly takes weeks
before you see a change).
</P>
<P>
   Another therapist, Danielle, appeared soon after to administer
the silliest procedure of the day, the ``self-tan.'' She applied
some freezing exfoliating lotion to my arms and legs, and though
she wiped most of it off before applying Sothys Self-Tanning Lotion
(the brand they use on ``Baywatch,'' she said), I still felt some
sandy granules mixed in with the tan. Then she massaged my head and
feet, hard, and left, by my watch at least, five minutes before the
appointed time.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to the hair salon for my blow-out, I stopped by the
concierge to have her phone in a take-out order from a nearby
Chinese restaurant, so I could pick it up on my way home.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan, the stylist, who was wearing a tie with the Mona Lisa on
it, proclaimed, ``I see a smooth, polished look for you.'' When he
was done I had stick-straight hair that ended in a flip with some
long bangs in front. I looked like Sissy Spacek in ``Coal Miner's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to the Martini Bar to meet my sister for a drink, and she
tried not to laugh. As we nibbled on steak tartare in the Pulse Bar
&AMP; Grill, run by Drew Nieporent of Nobu, the concierge came in and
said I could pick up my food in half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   I left the building feeling thoroughly cosseted and comforted.
After dinner, I took off my clothes and started to laugh. The
self-tan, which takes four hours to set, was in full bloom, but its
application left something to be desired. Long white triangles
stood out on my thighs where apparently Danielle had missed, and
one heel was bright orange. So much for ``Baywatch.'' I looked like
a Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if I had still been at the club, all I would have had
to do was snap my fingers and someone would run to fix it. But I
was home now. I would just have to wait for it to self-fade, all on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Pity.

   GALLERY-ART-QUEEN (New York) _ The sleek crowd grew restive at
the opening late last month at Mary Boone's Fifth Avenue gallery,
but Boone was nowhere in sight. At exactly 6 p.m., Boone emerged
from her office. She was dressed expressly to complement one of the
paintings _ a Valentine-themed work full of swirly frosting and
candy hearts printed with messages like ``Hug Me'' _ in a
rose-print Todd Oldham frock and red python stilettos. It was easy
to see in the outfit not only a vote of confidence for Will Cotton,
the latest in a wave of young painters Boone is once again
championing. It was a vote, too, for Boone herself, for whom life
has started to seem oh-so-sweet again. The flamboyant dealer once
known as the Queen of SoHo, who moved uptown in the mid-1990s after
the scene she helped ignite had flared out, is working hard to
reinvent herself. By Nancy Hass. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   SABBAH-FASHION (New York) _ Da House of Sabbah, a clothing store
in Manhattan, owned by Claude Sabbah, 47, is a favorite with
underground fashion editors, ghetto-fabulous rappers and art-world
style icons wanting to preen. While he calls himself a couturier,
his clothes, at $500 to $2,000, cost a fraction of the real
couture. Customers pick out clothing samples hanging on racks that
Sabbah, who was born in Morocco, fabricates on a made-to-order

   NY-CATS-MUSICAL (New York) _ Residents of Manhattan have scorned
Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous musical ``Cats'' for years, but
how many of them have actually seen it? The news that after 18
years, the show will close on June 24 presents a unusual problem
for the jaded among us. On the one hand, there's the impulse to
ridicule or ignore the very tourist traps of which ``Cats'' is the
apogee. On the other, there's a nagging need to have seen and done
it all. In my case, the second instinct won out. And so, last
Sunday afternoon, four of us found ourselves behind the big
billboard eyes of the Wintergarden Theater doing the unthinkable. I
think it was an experience none of us will soon forget. By Rick

   NITEOUT-WOODLAWN (New York) _ Born Harold Danhakl, 1946.
Transformed into Holly Woodlawn in 1969, when Andy Warhol asked for
a last name. ``We were watching this episode of `I Love Lucy,'''
she said, ``and behind her was this sign on the No. 4 train,
`Woodlawn,' and we said: `That's it. Holly ... Wood. Holly
Woodlawn.'' She became the scene-stealing transvestite in Paul
Morrissey's ``Trash.'' Now, the movie, and Holly, are being rolled
out for a 30th-anniversary appearance. (``Trash'' opens March 17 in
Manhattan and in Los Angeles.) Thursday found her at
Bloomingdale's, all man, in a camel's hair jacket, khakis, yellow
sweater and fedora for an early lunch at Le Train Bleu with Karin
Lefler, in from San Francisco, who runs the Web site
hollywoodlawn.com. By Linda Lee. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Kumquat is among the hardiest citrus _
it can take temperatures to 15 degrees Fahrenheit _ and part of
that hardiness is because of the long winter's rest into which it
settles. Like other citrus, kumquat is a pretty sight all year
round, with glossy, evergreen leaves that provide a perfect
backdrop for the waxy white, sweet-smelling flowers. The fruit is
what makes kumquat stand out from the citrus crowd. You can eat
only the pulp of oranges and grapefruit, and for the most part, use
only the juice of a lemon or a lime. Kumquats can be eaten skin and
all. By Lee Reich. &QL;

&HT;     BUSH TESTS HISPANIC VOTER APPEAL IN CALIFORNIA

<P>
   CHULA VISTA, Calif. _ For George W. Bush, Tuesday's California
primary is a crucial test not only in his battle against John
McCain for the Republican nomination but also in his effort to show
he can attract the traditionally Democratic Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week Bush demonstrated his techniques in trying to
appeal to the group by going to a largely Hispanic gathering at the
Clear View Charter School here just north of San Diego. He answered
questions asked in Spanish and called himself ``Jorge Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing about 75 parents, he spoke in English although he
often uses Spanish before such groups. He boasted about his
education initiatives in Texas that he said had raised the test
scores of minorities. He also said he won nearly half of the
Hispanic vote in his 1998 re-election as Texas governor, not
mentioning some estimates pegging his share at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him because I think he looks out for minorities,
Latinos, and I really look for people like that,'' said one of he
parents, Lorna Mena.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending around $3 million on television
and radio in California, which will send a whopping 162 delegates
to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.
About a quarter of the $3 million is going to Hispanic TV and radio
outlets in the state, ``more than any other Republican Presidential
effort has spent,'' said one senior Bush adviser, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not conceding the state's Hispanic vote. But so far
the senator has not advertised on any Spanish-language outlet in
California, and the Spanish-language branch of his Web site _
``Vamos con McCain'' went operational only in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's matter of resources,'' said McCain spokeswoman Heather
Mirjahangir.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won 55 percent of the Hispanic vote in Arizona in his
last re-election bid in 1998, and he has been endorsed by the
Washington-based Hispanic Business Roundtable and by the Latino Los
Angeles County sheriff, Lee Baca.
</P>
<P>
   Among voters generally, Bush has run as much as 21 points ahead
of McCain in California polls. So his reaching out to Hispanics now
is less about winning the California primary than winning
California in November if he gets the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush effort ``is one that says the Latino vote is critical,
and we're not going to wait until the fall,'' said Lionel Sosa,
whose San Antonio-based advertising and marketing firm is producing
Bush's Spanish-language California radio and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush has not locked up the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Registration among Latinos skyrocketed in the past decade from 4
percent of California's electorate in 1990 to 14 percent in 1998,
according to Mark Baldassare, survey director of the Public Policy
Institute of California, a San Francisco-based nonpartisan research
group. Of those, 63 percent are Democratic and 23 percent are
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are a direct result of ballot initiatives backed by
former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. Proposition 187 in 1994 barred
undocumented immigrants from using taxpayer-funded services such as
hospitals and schools. It was challenged in court and found
unconstitutional. Proposition 209 in 1996 ended affirmative action
hiring, contracting and admissions programs in state institutions.
And Proposition 227 in 1998 severely restricted bilingual education
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness over these measures lingers. ``There was a sense of
immigrant bashing, and it would be a problem if Bush basically
followed the same pattern as Pete Wilson,'' said Bertha Wilson, a
Chula Vista School Board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there are some open wounds here
between leaders of the Republican Party and the Hispanic
population,'' said Alixe Mattingly, Bush's California spokeswoman.
However, Mattingly insisted Bush can overcome the legacy of
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The governor often mentions the good relations his family has
had with Hispanics and notes that his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, is married to a Mexican American, Columba Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, George W. Bush took part in a town meeting televised
by the Spanish-language television network, Univision, that was
</P>
<P>
   staged in Los Angeles and wired into four other locations around
the state. Bush answered questions in Spanish, and, Mattingly said,
his performance ``was a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   But the response of Hispanic voters remains in doubt. A poll by
Baldassare's Public Policy Institute of California showed that 40
percent of Hispanics said they might vote for Bush vote in
November. That would be a stunning contrast to 1996 when GOP
candidate Bob Dole got 28 percent of the Latino vote to President
Bill Clinton's 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a Los Angeles Times poll that showed Bush
ahead of McCain 47 percent to 26 percent overall also found that 52
percent of Hispanic voters have an unfavorable impression of Bush
while 56 percent have a favorable impression of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Hispanic Democrats in California are not ceding an
inch of turf to Bush. ``He may speak some Spanish, but I don't
think that's going to be enough in Calfornia,'' said California
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaragosa. ``He is out of sync (with
Latinos) on health care, out of sync on gun control, and his
tax-cut plan would jeopardize Social Security and Medicare. The
vast majority of California's electorate would oppose any plan that
did that, especially Latino voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Villaragosa added that Bush has moved ``farther and farther to
right, associating himself with elements of the (Republican) Party
who have been immigrant scapegoaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he opposes the ``spirit'' of Proposition 187
barring undocumented immigrants from most social services. But
regarding Proposition 209, he has said, ``I support the spirit of
no quotas and no preferences.'' He has been unenthusiastic about
bilingual education. At the Chula Vista meeting, he said children
should master English first and focus on other languages if
possible. Some parents disagreed, saying bilingual education would
prepare their youngsters for the new free-trade economy where
mastery of both English and Spanish is a resume enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many of the parents said they would keep an open
mind about Bush. ``We're not all thinking about only voting for a
Democrat,'' said Ana Talavera, a Democrat whose question prompted
Bush's discussion of bilingual education. ``We're not in a box. We
don't want to be a one-size-fits-all.''

Latinos, and I really look for people like that,'' said one of he
parents, Lorna Mena.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending around $3 million on television
and radio in California, which will send a whopping 162 delegates
to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.
About a quarter of the $3 million is going to Hispanic TV and radio
outlets in the state, ``more than any other Republican Presidential
effort has spent,'' said one senior Bush adviser, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not conceding the state's Hispanic vote. But so far
the senator has not advertised on any Spanish-language outlet in
California, and the Spanish-language branch of his Web site _
``Vamos con McCain'' went operational only in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's matter of resources,'' said McCain spokeswoman Heather
Mirjahangir.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won 55 percent of the Hispanic vote in Arizona in his
last re-election bid in 1998, and he has been endorsed by the
Washington-based Hispanic Business Roundtable and by the Latino Los
Angeles County sheriff, Lee Baca.
</P>
<P>
   Among voters generally, Bush has run as much as 21 points ahead
of McCain in California polls. So his reaching out to Hispanics now
is less about winning the California primary than winning
California in November if he gets the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush effort ``is one that says the Latino vote is critical,
and we're not going to wait until the fall,'' said Lionel Sosa,
whose San Antonio-based advertising and marketing firm is producing
Bush's Spanish-language California radio and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush has not locked up the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Registration among Latinos skyrocketed in the past decade from 4
percent of California's electorate in 1990 to 14 percent in 1998,
according to Mark Baldassare, survey director of the Public Policy
Institute of California, a San Francisco-based nonpartisan research
group. Of those, 63 percent are Democratic and 23 percent are
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are a direct result of ballot initiatives backed by
former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. Proposition 187 in 1994 barred
undocumented immigrants from using taxpayer-funded services such as
hospitals and schools. It was challenged in court and found
unconstitutional. Proposition 209 in 1996 ended affirmative action
hiring, contracting and admissions programs in state institutions.
And Proposition 227 in 1998 severely restricted bilingual education
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness over these measures lingers. ``There was a sense of
immigrant bashing, and it would be a problem if Bush basically
followed the same pattern as Pete Wilson,'' said Bertha Wilson, a
Chula Vista School Board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there are some open wounds here
between leaders of the Republican Party and the Hispanic
population,'' said Alixe Mattingly, Bush's California spokeswoman.
However, Mattingly insisted Bush can overcome the legacy of
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The governor often mentions the good relations his family has
had with Hispanics and notes that his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, is married to a Mexican American, Columba Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, George W. Bush took part in a town meeting televised
by the Spanish-language television network, Univision, that was
</P>
<P>
   staged in Los Angeles and wired into four other locations around
the state. Bush answered questions in Spanish, and, Mattingly said,
his performance ``was a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   But the response of Hispanic voters remains in doubt. A poll by
Baldassare's Public Policy Institute of California showed that 40
percent of Hispanics said they might vote for Bush vote in
November. That would be a stunning contrast to 1996 when GOP
candidate Bob Dole got 28 percent of the Latino vote to President
Bill Clinton's 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a Los Angeles Times poll that showed Bush
ahead of McCain 47 percent to 26 percent overall also found that 52
percent of Hispanic voters have an unfavorable impression of Bush
while 56 percent have a favorable impression of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Hispanic Democrats in California are not ceding an
inch of turf to Bush. ``He may speak some Spanish, but I don't
think that's going to be enough in Calfornia,'' said California
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaragosa. ``He is out of sync (with
Latinos) on health care, out of sync on gun control, and his
tax-cut plan would jeopardize Social Security and Medicare. The
vast majority of California's electorate would oppose any plan that
did that, especially Latino voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Villaragosa added that Bush has moved ``farther and farther to
right, associating himself with elements of the (Republican) Party
who have been immigrant scapegoaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he opposes the ``spirit'' of Proposition 187
barring undocumented immigrants from most social services. But
regarding Proposition 209, he has said, ``I support the spirit of
no quotas and no preferences.'' He has been unenthusiastic about
bilingual education. At the Chula Vista meeting, he said children
should master English first and focus on other languages if
possible. Some parents disagreed, saying bilingual education would
prepare their youngsters for the new free-trade economy where
mastery of both English and Spanish is a resume enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many of the parents said they would keep an open
mind about Bush. ``We're not all thinking about only voting for a
Democrat,'' said Ana Talavera, a Democrat whose question prompted
Bush's discussion of bilingual education. ``We're not in a box. We
don't want to be a one-size-fits-all.''

 &HT;     GEARING UP FOR ELECTION, LAWMAKERS HIT BRAKES ON HILL ACTION 
 &HT;    
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their eyes on the elections less than eight
months away, congressional leaders have apparently decided less is
more when it comes to legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new year began, House and Senate members have spent
less than half their time on Capitol Hill in active session.
Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers, have set a
light schedule for the remainder of the year. They want to adjourn
by early October to allow lawmakers opportunity to campaign, and
they're working in plenty of breaks before then.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are griping that Congress isn't doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to me that we're not getting our work
done,'' said Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., citing the paucity of votes
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for Congress to take up the issue of expanding Medicare
to include a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens,
Democratic leaders have taken to mocking Republicans for the
schedule. Citing the numerous proclamations and resolutions that
Congress considers each week, Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority
leader, cited some recent honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're celebrating national ``On Hold Month'' and national
``Procrastinators Week'' by doing what they do best - nothing,''
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it's not unusual for Congress to adopt a lighter
schedule during a presidential election year. And they say they're
being judged by President Clinton's agenda, which they have no
interest in tackling.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are pushing for such items as relief from a marriage
tax penalty and repealing the Social Security earnings limit, which
the House recently passed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing their own agenda, citing the
need for stronger gun control, a raise in the minimum wage and
advocating a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, both sides see an advantage in highlighting
these issues and letting the voters decide in November which party
should take the lead in resolving these disputes.
</P>
<P>
   CARPAL TUNNEL VISION
</P>
<P>
   Southern Republicans are feeling ignored by the Occupational
Safety &AMP; Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A group of top GOP House members wrote the head of OSHA, asking
that he schedule a public hearing on controversial new workplace
ergonomics rules somewhere in the Sunbelt. Sessions are now planned
only for Washington, Portland and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from GOP Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Dan Miller
of Florida among others asked that OSHA ``consider adding a hearing
in the Southern region of the U.S. to give all Americans a chance
to express their views on the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that OSHA's voluminous 1,200-page regulation
would put employers in a bind if they had to comply with all the
provisions to ease repetitive motion disorder. They say OSHA is
deliberately avoiding the South to concentrate on more welcoming
locations with a strong labor presence.
</P>
<P>
   DRILLING FOR VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts on offshore oil and gas exploration apparently won't
determine this presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising energy prices, all the chief presidential
candidates have signaled they won't try to boost drilling in waters
off states where the public resistance to such activity runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the latest to weigh in, saying
during an ABC interview that ``I think that we should allow these
decisions ... to be made by the people who are directly affected by
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans want offshore oil drilling,'' he said. ``That's fine
with me. Off Florida, they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has already sided with his brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in resisting drilling there and Vice
President Al Gore has said that not only does he oppose new
drilling, but that he would move to block activity on existing
leases off Florida and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   DUBIOUS ACHIEVEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Four Southern water projects have made a Top 10 list, but it is
a list of civil works jobs deemed wasteful by a taxpayers group.
</P>
<P>
   As prime examples of pouring money down the drain, Taxpayers for
Common Sense cited a $200 million Mississippi Delta flood
prevention effort, jetties costing $108 on the Oregon Inlet in
North Carolina, the annual $20 million dredging of the Apalachicola
River for limited barge traffic in Florida, Georgia and Alabama,
and the deepening of the Savannah, Ga., harbor at a cost of $230
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers should be outraged by this flagrant misuse of their
money,'' said Ralph DeGennaro, head of the taxpayers group, which
issued the report in cooperation with the National Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the cited projects, of course, believe they are
all worthy and justifiable.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An area of cool rain will slide east across parts of the
Carolinas in concert with a surface low pressure system and a
pocket of high-altitude cold air trailing just to the west. The
cold pocket will sag south over portions of south Georgia and
northern Florida Saturday afternoon, setting the stage for widely
separated showers and thunderstorms, a few with brief, moderately
heavy rain. Low clouds will linger west of the system over parts of
the southern Appalachians, with clouds breaking later Saturday over
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated showers and thunderstorms will affect spots in the
Southwest States as a cold low pressure in the upper atmosphere
spirals sluggishly east from the offshore waters of Baja
California. Farther north, generally light to occasionally moderate
rains will dampen the Pacific Northwest, with rains spreading east
of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A warming trend will continue across the Middle West as a warm
region of high pressure ridges northward from Texas. Warmth will
build eastward Sunday, embracing much of the Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Ohio River Valleys. Warmth will also build into the
Southeast States Sunday in the wake of Saturday's low pressure
system.
</P>
<P>
   Generally light snow will fall in parts of northern Maine early
Saturday in the unsettled wake of a low pressure system over the
Canadian Maritimes. The strong winds that buffeted parts of New
England Friday will ease Saturday as the low pulls farther away to
the northeast. Saturday night will not be as chilly as Friday night
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Gentle Winter
</P>
<P>
   Winters can be bitter in the northern Plains where northerly
winds direct arctic cold from the Canadian tundra. But, the most
recent winter has been exceptionally gentle. In Sioux Falls, S.D.,
the period from December through February was the eighth warmest
since records began in 1892. The coldest day in Sioux Falls was
December 20 when the mercury reached 11 degrees. On average, in
seven out of ten winters the temperature stays below zero on at
least one day. This past winter was dominated by winds from the
west which brought mild air masses from the Pacific Ocean.

FASHION 911'S? DIAL DA HOUSE OF SABBAH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like all divas, the rap performer Eve likes to make a
grand entrance. On a Tuesday afternoon, after keeping a dozen
people waiting two hours, she sashayed into Da House of Sabbah, a
clothing store on Mulberry Street, wearing a chubby gold fur
jacket, dripping in pave diamond jewelry, with her normally
platinum hair newly dyed cinnamon red.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dope,'' she said, spying a black fish-net gown with a
leopard lining on a rack. ``It's wild. It's different. No one else
would wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled the dress off the hanger and disappeared into a
dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 the previous night, a stylist working with Eve had made an
emergency call to Claude Sabbah, the store owner and designer,
whose sexy camouflage suit is worn by Eve in her latest video,
``Love Is Blind.'' The rapper wanted a new ensemble for the closing
number of a six-week tour she was about to begin. Sabbah had only a
day and a half to create a show-stopping look.
</P>
<P>
   The short notice might throw another designer into a tizzy, but
Sabbah, 47, quickly pulled out his fabric shears. As a creator of
custom clothes in his NoLIta studio, a former welding shop
identified by a graffiti sign, he is a favorite with underground
fashion editors, ghetto-fabulous rappers and art-world style icons
wanting to preen.
</P>
<P>
   A few trendsetters who appear in the party pages, like Ahn Duong
and Anne McNally, have also been spotted in his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Da House of Sabbah opened only in November, Sabbah, who
was born in Morocco and has worked as a stylist, D.J. and designer
for a French department store, has gained a following in New York
through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   While he calls himself a couturier, his clothes, at $500 to
$2,000, cost a fraction of the real couture. Customers pick out
clothing samples hanging on racks that Sabbah fabricates on a
made-to-order basis. In contrast to the luxe fabrics and ``Belle de
Jour'' styles that prevailed on the New York runways last month,
Sabbah's designs are urban, ethnic and theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   He is inspired by hip-hop, Middle Eastern caftans and clerical
robes, as well as military and martial arts uniforms, with a little
disco cheesiness thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a camouflage jacket lined in red velvet, and I get
stopped in the street by hip-hop kids who love it and the elitist,
socially acceptable New York crowd who react to it in the same
way,'' said Carmen Zita, a freelance art curator.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Force, an art consultant, who wore a camel-colored
cashmere sheath dress with a hood by Sabbah for New Year's Eve,
said that the designer's penchant for camouflage fabric recalls
Andy Warhol's paintings in the same pattern. ``Sabbah takes these
materials seen in a different context, like tacky gold lame and
Desert Storm fatigues, and transforms them,'' Force said. ``Just
when you thought camouflage got to be so trendy, Sabbah brought
another life to it by layering it with fish-net or creating a big
Chanel flower out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes are really avant-garde,'' said Claude Grunitzky,
editor of Trace, an urban style magazine that featured Lauryn Hill
on the January 1999 cover in a Sabbah dress. ``There's an element
of flash in his clothes, and the hip-hop community is really into
being loud and flashy. People find them spiritual, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming the do-rag _ or head scarf that African-American men
have long worn _ as a signature accessory, Sabbah has turned this
particular street look into high fashion. Eve, who wears a lace
do-rag with a train created by the designer in her recent video,
said she was the first female rapper to sport the look. It makes
her feel ``tomboyish,'' she said, adding that women now wear
do-rags to her concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main piece for men and women is the do-rag,'' Sabbah said.
``It's all about black elegance. When I arrived in New York from
Paris and saw the messenger boys wearing do-rags, it reminded me of
Rudolph Valentino, the Son of the Sheik. It struck me that wearing
the do-rag, you could be princes and princesses in the street.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sabbah affects an outlandish look, typically dressing in
oversize pants, gold medallions and knuckle rings. With a
gold-capped tooth and brown eyes rimmed with dark blue pencil, he
makes Puffy Combs look understated.
</P>
<P>
   In his steel-floored studio , amid burning candles and
camouflage pillows strewn around harem-style, he plays the role of
designer-artiste, pontificating about everything from palmistry to
style. ``In ancient Greece, the word `stylos' means pen,'' he said
as his assistant, a seamstress and a young intern listened raptly.
``A nose has style. A mouth has style. An eyebrow has style. You
understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbah, who was born in Casablanca and whose father was a
butcher, personifies multiculturalism. He is Jewish but was raised
by a Muslim nanny. In 1965, the family immigrated to the south of
France, and by his early 20s, Sabbah was living in Paris. Without
any formal training, he briefly worked at the couture house of
Jacques Esterel, a futuristic designer prominent in the late '60s
and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, Sabbah went to London, working as a fashion
stylist, DJ and singer. By 1990, he had returned to Paris and
within a couple of years was collaborating with the designer Gilles
Rosier (now the creative director for Kenzo), who started the label
GR 816, a hip clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also designed for Tati, a French discount department
store. During that time, Sabbah traveled to India to create
clothing for a sari company.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sabbah said, he arrived in New York with only
$100 to spare for fabric. He bought a bolt of camouflage, one of
the cheapest materials available, on Canal Street. He had a few
high-profile friends, like Duong, whom he knew from her days
modeling in Paris, and he began to outfit them.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was on a tight budget, he made things to order,
rather than mass-producing them. Little by little, he saved enough
to open his store, and in February 1999 he held his first fashion
show at the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club on
Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw his work last year, and his whole sensibility mixes a
real urban thing with Bedouin,'' said Kim Hastreiter, a co-editor
and co-publisher of Paper magazine, which features Sabbah's designs
in its March issue. ``But it's smart and sophisticated. It has a
`streety' twist, but he knows how to make couture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbah was one of 16 low-profile designers Hastreiter chose to
show together in the tents of Bryant Park over two days during the
recent Fashion Week. The audience at his show lacked a Manolo
Blahnik-shod front row, but it was filled with camcorder-toting
downtown types and fashion students.
</P>
<P>
   At Da House of Sabbah, Eve parted a red velvet curtain and
emerged from the dressing room. The train of her fish-net gown
swept her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing the excess fabric at her midriff, Sabbah insisted that
the dress be skintight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot,'' Eve told her stylist, Kithe Brewster. ``Don't we
have any awards coming up?'' Brewster mulled the question. The
rapper cocked her head, admired her image in the mirror and
pirouetted to study the back of the dress, which she decided to
buy. ``This is for walking down the red carpet,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I love cold and snowy winters. Still, my mouth waters and my
hands itch to pluck ripe citrus from a home-grown tree in winter.
It can be done, as attested to by all the potted calamondin orange
trees now basking in sunny windows. But as pretty as calamondin
trees are, their fruit is barely edible, if that. I'd rather have a
plant that also bears edible fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Oranges and grapefruit are possibilities, but I think a
4-foot-high citrus tree festooned with a few large, colorful fruit
lacks grace. Lemons and limes are better proportioned to an indoor
plant and have the advantage that a single fruit of either goes far
in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus that offers the most mileage as a potted plant is
kumquat. (Kumquat actually is a close relative of citrus, moved
from that genus in 1915 to the closely related genus Fortunella.)
</P>
<P>
   Like other citrus, kumquat is a pretty sight all year round,
with glossy, evergreen leaves that provide a perfect backdrop for
the waxy white, sweet-smelling flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit is what makes kumquat stand out from the citrus crowd.
You can eat only the pulp of oranges and grapefruit, and for the
most part, use only the juice of a lemon or a lime. Kumquats can be
eaten skin and all. The skin has a sweet, spicy flavor that mixes
well with that of the pulp, which, depending on variety, varies
from sweet to tart. The orange fruit are about the size of a
quarter, perfectly proportioned to a potted plant, and can be
popped whole into your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few wrinkles, the kumquat should be grown like any
other house plant. Fruiting takes energy, which comes from
sunlight, so my kumquat trees spend summers outdoors in almost full
sun and winters at a south-facing window. A cool room is best in
winter, with cool temperatures compensating to some degree for
reduced light. I pot them in the same mix I use for other potted
plants, consisting of equal parts compost, garden soil, perlite and
peat moss.
</P>
<P>
   Although this mix offers nutrients, I supplement them with more
or less regular applications of some soluble fertilizer, except in
midwinter, when the plant is resting.
</P>
<P>
   Kumquat is among the hardiest citrus _ it can take temperatures
to 15 degrees Fahrenheit _ and part of that hardiness is because of
the long winter's rest into which it settles.
</P>
<P>
   Color change of the ripening fruit is my plants' only sign of
life right now. But the fruit are almost too pretty to eat.
Fortunately, ripe kumquats hang in good condition on the plant for
many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The kumquat sold in stores is the oval-fruited Nagami, whose
thick skin encloses a tart pulp. Besides Nagami, I grow the variety
Meiwa, which has fruit larger than the Nagami and round, with a
thin skin enclosing a sweet-tart pulp. Less well known are Marumi
and Changshou (Fukushu in Japan), both with round fruit and
sweetish pulp.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus breeders have incorporated the cold-hardy genes of the
kumquat into a number of hybrids whose names are fun to speak.
Limequats are hardy lime substitutes, and they include such
varieties as Eustis and Tavares. Orangequats are larger and sweeter
than kumquats, and quite cold hardy. Hardiest of all are
citrangequats, hybrids of kumquat and citrange. The citrange is
itself a hybrid of orange and poncirus, an inedible citrus relative
that grows as far north as New York City. But they have those large
fruit, and I want to be able to eat the whole fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as soon as I harvest the last of my Meiwa and Nagami
kumquats, I prepare the plants for next year's crop. Because both
plants are as large as I want them to be, I root-prune them to make
way for fresh soil so that they can go right back into their
present 10-inch-diameter pots. To do this, I slide each plant out
of its pot and then, with a knife, slice an inch of roots and soil
from the sides and bottom of the root ball. Teasing the remaining
outermost roots with a fork or stick encourages them to grow into
new potting soil. After setting the root ball in the pot on a new
bed of soil, I pack the new soil into the space between the root
ball and the edge of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   After root pruning, the stems need pruning to encourage fresh
growth, avoid congestion, and keep the plants a manageable size. My
technique is the same for my Meiwa, with a trunk like a small tree,
as for my Nagami, which looks more like a bush. My first cuts
remove some stems right to their origin. Next, I shorten remaining
stems wherever increased branching is needed. Finally, I remove
twiggy or crowded stems. As I prune, I step back and look at the
plant with an artist's eye, clipping stems here and there to put
them visually in balance with each other and with the size of the
pot.
</P>
<P>
   You could start a kumquat tree from the seeds of a store-bought
fruit. Unlike most fruit, whose seed-grown progeny can be very
different from the parent tree (for the same reason that human
children differ from their parents), citrus seedlings commonly are
identical to their parents. Still, a seed-grown kumquat could take
10 years to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest thing is to get kumquats from nurseries, which
propagate them by grafting onto kumquat or poncirus seedlings.
Grafted plants usually cost $20 to $40 and will bear within a year
or two.
</P>

A NIGHT OUT WITH HOLLY WOODLAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 5) (dw) 
 By LINDA LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Born Harold Danhakl, 1946. Transformed into Holly
Woodlawn in 1969, when Andy Warhol asked for a last name. ``We were
watching this episode of `I Love Lucy,''' she said, ``and behind
her was this sign on the No. 4 train, `Woodlawn,' and we said:
`That's it. Holly ... Wood. Holly Woodlawn.''
</P>
<P>
   She became the scene-stealing transvestite in Paul Morrissey's
``Trash.'' Now, the movie, and Holly, are being rolled out for a
30th-anniversary appearance. (``Trash'' opens March 17 at the Quad
Cinema, and in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   Women of the '60s who complained that Holly looked better than
they did, lease note: She still does. Or at least like the most
glamorous size 10 at the PTA.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, in from her home in West Hollywood, Calif.,
she had visited her plastic surgeon for a consultation. ``I had my
eyes done _ now we need a little work here,'' she said, gesturing
to some poochiness around the jawline.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday found her at Bloomingdale's, all man, in a camel's hair
jacket, khakis, yellow sweater and fedora fo an early lunch at Le
Train Bleu with Karin Lefler, in from San Francisco, who runs the
Web site hollywoodlawn.com. ``She's very preppy,'' Lefler said.
``You could take her to Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly said: ``I'd be very good in J. Crew. It's timeless,
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night found her wearing a bugle-beaded red cocktail
dress under a mink coat to the drag club Lips on Bank Street in the
Village. At her table were Lefler and Steve Bocks, a clothing
designer, who met Holly 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There was Georges Piette, a construction consultant from
Brooklyn and her host in New York. They met 20 years ago, when ``we
were young and flawless,'' Holly said.
</P>
<P>
   One subject at the table was sex. ``I have a boyfriend who's
married with two children,'' Holly said, as a very large version of
Diana Ross came by to ask for an autograph. ``I see him once a
week. You have a life, he has a life. It works.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoking. (She gave it up a month ago.) ``My plastic surgeon
said: `Quit smoking. It ages you, and you don't heal well.' And you
know, my lips were beginning to get those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad nods around the table.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs. ``Everyone I know is in AA, making up for those years of
drugs,'' Holly said, sipping cranberry juice. ``My drug-taking
period was in my 20s. By the time Ecstacy came out, it was already
too late for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery. ``New York plastic surgeons are a lot better
than the ones out West. I mean, my God, did you see Melanie
Griffith? She has fish lips. Here there is more restraint, and less
collagen.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger drag generation. ``It only takes me an hour to do
the whole thing. What's with these young girls who are so gorgeous
and it takes them three hours? What are they doing in there?''
</P>
<P>
   And sex again. ``When I was in my 20s, I never thought I'd be
this old and having sex. But it's better, when I get it. It's
quality, not quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nearing midnight, and the last Cher had taken the stage.
With the first advance screening the next night, sleep had its
allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're civilized these days,'' Holly said. ``I have to start
doing yoga now.''
</P>
<P>
   Off they went, looking for a train named Woodlawn.

&HT;     TRAIL OF DISAPPOINTMENT LEADS TO THE RIO GRANDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 5)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESIDIO, Texas _ For nearly a century, the South Orient
railroad has carried the promise of trade between the United States
and Mexico, and has delivered decades of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Now Texas officials say they are in a race against time to save
the little-known railroad that crosses the Rio Grande on a wooden
trestle. While the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has
turned the six other rail lines that connect the two countries into
busy routes, this line has grown weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that some time in the future, we will be
very, very sorry that we lost that line if we let it go,'' said
David Laney, the state transportation commissioner. ``There is no
question that the volume of NAFTA traffic is growing very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the operators sought to abandon the line, citing
mounting financial losses. The federal Surface Transportation Board
denied their petition, but kept the door open to reconsider the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Now a final effort to resuscitate the railroad that runs as far
as San Angelo, Texas, is under way, aided by $6 million in the last
state budget to sweeten the deal for a prospective buyer.
</P>
<P>
   GrupoMexico, the majority owner of Ferrocarril Mexicano, or
FerroMex, the newly privatized Mexican company that owns the tracks
connected to Presidio, is negotiating to buy the railroad, Laney
said. The announcement of a deal is ``imminent,'' according to
various people familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to FerroMex officials in Mexico City were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   If this latest deal sours, officials said, the federal
government might have no option but to let the rail line be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is ever pulled up and scrapped, you can't ever build it
again,'' said state Rep. Rob Junell, a Democrat from San Angelo who
is the railroad's staunchest ally in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only seven crossings in the whole of the U.S. into
Mexico by rail,'' Junell said. ``Preserving every entry and every
mile of rail that has strategic value is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this isolated West Texas border town, population
3,500, would like to hear the rattle of the railroad again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish anybody would take it over. Don't abandon it. Don't
close it,'' said Adam Covos, who lost his railroad job when the
South Orient stopped running trains in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He now drives the town's only garbage truck.
</P>
<P>
   The South Orient was created in 1900 by Arthur Stilwell, a
visionary who had dreams of international commerce a century before
Mexico, the United States and Canada became partners in NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   His goal was to connect Kansas City to the Pacific Ocean by the
shortest route _ across West Texas and through Mexico. He planned
to ship goods to Asia, a failed scheme that nonetheless left the
railroad with the ``Orient'' in its name.
</P>
<P>
   He soon ran afoul of financiers, denouncing them as the
``cannibals of Wall Street.'' The project went into receivership,
and it wasn't until 1930 that the new owners, the Santa Fe Railway,
completed the line to Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the track connected through to Chihuahua City and on
to Topolobampo, a deepwater Pacific Ocean port.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic over the line never developed, and, over the years, so
little basic track maintenance has been done that the line's
condition has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to watch the track torn up, West Texas officials
turned to the Texas Legislature. During a special session,
lawmakers appropriated $3 million to buy the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   The line was leased to the South Orient Railroad Co., a
partnership of three businessmen, two in Dallas and one in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of substantially increasing levels of trade
between the United States and Mexico, (we) saw an opportunity,''
South Orient President Joel Williams III said in a 1998 affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment for this article because of the ongoing
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His business plan was to team up with the Burlington Northern,
the only major U.S. railroad that didn't have a route into Mexico.
But soon after the purchase, the Burlington Northern merged with
the Santa Fe Railway, which already operated a bridge in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   From Dallas to the northern Mexican city of Chihuahua, the South
Orient route is 425 miles shorter than the merged Burlington
Northern Santa Fe and 175 miles shorter than Union Pacific's route,
according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But while the underdog had the shortest route, the major
railroads had all the freight traffic. The South Orient suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an unneeded piece of railroad, it's just that given
the current railroad industry organization, the megamergers, it has
been left out by itself,'' said George Werner, a railroad historian
who lives in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the promise of border trade has passed Presidio without
stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the truck industry, we are not picking up on any of
that NAFTA traffic,'' said Presidio Mayor Alcee Tavarez, a social
studies teacher at the high school. ``The maquiladora program has
not caught on along the border in this area. I don't know why; I
can't put my finger on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maquiladoras are foreign-owned companies set up in Mexico,
usually close to the U.S. border, to take advantage of more
favorable taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The South Orient tried to develop traffic, but had little
success. Few shippers in Presidio or Brewster counties need the
railroad, although the development of large deposits of humate, a
fertilizer, has stirred interest in rail traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term survival of the rail line, almost everyone
involved agreed, depends on international trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for NAFTA and it weren't for the potential
tremendous explosion of traffic, I don't know that anyone would be
talking about it,'' said Jerry Martin, head of the rail division at
the Texas Railroad Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The South Orient discovered that potential trade is not a good
alternative for paying customers. Other possible suitors agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were approached three different times about our interest in
operating that line, and we turned it down on three occasions,''
said Bruce Flohr, founder and former chairman of RailTex Inc., a
San Antonio-based company that was sold to RailAmerica Inc. last
year. ``There is just no business on it.''

   The trains stopped on June 23, 1998, when a fire damaged a
bridge about 30 miles north of the border near the ghost town of
Casa Piedra. The bridge was repaired, but in October 1998, the
federal government approved a request to discontinue service.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, trains have become a rare sight along the desolate
track.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a buyer willing to invest in upgrading the track can be
found, the future looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the order to discontinue train service, in
what Mayor Tavarez said was cruel timing, the state transportation
department finally complied with a long-standing request to install
crossing gates where the tracks cross Highway 170 near the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to see coming through here now?'' he said
with a laugh.

THE SMASHING PUMPKINS LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The supposedly difficult Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins
is reminded of an interview he did with this newspaper two years
ago. ``Was I contentious that day?'' he asks. No, comes the reply.
``You got me on a good day, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan is having more good days lately.
</P>
<P>
   He is steering the Pumpkins into a new, more optimistic era with
the release of ``MACHINA: the Machines of God,'' which comes out
Tuesday. It also restores the hard-driving, rocking side of the
band, versus the indulgent, downtempo style of the last CD,
``Adore,'' which raised questions of whether the band might be
headed toward a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The new songs address love, survival, and humanity with far more
hope than the days when Corgan sang his generational rant:
``Despite all my rage, I'm still just a rat in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   The cage has opened - and some bright light is pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to project a more positive energy,'' Corgan says on a
cell phone from Chicago, where the band began. ``What's funny is
that when we were inherently more of a narcissistic, negative kind
of band, back when we were just trying to basically blow people's
minds, we got a lot of negative energy back. And now that we've
turned the corner, I think it's generating a lot of
</P>
<P>
   positivity. You reap what you sow.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan can still be cantankerous (``I'm a terrorist, but instead
of using bombs, I use ideas''), yet he's definitely turned the
corner with new tracks like ``This Time'' (``Only love can win''),
``Raindrops and Sunshine'' (``I'm just
</P>
<P>
   trying to walk with you between the raindrops''), and the
spiritual ``With Every Light'' (``Look ma, the sun is shining on me
. . . In every light that's shining down on me/ I'm never alone'').
</P>
<P>
   Corgan wrote most of the songs very early in the morning (at 7
and 8 a.m.) in ``almost a dream state'' when he got out of bed.
``It's a blurring of dream and reality and metaphysical impressions
and junk culture and drugs and whatever else gets thrown in the
blender,'' he says, though he adds later: ``I don't drink and I
don't really take any drugs. I'm a pretty clean liver. I'm allergic
to about half of what's in the world anyway, so it's pretty much
just me and water. . . . When I was younger, I felt I needed to
push myself, as a lot of young people do, into some sort of
psychotic state to reach that part of myself, but I don't feel that
way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of edginess on the new CD, however, so old
fans shouldn't feel left behind. The nearly 10-minute ``Glass and
the Ghost Children'' has eerily psychedelic echoes of the Doors'
``The End,'' while ``Heavy Metal Machine'' has a dense, Nine Inch
Nails-like electronic rush, capped by the macabre line, ``If I were
dead, would my rec ords sell?''
</P>
<P>
   But the overall effect is of a damaged band trying to be whole
(drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, once kicked out for drugs, is now back
in); and of a damaged soul (Corgan) trying to find a fresh balance
in life.
</P>
<P>
   So what's with the new spirituality? Has Corgan been meditating
on any mountaintops?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, God hit me over the head with a two-by-four,'' he says
with a laugh. ``Really, I think that it's hard . . . to travel the
world, meet so many people, and go to places where people could
care less about Mariah Carey and our world of pop and rock, without
finding some sort of humility. And I don't
</P>
<P>
   mean humility in a kind of I'm-not-worthy way, but humility in a
deeper respect for life and what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't subscribe to any single religion, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this: I just believe. I don't prejudice myself
against anybody else's (religion). I just believe. I think one look
at the ocean is all you need. You don't need to find it in somebody
else's version. It's right there in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Corgan is much less self-consumed than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're younger, it's easy to think that (life) is
all about you, but as you get older, you realize it's not all about
you,'' says Corgan, now 32. ``There's a line in a song that's not
on the album but reflected the way I felt, which is: `I'm just one
of many more to come.' It's about the folk
</P>
<P>
   troubadour tradition and how I'm just another guy with a guitar
and there will be a lot after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realizing that, you respect what you have and you feel that
you can effect change in a positive way. It doesn't have to be
pretty. It doesn't have to be perfect. It can be messy. If you want
any insight into how we work, we're not afraid to be cracked or
broken, because we feel in some ways it is a truer
</P>
<P>
   reflection than something that is airbrushed and perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Corgan says, he finds it hard to be included in
any Grammy nominations with other bands, ``because you find
yourself in the same categories as airbrushed, plastic-surgeried,
pimped-up, blown-up stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead - and this is where some industry types get upset with
the Pumpkins (including Sharon Osbourne, who just quit as their
manager) - the Pumpkins ``demand to be treated like real artists.
If people don't like that, then that's OK. But rock 'n' roll is not
supposed to be safe and comfortable. Not
</P>
<P>
   everyone is supposed to like you, and if everyone does, you're
definitely doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan has taken some shots lately - notably from, of all
places, The Washington Post, whose writer said he looked like
``Uncle Fester'' and was presiding over a band with ``soap opera
histrionics.'' Says Corgan: ``I expect that from Spin magazine, but
not from The Washington Post. I was stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap-opera types started buzzing when bassist D'Arcy Wretzky
left the band after the new CD was made, claiming she wanted to go
into acting. Corgan says of Wretzky (who was just arrested for
possession of crack cocaine): ``We've decided on taking a graceful
pass on talking about why she left the band. It's a complex
situation. There's no one single factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's pleased with new bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur (formerly
of Courtney Love's band, Hole), who is now an official member. And
he's pleased that the Pumpkins are back to a four-piece unit,
rather than the bloated seven-piece that toured last time. The
Pumpkins have been doing autograph signings at various record
stores and playing occasional surprise gigs in cities they visit
(look for one in Boston later next week), which have been well
received. And though they could headline arenas again, Corgan wants
the group to play in smaller venues later this year, maybe doing
multiple gigs in each city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a street band again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for continued rumors that the Pumpkins might throw in the
towel and break up, Corgan says with another laugh, ``I've
considered throwing it in every day of my life! But, really, the
speculation around the band is just too funny. We simply live in a
rumored world. I mean, I would say of every three questions I'm
asked, one is based on rumors or Internet information, so that
seems to be the world I'm living in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we wouldn't have made this record unless we were looking
at a future,'' he says. ``Many people seem to be really excited
about the record, and excited about the prog ress the band has
made. A lot of people thought the band was a dead entity, but we're
living in a really good kind of sunny day
</P>
<P>
   right now. All that other stuff just seems to feed a monster
that's not even of our own making anymore.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be one of the most revolutionary devices in consumer
entertainment electronics history debuts today, but you'll need to
go to Japan to get it, at least until it hits American store
shelves this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sony's PlayStation 2, perhaps the most eagerly awaited game
machine ever as the successor to the 70-million-selling
PlayStation. But why should people who don't care about games care
about the PS2?
</P>
<P>
   Because it probably will affect not only the gaming business but
also consumer electronics, entertainment, the Internet and possibly
the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is definitely a terrific gaming machine, it can be a
DVD player, a CD player, even _ with additions _ an Internet
surfing appliance or a powerful, cheap computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's got Microsoft worried enough that Redmond is developing its
own game machine, still code-named the ``X Box.'' And people have
literally been overwhelming Web sites and convention centers in
Japan to get an early crack at the new machines before today's
debut.
</P>
<P>
   And in a video-gaming first, the PS2 will play the hundreds of
titles created for the original PlayStation, instantly giving its
owners access to a huge library of older games.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the machine most interesting for non-gamers are
its other talents. It uses a DVD drive for its games, and in Japan
at least, you can thus also play DVD digital movies and CD music.
</P>
<P>
   You'll use the machine's PCMCIA Type 3 card slot, like those on
most laptop computers, and USB and IEEE 1394 high-speed ports to
connect modems and hard drives, along with accessories like
keyboards, scanners, digital cameras and digital video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The price: about $360 worth of yen right now. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
THE OTHER GUYS, PART 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other big question, of course, is what it means for Sony's
direct video-gaming competitors, Sega and Nintendo. For now,
anyway, they're OK.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of titles have been released and plenty of new ones have
been announced, from numerous publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best new ones is Crazy Taxi, which was a huge arcade
hit and should be much loved on CD. You basically get to drive like
a madman through the streets of San Francisco to deliver your
passengers by any means or route necessary to their destination.
</P>
<P>
   The machine's power also has allowed the creation of some
really, and I mean (BEGIN ITALICS)really(END ITALICS), offbeat new
titles that are changing our notions of what is possible with
gaming.
</P>
<P>
   With Seaman, for instance, you use a microphone attachment to
raise and converse with what is basically a fish with a human's
face. Eco the Dolphin allows you to control a cetacean in a
beautiful undersea adventure. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
THE OTHER GUYS, PART 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo, meanwhile, isn't saying much about its own
next-generation machine, code-named Dolphin, though the Dreamcast's
debut has savaged N64 sales and the PS2 will only worsen the
situation. But thanks to $8 billion worth of Pokemon sales, few
people are complaining just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Those Poke-totals will only increase with the debut this week of
a new Nintendo 64 title, Pokemon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In a clever piece of engineering, the new ``transfer pak''
accessory (included with the game) will allow your little
Pokemaniacs to download their favorite Pokemon from their Game Boy
cartridge into the Stadium game, where those creatures can fight
against other teams of opponents. I'm predicting another big, big
winner here. &QL;

THE CONSTRUCTION GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 05, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know that ``bridge to the future'' some people talk about?
</P>
<P>
   Al MacPhail is building it.
</P>
<P>
   With about 120-odd ironworkers, crane operators, truck drivers,
and some $100 million in the massive Boston highway project known
as the Big Dig, this compact and comfortable Canadian is a
construction guy's construction guy.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his way around, under, and up the breathtakingly
elegant bridge that spans the Charles River to Cambridge, everybody
in a hard hat calls out, ``Hi, Al.''
</P>
<P>
   The first tower is up, an inverted Y from which will be strung
bundled cables of graceful curves that will be lighted at night.
The tower on the Cambridge side is going up. A year from today
you'll be able to walk across it. Two years from this July, you'll
be driving north across it.
</P>
<P>
   It will become the signature symbol of Boston, twin pyramids of
gossamer strands linking Boston with the north country via
interstate 93, like two giant sloops.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a river runs through it. Massive barges are being inched
into place, with giant girders lifted or jacked to fill in chunks
of the puzzle. One lift last year saw a 640-ton welded hunk of
steel jacked up to enter its proper place in the span. Giant slabs
of concrete decking, fabricated in Virginia and barged up here,
will form the base of the roadway, 180 panels, 20 feet by 30, and
10 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a pretty bridge,'' drawls Al. He's the kind
of guy who can talk about something made of 40,000 cubic yards of
concrete and 7,600 tons of steel as ``pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicians will get to name it. So it will carry the name
of someone else _ my preference is to call it the Tip O'Neill
Bridge, after the man who wrestled the money for it. But to anyone
who knew how it came to grace the city's skyline, this delicate
span with its spidery web, it will always be Al MacPhail's bridge.
He is the leader, the father figure, the protector; he adjudicates
disputes, fends off the bosses from afar; he enables the craftsmen
to do their jobs. Al just puts it all together.
</P>
<P>
   It is through his hands, and those of the nine engineers working
under him, that all the strands come into harmony. The million and
one decisions that are demanded by the architects, accountants,
financial folks, insurers, unions, inspectors, subcontractors,
bureaucrats of city, state, and federal mandates, all of this
brainwork has to be dispatched by MacPhail's people, or the bridge
doesn't move along.
</P>
<P>
   A computer couldn't do it, though they have computers galore. It
takes a certain personality, a certain discipline, a certain knack
for getting the most out of men and women who work hard and
sometimes live hard, who take large risks and require special
handling if you want to keep the good ones on the job.
</P>
<P>
   There've been no accidents here _ ``zero, knock on wood,'' says
MacPhail, grinning. That's the way he'd like to keep it. His job is
about 1,700 feet long, counting the approaches, and over 400 feet
tall, if you go from the 30 shafts drilled down 100 feet into
bedrock to support the darn thing, and the twin cranes, one 200
feet up and the other 160 feet, that lift and swing and drop and
nudge everything that needs shifting. One tower will be 330 feet
high, the other 295 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It will carry 10 lanes of traffic, and when the 1,458-foot-long
bridge is done, it will be the widest cable-stayed bridge on the
planet. ``I wish everyone in Boston could come up here,'' engineer
Matt Seel said Friday, atop the south tower. The north tower
straddles the subway's Orange Line, the south a giant water main.
It takes a lot of man-hours and a great deal of leadership to put
this together. And Al's the man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving his native New Brunswick, he's built bridges,
power stations, and the like all over. He built a rapid transit
tunnel in San Francisco before coming here three years ago for
Bechtel Corp., the construction behemoth. He designed and built a
giant sawmill and lumber processing factory in Alberta, soup to
nuts, taking a giant hunk of wilderness and leaving behind a
monster of a plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `Put a mill there' _ and I did. That was a lot of
fun.'' He built a hydroelectic plant in the wilds that had to take
in water that had just dropped 2,400 feet. ``That's some bunch of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   He built 23 radio towers in Morocco, and says Tangiers is about
the only place he recollects where they drive worse than in Boston.
At 64, he's got one or two more big jobs in him, he says with a
chuckle. He'll head back to the University of New Brunswick this
summer for a college reunion of the ``Alexander Athletic Club,'' a
group he descibes as ``kind of an outlaw fraternity _ a good group
_ that puts on a great lobster boil.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power stations, remote Arctic Circle air force bases,
they're all on his ``been there, done that'' list. His colleagues
rate him at the top. He's calm, collected, competent and respectful
to all. In this political season there's a lot of guff talked about
leadership. Whatever you mean by that, Al has it. He's the type of
man other men listen to, take risks for, and fall in line behind.
</P>
<P>
   No one is irreplaceable, in the end. But some people come close.
And he's one.
</P>

THE SMASHING PUMPKINS LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects typo in slug; repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The supposedly difficult Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins
is reminded of an interview he did with this newspaper two years
ago. ``Was I contentious that day?'' he asks. No, comes the reply.
``You got me on a good day, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan is having more good days lately.
</P>
<P>
   He is steering the Pumpkins into a new, more optimistic era with
the release of ``MACHINA: the Machines of God,'' which comes out
Tuesday. It also restores the hard-driving, rocking side of the
band, versus the indulgent, downtempo style of the last CD,
``Adore,'' which raised questions of whether the band might be
headed toward a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The new songs address love, survival, and humanity with far more
hope than the days when Corgan sang his generational rant:
``Despite all my rage, I'm still just a rat in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   The cage has opened - and some bright light is pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to project a more positive energy,'' Corgan says on a
cell phone from Chicago, where the band began. ``What's funny is
that when we were inherently more of a narcissistic, negative kind
of band, back when we were just trying to basically blow people's
minds, we got a lot of negative energy back. And now that we've
turned the corner, I think it's generating a lot of
</P>
<P>
   positivity. You reap what you sow.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan can still be cantankerous (``I'm a terrorist, but instead
of using bombs, I use ideas''), yet he's definitely turned the
corner with new tracks like ``This Time'' (``Only love can win''),
``Raindrops and Sunshine'' (``I'm just
</P>
<P>
   trying to walk with you between the raindrops''), and the
spiritual ``With Every Light'' (``Look ma, the sun is shining on me
. . . In every light that's shining down on me/ I'm never alone'').
</P>
<P>
   Corgan wrote most of the songs very early in the morning (at 7
and 8 a.m.) in ``almost a dream state'' when he got out of bed.
``It's a blurring of dream and reality and metaphysical impressions
and junk culture and drugs and whatever else gets thrown in the
blender,'' he says, though he adds later: ``I don't drink and I
don't really take any drugs. I'm a pretty clean liver. I'm allergic
to about half of what's in the world anyway, so it's pretty much
just me and water. . . . When I was younger, I felt I needed to
push myself, as a lot of young people do, into some sort of
psychotic state to reach that part of myself, but I don't feel that
way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of edginess on the new CD, however, so old
fans shouldn't feel left behind. The nearly 10-minute ``Glass and
the Ghost Children'' has eerily psychedelic echoes of the Doors'
``The End,'' while ``Heavy Metal Machine'' has a dense, Nine Inch
Nails-like electronic rush, capped by the macabre line, ``If I were
dead, would my rec ords sell?''
</P>
<P>
   But the overall effect is of a damaged band trying to be whole
(drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, once kicked out for drugs, is now back
in); and of a damaged soul (Corgan) trying to find a fresh balance
in life.
</P>
<P>
   So what's with the new spirituality? Has Corgan been meditating
on any mountaintops?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, God hit me over the head with a two-by-four,'' he says
with a laugh. ``Really, I think that it's hard . . . to travel the
world, meet so many people, and go to places where people could
care less about Mariah Carey and our world of pop and rock, without
finding some sort of humility. And I don't
</P>
<P>
   mean humility in a kind of I'm-not-worthy way, but humility in a
deeper respect for life and what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't subscribe to any single religion, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this: I just believe. I don't prejudice myself
against anybody else's (religion). I just believe. I think one look
at the ocean is all you need. You don't need to find it in somebody
else's version. It's right there in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Corgan is much less self-consumed than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're younger, it's easy to think that (life) is
all about you, but as you get older, you realize it's not all about
you,'' says Corgan, now 32. ``There's a line in a song that's not
on the album but reflected the way I felt, which is: `I'm just one
of many more to come.' It's about the folk
</P>
<P>
   troubadour tradition and how I'm just another guy with a guitar
and there will be a lot after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realizing that, you respect what you have and you feel that
you can effect change in a positive way. It doesn't have to be
pretty. It doesn't have to be perfect. It can be messy. If you want
any insight into how we work, we're not afraid to be cracked or
broken, because we feel in some ways it is a truer
</P>
<P>
   reflection than something that is airbrushed and perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Corgan says, he finds it hard to be included in
any Grammy nominations with other bands, ``because you find
yourself in the same categories as airbrushed, plastic-surgeried,
pimped-up, blown-up stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead - and this is where some industry types get upset with
the Pumpkins (including Sharon Osbourne, who just quit as their
manager) - the Pumpkins ``demand to be treated like real artists.
If people don't like that, then that's OK. But rock 'n' roll is not
supposed to be safe and comfortable. Not
</P>
<P>
   everyone is supposed to like you, and if everyone does, you're
definitely doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan has taken some shots lately - notably from, of all
places, The Washington Post, whose writer said he looked like
``Uncle Fester'' and was presiding over a band with ``soap opera
histrionics.'' Says Corgan: ``I expect that from Spin magazine, but
not from The Washington Post. I was stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap-opera types started buzzing when bassist D'Arcy Wretzky
left the band after the new CD was made, claiming she wanted to go
into acting. Corgan says of Wretzky (who was just arrested for
possession of crack cocaine): ``We've decided on taking a graceful
pass on talking about why she left the band. It's a complex
situation. There's no one single factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's pleased with new bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur (formerly
of Courtney Love's band, Hole), who is now an official member. And
he's pleased that the Pumpkins are back to a four-piece unit,
rather than the bloated seven-piece that toured last time. The
Pumpkins have been doing autograph signings at various record
stores and playing occasional surprise gigs in cities they visit
(look for one in Boston later next week), which have been well
received. And though they could headline arenas again, Corgan wants
the group to play in smaller venues later this year, maybe doing
multiple gigs in each city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a street band again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for continued rumors that the Pumpkins might throw in the
towel and break up, Corgan says with another laugh, ``I've
considered throwing it in every day of my life! But, really, the
speculation around the band is just too funny. We simply live in a
rumored world. I mean, I would say of every three questions I'm
asked, one is based on rumors or Internet information, so that
seems to be the world I'm living in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we wouldn't have made this record unless we were looking
at a future,'' he says. ``Many people seem to be really excited
about the record, and excited about the prog ress the band has
made. A lot of people thought the band was a dead entity, but we're
living in a really good kind of sunny day
</P>
<P>
   right now. All that other stuff just seems to feed a monster
that's not even of our own making anymore.''

 &HT;    GOP SENATORS CELEBRATE WIN ON EDUCATION TAX BREAKS
 &HT;    310&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans celebrated a victory over
President Clinton on Friday, saying they hope to convince him to
sign their bill creating tax breaks for parents of children in
public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   During a week-long Senate debate, Republicans fought off five
attempts by Clinton's supporters to eliminate its central
provision, which resembles legislation that Clinton vetoed in 1998
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Crafted by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., that provision would let
parents and others put up to $2,000 per child per year into
educational savings accounts that would earn tax-free interest. The
savings could be withdrawn not just for college, but also for
educational expenses at home or in a public, private or parochial
school.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the annual limit is $500 and the money can
only be used for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed this bill last night with a bipartisan majority of
61 to 37,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., at a news conference
packed with students wearing red T-shirts with pro-education
slogans. ``It's time the president quit playing politics with our
children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans and nine Democrats voted for the bill, while
most Democrats and two Republicans followed Clinton's request to
vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the welfare debate,'' Coverdell said. ``In
the end, it becomes indefensible to argue that things should stay
the way they are _ to defend the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the administration will continue to oppose the measure
when it reaches the House, said David Frank, communications
director for the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is bad education policy and bad tax policy,'' said
Frank. ``The president vetoed this approach in the past and
retained enough votes in the Senate to uphold another veto.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan congressional analysts said that letting education
savings accounts earn tax-free interest would save the average
family with a child schooled at home or in a private school $37 a
year. The average public-school family would save $4 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But many others also had a stake in the fight. Besides the
savings accounts, which would cost the treasury $2.4 billion in
revenue over 10 years, the bill contains more than $6 billion in
other tax breaks with widespread bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beneficiaries of those other provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer sellers and other businesses that donate used
computer equipment to schools or senior citizen centers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers who pay for their workers' undergraduate or graduate
studies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers who buy classrooms supplies out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Professionals who switch to teaching careers in mid-life.
</P>
<P>
   _ School districts that earn interest on unspent bond proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Families that use prepaid college tuition plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to veto this, he would be turning away from them
all,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel of the
American Council on Education, a higher education association that
took no stand on pre-college savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of their popularity, those items are likely to be
re-attached in some form to another bill later, if the president
vetoes this bill,'' Steinbach said. ``Or possibly the offensive
provision may be dropped in (a House-Senate) conference; that would
be the easiest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a quiet compromise is unlikely, said political scientist
Joseph Cooper at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican strategy is to put the president behind
the 8 ball,'' Cooper said. ``They want him to veto a bunch of bills
in the next eight months so that they can tell the voters, 'We
Republicans passed those good things and the Democrats are the guys
who killed them.' ``

<P>
   It's Oscar month, so let me suggest a new award category _
lifetime achievement in investment. My nominees for the inaugural
prize are the often-criticized strategies of momentum-based
stock-pickers.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is simple. Each of the newsletters atop the
performance rankings of The Hulbert Financial Digest for the 5, 10
and 15 years through 1999 uses a momentum-based strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum means different things to different people, but these
newsletters consider a stock to have momentum if it has
outperformed the market over the previous 6 to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Often, strategies that emerge from historical research stop
working almost the moment they are discovered. But these momentum
strategies, which have been widely known for decades and have
gained in popularity, have shown staying power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, momentum strategies look more effective than ever.
Consider OTC Insight, a a momentum-oriented newsletter edited by
James Collins, which is the top-performing letter among those
tracked by the digest over the last 10 years. Last year was its
best, with its average model portfolio _ which included stocks like
JDS Uniphase and Cisco Systems _ gaining 153 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors should be cautious about any strategy,
including momentum investing, until they receive a good explanation
of how it works. Only then can they weed out those managers or
newsletters whose records result from luck alone.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found two factors that may account for
momentum's success. I call the first the bandwagon effect. As a
stock keeps outperforming the market, more and more investors
``discover'' it and jump on board _ propelling it even further
ahead of the market and seducing still more buyers. (Eventually
that can cause the stock to become overvalued and subject to
correction, but that's another matter.)
</P>
<P>
   For stocks that have recently underperformed the market, a
reverse bandwagon is often at work as more and more investors
succumb to selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor has to do with the behavior of Wall Street
analysts. Because of certain incentives and disincentives, they
often respond sluggishly to new information.
</P>
<P>
   Say the consensus earnings estimate for a company is $1.20 a
share, but one analyst finds new information that justifies an
estimate of $2. There is little incentive for the analyst to go out
on a limb with the new estimate, because he will receive almost as
much attention for being the first to predict, say, $1.50 a share.
That way, he will be poised to garner still more attention if and
when he becomes the first to predict $1.75, and then $2. And each
higher projection helps keep the stock's momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, works in reverse. Analysts are reluctant to announce
earnings estimates that are far below the consensus for fear of
alienating the company and endangering their relationship with its
management. So their estimates usually fall gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The key question becomes this: Over what period should momentum
be measured in order to get the best results? Six months appears to
be ideal, according to a study conducted by two finance professors,
Narasimhan Jegadeesh of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and Sheridan Titman of the University of Texas at
Austin. They created a hypothetical portfolio that on Jan. 1, 1965,
bought the 10 percent of stocks with the best returns over the
previous six months. Every six months, through June 30, 1998, they
reconstituted the portfolio so it held the 10 percent of stocks
with the best returns over the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 34 years through 1998, the portfolio gained 21.7
percent, annualized. That is 16.5 percentage points better than one
that held the 10 percent of stocks with the worst returns over the
previous six months and 7.8 points better than the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an Oscar-winning performance.

`DETECTIVE FICTION': FORENSIC SCIENCE FROM POE TO CHANDLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of essay.) 
(DW) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The accumulated evidence is shocking: a severed thumb, a
pornographic photograph, a poison-dart, a tell-tale heart. The
villainy is exotic: a pigmy warrior, a crazed orangutan, a vengeful
Mormon, a Levantine art collector. Contemplating this melange of
the forbidden, the horrifying and the foreign, is the detective:
neurasthenic or cynical or corpulent _ a stranger in a strange
land. What sort of a weird fictional universe is this, constructed
with such peculiar ingredients?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the knotty history of the detective story _
beginning with Edgar Allan Poe's ``Murders in the Rue Morgue''
(1842) _ must be buried clues to more than just our notions of
crime and punishment. Why the eccentric detective? The elaborate
masquerade of the criminal? The ornate trappings? The racial
allusions that stain the genre? Trollope thought detective stories
had plots that were too complex and characters that were too
simple. But that just makes their power more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years many literary investigators have been on the
case. The detective story has become a touchstone for academic
criticism, raising issues that have become cultural obsessions.
There have been examinations of the detective as skilled reader of
cryptic texts and of the detective novel as a bourgeois morality
tale. Walter Benjamin has turned up as a witness: the German critic
alluded to detective stories when describing the mysterious traces
left by bodies moving through 19th century urban crowds. So has the
French philosopher Michel Foucault: his detective would be an
unknowing agent of the state's bureaucratic power, banishing the
foreign and the eccentric, branding them crazy or criminal, and
imposing an unyielding order.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to ignore such testimony even if, by now, it
does seem to round up the usual suspects. The detective story
really is partly a tale about race and nationality, imperialism and
bourgeois life: Sherlock Holmes' villains are from the far corners
of the British Empire (including the barely civilized United
States); Poe's villain in ``Rue Morgue'' is not even human. So
preoccupations with these political themes also run through this
dense, smart book as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald R. Thomas, professor of English at Trinity College in
Hartford, also steps back from the crime scene, following tracks
left by Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Dashiell Hammett and
Raymond Chandler, Joseph Conrad and Mark Twain, scrutinizing how
the development of forensic science was intertwined with the
evolution of the detective story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' appeared during the 1890s,
for example, when the lie detector was first invented and a
systematic examination of fingerprints was published. In ``The
Hound of the Baskervilles'' a character praises Holmes as a master
comparable to Alfonse Bertillon, who first used the art of
photography to catalog criminals using mug shots. One early French
forensic scientist urged his students to read ``A Study in
Scarlet'' to see how brilliantly Holmes could deduce facts from
slight physical traces.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suggests that in the 19th century, the detective
anticipated and reflected three major forensic tools: the lie
detector, the deciphering of fingerprints and the camera. The
detective too is a nearly inhuman machine able to separate truth
from falsehood. He too reconstructs the criminal body from knowing
its most subtle whorls. He too possesses an all-seeing eye with
nearly photographic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Photography may even have been detective fiction's most avid
collaborator. The arts were born simultaneously. Poe wrote about
photography in the same magazine that published ``Rue Morgue.''
Doyle, who became an ophthalmologist and first wrote about his
famous ``private eye'' while waiting for patients, later sold his
medical equipment to take up photography.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the camera had become a forensic tool that not only
captured the criminal's image but was also used to catalog it.
Photographs were studied in an attempt to discover physiological
characteristics of the criminal's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' wrote one forensic pioneer, ``born criminals
have projecting ears, thick hair, a thin beard, projecting front
eminences, enormous jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph as a form of unquestioned truth also played an
important role within detective stories. In Dickens' ``Bleak
House,'' a photograph and an oil painting are used to solve a
mystery. In Hawthorne's ``House of the Seven Gables'' a
daguerreotype used for a political campaign also displays the
villain.
</P>
<P>
   In the very first Holmes story, ``A Scandal in Bohemia,'' a
photograph is used for blackmail; another photograph becomes
Holmes' reward. One of Philip Marlowe's famous cases also begins
with a search for a photograph. But by the 1930s, when Chandler was
writing, the photograph was not an unambiguous source of truth but
just another sign of a corrupt world in which ``everyone is a
suspect and no one can be conclusively identified or fully
trusted'' .
</P>
<P>
   A literary detective of limited powers might simply gather these
kinds of clues and consider his case complete. There are times when
Thomas seems tempted, settling into academic discussions of
``textuality.'' Professional eccentricities _ like Holmes' cocaine
addiction _ come with the territory, and Thomas' meticulous
readings are otherwise compelling and sometimes brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The word forensics and the word forum have similar origins: both
imply a gathering in which something is proved. This is the primal
scene of the detective story as well. Though the case is still
incomplete (what about, for example, detectives currently at
large?) there is more than enough here to think about. Yes, the
detective story is about politics and race and identity, but it is
also about how we come to know, how we come to prove what we know
and what difference it might all make.

64 YEARS IN THE MAKING, THE MORGAN IS REMADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: 2nd take consists of optional sidebar)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD FEAST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The venerable Morgan Motor Co. did something here this
week it hadn't done in a long time: It introduced an all-new car,
its first since Edward VIII abdicated the British throne to marry
Wallis Simpson, the divorced woman he loved.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan pulled a white sheet off its new model, the Aero 8,
at the 70th Salon Internationale de l'Automobile here on Tuesday,
Feb. 29, it was a very big deal for a very small company. In an age
when automakers churn out all-new models every four years or so,
Morgan is still selling a car that made its debut in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   True, the classic Morgan has been modernized over the decades to
comply with safety and emissions regulations and its customers'
changing expectations, but the car's fundamentals remain the same:
a stout steel chassis and a wooden frame made of English ash
overlaid with sheet aluminum. The ``live'' rear axle uses leaf
springs, like a horse-drawn cart. The front suspension, a primitive
design called a sliding pillar system, dates to Morgan's first car,
a three-wheeler from 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, until now, has the styling changed much since the
Depression. Current Morgans, with their exposed, cycle-style
fenders, louvered hoods and running boards, look like refugees from
a long-gone era.
</P>
<P>
   The existing cars use four-cylinder engines from Ford and Rover
and a V-8 that is also used in the Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 8 accelerates Morgan into the 21st century _ if not in
its design, which is sleeker but still anachronistic, but certainly
in its mechanical components. While the car retains many styling
themes from the current models, plus their ash frame and aluminum
bodywork, it is otherwise thoroughly modern. It has a bonded and
riveted aluminum monocoque chassis, which is stiff, strong and
light; an all-independent wishbone suspension; and a 286-horsepower
version of BMW's 4.4-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   All that power in a body that weighs just 2,200 pounds will make
the Aero 8 ``demonically quick,'' said Charles Morgan, the
company's joint managing director and a grandson of its founder.
The top speed is said to be 160 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exceptional performance, Morgan promises that the
car will have excellent handling, braking and ride. It gains a
trunk _ something no current Morgan has _ large enough for two sets
of golf clubs. Diehard enthusiasts may shudder, but the Aero 8 _
its code name during development was P8000 _ will even have
electric windows and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   These are sudden and radical changes for an eccentric company
that has evolved at a glacial pace. Still, the Aero 8 is not simply
a show car designed to gauge public reaction. It will go into
production in July and sell in Europe for $81,500. That is a 55
percent premium over the basic version of the Plus 8, currently the
company's top model.
</P>
<P>
   The new car is destined for sale in the United States in the
fall of 2001. ``We have two agents there, and will be looking to
expand that by the time the new car is ready,'' said Matthew
Parkin, Morgan's sales and marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's determination to press on with production of an all-new
car reflects a quiet confidence within the company. Its products
may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it knows intuitively what its
customers want. It does not rely on design studies, clinics or
focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's success over the years is proof of that. The company
began making three-wheel cars in 1910. The Runabouts, as they were
called, proved so popular that Morgan opened a second plant in 1919
_ the red brick, single-story factory near Malvern, England, where
Morgans are still produced.
</P>
<P>
   The inexpensive cars were British best-sellers until cheap
four-wheeled family sedans arrived in the early 1930s from Austin,
Ford and Morris. That prompted Morgan to cut back on three-wheelers
_ though they continued to be made until 1951 _ and shift to
four-wheeled roadsters, starting with the 4/4 model of 1936. The
lineage of today's cars, which will be sold alongside the new Aero
8, can be clearly traced to the 4/4.
</P>
<P>
   That four-seat car became a cult classic, along with derivatives
known as the Plus 4, a two-seater, and the Plus 8, a two-seater
with the Rover V-8 engine. There were always more than enough
sports car enthusiasts to keep Morgan in business. Indeed, even
after all these years, demand remains so strong _ and Morgan so
small _ that it gives customers estimated delivery dates four years
into the future. While that represents an improvement, the
company's aim is to guarantee delivery within two years.
</P>
<P>
   That will be done through greater efficiency. The way the cars
are hand-crafted has changed little over the years, but significant
gains in quality and cost control were made after Morgan brought in
management consultants. Under the guidance of Strategem, a
consulting firm that specializes in the auto industry, Morgan
reorganized production and cut parts inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying aim was to get the waiting list under
control,'' said Dave Wright, the director of Strategem assigned to
Morgan. ``The only way to do that was to take fewer orders or make
more cars.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a hard decision to make. Production rose 10 percent _
albeit from just 10 cars a week to 11.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how many specialized automakers have lost their
independence in recent years _ the list includes Aston Martin,
Jaguar, Lamborghini, Lotus, Maserati, Rolls-Royce, Saab and Volvo,
among others _ Morgan's business formula is worth closer scrutiny.
Morgan made more cars last year (526) than at any time since it
gave up three-wheelers. What's more, none were sold at a discount,
and all were paid for in full before they left the factory. Indeed,
Morgan financed the Aero 8's development without the need for
loans, venture capital or financial partners.
</P>
<P>
   How many enterprises _ whether they make airliners or dustbins _
have performed so consistently for so long? Although its economies
of scale are minuscule, simply turning out 11 cars a week
guarantees money in the bank for Morgan.

   &UR; THE CARS SELDOM CHANGE; NEITHER DO THE BOSSES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RICHARD FEAST &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the longevity of its automobiles' design, Morgan
Motor Co. has another distinction: No other carmaker is still
wholly owned by the family that started it. Even today, 91 years
after the company was founded to make three-wheeled cars,
management is in the hands of only the third generation of Morgans.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started by H.F.S. Morgan, who, like Walter P.
Chrysler, trained to be a railway engineer but became an early
motoring enthusiast. He died in 1959, having run the company for
half a century. Peter, his son, became managing director in 1957
and chairman two years later. Now 80, Peter still goes to work each
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's day-to-day business is now handled by a
member of the third generation, Charles Morgan, who has the title
of joint managing director, a position he shares with Peter, his
father. Charles, 48, joined the company in 1985 after earning a
reputation as a filmmaker and news cameraman for the British
network ITN. Although he has memories of maneuvering to avoid
Soviet helicopter gunships while on assignment in Afghanistan, he
now works in peaceable surroundings amid the gentle hammering and
sawing of Morgan's factory in the shadow of England's Malvern
Hills, some 100 miles northwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   What does Charles see in Morgan's crystal ball, a decade or so
into the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still be coach-building cars,'' he said in a recent
interview on a cold but sunny day outside the Malvern factory. ``I
still see a lot of mileage in it. New technology fits well with the
way we do things.''
</P>
<P>
   And he predicts growth. ``Volumes you can see going up
relatively substantially, though we've see seen the lessons of
Porsche and Ferrari, which have on occasion overstretched
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, we will still be independent _ albeit with one
major partner.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to BMW, which will supply drivetrains for
the new Aero 8. The fact that BMW, a company with a sterling
engineering reputation, would even agree to supply a tiny British
sports car manufacturer is, in itself, a considerable endorsement
of Morgan and its prospects. &QL;

a surprising one in Europe, where countries have long resisted

absurd changes to the language. In Britain, for example, letter

   MEXICO-POLLUTION MEXICO CITY _ Mexican environmental officials
proudly announced in January that this crowded ? and usually
smog-filled ? had enjoyed the cleanest air in a decade in 1999.
Within a few weeks those officials were all but eating their words.
Just after they unveiled data showing that one of the world's most
polluted cities had made gains, the city was shrouded once again in
eye-stinging, throat-burning smog. Kids, who are at special risk
here, were ordered indoors in the southern end of the city. Brown
clouds hung on the horizon like frozen dust storms. Coughs and
respiratory ailments soared. From the World Trade Center, one of
the city's tallest buildings, the view was apocalyptic. A blanket
of smog rolled over the city 46 stories below, growing thicker by
the minute. Yes, the air is cleaner thanks to reforms. But problems
with industry emissions, traffic and even soil erosion are still
serious. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

obstruction the size of a basketball. The obstruction would either

   MARDIGRAS-PANTIES _ NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans cops have placed
signs up all over saying public nudity is forbidden for this year's
Mardi Gras. The crackdown on festival bawdiness seems extra-serious
this year. A suburban city has banned obscene throws, like dildos,
from its parades, but voted that panties were OK. A city councilman
worried about the appearance of that: ''So,'' he said, ``we are on
the record as pro-panties?'' (Konigsmark, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

FOUR CITY MICE WHO HAD TO SEE `CATS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 5)  
(lh) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We've got 4 tickets! Do we need more?''
</P>
<P>
   An improbable e-mail for one New Yorker to receive from another,
considering the show the tickets in question were for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Manhattan have scorned Andrew Lloyd Webber's most
famous musical for years, but how many of them have actually seen
it? The news that after 18 years, the show will close on June 24
presents a unusual problem for the jaded among us. On the one hand,
there's the impulse to ridicule or ignore the very tourist traps of
which ``Cats'' is the apogee. On the other, there's a nagging need
to have seen and done it all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the second instinct won out. So, last Sunday
afternoon, four of us found ourselves behind the big billboard eyes
of the Wintergarden Theater doing the unthinkable. I think it was
an experience none of us will soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   To give our excursion the patina of irony, we had lunch first at
Katz's Delicatessen, on Houston Street. Then we could tell people,
``We went to Katz's, then `Cats.' Get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Our seats were within hissing range of the stage, whose outsize
junkyard props _ convincingly decayed-looking after 18 years _ are
meant to convey a cat's-eye view. Around us were Japanese tourists
and the sensibly fanny-packed elderly. There was no mistaking the
scene for the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The patron of the arts
next to me spent most of the show on his nanny's lap sucking his
thumb. (Much of the audience was in the under-5 demographic.)
</P>
<P>
   The house lights dimmed. A 25-piece orchestra, offstage left,
played its first rock-operatic notes. Men and women in Halloween
makeup, skin-tight body stockings (all right, cat suits) and leg
warmer ``fur'' entered, miming feline poses. As the company burst
into the first number, ``Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats,'' one of
my party leaned over to ask, ``What's a Jellico cat?'' It would not
be the last time one of us would fail to grasp what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   I know I didn't. And I even own ``Old Possum's Book of Practical
Cats,'' the slender volume of T.S. Eliot poems published in 1940,
which supplied most of the lyrics for ``Cats.'' My copy, an old
Faber &AMP; Faber edition, came from my grandmother's library. As a
youth, I pulled it off the shelf, confused by the seeming
incongruity between its heavyweight author and nonsense verse. I
liked the way the cover said ``Nicholas Bentley Drew the
Pictures,'' but could never quite bring myself to read it.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why the dogfight in ``Cats'' between the Pekes and
Pollicles went over my head. The cats put on masks made from trash,
see, and pretend to be dogs. I thought they really were dogs, which
was embarrassing. This is, after all, a musical that owes its
cross-cultural longevity to the fact that you can understand it
without knowing English.
</P>
<P>
   Act One consists largely of introductions. The Old Gumbie Cat.
Bustopher Jones, who looked like the grotesquely fat man who
explodes in Monty Python's ``Meaning of Life.'' Mungojerrie and
Rumpleteazer, whose smug, vaudevillian slapstick was our first
walkout challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest of us had the aisle seat, trading leg room for the
constant, terrifying threat of audience participation. The
performers frequently gambol into the crowd, but the feeling is not
always mutual. In 1997, a spectator who refused to dance with Rum
Tum Tugger sued the Shubert Organization for $6 million, accusing
it of assault, battery, invasion of privacy, violation of civil
rights, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress
and false imprisonment. (The case never went to trial.) Our friend
on the aisle slouched deeper and deeper into his seat.
</P>
<P>
   The tedium of the ancient (also fat) Old Deuteronomy was matched
only by the gothic weirdness of Grizabella, the Glamour Cat. A
Norma Desmond figure, Grizabella closes Act One with the only
``Cats'' song anybody knows, ``Memory,'' which is not an Eliot poem
and sounds like an ``Evita'' leftover. It was the second walkout
challenge and, this time we accepted. We repaired to Gallagher's
bar around the corner to grapple with the phenomenon we had just
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Cats'' today, you can't quite believe that a) this
thing was ever a hot ticket among consenting adults, and b) it
didn't close on opening night. Theater people will argue that when
it opened in London in 1981, there had never been anything like it.
This could also be regarded as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rich's review in The New York Times was no rave, but he
predicted the show's trans-Atlantic success, writing, ``It's not
that this collection of anthropomorphic variety turns is a
brilliant musical or that it powerfully stirs the emotions or that
it has an idea in its head.'' No, the reason it would be a hit,
Rich explained, was that ``it believes purely in theatrical magic,
and on that faith it unquestionably delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now but no longer forever, ``Cats'' will be missed. Television
commercials for new Broadway shows will no longer be able to quote
theatergoers gushing, ``Better than `Cats!''' David Letterman, who
broadcasts from the Ed Sullivan Theater up Broadway, will be
deprived of a punchline.
</P>
<P>
   The news that ``Cats'' was closing broke on a Sunday. Ticket
sales on the following Tuesday were $285,000, up from the normal
$60,000 range, said Jonathan Schwartz, a spokesman for the show.
``And the demand for house seats is back,'' he added, indicating
that show business insiders are calling in their connections again.
The 11th hour revival of interest may give ``Cats'' another nine
(or 18) lives. Like ``The Fantasticks,'' it could go on in some
Village basement until the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   None of us enjoyed ``Cats,'' on any level. But not enjoying it
did not make me feel superior, as camp is supposed to. I e-mailed
Hugh Kenner, the Eliot scholar now professor emeritus of English at
the University of Georgia, and asked him what T.S. _ the Old Possum
himself _ would have thought of ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Eliot would have been gratified by the success of
`Cats,''' Kenner replied. ``Why not? His text's behind the costumes
and music. And it made a secure income for Valerie (his widow), to
whom he was devoted. Drop all stereotypes of Eliot the touchy
aesthete.''
</P>
<P>
   If perhaps the greatest poet of the 20th century wouldn't have
had a problem with ``Cats,'' where do we get off? Besides, a week
after leaving halfway through, I'm still reciting that dumb
Jellicle cat song. The scary thing is I'm starting to like it.

   BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AS CAMPAIGN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush went to a breast cancer research center in New
York today to emphasize his criticism of John McCain for listing
some breast cancer projects as pork-barrel spending. Bush's ads in
New York feature a breast cancer survivor calling McCain's
opposition to research funding ``shocking'' and saying America
deserves ``a candidate with a record on women's issues we can
trust.'' McCain said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending
on breast cancer research. Speaking on ``Imus in the Morning'' in
New York, McCain said he could get his message to voters despite
such ads, but, ``If they don't figure it out, we will have run an
honorable campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AS PERSONAL ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Another reason John McCain was offended by the George W. Bush
radio ad accusing him of being indifferent to breast cancer
research funding is that McCain's sister is a breast cancer
survivor in remission. McCain refused to answer questions about her
condition, but Sandy McCain Morgan was reached by phone by online
magazine Salon: ``All I can say is that I'm very grateful for my
brother's support for breast cancer research, and I'm very grateful
to Johns Hopkins Hospital,'' where her illness was treated.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY DONATIONS AIR CLEARED
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious group airing ads in the presidential race
promoting George W. Bush's environmental record is headed by Sam
Wyly, a Texas entrepreneur. Wyly and his brother Charles, have
donated thousands of dollars to Bush political campaigns. Wyly's
newly formed group, Republicans for Clean Air, is airing $2 million
in TV ads that go after John McCain on the environment and tout
Bush's record. It would be an illegal donation if the Bush campaign
were involved with planning the ads, but the Bush camp says it has
nothing to do with them. McCain said that's what's wrong with the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-ODDS BRADLEY PLUGS AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, looking to knock Bill Bradley out of the race Tuesday
night, confidently road-tested a general election fight with
Republicans today, while Bradley urged supporters to ignore the
pollsters and vote their convictions. Bradley, in Portland, Maine,
called the race ``a choice between the politics of division, of
exaggerated and unfulfilled promises, and a politics based upon
belief, conviction and straight talk,'' but never mentioned Gore by
name. With Bradley no longer seen as a serious threat, Gore already
has begun looking past his only Democratic rival, railing instead
against the two Republicans. And in Jacksonville, Fla., today, Gore
added Sen. Bob Graham to his lopsided pile of Democratic Party
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT MAY HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush suggested that if he is elected president, he
might order the Justice Department to drop its antitrust case
against Microsoft, Britain's Financial Times reported. ``I think it
is very important for our society, when there is innovation taking
place, to understand the consequences of litigation,''the paper
quoted Bush as saying during an interview in Seattle, where the
company is based. ``I am not sympathetic to lawsuits. Write that
down. I worry about the effect of lawsuits on job creation. If you
are looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to
litigate.'' The monopoly case is pending in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   BOB JONES III FIGHTING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University is using full-page newspaper ads to answer
national criticism of its interracial dating ban and other issues
that cropped up after George W. Bush made a campaign stop at the
fundamentalist Christian school last month. In the ``Letter to the
Nation,'' University President Bob Jones III says the Greenville,
S.C., schoo has been wrongly painted as racist and anti-Catholic.
The issue is religious freedom, he wrote. The ad appears in USA
Today and the three largest South Carolina papers, in Columbia,
Charleston and Greenville. Jones is to be interviewed tonight by
Larry King on CNN (9 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   JERRY FORD WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE WHOLE MESS
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing both Republican presidential candidates, former
President Gerald Ford says he would not have spoken at Bob Jones
University and wouldn't have criticized Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell. ``It would be better for candidates to stay away from any
group that is so dedicated to a single religious conviction,'' Ford
said of George W. Bush's visit to the university. Ford also called
some of John McCain's comments about Robertson and Falwell ``poor
judgment _ any candidate should not call someone evil ... I would
not use that language myself.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUR DAYS TO SUPER TUESDAY, AND MCCAIN NEEDS HELP
</P>
<P>
   Four days before Republicans vote in 13 states, there were no
signs that John McCain is closing George W. Bush's wide leads in
California, Ohio, Missouri and Georgia polls. New York is
competitive and most of New England is leaning McCain's way, but
some advisers warned privately that McCain's 's candidacy was in
jeopardy unless he could generate fresh support this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   DESTROY THE VILLAGE TO SAVE IT
</P>
<P>
   John McCain said today the Republican Party is headed for
another defeat, and that's what sparked him to challenge the party
establishment's ties to some conservative religious leaders and
campaign donors. ``If you want business as usual, the Republican
Party has lost the last two presidential elections, the last two
congressional elections, and we're headed down the same path,''
McCain said. ``I had to take on the Republican establishment and
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MESSAGE, REMEMBER THE MESSAGE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is railing against George W. Bush's campaign tactics
and the evangelical leaders who ``unfairly attacked'' one of his
advisers. Suddenly an aide jumps up from a hotel sofa, leans over a
tray of coffee cups and slips him a note. ``Social Security,'' is
scrawled on the paper, a reminder that _ once again _ the boss is
off message. Getting the hint, McCain abruptly changes the subject
in an interview with a group of newspaper editors and launches into
his plans to bolster Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY'S WIFE COMES OFF THE BENCH
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of spousal and female unity, Bill Bradley's wife,
Ernestine, made plans to tour upstate New York with the wives of
New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Los Angeles Lakers
basketball coach Phil Jackson: Elizabeth Moynihan and June Jackson.
They're slated to go to Rochester, Buffalo and Albany.
</P>
<P>
   FUND-RAISER IN THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, the oldest daughter of Al Gore, raised
$40,000 for her father's presidential campaign at Cities, a
Washington restaurant, packing in 150 young professional Gen-Xers
like herself. Gore Schiff, 26, said her generation tried to
``cultivate an ironic detachment'' but she urged her listeners to
overcome their cynicism and support her father.
</P>
<P>
   SOUND OF A DIFFERENT DRUMMER
</P>
<P>
   Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat. That's the sound of a new addition to
John McCain's campaign rallies. Backers who applauded during one of
his speeches Thursday were joined by the pounding sound of a drum.
``Now we have an Al Gore drum,'' McCain chuckled. The reference was
to one of his stock phrases _ that he'll ``beat Al Gore like a
drum.''

   (italics)Great dramas and grand operas build to memorable
farewells and resonant exit lines. When the time comes to leave
one's place of employment, not everyone is capable of the beau
geste or the bon mot. Some people dream afterward of what they
should have, could have, said. Others go off with comments and
gestures that linger in legend and memory.(end italics) &QL;

   ``Some years ago, a management shuffle having cost me my
editor's job at a major publisher, I felt most fortunate to be
hired almost immediately by a small trade magazine firm as managing
editor of its top publication,'' writes Theodore Lustig, now
retired and living in Morgantown, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Wednesday of my third week on the job, I was called
into the editorial director's office and asked to sign an agreement
that said I understood my position was not permanent; rather, at
management's direction, I could be transferred to any other
editorial position they designated. (I found out later the job I
held was a lure that got them editors for their less prestigious
magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the agreement stated that the company could fire me at
the end of any workweek if I were given notice before noon on
Friday. When I suggested this latter stipulation was unfair, I was
told I also had the right to quit any Friday if I gave notice
before noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, during my lunch hour, I went to a recruiter who
sent me on an interview at a trade association in desperate need of
an editor for its monthly magazine, their current editor having
walked off the job without notice. We agreed on terms, and I told
them, to their delighted surprise, that I would be on the job the
following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11:30 Friday morning, I walked into the director's office
and had him reiterate the terms of the agreement. I then signed it
and had him countersign my copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With it in hand, I asked him what time it was. He said, `It's
20 minutes to 12.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Waving the agreement as I walked out the door, I said, `I
quit.''' &QL;

   After 19 years at a large service corporation, 17 of them as a
vice president, Lawrence B. Kilfoy, now of Weston, Conn., said he
finally realized that, at 61, he was too old for further promotion.
After all, he hadn't received a salary review for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Kilfoy let competitors know he was available. Within a week, he
had a new position at a substantial increase in salary and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I resigned, I felt like I had spent 19 years working 60
hours a week in a no-win rat race,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my last day, I noticed a pet shop in the hall below our
offices. In the window was a display of hundreds of mice running
around in a large cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilfoy looked at the mice with their white tails and red beady
eyes and thought: ``This is the rat race I am leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``I entered the store and purchased two dozen white
mice. I returned to my office, closed the door and let them run
loose. I put on my suitcoat, picked up my briefcase and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was six years ago, and they are still trapping mice.'' &QL;

   The first time Pete Selkowe had to dismiss someone, he was a
young night city editor on a midsize daily newspaper in Westchester
County. It was an emotionally trying experience for both him and
his victim, an error-prone reporter who occasionally slept through
meetings he was supposed to cover.
</P>
<P>
   But another memorable dismissal years later took much less out
of him, says Selkowe, who lives now in Racine, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victim this time was an underperforming sales rep who
didn't show up for work on Monday,'' writes Selkowe, by then a
publisher in Carbondale, Ill.. ``Or Tuesday. By Wednesday, we were
worried about him and called his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `I wasn't making my numbers, so I fired
myself.''' &QL;

   In 1968, when Dr. Robert J. Broselow, now an obstetrician and
gynecologist in Lubbock, Texas, was a resident in psychiatry in
Philadelphia, he paid for his own psychoanalysis by working several
nights a week running a busy emergency department in a hospital in
Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night a family practitioner called about a patient with a
`compound fracture' who was en route to the E.R. He asked me to
call a certain orthopedic doctor to see this patient. I complied
but dreaded awakening this particular surgeon,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough, after the orthopedic surgeon saw the patient, he
unmercifully lambasted me for calling him at midnight about a
patient who `obviously doesn't have a compound fracture.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I replied, `If you think you can run this E.R. better than I
can, you're welcome to, because I'm leaving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I later learned that he was busy until the morning shift came
on at 7, and that thereafter there was a noticeable improvement in
his treatment of the hospital staff.'' &QL;

   ``I had been employed as a medical secretary for over 25 years
and making top dollar,'' writes Connie Guerra of Bayville, N.Y.
``My boss, a surgeon, retired, and the medical group didn't know
what to do with me, so they used me as a `float' in various
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year I received my review. I was told that I wasn't
working to my capacity and made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ```Like what?' I asked. The office manager said I once copied a
page two times. She also told me that I had to sign a paper that I
was warned, and would be reviewed again in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked her straight in the eye and said, `Sayonara.'
</P>
<P>
   ```What does that mean?' she asked.
</P>

   ```Look it up,' I said, and walked out.'' &QL;

   In 1989, Ted Kruckel was fired from the job of promotion
director of Details magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons too bizarre and long forgotten, they did, however,
offer to throw me a goodbye party,'' writes Kruckel, a Manhattanite
who now runs Ted Inc., his own public relations firm. ``The only
problem was that as the promotion director, it fell to me to
organize the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``So on my last day, at the party, as the guests thinned out to
a last paltry few, someone asked me why I wasn't packing up and
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad and pathetic answer was that I had to wait and pay the
caterer.''

AN ALGERIAN WRITER FINDS HER LOST PAST THROUGH LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``So Vast the Prison,'' the new novel by Assia
Djebar, begins inside the protected walls of a women's hammam, or
public bath, in a small Algerian city in the 1960s. The narrator's
mother-in-law, speaking Arabic, begs a friend to stay a bit longer.
The friend replies:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot possibly stay later today. The enemy is at home!''
</P>
<P>
   She left.
</P>
<P>
   ```The enemy?' I asked, slowly turning to my mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother-in-law explains that the Arabic word for enemy is
also the word local women use to refer to their husbands when
speaking among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That moment, which reveals language's multiple meanings as well
as the bitter traces of women's experience, is typical of Djebar's
work. Like other writers who have had to adopt different languages
and homes, she is something of a cultural nomad. Djebar, 63, was
born in Algeria, lives in the United States and Paris and writes in
the language of her homeland's French colonizers. It is a
magisterial French that is both a legacy of 130 years of colonial
occupation and an instrument of liberation from the constraints of
tradition and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   French plays a new role in today's Algeria, where for the last
eight years a savage civil war between Islamic militants and an
army-backed government has cost over 100,000 lives. Francophone
writers and intellectuals have been frequent targets of
assassination by both Islamic militants and shadowy
counterinsurgency forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a man who has lost his homeland, writing becomes a place
to live,'' the German philosopher Theodor Adorno observed, while
living in exile in Los Angeles during World War II. Djebar has made
the French language her domain, which she has won back slowly, over
the course of years, from the language of the colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of German Jews, writing after the Shoah,'' Djebar said
in French during a recent visit to New York. ``German is their
language, and yet they suffer in it. Well, little by little, I
began to question my own relation to French and the memories it
carried for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a complex, passionate and highly literary oeuvre:
nine novels and several books of essays, short fiction and poetry,
many of which have won international awards. (Seven of her novels,
``So Vast the Prison'' among them, and a collection of short
stories have been translated into English or are forthcoming.) In
her work, which also includes two films, she explores the roots of
Algeria's current crisis in language and history.
</P>
<P>
   Djebar was born in 1936 in Cherchel, a coastal town about an
hour west of Algiers. Her father was the only native teacher of
French in a colonial school. Her mother was descended from a family
with deep roots in Berber and Andalusian culture.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke Arabic with her mother and listened to her
grandmother's ramblings in Berber. But she was educated in French,
since teaching Arabic was forbidden by the colonial authorities. At
the age of 10, when her female cousins left school and assumed the
veil required by Islam, her father insisted that she continue her
education. So for her, French became identified as an ambivalent
source of liberty. ``Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade'' (1985), her
first mature novel, explored this fractured linguistic identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia started from my simple perception, at the age of 40,
that I was incapable of saying words of love in French,'' Djebar
said. ``The book tells the double story of how the French language
arrived in Algeria with violence and the military conquests of the
19th century, and the way I learned French as a child _ my first
words and how strange the culture seemed to me. First it was the
language of the enemy, then it became a kind of stepmother, in
relation to the maternal tongue of Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Djebar was the first Algerian woman to attend the Ecole
Normale Superieure, the elite, state-run French training school for
teachers, where she studied history. She soon dropped out, however,
to join the FLN, the Algerian movement for national liberation, in
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to a newly independent Algeria in 1962, she became the
first woman to teach at Algiers University. She had already written
three novels under the nom de plume she has used ever since. (The
pseudonym, adopted as a veil of discretion for a woman publishing
in a Muslim society, now shields her family in Algeria from
reprisals.)
</P>
<P>
   The new state increasingly sought to impose a single language
(classical Arabic) on a nation that was 90 percent illiterate, with
a cultural elite largely trained in French and a broader population
that used a mix of popular Arabic dialects, French and several
Berber languages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Djebar, chafing under the constraints of the new
government, went to live in Paris, but in 1974, longing for home,
she returned. (Two years later, the government adopted Islam as the
state religion, and the Arabization process intensified.)
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades (and over the course of two marriages)
_ before the current conflict made travel in Algeria more difficult
_ she shuttled continually between the two countries, as if between
two halves of a long historical equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman between two worlds,'' says Clarissa Zimra, a
professor of comparative literature at the University of Southern
Illinois at Carbondale. ``She says: `This is where history has
landed me. And therefore, I will make it my territory.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Voices Which Besiege Me,'' a recent collection of
essays that has not yet been translated into English, Djebar
reflects on the fertile multilingualism of her native land. There,
centuries of successive invaders have imposed Punic, Latin,
classical and dialectical Arabic, Turkish and French over several
native Berber languages. Djebar is one of the Algerian writers,
including the novelist Kateb Yacine (whose funeral in 1989 was the
occasion for Berber demonstrations) and Tahar Djaout (a poet,
novelist and journalist murdered in 1993), who have invoked this
pre-Islamic, pre-Arabic past as a challenge to both fundamentalist
and government orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Djebar's approach to language and history has
been compared to that of the Caribbean writer Wilson Harris. Born
in 1921 in Guyana (then a British colony) and educated in English,
Harris (who is descended from a mix of English, Hindu, Indian,
Afro- Caribbean and Amerindian ancestors) has written more than 20
novels, which slide between an ancient or imaginary and a more
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone from England, where he has lived since the
1960s, Harris talked about Guyana's ancient Amerindian peoples, the
Arawakf and the Macusis. ``I do not speak their languages,'' the
writer said. ``But the landscape of Guyana is saturated with their
names. And this has affected my writing. I have the sensation of
languages that come into English and change the tone of English. So
that you get crosscultural significance.''
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria the stakes of such exchanges can be deadly. Djebar
began writing ``Algerian White'' (coming next year from Seven
Stories Press) after three close friends _ a psychiatrist, a
sociologist and her brother-in-law, a playwright _ were
assassinated. The book reconstructs the last moments of 19 Algerian
writers: from Albert Camus, who died in a car crash in 1960, to an
unidentified Muslim woman, a teacher gunned down in 1994. A hymn to
friendship and the enduring power of language, it is also a requiem
for a nation's unfinished literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Vast the Prison'' seems remote from these harrowing
memories. In three sections, it recounts a modern Algerian woman's
observation of her disintegrating marriage; the history of
archaeological searches for the lost alphabet of the Berber tribes;
and the carefully reconstructed life stories of the writer's mother
and grandmother. For Djebar, the middle section, in which the
ancient Greek historian Polybe appears as a character, holds
particular significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polybe had seen his own country destroyed, and then was
brought as a Roman captive to Carthage to describe its
destruction,'' she explained. ``And when that was over, the Romans
told him, you're free, you can go home. But when he finally arrived
at his native city he witnessed the famous sack of Corinth. He was
over 70 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``So Vast the Prison,'' Djebar writes: ``Polybe the historian
... Polybe the deported writer, returning in the twilight of his
life to his native land, sees that he no longer has a land or even
a country (the latter enslaved and in chains). All that he has is a
language whose beauty warms him and that he uses to enlighten the
enemies of yesterday who are now his allies. He writes. And his
language, his hand, his memory and all his powers just before they
fade, contribute to this untimely, yet necessary transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about Polybe,'' Djebar later reflected, ``I ask
myself, what are the conflicts of Algeria today in relation to
these past centuries of destruction? And somehow I feel calmer.''

COMPANIES HOPE TO CASH IN ON JAPANESE OBSESSION WITH PERSONAL
HYGIENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a country with cramped living quarters, crammed
subways and overcrowded streets, it stands to reason that the
Japanese often go to great lengths to avoid germs.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are not worn in the home, people with colds wear surgical
masks in public and waiters spray their hands with disinfectant
before serving customers. At the cash register, money is placed on
a small tray and not in the hand. Body odor is simply not
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But lately the obsession with cleanliness has reached new
heights with the introduction of a variety of products ranging from
deodorized underwear to breath-freshening lipstick, all intended to
keep the body free of odor.
</P>
<P>
   The main targets of the sales campaign are older people,
especially middle-aged men. According to cosmetics companies and
public surveys, they smell worse than the rest of Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido Co., Japan's largest cosmetic maker, said it has
discovered the source of body odor in people over 40 _ a substance
called noneal, which researchers said is more pronounced among
middle-aged men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our data shows that older women and men produce the same
amount of noneal but that we smell more odor coming from men
because they tend to be less hygienic than women,'' said Shoji
Nakamura, a Shiseido perfumer, who is credited with discovering the
offending agent.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Shiseido introduced a line of shampoos, lotions
and deodorants that it says reduce body odor in older people by
inhibiting the breakdown of fatty acid in skin that creates noneal.
</P>
<P>
   Noneal, which has a ``greasy, grassy odor,'' is rarely found in
the body odor of people in their 20s and 30s but increases in
volume and strength with aging, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido said it expects sales of the new product line, called
Care Garden, to reach $30 million by March, more than five times
its initial target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainly salarymen in their 50s who are buying it,'' said
Kyoko Asakura, manager for Matsumoto Kiyoshi, a discount drug store
in the Ginza shopping district. ``Many of them come into the store
and shyly ask for `the product that takes away old man's smell.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to unpleasant body odor, Shiseido said that its
market research showed that Japanese people were most concerned
about bad breath and bad smells produced by the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Many young women like Miki Ishimoto, a 21-year-old student, say
they are afraid to touch a subway strap after an older man, or
ojisan as they are known in Japan, has handled it. And if an ojisan
should accidentally brush up against her: ``I feel so contaminated
that I immediately go to wash myself,'' Ms. Ishimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido is not the only company trying to capitalize on the
germ phobia. Etiquette Water, a health drink made of fruit enzymes
and minerals, promises to eliminate bad breath and underarm odor.
Elizabeth Arden, Japan, is marketing the Lip Lip Hooray line of
lipsticks that contains citric acid that the company says
neutralizes the compounds that can cause bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   SSK Corp. has a line of T-shirts that contain deodorant fibers
that it says eliminate foul odors when exposed to the sun's
ultraviolet rays. The deodorizing agent remains in the shirt when
it is washed, SSK said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks the preoccupation with cleanliness is
healthy. Koichiro Fujita, a professor of immunology at Tokyo
Medical and Dental University, said that while the Japanese have
long been attentive to personal hygiene, they have become ``slaves
to smell,'' succumbing to the recent barrage of advertising by
deodorant producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketers have brainwashed people to be afraid of their
own smell, which is supposed to be something natural, something
that as a living creature is a way of asserting I am here,'' Fujita
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is suffering from super cleanliness syndrome and
it's so extreme that even elementary school children are afraid to
make a bad smell in the bathroom for fear that they will be teased
or bullied,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita, citing a recent rise in asthma, allergies and dermatitis
in Japan, said that too much cleanliness is actually detrimental to
one's health because it reduces the body's ability to fight off
infections and diseases. His book ``Cleanliness is a Sickness'' has
sold 30,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But some people have a simpler explanation why the Japanese have
so readily embraced products that eliminate any distinctive
personal smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before these products were created, the norm for Japanese men
was to wear that awful smelling hair tonic, and they really didn't
care how they smelled,'' said Harueko Kato, a sociologist at Tokyo
Women's Christian University. ``Today, whether it's in the office,
subways trains, or at home, Japanese men want to be liked, so they
are trying to improve their image, and I think it's great,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese eschew bad odors, they also avoid strong
fragrances and generally like their cosmetic products, soaps, and
incense to have subtle scents. Indeed, cosmetic industry figures
show that the Japanese buy more deodorant products intended to
prevent bad smells than perfumes that create a strong individual
fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido said that its new line of cosmetics was not
specifically targeted at middle-aged men but rather for all people
over 40. The company said its market research showed that people of
all ages and both men and women were buying the products.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan's population aging faster than those of most other
industrialized countries, Shiseido said it hopes the product will
become a part of daily grooming for the elderly. People in their
70s secrete almost 10 times more of the fatty acid that turns into
noneal, the smelly substance, than do people in their 40s, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   In a consumer survey conducted by Shiseido, a grandmother told
the company that after using Care Garden she was no longer
concerned that her strong body odor might offend her young
grandson, who sometimes sleeps with her in the same bed.

 &HT;    Art Papers Magazine is an Atlanta-based review, nationally
respected for contemporary coverage, but the publication may be
turning a final page
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 5.
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Art Papers is a small magazine. If you didn't know
from its circulation _ about 1,500 subscribers, a press run of
5,000 _ you might guess from visiting its office, a Fonzie-era
classroom in a retired elementary school, which also houses a
community radio station and the Atlanta Jugglers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might get a clue from meeting the board president, a
self-effacing sculptor with no business experience, whose
large-scale artwork has utilized junked cars, telephone poles and
an old school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Scan some of the magazine's headlines. Witness ``Tensions
Confronting Today's Turkish Artists'' and ``Unnecessary Duplicates:
Identity and Technology in the Performances of Laurie Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's not a must-read for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the size and specialized subject of Art Papers belies its
influence and history and the national cachet it gives its
hometown, which has suffered a recent spate of arts-event crises
and leadership losses.
</P>
<P>
   This esoteric, nonprofit art journal, with its Southern focus
and international reach, may be the city's least-known arts
institution. And suddenly, much like the Arts Festival of Atlanta,
which folded in 1998, it embodies a rich tradition that's on the
verge of dying after building heavy debt during one really bad
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of extinction,'' says Evan Levy, the
40-year-old board president and sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   But, as it turns out, hanging tough. It's merely on life
support.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the late '70s heyday of public funding for the arts, Art
Papers began life as the Atlanta Art Workers Coalition Newsletter,
an awkward, leftist-sounding title for the mouthpiece of an
artists' rights group.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing another magazine, Contemporary Art Southeast, it
became Atlanta Art Papers with the March 1980 issue, evolving into
just plain Art Papers in January 1981. (It added ``magazine'' to
the title more recently, in part to help cut down on phone calls
inquiring about paper products.)
</P>
<P>
   Since its earliest days, the magazine has helped establish the
South as fertile turf for contemporary art. Fans appreciate it for
recognizing artists early in their careers _ such as Atlanta's own
Radcliffe Bailey _ without filtering its views through the
exclusive prism of the New York gallery world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers a fresh view,'' says Robin Bernat, a local video and
book artist whose work will be included in the upcoming Whitney
Biennial in New York. ``Art Papers reviewed my work very early in
my career, when I first graduated from art school and opened my own
studio. It was important, because it was prior to my having gallery
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key Atlanta arts figures leaving the city, Harriet
Sanford, director of the Fulton County Arts Council, says, ``It's a
critical journal that not only helps us get a sense of where we
stand artistically, it helps keep us on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Papers maintains its edge by avoiding ``mainstream and
blue-chip galleries,'' says New York free-lancer Susan Canning, one
of the magazine's dozen or so contributing editors.
</P>
<P>
   It spotlights newer galleries and alternative spaces, such as
the Lump Gallery in Raleigh and Exit Art in New York _ places the
glossier, more established magazines such as Artforum and Art in
America are less likely to feature. The January/February issue
includes reviews from Miami, New Orleans, Washington, Richmond, New
York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Denver, Kansas
City, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Istanbul and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Michael Pittari coordinates it all from Art Papers'
office _ blackboard still intact on the wall _ in the old Moreland
Elementary School. The building operates as the Little Five Points
Community Center, a sort of boardinghouse for nonprofit
organizations: Along with the jugglers association and radio
station WRFG-FM (89.3), the Horizon Theatre is another full-time
tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Pittari, 32, and his contributing editors supervise more than 50
free-lance writers and critics around the country. The magazine
covers the Southeast more than other areas, but it also
concentrates on the West Coast and the Northeast. ``It's very
difficult to ignore what's happening in those places,'' Pittari
says.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a quarter-century, the magazine has made its
grass-roots mark with long, essay-format reviews, often presented
in a dense, gray format. Art Papers was an early champion of folk
art, publishing its first major reviews in 1982 _ before
Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art introduced self-taught
African-American artists to a wider audience. Some of the bigger
names lauded in their pre-celebrity mode _ performance artist
Laurie Anderson and MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant recipient
Kara Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its boutique size, the magazine remains a warehouse of a
resource for its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps us afloat in information and ideas,'' says Louise
Shaw, a local consultant and former director of the recently
renamed Atlanta Contemporary Art Center. ``Art Papers has
legitimized Atlanta and the Southeast. It's the only serious art
journal being distributed out of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura C. Lieberman, a co-founder who served as editor from 1979
to 1984, stresses the archival importance of reviews by more than
1,000 writers. ``It is the only history of artists in the South
that exists,'' says Lieberman, now development coordinator with the
American Museum of Papermaking in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The bimonthly lands on newstands ($7 cover price) all over the
country. In Manhattan, you can find it at Tower Books on Lafayette
Street and at Printed Matter in SoHo. In Seattle, it goes to the
Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington; in Chicago, the
Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Borders Books &AMP; Music carries a few copies, as do some
independent bookstores and the High Museum of Art and Emory
University's Michael C. Carlos Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the magazine could be out of circulation for
good. It is enduring what Levy calls ``the biggest crisis in the
history of the publication,'' referring to some recent
mismanagement that left it with a debt of about $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The financial abyss, discovered suddenly last fall, stunned
board members, who won't discuss specifics because of an ongoing
investigation and audit of last year's records. Staff members had
to be let go. The executive director and business manager resigned.
The magazine's developing Web site (artpapers.org) was put on hold.
All this at a time when the magazine's National Endowment for the
Arts grant had been cut roughly in half; Art Papers historically
gets 30 percent of its funding from grants, Levy says. Its normal
annual operating budget is $210,000 to $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   As some were fearing the next issue would not make it to press,
the local arts community fashioned a rescue. Photographer Lucinda
Bunnen, an Art Papers board member, called friends and raised
$25,000 in three days.
</P>
<P>
   An auction fund-raiser last month at Lowe Gallery was jammed by
600 arts enthusiasts who cleared the walls of more than 150 works
of art donated by local galleries and artists. The benefit raised
about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will help get us off the hook,'' says Pittari, one of
only two remaining full-time staffers. ``But it's important from a
business standpoint to show our supporters that we're going to make
changes to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   A more accessible approach is key for survival, and to serve a
changing audience. Senior editor Jerry Cullum, a part-time staffer
who has been with Art Papers since 1984, says the magazine
typically dealt in ``a fairly academic manner'' with the
contemporary art scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're trying to be intelligent but much more informal,''
explains Cullum, a painter and poet who also reviews visual arts
for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``We've always been strong as
a magazine read by artists themselves. But we've made a great
effort to branch out'' to other segments of the arts audience.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the times: more stories relating art to film and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Arts insiders say it's crucial that Art Papers succeed in
remodeling itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the magazine folded, ``there would be a real drastic
reduction in opportunity for artists from the area,'' says Kathryn
Hixson, editor of New Art Examiner in Chicago, a competing
publication and one of the few surviving regional art journals in
America. (Some recent publishing casualties in the field: Reflex in
Seattle and Artpaper in Minneapolis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've become more globalized and Internetted,''
Hixson says, ``it's more important that these kinds of regional
magazines stay afloat to serve those communities. Because they're
not gonna get coverage from (magazines based in) New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Vroom, who teaches art criticism at Cornish College of
the Arts in Seattle, uses Art Papers in his classroom and is trying
to get the school library to subscribe. ``As far as content,
usually every issue has something thoughtful, unique,
problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the recent benefit auction, the Fulton County Arts Council
showed its support by buying $5,000 worth of art for its art loan
program. It also plans to give the magazine another $5,000 for
technical support, Sanford says.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from making its editorial product more reader-friendly,
the magazine has hired a new director of operations and is
attempting proactive business solutions. Brainstorming with local
museums about ways to increase circulation. Thinking about
databasing its archives. Persuading the phone company not to cut
off service.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern: strengthening its board of directors _
dominated by artists _ with business people who know how to raise
money and monitor the bottom line. ``We don't have a big corporate
presence on the board,'' Bunnen says. ``But we're going to address
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullum says the debt reduction has raised spirits in the office.
But the magazine's long-term health is still a critical concern for
arts supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need it more than ever,'' Lieberman says. ``It's
harder and harder for artists to see a reason to stay here. Art
Papers makes it easier for collectors to justify buying a Southern
artist. Everyone in the arts in Atlanta needs to have Art Papers
working.''
</P>
<P>
   AHEAD OF THE CURVE
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Atlanta's Art Papers Magazine, a small but savvy
journal, has reviewed blossoming artists and published incisive
critics before they attained national celebrity. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Performance artist Laurie Anderson was featured on the
March/April 1979 issue, when she was interviewed by an unknown
artist named John Turturro, before he went on to a successful
acting career in such movies as ``Barton Fink'' and ``Quiz Show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the mid-1980s, the magazine published essays by Henry Louis
Gates and Cornel West before they established themselves as
intellectual stars and prolific authors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A 1995 review singled out artist Kara Walker, who attended the
Atlanta College of Art, before she was featured on the cover of
major art magazines in New York and London. In 1997, at the age of
27, Walker was awarded a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant.

 &HT;    Millions of dollars in federal money bypass a Mississippi
community made up of the poorest of the poor
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 5.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Miss. _ Emmanuel Jackson remembers a time, not long ago,
when most people in this tiny village had outdoor toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't so bad then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Time and ``progress'' have made this Mississippi Delta community
more miserable, not less. At least with outhouses, the waste went
into a hole in the ground. Today, with no sewage system and broken
or inadequate septic tanks, much of what drains from sinks and
flushes out of indoor toilets winds up in ditches beside people's
homes and along the dusty gravel streets. In the summer, the smell
is unbearable. When it rains, raw sewerage washes over yards and
into the road. Toilets back up. Snakes are a daily problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the Third World here,'' says resident Willie
Knighten.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 15 years since the Rev. Jesse Jackson stood in Sugar
Ditch, a destitute section of Tunica, and dubbed the Delta
``America's Ethiopia.'' The open sewage streams of Sugar Ditch are
gone, and in many larger Delta towns like Tunica, there have been
improvements in the standard of living. Millions of dollars' worth
of federal grants and the development of casinos have brought some
changes to a region struggling to diversify after more than a
century of growing cotton.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shadows are Rome and places like it _ poor, mostly
black communities where even the most basic needs are not met. As
the nation enjoys its most prosperous era, the people of Rome stand
by and watch, painfully aware of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much here besides water and lights,'' Emmanuel
Jackson says, standing behind his frame house, looking down at a
ditch murky with dirty dishwater and raw sewage. He is unemployed
right now, and can't travel far: His car broke down. ``The county
will come through and mow the grass by the road in the summer, but
that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson won't believe it until he sees it, but a sewerage system
is in the works, thanks to years of effort by a small and
determined group of Rome citizens. It took battling the
indifference from the powers that be, who were reluctant even to
accept the $1 million grant applied for and obtained by the
citizens. It is only the first step on a long road to a better
life. And Rome is only one of perhaps dozens of communities in need
in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta native Hodding Carter III, former editor and associate
publisher of the Delta Democrat Times, says he didn't know anyone
still lived in Rome, which is at the north end of Sunflower County.
But he knows such communities exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``With almost all federal programs, there are going to be some
communities falling through the cracks,'' says Carter, who is
president and CEO of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
``Now, you have even more sharply etched isolation, pockets of
implosion and economic deflation.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO COMMUNITIES,
</P>
<P>
   WORLDS APART
</P>
<P>
   Rome used to be a community of field hands, but machines do most
of the farm jobs these days. Many people have moved away, and the
ones who remain seem stymied by a lifelong hunch that no one cares
_ particularly the white people who run most things. They are
trapped by their own lack of education and resources. And so they
watch their situation deteriorate, year by year, decade by decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people here, they just don't know how to get what
they want,'' says Hime ``Skinner'' Weekly, who owns one of the two
nightclubs in town. ``They are so used to people telling them what
to do, they don't know how or they don't even want to try to
upgrade this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial tension is almost palpable here, so there is little
cooperation or even communication between blacks and whites. Weekly
and other black residents accuse whites of clinging to old
plantation notions of superiority. The white residents accuse
blacks of being unable to take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sunflower County Supervisor Barry Bryant, a white Rome resident,
says he tries not to judge people by the color of their skin, but
he also believes segregation is ``human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in Martin Luther King's speech `I have a dream,'''
he says. ``But we don't go to church together, we don't eat
together or live together.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like to see that change, Bryant says, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   AND THE WALLS COME
</P>
<P>
   TUMBLING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people, 95 percent of them black, live along the dusty
gravel roads of Rome. Their homes are fragile wood frame houses or
house trailers guarded by dogs with threatening snarls. The ravaged
downtown looks like Main Street Sarajevo: The facades on some of
the abandoned brick buildings are dangerously close to collapsing.
Inside an old grocery, the shelves and freezer cases and even boxes
of Italian dressing and hot sauce lie in shambles on the floor.
People have thrown bottles and cans inside for what must be years,
judging from the mountainous piles. Another store is practically
carpeted in broken glass. Residents say the owners of the stores
packed up and left many years ago. There is only one open store, a
service station out on U.S. 49.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a community was in need of a leg up, it would seem to be
this one. Yet none of the $40 million provided by the Mid-Delta
Empowerment Zone, the latest in a string of federal programs
designed for the troubled region, will ever reach Rome. The
boundary of the zone, which contains parts of six counties, is
about 15 miles south, in the middle of Sunflower County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they cut us out,'' says community activist
Betty Smith, who lives in nearby Drew, a town also not in the zone.
``The empowerment zone is like a cover, so people will say, `Oh,
they're doing something now.'''
</P>
<P>
   INFRASTRUCTURE
</P>
<P>
   DRAWS THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Being left out of the empowerment zone created a fresh sense of
bitterness in Rome, even among the whites, who are generally better
off than the black residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For goodness' sake, the empowerment zone includes Indianola,
and they are the only town in Sunflower County that already had a
Wal-Mart,'' says Bryant, owner of the one store in Rome. Indianola,
thanks to the empowerment zone, has a $4 million work force
training center and a Dollar General distribution facility that
employs more than 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Knighten, who is black, says, ``You want to see poverty, come
here. The empowerment zone is not doing what it was supposed to do.
That money was supposed to be for poor communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Bowie, co-chairman of the empowerment zone, says there
were geographical reasons why the north end of Sunflower was not
included. The land mass had to be contiguous, and it had to be
built on census tracts, not counties. Moreover, the grant is
designed to attract industry by providing matching funds.
Businesses are drawn to areas that have infrastructures in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Indianola, there was an opportunity to create
opportunity,'' he says. ``You can't use the resources of the
empowerment zone to rebuild small communities like Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   The empowerment zone, created in 1994, got off to a slow start.
It was so mismanaged at first that the state Department of Economic
and Community Development threatened to send the money back to
Washington. With a new director, a more streamlined application
process and a slightly smaller board, things are moving forward,
Bowie says. About half the money has been granted, and about a
dozen businesses have moved into the Delta. In Sunflower County,
the unemployment rate has dropped 7 percent. It used to hover near
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in the empowerment zone is good for the entire
Delta,'' Bowie says.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE BOTTOM
</P>
<P>
   OF THE ECONOMIC HEAP
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for the 18 northwest Mississippi counties that
make up the Delta can be numbing. Its counties are at the bottom of
most rankings in a state that ranks worst or close to it on most
national lists. Of the 16 Mississippi counties with poverty rates
above 30 percent, 12 are in the Delta. Sunflower County and Holmes
County are two of the poorest counties in the nation, according to
the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robert Clark, the speaker pro-tem and the first black
person elected to the Legislature, is frustrated that most of his
native Holmes County was left out of the empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I have not seen any changes because of the zone,'' he
says. In fact, unemployment in Holmes County has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever drew up the empowerment zone did not have a grasp of
what was needed in the Delta,'' he says. ``I quit going to the
board meetings because it was a waste of my time. It is nothing but
feel-good talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie says there is no comprehensive program set up to deal with
communities like Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an agrarian community, but once that pool of labor is
gone, the grocery stores and such go, and the town goes to the
pits,'' he says. ``I don't know of a program that looks at that.
But there are individuals who do. I have seen towns that have
gotten inspired and thought about what they can do for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Rome is doing. Through the efforts of a small
group of citizens, there is a happy chapter in the story of Rome.
The village should have a sewerage system in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   TOWNSPEOPLE MOTIVATED
</P>
<P>
   TO HELP THEMSELVES
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a black church in the town formed the Rome
Community Development Organization. The members asked the governing
board of the Rome Water Association, a seven-person body that was
and always had been all white, to apply for grant money for a sewer
system. The board is the only official body in the village, since
there is no mayor or police or fire department. They were
reluctant, citing residents' poverty and inability to pay bills. So
the organization raised money to send Willie and Irie Knighten to a
nearby community college to learn how to write grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Knightens then went to the county supervisors and persuaded
them to let the Rome residents apply for $1 million in federal
money. The money was awarded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the residents had to persuade the Rome water board to
accept the money and take n the project.
</P>
<P>
   That was more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a problem,'' says Billy Patterson, a water
board member. ``We have water customers who can't pay a $25 water
bill. You put a $25 sewer bill on top of that, and what's going to
happen? Probably half this community is way below the poverty line.
They're welfare people, food stamp people, three, four generations
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The water system is a cooperative, which means everyone in Rome
owns it. So the Knightens asked the water board to have a meeting
last fall. They got several dozen residents to attend the meeting.
They took a vote on accepting the money to build a sewer system,
and more than 30 people were in favor of it. Several residents, all
whites _ some of them on the water board _ voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   At that same meeting, two board seats were up for re-election.
The residents voted Irie Knighten and a black woman to be the first
black members of the Rome water board.
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Willie Knighten, a medical technologist who is studying for a
master's degree, says she has great hopes for Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get residents involved,'' she says. ``I think this
community is going to be an example. We're going to see some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people need a way to make a living,'' he says. ``Rome
isn't going to make it. There is no economic base.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter wonders as well about the viability of tiny Delta towns
whose roots are in an agrarian culture that is fast disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer a need for these little towns,'' he says.
``There is no place for unskilled labor communities. Exactly how
much money should any society spend to prop up circumstances that
have no economic fundamentals?''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie would like to see communities like Rome link up with
nearby larger towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be sort of like the suburbs, but in a rural area,''
he suggests. ``They could share a tax base with a larger town.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knightens and other Rome residents remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get this sewerage system, we've got something,'' says
Irie Knighten, who says he wants to run for county supervisor when
Bryant's term is up in four years. ``Then people might give us
grants to build businesses. We've got the ammunition now.''

 &HT;    Retiring Bishop Frank Allan is getting in touch with his
artistic side, setting up a shop for artisans to benefit Episcopal
ministriesBy Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For almost 13 years, Bishop Frank Allan has been a
shepherd of the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta. Now, he's becoming a
shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Allan is trading in one kind of miter for another _ his bishop's
pointed hat for wood joints.
</P>
<P>
   Among the products he will be selling at the Work of Our Hands,
a store for arts and crafts, are his own handmade wooden toys and
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The shop, featuring the work of more than 100 Southern artisans
in weaving, pottery, basketry, quilting, caning and painting, will
open soon in Atlanta. The nonprofit corporation, which will benefit
some Atlanta Episcopal ministries, takes its name from Psalm 90:17,
which asks God to ``prosper the work of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is we're closest to being in the image of God when
we're involved in creating,'' said Allan, who first took up
woodworking many years ago when his father passed down to him an
old Sears and Roebuck scroll saw.
</P>
<P>
   He began turning bowls last year after his staff gave him a
lathe _ ``I sort of hinted,'' he admits. In his almost-empty office
sit three smooth bowls of different sizes and different woods _
maple, magnolia and red mahogany _ and a communion chalice he has
made.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will always be an Episcopal bishop, Allan's last day
as head of the Atlanta diocese is March 12. He had planned to step
down a week earlier when his elected successor, the Rev. Robert
Trache of Richmond, was to be consecrated. But late last week the
diocese called off Trache's consecration, saying the bishop-elect
had failed to disclose significant matters in his personal and
financial life.
</P>
<P>
   Allan wrote in a statement to North Georgia Episcopalians that
he was ``grieved'' by the decision but agreed with it. ``It had
been my hope to end my tenure as your bishop on a note of
celebration instead of grief and disappointment,'' he wrote.
``There is no doubt in my mind that it is appropriate for me to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish priest at heart
</P>
<P>
   Allan, who will turn 65 in May, grew up ``a pretty inactive''
Presbyterian in Atlanta, graduated from Druid Hills High School and
attended Emory University, majoring in English literature and
graduating in 1956. As a college student, he first visited Holy
Trinity Episcopal Church in Decatur and said he was taken by the
beauty of the liturgy and the openness of the clergy he met.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met Agnes Scott history major Elizabeth Ansley in
a Russian history summer school class at Emory, he had decided to
become an Episcopal priest _ but she didn't realize that when the
two started dating.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Decatur who had
conscientiously avoided serious relationships with students at
nearby Columbia Theological Seminary because she didn't want to be
a preacher's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was snuck up on from behind'' by Allan's career plans, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two married in 1957 when she graduated from Agnes Scott and
he was going into his second year of theology school at the
University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of their four children turns 40 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Allan went on for a master's degree at Sewanee and a doctorate
at Emory. He was rector at St. Mark's in Dalton; St. Peter's in
Columbia, Tenn.; St. Paul's in Macon; and St. Anne's in Atlanta
before being consecrated bishop coadjutor in 1987, to serve with
and then succeed Bishop Judson Child. Child retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Allan said he remains a parish priest at heart. ``It took me
about five years to feel like a bishop,'' he said. During the
election process when he realized he might be chosen, he was
tempted to stand up and shout, ``Wait a minute! I was just
kidding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As bishop he has gained a reputation as an intellectual, a good
preacher, a fair boss and a person of solid integrity. He's also a
``computer nerd,'' said his longtime secretary Glenna Smith. ``He
fixes all the computers for the entire staff now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan uses his computer to extend his working time into the wee
hours of the morning. Priests in the diocese are not surprised to
click on their computers and find that the bishop has sent them
e-mail at 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worried about the amount of time he puts into
it,'' said the Rev. Richard Callaway, president of the diocese's
six-member Standing Committee, or bishop's advisory board. ``But he
has a very steady hand on the helm. He listens well. He's not
afraid to say he made a mistake, but he makes them rarely.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Allan's leadership, the Atlanta diocese has grown by 16
congregations and now has 91 churches with about 53,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But during that time, a few churches have left the diocese,
saying the national denomination had become too liberal by
ordaining women priests and consecrating female bishops. Two local
Episcopal priests became Catholic clergy, one taking a congregation
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Allan from the beginning supported women's ordination and
accepted the first female deacon in the diocese as his associate in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   If the question of female clergy seemed to dominate the church
during the first part of his tenure, the questions of whether to
ordain sexually active gays and lesbians and bless same-sex unions
have divided Episcopalians _ and other mainline Christians _ during
latter years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bishop has one or two big issues,'' Allan said. ``My
issue was homosexuality. That's what the church was absorbed
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the store
</P>
<P>
   Allan has made it clear that he would like to be able to open
ordination to gays and lesbians in committed relationships _ but he
will not because it is against the doctrine of the Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of a communion,'' he said. ``I believe we cannot
act unilaterally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a diverse diocese,'' said Callaway, rector of St.
Julian's in Douglasville. ``We've got lots of folks on the ends of
the theological spectrum, the economic spectrum and the issues of
the church. He manages to hold all that in tension, and he loves
those he disagrees with as much as those he agrees with. We've been
managed well.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop's greatest strength, Callaway said, has been his
wife, Elizabeth. ``She's a partner in ministry but she has her own
personality, her own life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Allan is a teacher who retired last year from the
Fulton County system. ``I didn't go back in case when he retired he
wanted to take one of those trips you hear about,'' she said. ``I
soon found out different.'' She is also a poet who has kept a diary
of her life since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, the Allans sold their large northwest
Atlanta house to move into a more modest one on Briarcliff Road,
cutting their mortgage in half and committing themselves to give
away much of the difference mostly to Episcopal outreach ministries
and to their alma maters. Elizabeth Allan mows their lawn, the
bishop said, and they consciously consider how they use their
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do try not to be cumbered about with too much,'' he said.
``I think John Wesley said, 'I don't want to be cumbered about with
too much lest it get into my heart.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Allan, who recently spent time doing relief work in
Honduras, says she plans to look after her grandchildren _ four of
six live in metro Atlanta _ help out with the shop, and ``travel,
whether he does or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop will run the store with his two partners and longtime
friends, Smith, his secretary since his St. Anne's days, and Martha
McClatchey, a jewelry designer, painter and St. Anne's parishioner
who was in a sixth-grade Sunday school class he taught while he was
an Emory student.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a grand time together,'' McClatchey said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan is already spending every unscheduled evening at the shop
installing display shelving. He will also teach at Emory, write,
sail, bicycle and continue to use his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to keep busy,'' said his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not retiring because I'm tired and burned out. I'm
retiring because it's time to do other things,'' the bishop said.
``I'm retiring as bishop but not from life.''
</P>

   CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The GOP slugfest over
whether John McCain is baiting Catholics by painting George W. Bush
as anti-Catholic has freed a genie from a bottle corked 40 years
ago by John F. Kennedy. Democrats are rejoicing, for it was only
six years ago that the Gingrich-led House revolution showed that a
Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in
decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before
that, Catholics split their ticket, as in voting for Ronald Reagan
but then returning to their old lunch-pail Democratic roots. By
Francis X. Clines.

   DARK-MATTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern astronomy was supposed to
banish Aristotelian and mystical notions about the composition of
the universe, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February, the quest is only
progressing because of science's willingness to stretch the very
meaning of the word ``matter.'' This once-simple stuff is coming to
seem as ethereal as anyone could have imagined. By George Johnson.

<P>
   DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest buzzphrase
circulating among politicians and computer executives is the
digital divide, the gulf between those who have access to computers
and the Internet and those who do not. People in the latter
category, the thinking goes, are being shut out of the most
important mode of gathering and exchanging information in the new
century. In fact, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing closely with the issue that the term digital divide, while
clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
By Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1996, immigrant bashing was
in: Bob Dole, Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan took positions that
could be seen as anti-immigrant. But what a difference four years
makes. In the 2000 campaign, nary a nasty word has been uttered
about immigrants. GOP strategists say Hispanic Americans will be to
this year's campaign what soccer moms were to the 1996 campaign.
Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may
provide swing votes in California, New York, Texas, and Florida _
which together account for half the electoral votes needed to win
the presidency. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERTUESDAY-SCENARIOS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the primary
and caucus schedule so far, it's been easy to keep track of whether
Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain is up or down. It may not
be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 contests. It is the biggest, and
most important single day of the primary season. And, perhaps, the
most confusing. Consider the possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's behind the comeback of high
heels? Professional women may have discovered that sex appeal is
power because it is a way to get people to do what you want. And
high heels are the prime symbol of erotic femininity, because they
inspire simultaneous fantasies of vulnerability (who can run in
them?) and of the heel as weapon. They are a gal's version of a guy
thing: the female power tool. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-POLICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Scandals often require not
just scandalous facts, but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to
activate public outrage. In Los Angles, for example, a police
corruption scandal in which officers brutalized, framed and shot
innocent people has suddenly erupted, after quietly simmering for
five months. At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have
been a proposed bond offering. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-NYPD-ABUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A scathing report detailing
corruption and abuse in an elite-anti-crime unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department came just a week after four officers in a similar
squad in New York were acquitted in the death of an unarmed man
they shot 19 times. But where the New York officers may have been
reckless, the Los Angeles officers were almost certainly
premeditated criminals. Although there is no indication that the
New York unit has engaged in such lawlessness, critics say such
squads are risky ventures that frequently lead to problems. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-GOOKS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The brush fire over John
McCain's use of the word ``gooks'' flared and faded fairly quickly.
Asian-Americans may have wondered: Would McCain have gotten more
bad publicity from a slur against blacks or Hispanics? Some
excerpts, primarily from Internet e-mail forums directed at Asian
Americans, capture this and other sentiments.

   BRIT-CORPORAL-PUNISH-REVIEW (London) _ Britain has outlawed
corporal punishment in schools, and the debate has now shifted to
the home, with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to
set out exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current
law, which dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into
limbo when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had
failed to protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather. By Sarah Lyall.

SIMS GAME'S ALLURE IS THAT IT'S LIKE LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Wright created the original SimCity game 11 years ago, and
looking at the concept on paper, nothing could seem more boring.
Players build a city from scratch, manage its resources and keep
the citizenry happy.
</P>
<P>
   Who but a municipal bureaucrat or a policy wonk would think
that's fun?
</P>
<P>
   But the SimCity franchise _ the latest version is SimCity 3000 _
has sold more than 7 million copies, according to game developer
Maxis' Web site. It spawned an entire genre of computer games that
simulate real-life systems, but it remains the best of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every city has citizens, and in the SimCity line the
inhabitants are called Sims. Most players of the game come to hate
the Sims because they complain all the time _ taxes are too high,
housing or jobs are scarce, traffic is too congested, pollution is
nasty. You just wanna slap their little pixilated faces ... which
is why the game also lets you unleash tornados, earthquakes, movie
monsters or space aliens on your simulated town.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can get to know these annoying creatures better.
Wright's latest game, The Sims, drills down to examine life inside
the walls of SimCity's homes. It's described as a ``people
simulator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sims is easily the most addictively enjoyable game Wright
has done since the first SimCity. It's complex enough that longtime
fans of simulators will not be bored, but not so hard that novices
will be frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, it's compelling fun. Essentially, players
control simulated human lives, down to the smallest detail, and
there's something primally appealing about that. You can even tell
the Sims when to use the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IT STARTS WITH MAN, BARE HOUSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sims, which currently is available only for Windows 95/98
systems (it will also run on Windows 2000), begins with a simple
tutorial. Players start with a sparsely furnished house and a male
character with a fairly balanced personality. The tutorial shows
you how to work with the clever interface _ a series of simple
icons that lead to more complex menus _ and how to manage your
Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually a second character, a female, is added to the home,
and now you get to see how your Sims interact. She also has a
fairly balanced personality, so she's likely to get along with her
new mate.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in real life, don't expect fireworks right away. As they
get to know each other, they get to like each other better _ and if
they really hit it off, one will propose marriage. If they get
along in marriage, they may have a child ... or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Sims go off to work each day, climb the career ladder, and
bring home money _ or Simoleans, the coin of the Sim-realm. With
that money you can buy them things, upgrading that cheap
black-and-white TV for a snazzy plasma-screen model, but only if
you can afford it. The more gadgetry and luxury you provide for
your Sims, the happier they are.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
YOU CAN CREATE PERSONALITIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can let the game create Sims for you, or you can craft your
own. The Sims' personalities are controlled by variations in five
settings: Neat, Outgoing, Active, Playful and Nice.
</P>
<P>
   Ratchet up the Outgoing, Active and Playful settings and you'll
make a Sim who's gregarious and a bit childish. Back off on Nice,
crank up the Active and reduce the Outgoing setting and create one
who's mean, keeps to herself but fidgets and likes to dance.
</P>
<P>
   As you progress through the game, your Sims will meet other Sims
and you can watch how different personality types get along. These
may be Sims you've set up in other houses, or random Sims that drop
by.
</P>
<P>
   For example, early in the game a woman in a tight red dress
dropped by to visit one of my male Sims while his wife was away at
work. I expected hanky panky, but instead they didn't get along.
The two began arguing, and he told her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The game is full of little touches that make it fascinating. For
example, early in their lives, the Sims aren't good cooks. They are
liable to cut themselves as they prepare meals on a chopping board.
And don't buy them a gas stove too early, or they will likely burn
the house down.
</P>
<P>
   The Sims like to have music and television around, and you can
change stations to suit their moods. Play classical music, and
they'll sit and relax. Play rock 'n' roll, and they'll boogie in
the kitchen. Some Sims seem to have a fondness for horror flicks,
while others prefer Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Sims have all the emotional and biological needs of real
people. They must work, play, eat, practice good hygiene and even
use the toilet. When they take a shower or visit the restroom,
their images pixilate, using the same effect TV does when trying to
hide someone's identity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fun, low-effort aspects of all the Sim games is to
just let them run and watch what happens. You can do that with The
Sims, and they will live their lives on auto-pilot. But it's a lot
more fun to intervene, and sometimes you have to. One of my Sims
liked to sleep in and was constantly late for work, which
eventually cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Sims even has an online aspect of sorts. You can upload the
Sims you've created to www.thesims.com to share with other players.
This lets you diversify the Sim-gene pool.

INTERNET ACCESS OPTION ISDL A HYBRID OF ISDN AND DSL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: In investigating high-speed Internet service, I
find limited options for my home. My cable provider does not offer
cable-modem service, and I am too far from the Southwestern Bell
central office to get ADSL service. However, I have been told I can
get IDSL at 144,000-bit-per-second speeds. The only thing I know
about ISDL is that it is related to ISDN. Is it a worthwhile option
until I have better options available?
</P>
<P>
   A: IDSL stands for ISDN Digital Subscriber Line. It's a kind of
hybrid blend of two technologies: ISDN, one of the earliest ways to
get faster Internet access, and the more modern DSL.
</P>
<P>
   DSL has severe distance limitations, though. The farther you are
from the phone company's central office, the weaker the DSL signal.
At more than 17,000 feet, the signal is virtually unusable, and
most providers won't sell you the service.
</P>
<P>
   ISDN has fewer limitations but is costlier to set up and use.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid, originally developed by Ascend Communications, a
communications hardware manufacturer, uses the ISDN-style signal,
but gets it to you in a fashion similar to other forms of DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, with ISDN, you actually have to dial up a connection,
similar to a regular phone call. ISDN goes through the phone
company's switching equipment. DSL does not _ it plugs into
different equipment at the central office. IDSL takes ISDN and
pumps it through equipment similar to that used by DSL.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, you can get IDSL service in places where you
normally cannot get DSL. If it's cheaper than standard ISDN, it
could be an excellent choice until something better is available in
your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your review of the Epson Stylus Color 860 printer and the
Hewlett-Packard 5300C scanner (see
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/457394), you said that older
printers and scanners that use parallel port connections would be
``useless'' with new legacy-free computers that only use USB ports.
But what about the adapters that are available that let you connect
parallel port devices to a USB port?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right, adapters are available. But they have
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see the speed gains you'd get from moving to a pure
USB printer or scanner. Although some manufacturers claim speed
improvements over a standard parallel port, that hasn't been my
experience.
</P>
<P>
   You also lose the two-way communications ability that lets your
computer and device talk to each other. This is used by printers,
for example, to report ink cartridge levels, or by scanners to scan
only certain areas of an image or document. In some cases, your
device's drivers may not work properly if two-way communication
isnot available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 1-gigabyte SyQuest SparQ drive, and I love it.
However, I've filled up my last disk and need to buy more. SyQuest
went out of business and now I can't find the disks. Know where I
can get 'em?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although SyQuest went bankrupt and sold most of its assets to
rival Iomega, it still operates a Web site at www.syquest.com.
There's an online store where it appears you can buy disks for your
SparQ and other SyQuest drive. In fact, the online order form even
indicates you can buy SparQ drives. The site also has support
information and drivers to download.

MEDICARE SHIFT HITS HOSPITAL IN THE WALLET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The 15 employees in the legal and risk management
department of Memorial Hermann Healthcare System recently got the
word they were being replaced by an independent firm that promised
to do the work for 30 to 40 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, who were told to pack up their personal
belongings, turn in their pagers and leave, are victims of the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The legislation, which went into
effect last year, has substantially reduced Medicare reimbursements
to health care providers. Consequently, some hospital systems are
finding themselves in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven months of its fiscal year, Memorial Hermann's
12 hospitals have suffered an operating loss, and the system has
had to sell its financially troubled health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   To turn its fortunes around, Memorial Hermann hired Ernst &AMP;
Young to find ways to cut $50 million out of its budget next year,
said Patty Riddlebarger, spokeswoman for Memorial Hermann
Healthcare System. The consulting firm is also searching for $30
million in new revenues _ such as collecting more of the hospitals'
overdue medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Hermann hopes ``Project 2000'' will turn the fourth
quarter into a profitable one. One of its hospitals has already
reduced the number of days it takes to send a bill from four days
to two, Riddlebarger said.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been other terminations. A week before the legal
and risk management department was let go, 19 people in information
systems were terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said she doesn't know if more dismissals are in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RURAL HOSPITALS REALLY SUFFERING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other hospitals are also suffering, said Amanda Engler,
communications manager for the Texas Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   An association analysis indicates that the effects of the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will cost Texas hospitals $3 billion
over the next five years. Memorial Hermann lost $29 million in
Medicare reimbursements last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rural hospitals are being hit especially hard because some have
90 percent of their business in Medicare, Engler said. Some rural
hospitals have closed while others have shuttered their home health
care operations and dropped their skilled nursing facilities, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sharp turnaround for the health care industry. After
being a good jobs creator _ health care providers added 3,400
positions in 1998 _ the industry cut 1,800 jobs in Houston last
year, according to the Texas Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JOB HELP TO BE OFFERED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though the financial troubles are real, some of the
Memorial Hermann employees who got the boot are grumbling about the
way the hospital system did it.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly generous, for example, one employee said. It
offered only two weeks of severance pay for every year of service
up to a maximum of 15 weeks for those below the director level.
</P>
<P>
   Another grumbled that the hospital system offered no help in
finding another job.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said the severance plan is comparable to those of
other health providers. And Memorial Hermann is putting in an
outplacement center next week to provide classes on writing a
resume as well as teaching interviewing skills and job search
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   All the employees who have been terminated can use the
outplacement center, Riddlebarger said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing for the employees to get over is that the
terminations hit them like a ton of bricks because it affected the
whole department.
</P>
<P>
   There were meetings on how to reduce costs, said a former
employee. But no one expected the whole department to get the ax.
</P>
<P>
   Berating herself, the employee said she should have seen the
signs and started looking for a new job. The department was moving
to another location, and there was just a small space allocated to
it, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured a mistake was made,'' the ex-employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said it would have been difficult to give prior
notice of the terminations because the outsourcing contract was
signed just two days before the employees were let go.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Hermann is betting the outsourcing arrangement will
save money. And if the contract company can't do it with half the
employees? That's not Memorial Hermann's responsibility any more.

INTEL SET TO WIN RACE TO PRODUCE 1-GIGAHERTZ CHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The race to see who can be first to market with a 1-gigahertz
personal computer chip could be won much earlier than expected _ as
in, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said Intel Corp. on Wednesday will announce
1-GHz versions of its Pentium III chips. Personal computers with
the processors will be available later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Intel may beat rival Advanced Micro Devices to the
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard will be among the first to offer the systems. A
company spokeswoman confirmed that Pavilion consumer computers with
the fast Intel chips will be on store shelves by the end of March.
Commercial H-P systems aimed at businesses will be available in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that make personal computers using Intel
processors are also likely to announce 1-GHz systems next week,
including Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq spokeswoman Hedy Baker would not specify when the
Houston-based PC manufacturer would offer machines with the chips,
other than to say ``we are going to launch a 1-GHz class product in
the not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. and IBM are also both expected to ship 1-GHz
PCs this month. Both companies, along with H-P, demonstrated
computers with 1-GHz Pentium III chips during a developer's
conference in February sponsored by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq and H-P use processors from both AMD and Intel. Compaq's
Presario line uses more AMD chips, while H-P's Pavilion relies more
on Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and AMD have been battling to see who could be the first
to offer chips that break the gigahertz barrier, which is the
equivalent of 1,000 megahertz. Currently, the fastest PC processor
available is an 850-megahertz Athlon chip from AMD, but both
companies have demonstrated versions running at 1 GHz or more.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers refer to the clock speed of a processor, which is
the main chip in a personal computer. The clock speed indicates how
fast the processor manipulates data.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of processors has been roughly doubling every year.
Intel last February introduced Pentium III chips that ran at 500
MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-GHz goal was not expected to be reached until later this
year, in the late second or early third quarter. Analysts said the
acceleration of development can be directly attributed to the
competition between Intel and AMD, and the introduction last year
of AMD's powerful Athlon chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel has some real competition in the market now,'' said Van
Baker, director of consumer market research for Dataquest in San
Jose, Calif. ``It's a matter of bragging rights _ who's first on
the block with the fastest processor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Intel has scheduled an announcement for next week,
AMD may not be far behind. Drew Prairie, a spokesman at AMD's
Austin facility, said Thursday that ``our plans are to remain
competitive throughout the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that AMD is sticking by its earlier statements that
1-GHz Athlons will likely come at mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Howard High would not confirm the release date,
but said that once 1-GHz chips were launched, it would be a while
before they would be widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guesstimate that the stage when we hit general
availability will be in the third quarter of the year,'' High said.
</P>
<P>
   And early on, the gigahertz chips will probably cost buyers
gigabucks.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, of Dataquest, estimated that PCs using the chips will run
in the $2,500 to $3,500 range.
</P>
<P>
   He added that, other than avid computer gamers and others who
demand the fastest processors available, few users actually need
the power found in a 1-GHz chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in an era when the software just hasn't caught up
with hardware,'' Baker said. ``You can go out and buy a PC that
performs adequately for most people for $800 or $900. That was
unheard of a couple of years ago.''

 &HT;    The boy who came down from the mountain
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The village where Bautista Cruz was dying is so high his journey
to heaven would be very short.
</P>
<P>
   At more than 13,000 feet in the Bolivian Andes, there isn't a
lot of air to start with.
</P>
<P>
   But Bautista's lungs were being squeezed by a bowel obstruction
the size of a basketball. The obstruction would either rupture and
kill him or squeeze the last breath out of his lungs and kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Life is hard and short above the tree line, above the clouds. It
was 1996; Bautista was 6 and not likely to see 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Inca,'' Bautista said Thursday. ``My language is Quechua,
the language of the Inca.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses. ``Do you like Pokemon? I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista Cruz has come down from the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The trek began when a Franciscan nun visited his mountain
village. It ended in Jupiter, in the home of his adoptive mother, a
nurse anesthetist named Mary Kay Thomas. Until she met Bautista in
1996, she was a career single woman _ no kids, no husband, lots of
travel, free time, quiet evenings at home in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Then their paths crossed. Merged. They trek together from here
on out.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay Thomas has spent part of each of the last 15 years in
Bolivia. She and about 40 other doctors, nurses and medical
technicians with the MIMA foundation of Jupiter travel to the
mountains to perform surgery, treat smashed bones, infections, all
the maladies that kill people in poor countries. MIMA comes from
the Spanish word meaning to care for. Since 1995 they have focused
their attention on the high Andes of Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 visit, Franciscan nuns brought Bautista to the
MIMA clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this little boy, his stomach swollen beyond belief,''
says Thomas. ``It was obviously the end. Hirschprung's disease. The
nerves in the bowel don't work. The tissue isn't dead, but it
doesn't do its job. He had already undergone a few surgeries in
Bolivia, but it kept returning. He had to be treated in the States,
or die.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMA has performed more than 1,000 surgeries over the years.
Thomas had attended thousands more. A patient is a patient. She had
never brought one home.
</P>
<P>
   But she spoke Spanish. Bautista's doctors thought if the boy
came to the States for surgery he'd recuperate best if he lived
with someone who spoke Spanish. So after consulting with Bautista's
parents, who knew his choices were surgery or death, the MIMA
doctors took Bautista to Jupiter. St. Mary's and Good Samaritan
medical centers donated services. Two local surgeons, Gabriel
Zambrano and Ahmad Toufanian, donated their skills. Nurses,
doctors, hospitals. Everyone gave.
</P>
<P>
   They saved Bautista. And he went home with Thomas. Then
everybody realized they had missed an obvious consideration: There
was no way Bautista could lead a normal life back in his village.
The disease might return, his dietary needs could not be met. In
the United States he could live with his condition. In Bolivia he
would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents knew this,'' says Thomas. ``They knew their son
couldn't live in their village. His doctors knew it. I didn't see
where it was going. He started calling me mama. I started looking
at toys and boys clothes when I walked through the mall. My mother
said, `What have you gotten yourself into?' At the end of the
winter she said, `What are we going to do about Bautista?' She
didn't want to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista's mother, Basilia, had already lost three of her six
children to one ailment or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about adoption, all of us. Bautista's parents. Me.
Him,'' says Thomas. ``He's not an orphan, so everyone had to agree
on this. This was a new life for all concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista has taken to his new life. He's about as average as any
American 10-year old. Except for his mastery of four languages, a
good grasp of surgical procedures and a natural talent for telling
tales of the Inca and the Andes. He takes Irish step dancing
lessons. Likes soccer. Not sure about baseball. Doesn't watch much
TV. Has a big fat cat named K'acha, which means cute in his native
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption is moving along in spite of a few diplomatic snafus
here and there. Lost signatures. A visa and passport problem that's
keeping Bautista from accompanying Mary Kay to Bolivia on another
MIMA trip today. She and her MIMA colleagues are going for two
weeks. Bautista has visited his family on Mary Kay's previous
trips, but not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always go back to my village,'' he says. ``I have two
families. My brothers write letters. My sister is growing. My
father farms potatoes. I help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard enough for parents to watch a child go into surgery.
Bautista's parents watched him go in, and come out as a future
citizen of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for them,'' says Thomas. ``His mother had taken
care of him for years, with an illness that should have killed him.
She did what nobody thought was possible. She kept him alive. And
then said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is packing for the trip. She'll bring photos of Bautista,
his schoolwork and letters to his parents. She'll climb to where
the soil is rock and the wind never stops and Inca children die
young. She'll tell Bautista's mother and father their son is safe
and happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They entrusted their son to me. But it's going to work for
everyone. I love being a mother. I love my son.''
</P>

LOW PAY THE REAL ENEMY FOR MANY IN THE ARMED FORCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas _ Quotesha Austin is tired of being poor. It is
not what she expected as an Army wife.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Pfc. Gary Austin, spends his days training to
defend his country at sprawling Fort Hood, where he drives a
lumbering, tanklike vehicle called a Bradley. He is paid $1,171 a
month before taxes, a couple of hundred dollars in subsistence pay
and a housing subsidy that does not cover the rent for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That spells broke,'' Quotesha Austin says dryly. They can't
afford a car, and she can't find a job that pays enough to cover
day care for her two children.
</P>
<P>
   In November, she began collecting food stamps, and the Austins
joined the list of an estimated 12,000 military families who do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   More than $13 million in food stamps was redeemed last year in
military commissaries. There is no way to measure how many were
redeemed by military families in civilian supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Although food stamp recipients are less than 1 percent of the
nation's 1.4 million service members, the issue has embarrassed
some officials who claim to be supporters of the military and has
erupted as an emotional campaign topic for GOP presidential
hopefuls George W. Bush and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that it is an outrage that men and women who put
their lives on the line for their country must seek help to feed
their families.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Department of Defense has studied the food
stamp issue and dismissed it as too costly to fix in light of the
relatively small number of military families eligible for food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   But the military has another problem _ how to recruit and retain
good people during an era of plentiful jobs and a strong economy.
The Senate Armed Services Committee met recently to discuss the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates for better military pay point to a 13 percent gap
between overall military pay and that for comparable civilian jobs.
The defense-oriented Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments
believes the gap is exaggerated, but concludes that increasing pay
and benefits to some degree is a reasonable response to recruitment
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has ordered another study on its food
stamp families, the third since 1991. Defense spokeswoman Susan
Hansen said incremental pay raises scheduled through 2005 and a
proposed major boost in the housing allowance should help alleviate
cost-of-living problems for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we've seen in the past that the food stamp issue
is more a function of larger families for junior personnel than
other demographic groups,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Food stamp recipient Shauntrel Linton says her husband joined
the Army specifically because she was pregnant with their first
child. Her father was in the military, and they assumed joining the
Army would cover their young family's costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I thought he'd be making the same amount as my dad,''
Linton said.
</P>
<P>
   The military doesn't want to encourage people who are young and
at low levels in the military to have a lot of children, said
Steven Kosiak of the defense-oriented Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments. Although raising all military salaries costs
more than just taking care of the food stamp population, targeting
special financial consideration to potential food stamp recipients
creates the problem of different pay for the same work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having said that, nobody wants to think there are military
people who are so underpaid they are resorting to food stamps,''
Kosiak said. ``This is not an unsolvable problem, but it is
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Defense Department study, conducted in 1995, found that
59 percent of military food stamp recipients were living on the
base. Most of that group would not be eligible for food stamps, the
study speculated, if the agencies that administer them were able to
fully measure ``hidden compensation,'' such as on-post housing.
</P>
<P>
   Those conducting the study found that another 41 percent of
recipients were collecting food stamps even though they lived off
base and their housing allowances were calculated as part of their
gross pay. The study determined that of 4,900 food stamp families
living off base, only 1,100 should qualify for food stamps, based
on income and family size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjusting the military compensation system to account for the
4,900 members receiving food stamps and living off base with
above-average-size families would be complex, expensive, and we
believe, unwarranted,'' the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At the lowest end of the scale, an enlisted man or woman at the
pay grade of E-1 earns $1,005.49 per month in base pay. The largest
percentage of servicemen and women drawing food stamps are at the
slightly higher E-4 pay grade, which starts at $1,242.90 per month
for those with less than two years of service.
</P>
<P>
   The military got a 4.8 percent raise in January for every person
in uniform. Seventy-five percent of all service members will
receive another pay increase in July, although it's targeted to
midgrade and noncommissioned officers.
</P>
<P>
   The defense budget President Clinton has submitted for 2001
calls for another across-the-board pay raise of 3.7 percent, plus a
boost in the Basic Allowance for Housing allotted to families who
don't live on post. Incremental raises are planned through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But many military families barely noticed the raise in January,
in spite of claims from the Clinton administration that it was
``the largest military pay raise in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much gone,'' said Kim Garman, 31. Her husband,
Staff Sgt. Dale Garman, has been in the Army for nearly a decade
and soldiers like him at a pay grade of E-6 earn a monthly basic
pay of $1,932.60 before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   They live on post, which means they have no housing costs. Other
military families who live off the post (there's a waiting list for
base housing) receive a housing subsidy that varies by location in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Th% verage military family pays 19 percent of its rent out of
pocket, because the housing allowance frequently doesn't cover fair
market rent. But the housing allowance is worth hundreds of dollars
a month, depending on regional costs and the size of housing
required, and is not taxed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Money is pretty tight, Garman says, but she does think her
husband is compensated adequately _ with this caveat: ``Most
civilians who aren't familiar with the military think we get a lot
of things free. That's not the case. We don't get as much as they
think we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Their family income is low enough to qualify Garman and her
children for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants and Children known as WIC. Military families redeemed more
than $21 million in WIC vouchers in U.S. commissaries last year for
dietary supplements such as milk, cheese and infant formula.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent month, 14,245 clients received WIC vouchers in the
region surrounding Killeen, and slightly more than half of those
were Fort Hood military dependents. The county workers
administering the WIC program there joke that Fort Hood keeps them
in business.
</P>
<P>
   Though WIC vouchers are available to families that earn much
more than food stamp families (as much as $2,575 a month for a
family of four like the Garmans) it is designed to provide
supplements such as milk, cheese and infant formula for children
considered vulnerable to nutrition problems. That free formula
makes a big difference in the Garman household.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hundred dollars a month,'' Garman said. ``There's no
way we could pull that out of our paycheck. And diapers. It frees
us up to buy meat and vegetables _ the other things you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood provides financial counselors to help young servicemen
and women make the adjustment to military life and budgeting. At a
basic level, they advise families how much money they can afford to
spend for off-post housing. For those who arrive from out-of-state,
they include a lesson on the reality of utility costs during the
hot Texas summers.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Kelly Barcal says most of the financially strapped families
he counsels do not appear angry, only frustrated. ``We really
haven't dealt with a whole lot of people on food stamps,'' he said,
then was surprised to learn that about $250,000 in food stamps was
redeemed at Fort Hood commissaries last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the families we deal with, they're making it, but
they're barely making it,'' Barcal said.
</P>
<P>
   His own raise in January, he concedes, was only $38.50 a month
after taxes. ``The 4.8 percent looked like a real good deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soldier has to make up their own mind if they stay in or
not, or if they feel like they can make a better financial life for
themselves,'' Barcal said. ``That's totally up to that soldier and
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the highest levels of food stamp redemptions show up in
states with higher costs of living. The Defense Commissary Agency
reports Schofield Barracks in Hawaii leads the list with $1.4
million in food stamp redemptions last year and another $800,000 in
WIC vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Commissaries in Texas redeemed slightly more than $1 million in
food stamps last year, with Fort Bliss in El Paso heading the list
at $475,782 in redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a true picture because many are too proud to
accept food stamps, even though they are eligible,'' said Defense
Commissary Agency spokesperson Flo Dunn. ``Others don't want their
peers to see them use food stamps in the commissary, so they go off
post to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me to come and ask for help, no,'' said
Austin, the Fort Hood mother. ``As long as my children can eat.''

<P>
   In the 97 years since the Wright brothers made their first
flight, aviation has progressed to the point where an airline pilot
can now take off, push a button and sit back while the plane flies
to its destination and even lands by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have done such a good job of designing flight
computers, navigational equipment and autopilots that flying is by
far the safest form of travel. But the advances over the last 15
years have also energized a debate among designers and industrial
psychologists about how machines should relate to their human
operators. It is a concern that is expanding to other fields, like
medicine, where equipment is becoming increasingly complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``These technologies are not really purely reactive tools
anymore that you use to perform certain tasks,'' said Nadine P.
Sarter, a specialist in cognitive engineering at Ohio State
University. ``They are far more autonomous.'' She calls them
``independent machine agents'' because they can act on their own
based on programmed assumptions about the operator's desires in a
given circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of the best way to mate man and machine led Airbus
Industrie and Boeing Co., the only two makers of large passenger
jetliners, to adopt different philosophies when they designed the
cockpits of their latest airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting approaches in some ways reflect each
manufacturer's cultural origins. Airbus, which is a consortium of
European companies based in France, takes a paternalistic approach.
It places so-called hard limits on its pilots to protect them from
themselves. The airplane's computers do not allow the pilot to
pitch the plane too high or too low, to fly it too fast or to bank
it beyond a 67-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, perhaps reflecting an American cowboy spirit,
deliberately gives pilots the ability to risk destroying the plane
in order to save it. Computers tell pilots when they are
approaching the airplane's limits but it is left up to the captain
to decide whether to exceed them.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are quick to say that both approaches are safe.
But as fierce international rivals fighting each other for every
sale from the world's airlines, they are each equally quick to make
the case for the superiority of their own design.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Hutchins, a professor of cognitive science at the
University of California at San Diego, who has studied cockpit
safety issues for 10 years, says, ``The reality is more complex and
a lot more subtle than the way it has been discussed by the
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that accidents are so rare compared with the number
of miles jets fly and are caused by so many factors that it is
impossible to measure accurately which design is better. ``The
debate for me proceeds in the absence of empirical evidence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the two different approaches illustrate the knotty issues
facing researchers and designers in many fields. Highly automated
machines now administer drugs to hospital patients, produce
complicated semiconductors and operate power plants, transforming
technicians from machine operators into supervisory controllers.
How the human masters are kept ``in the loop'' so they know what
the machines are doing will ultimately affect hundreds of millions
of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the airline industry's safety record, several recent
crashes have shown that fatal mistakes still occur. Experts have
become increasingly concerned because the growth in air travel is
soaring while accidents rates have declined slowly in recent years.
If that trend continues, the number of accidents will rise.
</P>
<P>
   The low-hanging fruit in terms of aviation safety has now been
picked. Jet engines are highly reliable. Advanced navigational
tools means that planes rarely get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has undoubtedly improved safety, but it has also
created new problems. Today most commercial airplane accidents
occur not because of mechanical problems but because pilots become
confused.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 report by the Federal Aviation Administration expressed
concern that pilots were losing their basic flying skills because
they were depending so much on automation. ``It's a mixed
blessing,'' said Earl Wiener, professor emeritus at the University
of Miami, who was one of the first to sound a warning about the
perils of aviation automation. ``We see things we haven't seen
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the cockpits of all passenger jets were pretty
much the same. Pilots controlled the plane with a steering wheel
and column that was connected to a series of cables and pulleys
that moved the flaps on the wings and the elevators on the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1988 Airbus introduced its A320 twin-engine jet, which
replaced the cables with electronic signals routed through
computers, a system known as fly-by-wire that had been used on
fighter jets and the supersonic Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Having eliminated the cables, the pilot no longer needed the
leverage afforded by a wheel-and-column yoke to control the
airplane. Instead Airbus introduced a joystick on the side much
like the one used to play video games. Airbus pilots make the jets
climb, descend and bank with slight movements of the joystick,
while the jet's computers automatically adjust the elevators and
other control surfaces so that the plane flies smoothly on its
course.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Boeing introduced the 777, its first fly-by-wire jet.
But instead of using a joystick controller, Boeing decided to keep
the wheel-and-column design. Indeed, Boeing went to great lengths
to mimic the feel of the traditional mechanically controlled jets.
When the 777 slows, the yoke gets heavier, as if the pilot is
feeling the resistance on the plane's wings increase.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Airbus, Boeing also designed the cockpit so that the
mechanical levers, like the throttle, move even if the plane's
computers, not the pilots, are controlling them. After changing
course, pilots must also manually make adjustments, or trim, a
feature that is automatic in the Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this is to give pilots a system that they were
used to so they could draw on their experience and act intuitively
in an emergency. Another reason is to provide a variety of visual
and tactile cues so that pilots are aware of what the jet is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus says such feedback is unnecessary. Larry Rockliff, the
vice president for training at Airbus, likened it to having a
carriage return on a word processor. He also said that it created
the possibility that a mechanical error might give the pilot a
false cue, indicating that the plane was, say, accelerating when in
fact it was not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And he said the Airbus system was more consistent. For example,
if a pilot suddenly must avoid a collision, pulling back on the
joystick immediately instructs the Airbus to climb at the maximum
angle of 30 degrees. The pilot knows the jet will give that same
performance every time but will not allow the plane to pull up too
far, at an angle that would make it lose lift and stall or fall to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   He said Airbus thought the emphasis should be on adapting to a
new system that is superior, rather than relying on what he called
mechanical crutches.
</P>
<P>
   But John E. Cashman, Boeing's chief pilot, argues that the
Airbus system gives the machines too much control. The Boeing
cockpit always enables the pilot to override the airplane's
computers, taking advantage of a human being's unique ability to
sum up a new situation quickly and improvise, something computers
are not good at.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boeing cockpit, for instance, the controls begin to
vibrate to warn the pilot that the plane is about to stall. It is
up to the pilot to operate the plane at the ``outer edge of the
envelope'' but to take care not to cross it. This gives the pilot
the ability to use all of the plane's capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's there and they need it, we think the pilot should have
it,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Airbus design might have saved an American
Airlines Boeing 757 that crashed into a mountain ridge while trying
to land at Cali, Colombia, in 1995, killing 159 people. After the
airplane's warning system alerted the pilots that they were about
to hit terrain, they tried to climb as quickly as possible but but
were forced to ease back each time the control column began to
vibrate warning of a stall. In their haste, they forgot to retract
the airplane's speed brakes, which are flaps on the wings that made
climbing more difficult. The plane missed clearing the ridge by
about 250 feet.
</P>
<P>
   When a pilot pulls back on the joystick in the Airbus, the
plane's computers assume the pilot wants maximum aerodynamic
performance and automatically retract the speed brakes. A study by
American found that if the Cali-bound 757 had had its speed brakes
retracted and was flown at a constant angle just beneath the stall
point it would have gained about 300 more feet in elevation and
cleared the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Both the American pilots' union and Boeing dispute that
conclusion. In any case, there have also been crashes of Airbus
jets in which the Boeing cockpit design might have made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994 an Airbus A300 crashed in Japan, killing
264, after the pilot accidentally triggered the autopilot while the
plane was approaching for landing. The mistake sent the plane into
an emergency climb. Unaware of what was happening, the pilot tried
to compensate by pushing the plane's nose down. But the autopilot
countered by pitching the plane further up. The jet eventually
stalled and crashed. Japanese investigators noted that the
autopilot in Boeing cockpits automatically disengages if the pilot
exerts enough force on the control column.
</P>
<P>
   Automation researchers are loath to compare specific accidents
because each has so many distinct causes. (One study found that 25
major errors contributed to the Cali accident.) Instead, they are
focusing on the best ways for pilots to interact with computers so
that there are fewer breakdowns in communication like the one that
sent the Cali-bound jet off course toward the mountains without the
pilots realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   The principal challenge is how to alert the pilots to their
situation without overloading them with information, especially in
a crisis when they become highly focused. One approach is to try to
rely on as many human senses as possible to feed information to the
pilots in parallel channels _ like the moving levers in the Boeing
cockpit, which can be picked up easily in a pilot's peripheral
vision instead of requiring the focused attention of reading a
gauge.
</P>
<P>
   But a premium is also placed on simplicity. A recent study by
the Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilot union, found
that they could get ``more consistent and repeatable performance''
with the Airbus design. But the authors preferred the ``soft
limits'' of the Boeing design. They recommended that the two
manufacturers incorporate the best of both designs in their future
cockpits.
</P>
<P>
   Sarter says industry and safety agencies are asking more
questions of social scientists than there are answers. She contends
that researchers need to focus more on generic issues facing all
machines rather than on specific systems like a single model of
airplane. ``We are chasing technology,'' she said. ``It is
developing so quickly that by the time we get around to studying
one thing, the next thing is on the horizon.''

THE RISKS IN THE FED'S ASSAULT ON STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan can be clear as a bell when he wants
to be. Testifying before Congress last month, he left no doubt that
he intends to keep raising interest rates for as long as the wealth
being created by the stock market generates more demand than the
economy can satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he put investors on notice that monetary policy will
get tighter, he was unwilling or unable to address head-on the
quandary he faces: how to put a speed bump in front of Wall Street
without sending the entire economy into a skid, hurting workers who
own little if any stock while he hunts an enemy, inflation, that is
nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has been all but deified over the last few years,
rarely finds himself on the defensive. But his approach is puzzling
even some of his biggest fans, and if he miscalculates in raising
rates this year, his reputation, not to mention the nation's
prosperity, could take a beating.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for the Fed chairman to lay the blame for
inflationary pressures on Wall Street. Whatever the economic merits
of his position, making the stock market his bogeyman is less
politically incendiary in an election year than the traditional
central banker's warning that too many people are working and
earning good money.
</P>
<P>
   But having made the stock market the villain, he could have
trouble justifying interest rate increases that also skewer the
innocent. Is there any practical difference between raising rates
to curb the wealth effect and raising them to push up the
unemployment rate and subdue wage increases?
</P>
<P>
   When Greenspan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee,
Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., told Greenspan not to lose sight of the
fact that wage and price increases have remained remarkably
restrained, given the robust pace of growth. ``Don't become so
frightened by success that you throw wet blankets on a fire that
isn't burning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, suggested that
Greenspan consider raising margin requirements on investors who buy
stocks with borrowed money, as a way of reining in the stock market
without putting jobs and improved standards of living at risk.
``Isn't raising interest rates too blunt an instrument, a meat
cleaver rather than a scalpel?'' Schumer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in these pleas is that ownership of equities, although
far more common than in the past, remains relatively concentrated
among the wealthy. The Fed's most recent Survey of Consumer
Finances found that in 1998, 48.8 percent of households owned
stocks, either directly or through mutual funds and retirement
accounts _ a remarkable jump from 31.6 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among households earning $25,000 to $50,000 in 1998, those stock
holdings had a median value of $11,500. Among households earning
$100,000 or more, the median value of stock holdings was $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-M., cited the example of a high school
dropout he met recently who had finished a training program and
found work for the first time. ``This young fellow is far removed
from the wealth effect,'' Sarbanes said. ``If the activity and the
volatility is in the stock market, we may need to think of some way
to address that without slowing down the whole economy and
affecting the opportunities for these young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is far more attuned to the benefits of strong growth
than his critics acknowledge. He makes a solid case that the best
thing for Sarbanes' young dropout and others like him is to ensure
that the long expansion is not poisoned by an outbreak of
inflation. And there is no question that the economy's 6.9 percent
annual growth rate in the fourth quarter is far above anyone's
speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Greenspan is candid in saying that there are many
things about the fast-changing economy that even he does not fully
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable view is that Greenspan is still puzzling over how
to deal with the ways that lofty stock prices ripple through the
economy. The more skeptical view is that Greenspan, for all his
protestations that he is not aiming directly at stock prices, is
really doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released transcripts of policy meetings of the Fed during
1994, when it was raising rates repeatedly, show that Greenspan was
concerned even then that the equity market was in dangerously
speculative territory _ and that he quite consciously used rate
increases to send a chill through investors.
</P>
<P>
   He is no doubt equally eager now to take the froth out of the
markets. His challenge is to do it without draining the life out of
the best economy most of us will ever see.

CINCINNATI DOUBLES UP ON GRIFFEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune is part of the New York Times
Regional Newspaper Group.) 
 By DOUG FERNANDES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The scene could be a clubhouse anywhere.
Pittsburgh or Montreal or St. Louis. But this is the spring
training clubhouse at Ed Smith Stadium, and the two Griffeys are
discussing family.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., standing by one of his two lockers, is talking
to dad about his 6-year-old son, Trey. Ken Griffey Sr., pouring
salad dressing over a mound of lettuce, listens for a moment, then
responds.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is unremarkable, lasting just seconds. But what
transcends the words is the demeanor of the two men. They are
father and son, yes, but more than that, they are best friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds are counting on this bond, a son's love for
his dad, to pave over any unforeseen potholes. It's no secret
Griffey Jr. wasn't happy last year in Seattle. He hit .255 in
September, his focus was reaching 400 home runs, not the woebegone
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Junior finished with 48 homers, 134 RBI. What could he do
this season, relaxed and back home?
</P>
<P>
   Dad ponders the question, then smiles. ``Could be some strange
things happen,'' he said. ``But we'll wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ken Griffey Sr., the Reds' hitting coach, will be there for
every swing. He missed the media frenzy of Junior's arrival in
Sarasota. Dad was in the hospital having knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The anesthesia has long since worn off.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill of having his son aboard hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, it's still good,'' said dad. ``I'm still having fun with
it. As long as I can help teach, it doesn't make any difference who
it is. I know him a little better than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Sr. told the story of awaking at 2 a.m. one morning and
heading to the refrigerator to get a drink. There in front of the
door was somebody, unrecognizable to the Cincinnati outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   It was Junior. While dad had been away at spring training, son
had become a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just blew up,'' said Griffey Sr. ``One summer, he grew like
six inches and gained 25 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why mom, Alberta, always made sure to carry
Junior's birth certificate. No one believed a 12-year-old boy could
be that big. Maybe that's why Junior was intentionally walked
several times in high school with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared of him,'' said dad.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's interest in his son didn't lessen, even after Griffey Jr.
made the Mariners. He would call Seattle's clubhouse attendant
during the middle of a game. ``Tell Junior he's pulling off the
ball,'' dad would say into the phone. The attendant then would
relay the information to Junior.
</P>
<P>
   For no one knows Griffey Jr.'s swing better than Griffey Sr.
It's not hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who invented the swing,'' said dad. ``His swing
started to develop when he was about 7 or 8. Then we worked more on
thinking about what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's stroke is honey sweet. He swings down on the ball,
from top to bottom _ ``It's like I'm chopping down a tree,'' said
dad. Because he hits down on it, backspin is created. Junior's
essentially a line-drive hitter, aided by this intense movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you hit the ball 310 feet, and you got the backspin,
it's going to go 340,'' said dad. ``That's how his line drives are,
and they get a carry on them. He gets down through it and stays
above the ball and the ball carries.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Junior unleashes, his mental approach to hitting remains
uncomplicated. He doesn't guess pitch or location. He merely sees
the ball, then hits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get fooled much,'' said dad. ``He just looks for
the ball, in or out. He knows if it's away from him, he can hit it
out that way, and he knows if it's inside, he can pull it. That's
basically what I taught him as he came along.''
</P>
<P>
   One approach, two different players. That dad was a table-setter
for the Reds, a guy who got on base for Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan
and Tony Perez to knock in, while son is the table-clearer, means
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Sr. had to teach himself how to hit. His father left
when he was 2. His swing wasn't honed by roving hitting
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like him having a short cut,'' Griffey Sr. about his son.
``And I knew what to develop because I had to be mentally strong
about everything. So I knew if he was happy and he was mentally
strong about certain parts of his game, he could be untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the Reds are hoping.

MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR BANKRUPTCY BATTLE IN THAILAND HAS INVESTORS
WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ A bitter bankruptcy court struggle between
Thailand's largest corporate borrower and its creditors has
generated considerable uncertainty over the fate of billions of
dollars in unpaid loans in the country where the Asia financial
crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Thai Petrochemical Industry has been
talking with creditors over how to begin repaying $3.5 billion in
debts it defaulted on when the crisis struck. In late February, the
company balked at a deal that would leave its family owners in
charge but declare it insolvent. It was not insolvent, Thai
Petrochemical protested. Exasperated lenders, which include not
only Thailand's largest bank but the World Bank's International
Finance Corp. and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, petitioned
Thailand's fledgling bankruptcy court to let them take over the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Thursday it would decide March 15, but more than
the company's fate appears to hang on the outcome. As the dispute
escalated in February, foreign investors headed for the exits,
sending Thailand's benchmark stock index tumbling almost 20 percent
in February to four-month lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue here is debt restructuring,'' said Therapong
Vachirapong, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in Bangkok. ``People now
realize it's a bit more difficult than they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of investors' reaction is giving some economists a
sense of deja vu: only weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund
declared Thailand's financial crisis over and said that the
country's economy could expand by 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's banks have already restructured about 1 trillion
baht, or $26.4 billion, in loans, according to the central bank's
corporate debt restructuring advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the restructuring agreements have been largely
consensual. Now comes the hard part, analysts say. The problems at
Thai Petrochemical trouble investors not only because the company
is Thailand's largest corporate debtor, but because of what it may
mean for attempts to recover some of the 2 trillion baht in
nonperforming loans that remain and the more than 400 lawsuits to
recover them filed by creditors in Thailand's new bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about whether the court is going to work,''
said Donaldson Hartman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Petrochemical was established in 1978 by an ethnic Chinese
family of rice traders, the Leophairatanas. To this day, Prachai
Leophairatana remains the company's chief executive, overseeing a
plastics and gasoline business that turned the family members into
billionaires in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the baht in July 1997, however, nearly
doubled Thai Petrochemical's debt as measured in local currency.
Talks with creditors quickly degenerated into what has become a
bitter soap opera, as Prachai and the company's nearly 150 lenders
feud over how much ownership the family must surrender.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the two sides reached a tentative agreement
that, in exchange for $300 million to $400 million in accrued
interest, the company would give creditors a 30 percent stake and
reduce the family's stake to 40 percent from roughly 60 percent.
Prachai would retain control but if the company failed to meet
interest payments, lenders could raise their stake to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Prachai sought to change the terms. Creditors
refused and issued a January deadline for Prachai to agree to a
court-supervised restructuring deal or be taken to court
involuntarily. The company objected and a court hearing began
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the case highlights remaining weaknesses in
Thailand's bankruptcy and foreclosure laws. Though both laws were
strengthened after the financial crisis struck, the bankruptcy law
still contains problems inherent in the original version Thailand
adopted decades ago from Britain, according to Sutee Supanit, a law
professor at Bangkok's Thammasat University. Foremost among its
shortcomings, experts say, is that the creditor must prove a
company is insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Petrochemical's defense is that it is not insolvent: assets
exceed liabilities. Creditors dispute that interpretation, saying
the company has not paid debts in two years and is therefore
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   In English, both conditions fit the definition of insolvent. The
problem is that in the Thai legal lexicon, Sutee said, the word for
insolvent means liabilities that exceed a debtor's assets. An
inability to pay debts on time, on the other hand, is described by
a different Thai word that translates roughly into
``overindebtedness'' and is not provided for under the law.
</P>
<P>
   To decide in favor of Thai Petrochemical's lenders, Sutee said,
the judge hearing the case will have to expand the interpretation
of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has helped accelerate an exodus of foreign money
from Thailand's stock market. According to the Stock Exchange of
Thailand, foreigners pulled at least 9.7 billion baht out of the
market in February, more than in the previous three months
combined. &QL;

   LAREDO, Texas _ An elderly Rwandan clergyman accused of genocide
and other international war crimes will be extradited within a few
weeks, a federal official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a former pastor with the Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Rwanda, will soon be deported to the
Tanzanian-based international tribunal for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a matter of days or weeks, not months,'' said Robin
Croft, a State Department official who deals with war crimes
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would make Ntakirutimana, who is in his 70s, the
first person arrested on U.S. soil to face an international war
crimes trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ntakirutimana's lawyer nor his son, a medical doctor in
Laredo, could be reached for comment Friday. But in the past four
years of legal appeals, the senior Ntakirutimana has maintained his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor was first arrested here in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda charged that
in April 1994, the minister herded hundreds of refugees into his
church. Ntakirutimana then led a mob armed with machetes, grenades
and guns to massacre the refugees, according to charges filed by
the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana, a
Hutu, also is charged with being a fugitive of a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was released from jail here in late 1997 by a
judge citing the lack of a U.S. extradition treaty with Tanzania,
where he would face trial.
</P>
<P>
   But two months later, federal agents arrested him again, saying
they had found more evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark has said his client could not receive a fair
trial in Tanzania, because anyone testifying on Ntakirutimana's
behalf would suffer reprisals in Rwanda. His client's final avenue
of appeal was closed in January, when the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a
surrender warrant authorizing the extradition of the Rwandan man.
Croft said U.S. Marshals and a physician would transport the
prisoner from the Laredo jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana has been ill during much of his confinement in the
Webb County Detention Center. A condition affecting his esophagus
and throat often sent him to the jail infirmary.

&HT;     U.S. TO EXTRADITE MINISTER WANTED FOR GENOCIDE

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ An elderly Rwandan clergyman accused of genocide
and other international war crimes will be extradited within a few
weeks, a federal official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a former pastor with the Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Rwanda, will soon be deported to the
Tanzanian-based international tribunal for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a matter of days or weeks, not months,'' said Robin
Croft, a State Department official who deals with war crimes
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would make Ntakirutimana, who is in his 70s, the
first person arrested on U.S. soil to face an international war
crimes trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ntakirutimana's lawyer nor his son, a medical doctor in
Laredo, could be reached for comment Friday. But in the past four
years of legal appeals, the senior Ntakirutimana has maintained his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor was first arrested here in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda charged that
in April 1994, the minister herded hundreds of refugees into his
church. Ntakirutimana then led a mob armed with machetes, grenades
and guns to massacre the refugees, according to charges filed by
the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana, a
Hutu, also is charged with being a fugitive of a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was released from jail here in late 1997 by a
judge citing the lack of a U.S. extradition treaty with Tanzania,
where he would face trial.
</P>
<P>
   But two months later, federal agents arrested him again, saying
they had found more evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark has said his client could not receive a fair
trial in Tanzania, because anyone testifying on Ntakirutimana's
behalf would suffer reprisals in Rwanda. His client's final avenue
of appeal was closed in January, when the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a
surrender warrant authorizing the extradition of the Rwandan man.
Croft said U.S. Marshals and a physician would transport the
prisoner from the Laredo jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana has been ill during much of his confinement in the
Webb County Detention Center. A condition affecting his esophagus
and throat often sent him to the jail infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, jail administrator George Gonzalez said Ntakirutimana
appeared to be healthy on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was visiting with his family this morning. He seemed
fine,'' Gonzalez said.

 &HT;     BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE FOR WOMEN'S VOTE IN NEW YORK  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., battled Friday for the influential women's vote in the New
York presidential primar9, a contest McCain has said he must win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put McCain on the defensive with radio commercials accusing
him of voting to cut federal funds for two New York-based breast
cancer research programs. The two programs _ at New York University
Program in Women's Cancer and the North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health System's breast cancer program _ were among a list of $13
billion in projects that McCain's web site characterized as
``garden variety pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush highlighted the breast cancer issue by visiting a breast
cancer awareness program at Stony Brook Health Sciences Center on
Long Island. Long Island has one of the nation's highest rates of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters, ``I don't think the senator should be
squealing about pork and then squealing when somebody disagrees
with one of the cuts he wants to make.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 primaries on Super Tuesday when 56 percent of the
GOP convention delegates will be selected. New York will provide
101 of those delegates and McCain has said he must win the state in
order to offset his expected losses in California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, women are an influential swing constituency, with
recent elections showing that a successful candidate in New York
must garner the support of women.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki joined Bush at the Stony Brook
campus and complained that ``time and again, Sen. McCain has voted
against our interests.'' The governor said that what McCain called
``garden variety pork'' is instead ``important research funds to
help us beat cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded to Bush's criticism by citing his 18-year
congressional record of voting for breast cancer research. He also
touted his unsuccessful effort to levy taxeson the tobacco
industry that would have generated $50 billion in federal revenue _
some of it for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-cancer research projects sometimes are buried in
controversial appropriations measures approved by Congress that
also include treasured pet projects back home that critics dub
``pork barrel spending.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview on the Don ``Imus in the Morning'' radio
talk show, said the Bush campaign ad distorted his voting record on
breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've voted for it many times,'' McCain said, adding: ``It's
really an unfortunate part of American political campaigns when the
Bush people would pay for such an outrageous statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and former
congressman leading McCain's campaign here in New York, said the
Bush campaign had unfairly isolated two cancer programs among
nearly 800 so-called ``pork barrel'' spending projects that McCain
had criticized for inclusion in multi-billion dollar appropriations
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said McCain had opposed the measures not on merit but
because lawmakers had sneaked the spending into the final
legislation without scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said the Bush campaign
attacks on McCain's record were using a ``cheap trick'' of
isolating McCain's votes on legislative maneuvering to portray him
as an opponent of the spending.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no reference to the fact that his sister, Sandy
McCain Morgan, has been treated for breast cancer at Johns Hopkins
University. Morgan told Salon Magazine in a telephone interview
that her cancer was in remission and that she was ``very grateful
for my brother's support for breast cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to steer the campaign debate back to his own
insurgency message of ending the influence of special interests in
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery address in the Wall Street financial district, McCain
decried a mysterious, $2 million advertising blitz launched in New
York by a mysterious group calling itself ``Republicans for Clean
Air.'' The ad attacks his record on clean air environmental
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the ad, paid for by an unknown organization with a
post office box in Virginia, underscores the impact that special
interests can have in election campaigns using undisclosed,
unregulated soft money contributions to launch message ads without
formal ties to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain railed against ``big money _ from God knows where _ that
distorts the election'' and urged New Yorkers to ``send a message
back to the special interests that we're sick of your influence in
New York and in America and we want our government back.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Texas investor Sam Wyly, a prominent Bush supporter, was
identified as the sponsor of the ad. Bush denied there was a
connection between his campaign and the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's successful effort to put McCain on the defensive over his
record on breast cancer research could bolster the edge that Bush
already enjoys among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rolled up a 16 percentage point edge among women voters in
Virginia's Feb. 29 primary and a 14 percentage point advantage in
South Carolina's Feb. 19 contest, contributing to decisive
victories that rescued his then-faltering campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Michigan's Feb. 22 presidential primary where Bush lost
to McCain, Bush held down the margin of McCain's victory with the
help of women voters; Bush trailed McCain among women in Michigan
by 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ousted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in 1998, thanks in part to a 19-percentage point
edge among women. Republican Gov. George Pataki quelled a
Democratic challenge for a second term in 1998, with a 19
percentage point edge among women. Pataki was able to defeat
Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 when Cuomo's support
among women wavered.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton captured the state in 1992 and 1996 with a
substantial edge among women, holding a 35 percent edge among women
voters over Republican challenger Bob Dole in 1996 and a 24 point
edge among women voters in 1992 when he defeated President George
W. Bush.

   INDEPENDENT-ADS (Washington) _ Developing. A Texas businessman
who is one of Gov. George W. Bush's biggest campaign contributors
said Friday that he had paid for $2 million in television
commercials airing in New York and other primary states that
criticized Sen. John McCain and promoted Bush's record on clean
air. The businessman said he and his family had paid for the
advertising to draw attention to environmental issues. But McCain's
aides flatly accused the Bush campaign of being behind the
advertising. By Richard W. Stevenson and Clifford J. Levy.

   POLICE-CRIME-RATES (New York) _ With the city's stunning drop in
crime in the 1990s, many New Yorkers have come to assume that
aggressive police tactics and crime reductions are inextricably
linked. But a look at other cities around the nation suggests that
large reductions in crime can be achieved with less reliance on the
kinds of confrontational law enforcement measures New York has
used. Some cities, notably San Diego and Boston, have recorded as
big or even larger drops in violence through strategies that rely
on close cooperation between the police and the community. By Fox

MERRILL LYNCH TO HELP BORDERS SEEK WAYS TO BOOST ITS LAGGING
STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Borders Group Inc., one of the nation's leading booksellers,
said Friday that it had hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to explore steps
it might take to bolster its faltering stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory P. Josefowicz, the chief executive of the book chain,
said in a statement that the alternatives ``could include a
recapitalization, a leveraged buyout or a business combination with
another company.'' Analysts said they expected that stock buybacks
and perhaps a sale of part of the company's money-losing Internet
operation, Borders.com, would be high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has been trading in the low to mid teens,
down from more than $40 a share in mid-1998, despite several years
of matching or even beating analysts' earnings estimates. The
company is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter results Monday,
``and there's no reason to expect a downside surprise this time,
either,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Borders has some Wall Street fans. ``This is a misunderstood,
undervalued stock,'' said Donald I. Trott, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman who recently upgraded his recommendation on the
stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral.'' Although there are many lukewarm
``buy'' recommendations, ``no one's pounding the table saying you
must buy this stock,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Borders' stock woes, most analysts say, reflect investor
uncertainty over how well the chain can fare in an increasingly
dot-com world. The company's same-store sales, a prime barometer of
retail health, have been steadily increasing. In fact, several
analysts note that people who browse through book titles on the Web
are often driven into bookstores to learn more about interesting
titles. Still, Borders.com is losing enough money to pull the
company's overall profits down substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the country's largest book chain, sold half of
its dot.com operation to Bertelsmann _ for a sum that analysts said
was twice what it had invested _ and the two owners in turn sold 20
percent of the company to the public last spring. Thus, Barnes &AMP;
Noble has already reaped cash from its Internet foray and has
reduced the effect of online losses on the parent company's bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's stock, however, has not done well, either _ it
closed at $9.9375 a share Friday, well below the $40 it traded at
last spring. ``There's a general lack of interest in retail stocks,
and particularly in specialized retail categories,'' said Amy E.
Ryan, who follows Borders for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Borders' announcement seems to have cheered investors
somewhat. Borders shares rose $2.0625, to $14.9375, on the New York
Stock Exchange. ``Sometimes, just hiring an investment banker turns
into a self-fulfilling situation,'' Trott said.

CLINTON ORDERS SECURITY EVALUATION OF GOVERNMENT COMPUTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ President Clinton, reacting to public and
corporate alarm at massive, intentional Internet disruptions, on
Friday ordered a governmentwide study of federal computer system
security.
</P>
<P>
   In an executive memorandum, Clinton directed each federal
department and agency to review its computers against ``denial of
service attacks'' such as those directed at some of the busiest
Internet sites earlier this year. He named White House chief of
staff John Podesta to coordinate the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Internet disruptions highlight how important computer
networks have become to our daily lives and how vulnerabilities can
create risks for all _ including the federal government,'' Clinton
said in the order.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was issued as Clinton traveled to Silicon Valley to
speak to an Aspen Institute Forum on Communications and Society,
where his audience included executives from some targets of the
disruption, such as Yahoo. Such sites were bombarded with so many
hits that they crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised to order the government review after a White
House meeting last month with communication company executives,
academics and privacy experts. That followed his release in January
of the first National Plan for Information Systems Protection and
his call for $2 billion in federal spending on computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free because it
sparks innovation,'' Clinton told the conference. He said his memo
was a government attempt to ``lead by example.''
</P>
<P>
   One point of the review, he said, would be to ensure that
government computer systems are not used as conduits by outsiders
to attack systems in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also argued against overreaction: ``We must not
undermine freedom in the name of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, some data is ``so sensitive'' that it must be
protected from unauthorized dissemination. He mentioned medical
records, financial records and Internet communications between
parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about this,'' Clinton said. ``This is a big
deal to people. ... They are really concerned. They are afraid they
will have no place to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged high-tech communications firms to heighten their
self-policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have privacy policies you'd be glad to have reported in
the media?'' Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also touted his administration's effort to reduce the
``digital divide'' that he contends keeps some poor people and
minorities from sharing in the benefits of high-tech advances. The
president also pledged continued support for nanotechnology, the
work that allows information storage at an atomic or molecular
level.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if successful, the entire holdings of the Library
of Congress could be stored in the space of a sugar cube and cancer
could be detected when only a few cells had been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 30-minute speech at the headquarters of Novell, a
computer networking company, was a ``cover'' event to ensure that
the government will pay at least part of the expense of the
California leg of the president's weekend trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of the remainder of the day at three
Democratic fund-raising events expected to raise $1 million for the
party, much of it unregulated contributions known as ``soft
money,'' which has draw criticism from campaign-finance reformers.
</P>
<P>
   At his final event Friday night, Clinton was scheduled at a
private residence where 16 people, for a minimum contribution of
$50,000 a couple, were to nibble a fruit meringue dessert with the
president _ for an estimated total take of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit with daughter Chelsea, who is attending
Stanford University, before flying Saturday afternoon to Los
Angeles for two more Democratic fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Washington on Sunday, he will fly to Alabama
to participate in events marking the 35th anniversary of the
Selma-Montgomery civil rights march and the bloody confrontation of
demonstrators and local white law enforcement personnel.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ One known as the clown prince of Surrealism,
Salvador Dali (1905-1989) saw his muse as ``Paranoia,'' and he
painted her in 1935-36, a kitschy bust with a bosom deep in
Hollywood decolletage. Her fugitive face is composed of a
Leonardo-esque battle scene, with eyes formed by the rumps of
warriors' horses and the nose and mouth a twisted figure. The
setting is pure de Chirico (an artist from whom Dali freely
appropriated), a stagy floor of boards reaching back in long
perspective to the rocky seascape of Cadaques, Dali's home in
northern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paranoia'' is among some 60 Dali visions on view in ``Salvador
Dali's Optical Illusions'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum here. The show
is said to be the first Dali retrospective in this country in
nearly 60 years and the first devoted to his preoccupation with
optics and visual perception. But Dali goes way back with the
Wadsworth; in 1932, under its innovative director, Chick Austin, it
was the first museum in the world to purchase one of Dali's
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   This show, a clever repackaging of his work for a new
generation, was organized by the Wadsworth with an outside curator,
Dawn Ades, a Dali scholar who is professor of art history and
theory at the University of Essex in England. It has been
attracting large crowds, the biggest since the museum's exhibition
of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs in 1989. Viewers
seem intrigued by the images _ some haunting, some downright silly
_ and the optical challenges in the paintings, which were dismissed
as ``crossword puzzles'' by the Surrealist theorist Andre Breton
when Dali fell out of favor with the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paranoia'' is one of the simpler paintings done in what Dali
called his ``paranoiac-critical'' method, by which he meant the
replacement of so-called reality with an obsessional or delusional
reading of it. A madman's version, in his view, was as deserving of
attention as a more rational perception. Not that he himself was a
madman; he simply felt, he said, that the world of the inner self _
its dreams, reveries, fears and delusions _ should be rendered ``as
objectively evident as the exterior world of phenomenal reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief tool of the paranoiac-critical method was the double
or multiple image. Like those old childhood puzzles that challenge
you to find the gamboling lamb in the little girl's hair, its aim
was to make one image function simultaneously as another. In
``Paranoia'' the battle scene, viewed at a short distance from the
painting, reassembles itself into the muse's face.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier work, ``The Invisible Man'' (1929-32), contains the
first of the paranoiac double images, a gigantic seated hominid
constructed from landscape elements. His hair is a flow of golden
clouds, his head a pile of ruins; his hands and legs are formed by
the negative shapes around an Art Nouveau fountain that is closest
to the viewer. Other Dali-esque elements in the painting include a
woman's head that is also a jug, a gruesome ``family'' group and
two sexy women standing on the ledge of a classical building. They
represent Gala, Dali's adored, omnipresent wife and astute business
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides double imagery Dali was interested in more complicated
illusory strategies, like anamorphosis, an elongated distortion
that looks normal only when viewed from a certain perspective. The
best-known example of it is the crude apparition resembling a
whale's jaw that lies mysteriously on the floor in Hans Holbein's
elegant painting ``The Ambassadors'' (1533). When viewed from the
right of the painting at the level of its two subjects' heads, it
is decipherable as a skull.
</P>
<P>
   Dali's use of anamorphosis is seen at its eeriest in the 1933
painting ``Myself at the Age of 10 When I Was the Grasshopper's
Child (Castration Complex).'' Dressed in the sailor suit Dali used
as a symbol of himself when young, a boy sits before a table, his
enormously elongated, fishlike head stretched out on it. The table,
too, is grotesquely elongated, reaching toward a distant horizon to
end in a phallic cone.
</P>
<P>
   Although no grasshoppers are visible, the painting, as described
in its catalog entry, relates to Dali's phobia of these insects,
which in turn refers to a castration complex engendered by his
relationship with his father, which goes beyond that to the
repulsion caused by the insect's sudden movements from stillness to
action and its sliminess when crushed, which ultimately refers to
the pull between existence and annihilation _ well, you get the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Many negative things can be said about Dali. He was a terminal
publicity hound who courted public attention with outrageous
behavior and pronunciamentos. He was an aesthetic reactionary who
looked to the past while the 20th century soldiered on with
modernism. And he was an anti-democrat who expressed racist views,
made light of Hitler and _ though an early supporter of the
Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War _ accepted the Franco
regime, returning to Spain after the dictator's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was a virtuoso painter, with a keen interest in art
history and the sciences (particularly psychoanalysis). His
paintings of the 1920s and early '30s, before he turned to religion
as a subject, are sometimes dazzling. Among the best in the show
are smaller canvases, like ``The Phantom Cart'' (1933), a quiet
evocation of his childhood in the Pyrenees. It's a simple theme: a
cart, seen from the back, travels across a stretch of sugar-colored
sand toward a distant town, its two inhabitants blending with the
buildings as they remain individuals. A sparkling amphora fragment
lies in the foreground, a relic of the area's ancient
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   A far bolder and more powerful work is ``Soft Construction With
Boiled Beans: Premonition of Civil War'' (1936), in which a
Goya-inspired human monster rends its own body limb from limb. Its
positioning forms a grotesque rhombus through which appear an
incongruously bright sky and clouds. The ``boiled beans'' scattered
around the death-wracked monster refer to another Dali theme in
which a cannibalistic father bent on killing his son is distracted
by an offering of different food.
</P>
<P>
   But Dali's later works, often religious in imagery, tend to be
stiff and bombastic. Some seem painted merely in the interest of
visual games, like ``Gala's Christ'' (1978). It consists of two
canvases, similar but for slight changes in viewpoint and subject
matter; each presents a highly foreshortened view of a female body
lying on a cross that floats horizontally in midair. An angled
mirror placed between them gives a ``stereoscopic'' or
three-dimensional effect. Yet the painting itself is empty,
emotionally dead.
</P>
<P>
   Does this show reveal Dali as an artist of cosmic consequence?
No. But it does provide an intriguing new look the former
Surrealist poster boy whom the art world has long been used to
dissing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salvador Dali's Optical Illusions'' is at the Wadsworth
Atheneum, 600 Main St., Hartford, (860) 278-2670, through March 26.

NASCAR IS CALM ... FOR NOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Nev., Fla., Ala.)   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After watching General Motors' cars rebound at Rockingham, N.C.,
NASCAR plans no rule changes for Sunday's Winston Cup at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy teams in particular were vocal after Daytona, where Ford
dominated and appeared to have an advantage aerodynamically.
</P>
<P>
   After the Daytona 500, NASCAR took Dale Jarrett's Ford, Ward
Burton's Pontiac and Mike Skinner's Chevy to the wind tunnel for
tests. After the Dura Lube/K mart 400 in Rockingham, it ran tests
on Bobby Labonte's Pontiac, Dale Earnhardt's Chevy and Jarrett's
Ford to try and determine if any make has a built-in advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte won at Rockingham and Earnhardt finished second,
followed by Ward Burton and Tony Stewart, both in Pontiacs. Jarrett
finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition was much more balanced at Rockingham,'' said
Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations. ``It was what we
hoped to see at Daytona, but everybody knows Daytona and Talladega
are different.''
</P>
<P>
   The tracks in Daytona, Fla., and Talladega, Ala., are the only
one where restrictor plates are used on engines. The plates limit
the air-fuel mixture reaching the engine, cutting horsepower.
Aerodynamics are also important at Daytona and Talladega because
the tracks are steeply banked.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons and others, Daytona and Talladega cannot be
used as a gauge for what will happen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   While Fords swept the first five spots in the Daytona 500, a
Pontiac won Rockingham and three Pontiacs and a Chevy took the
first four spots.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett said he felt Chevy, Ford and Pontiac cares qualified
well and raced well at Daytona. He said Mark Martin and Rusty
Wallace were strong in their Fords and Bobby Labonte and Tony
Stewart ran well in Pontiacs. Overall, we were pleased with the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Wallace drive Fords; Labonte and Stewart Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be very interesting in Las Vegas,'' Triplett said.
``That's a place where, if somebody hits the setup, they can check
out on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett pointed out that Daytona presents special problems for
NASCAR, especially when new cars are being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ideal situation for us to go into our biggest race
of the year with so many unknowns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the alternative isn't much better. You don't want to
approve a new body style late in the year and give somebody an
advantage in the last few races when there's a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we constantly have to look at,'' Triplett
added.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Carsdirect.com 400 in Las Vegas begins at 2:30 p.m.
Eastern

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can art collecting itself be an art? If you doubt it,
see ``The Guennol Collection: Cabinet of Wonders'' at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Alastair Bradley and Edith Park Martin, who began collecting in
the late 1940s, were not artists in the strict sense of the word,
nor is their collection, strictly speaking, a work of art. But they
pursued their aesthetic interests like artists, with a refreshing
disregard for the usual categories of art history and an absolute
insistence on the primacy of personal response. A result is an
extremely diverse collection unified by a singular sensibility, a
kind of psychological double self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In naming the collection, the Martins used the Welsh word
gwennol (meaning martin, the bird in memory of their honeymoon in
Wales. Mr. Martin, a New York investor who has been a Brooklyn
Museum trustee since 1948, and Mrs. Martin, who died in 1986,
provided many works to the museum as gifts or as long-term loans.
This exhibition brings together for the first time their loans,
more than 40 gifts and works from the family's collection.
</P>
<P>
   That the 100-plus objects on display do seem to belong together
is amazing, for they represent almost all the earth's continents
and date from more than 5,000 years. To view the exhibition is to
leap freely through time and space _ from ancient Egypt to New York
modernism; from pre-Columbian to American folk art; from Africa to
Japan _ yet to feel one is always still in the same magical place.
</P>
<P>
   With its many carefully placed, mostly small, mostly
three-dimensional curiosities, the exhibition is like a walk-in box
by Joseph Cornell, one of whose dreamy yet rigorously formal
assemblages greets the visitor at the beginning of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary diversity, you don't have to look at
many pieces before you begin to understand the rules. You can see
that the Martins favored things formally compact (often small
enough to hold in your hand) and exquisitely refined, like a
graceful four-inch marble bowl encircled by the smoothly carved
heads and wings of ducks (from Egypt, circa 1938-1759 B.C.). They
also liked things imbued with a kind of primitive animation, like
the sweetly pensive head of a giraffe from a 19th-century American
carousel. And as in Albert Pinkham Ryder's painting ``The Lovers'
Boat,'' they were drawn to things fantastic or visionary.
</P>
<P>
   A top contender to best embody the spirit of the Guennol
collection is ``Leonine Goddess,'' a small sculpture thought to
have been made in southwestern Iran around 3000 B.C. Just over
three inches tall, this smooth carving in white limestone depicts a
lion with the body of a human weight lifter. With its finely
modeled head turned to one side, its beefy arms drawn close and its
fingers interlocked it radiates the relaxed potential strength of a
powerful athlete. It is at once a materially beautiful object and a
haunting mythic image. (Children might enjoy its resemblance to
certain contemporary superhero toys.)
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to learn that when the Martins lent ``Leonine
Goddess'' to the Brooklyn Museum in 1948, no one knew what it was.
Its exact identity still remains uncertain and yet it has been one
of the most widely reproduced works in the museum's collection, an
eloquent testimony to intuitions untainted by professional
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum curators who organized the exhibition, Diana
Fane and Amy G. Poster, have responded admirably to the
idiosyncratic variety of the collection. Conceiving the exhibition
as a ``Cabinet of Wonders'' _ a reference to the European
Wunderkammer of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which awe-inspiring
natural and artistic wonders were displayed _ they have not tried
to impose the usual art historical categories. Objects are grouped
thematically, but each group contains works of very different
origins.
</P>
<P>
   In a section called ``Collaborations Between Art and Nature,''
there is a miniature faux tree from 17th-century Germany made of
bright orange coral planted in a tiny gold pot and mounted on a bed
of purple amethyst. Sharing the case is a 19th-century American
folk artwork, a plaque in which a map of a town intricately inlaid
in wood embraces a found stone, which represents a pond while
suggesting a woman's ghostly profile. Such juxtapositions bring out
the unique qualities of each piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bestiary'' offers more similarity among objects, all
representations of animals. This section will appeal to the
viewer's inner child: there is a fat, blue, six-inch hippopotamus
from ancient Egypt; a playfully crouched celadon lion from Japan
with swirling mane and tail and a big grinning mouth; and a painted
wood sculpture of `` Frog and Toad Out for a Ride'' in a wooden
boat, by Oscar Peterson, an American folk artist.
</P>
<P>
   Where works resonate together most strikingly is in ``Between
Worlds.'' A ferocious, toothy woman by Willem de Kooning; a
maniacally grinning, pop-eyed bronze ``Head of a Guardian'' from
Japan; a Mexican folk sculpture of the skeletal figure of death
riding in a rough cart; and a rugged, simply carved gravestone by
the American folk artist William Edmondson together create a richly
uncanny, macabre atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The show's other categories are ``Object and Text,'' ``Royal and
Elite Patronage'' and ``Exotic Materials, Technical Virtuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine some politically minded critics objecting that
the Guennol Collection is ethnocentric: instead of explaining
artworks in terms of what they meant to their cultures, it
privileges the taste of acquisitive Westerners. It is true that the
Martins absorbed cultural expressions of all sorts into their own
world and put them to the service of their own self-expression. Yet
there is nothing self-aggrandizing about their enterprise and it
would be absurd to say that they erased the identity of any object.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely  &UR; because &LR;  they were so ruthlessly true to their own
instinctive susceptibility to the unique and the beautiful and
shrugged off the imperatives of any institutional agenda _
academic, political, moral _ that each object in the collection
retains its own distinctive character and radiates so arrestingly
its own sacred essence. It would be hard to imagine a more deeply
respectful approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guennol Collection: Cabinet of Wonders'' is at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,
(718) 638-5000, through May 7.

   WASHINGTON _ After a record-breaking four-year wait, Richard
Paez, one of California's most controversial federal judges, is
expected to be approved this week for a seat on the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution of his fate has not come easily. Last
November Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., held up a Senate vote on the
judicial nomination of a friend of Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., in order to force a vote on Paez, whose nomination
had blocked by conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Boxer has always been very interested in making sure Paez
got his chance,'' Boxer spokesman David Sandretti said Friday. He
said Paez has waited longer for a confirmation vote than any other
judicial appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Boxer's action, Lott relented and promised to
allow a vote on Paez by March 15, but only on the condition that
Boxer stop holding up the nomination of his friend Glenn
McCullough, the mayor of Tupelo, Miss., to the governing board of
the Tennessee Valley Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also cleared the way for a Senate floor vote on another
California nominee, Marsha L. Berzon, to the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, which covers California and eight other Western states.
Berzon's nomination has been pending for nearly two years.The
conservative Republican senators objected to Paez, a U.S. District
Court judge in Los Angeles, and Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer
specializing in federal appeals cases, saying that they are too
liberal. Berzon is also a member of the board of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty out there to cause me great concern,'' Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., said last week, adding that opposition to the
nominations was growing among GOP senators. However, backers of the
pair say they have the votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Paez's nomination also has drawn fire from a conservative
judicial watchdog organization. ``There's more opposition to Paez
than any judicial nomination outside the Supreme Court,'' said
Thomas J. Jipping, director of the Judicial Selection Monitoring
Project of the Free Congress Foundation, a Washington-based
conservative group.Jipping contended that Paez engages in
``judicial activism,'' refusing to fully enforce laws that he
disagrees with. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Jipping pointed to statements Paez made in a
1995 speech criticizing a 1994 ballot measure approved by the
voters that would have cut off nearly all social service benefits
to undocumented immigrants. That measure was later ruled
unconstitutional. He also criticized a measure that was about to go
on the 1996 ballot that ended affirmative action hiring, admissions
and contracting in state programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that speech, (Paez) also demonstrated his preference for
politics over judicial independence by actually calling for
lawsuits to force diversity in judicial appointments,'' Jipping
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats point out that both Berzon and Paez have
gained the support of several prominent Republicans, including
Hatch, who called Berzon one of the most qualified nominees he has
ever seen.``These are two extremely qualified candidates, and they
deserve a vote,'' Sandretti said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Democrats had showcased the stalled
nominations of Paez, a Latino, and Berzon, arguing that Senate
Republicans were slow in dealing with judicial nominees who were
female or members of minority groups. The Republicans denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic campaign led to Boxer's move last November to
take a political hostage of her own, blocking a Senate vote on
McCullough, who had been nominated by Clinton as a favor to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer invoked a Senate rule allowing an individual senator to
put a ``hold'' on a measure, blocking floor action on it.
</P>
<P>
   In their agreement Lott agreed to allow an eventual vote on the
two Californians, and Boxer agreed to let the Senate vote on
McCullough on Nov. 12. Later that evening, the Senate confirmed
McCullough's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Latino leaders applauded the agreement to push the nominations
to a floor vote and praised Boxer for her efforts on the
Californians' behalf. ``We're very excited these two qualified
individuals finally will get te chance they deserve,'' said Marisa
Demeo, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that it's taken this long, but better late than
never,'' she said.

`NOISE OF TIME': TO THE LAST SIGH: A DARK, DRAMATIC PORTRAIT OF
SHOSTAKOVICH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Britain, Russia) (See also NOISE-THEATER-REVIEW) 
(DW) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sense, every committed performance of a
Shostakovich string quartet is already a dramatic presentation.
This Russian master's 15 quartets are haunting and confounding
works, at once craftily composed scores and deeply personal
chapters of a musical memoir. So the idea of creating a multimedia
theatrical work to depict the life and times of Dmitri Shostakovich
that had as its core a performance of his searing final string
quartet from 1974 would seem to be fraught with potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable aspect of ``The Noise of Time,'' the
ambitious, amorphous theater piece receiving its world premiere
though Sunday at the John Jay College Theater, a collaboration
between the director Simon McBurney, who conceived it, the Theatre
de Complicite (the London-based company McBurney directs) and the
Emerson String Quartet, is the way the work succeeds in providing a
boldly theatrical frame for a performance of String Quartet No. 15
in E flat minor. ``The Noise of Time'' shatters the normal
protocols of concertgoing and compels the audience to experience
this discomforting music without intellectual defenses to protect
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The actual theater piece that provides a context for the
performance of the quartet, which uses taped readings of poetry,
letters and autobiographical materials as well as projected
photographs, film clips and four silent actors, is by turns
fascinating and exasperating. Presenting a clear, chronological
narrative is not the point here.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, you do not know that the cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich was one of Dmitri Shostakovich's most devoted younger
colleagues, it will take you time to realize that the comments of a
man identified as Slava are from Rostropovich.
</P>
<P>
   As its title implies, the work seeks to evoke not just the
composer but also the entire era he lived through. For example, a
powerful image is used to convey the effect of the 1942 radio
broadcast of Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, the ``Leningrad.''
After its premiere in the Soviet Union, a microfilm of the score
was sent to the United States. Toscanini conducted the work in a
live broadcast with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This bombastic
flawed symphony became a symbol of resistance to the Nazis. Here,
the image of lonely men bent over their home radios, lighted only
by the glow from the dials, poignantly captures the effect this
music must have had on the millions who heard it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noise of Time'' is so intentionally a mash of sounds and
imagery that when the piece turns in its last segment to the
performance of the quartet, you feel that finally something
concrete is happening. But the very chaos of the theatrical
experience makes us want, even need, to hear that music by that
point.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the players of the Emerson String Quartet
demonstrated their intense connection to Shostakovich's quartets
when they performed all 15 works in order in a remarkable series of
five concerts at Alice Tully Hall. Typically, fine ensemble work is
a benchmark of great string quartet playing: can the four musicians
play and think and breathe as one? But here, the violinists Philip
Setzer and Eugene Drucker, the violist Lawrence Dutton and the
cellist David Finckel emerge from separate corners of the stage,
playing in light barely bright enough to see.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly inexorable, quietly anguished modal music of the
opening Elegy employs the four instruments with daring independence
and in this theatrical context, as the players walk slowly about
the stage, we hear the music as four individual voices. Even to
someone who knows this score well, it was a revelatory listening
experience. The players perform whole stretches of the work from
memory and without benefit of eye cues.
</P>
<P>
   As the first movement proceeds, each of the four actors pairs up
with a musician. One of them sits opposite the cellist, Finckel,
staring intently, vanquished by the music. Another, engrossed in
the violist's printed score, sits on a chair reading it, entranced
as Dutton meekly looks over the actor's shoulder and plays the
music with mournful beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as the Elegy segues into the deceptively titled
Serenade, a fractured, slow dance of the soul, and then the
skittish figurations of the Intermezzo movement burst out of the
languidly lyrical lines, the four players come together and take
seats on a small platform. But they face not each other, as is
normal, but the audience. So we still experience them as four
individuals struggling to find common ground, and hear the music
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth movement is an oddly tranquil funeral march run
through only sporadically with the dotted-rhythm characteristic of
the genre. It leads to the weirdly shimmering harmonies and
tremulous sustained trills of the Epilogue. The Emerson played with
a bleak emotional honesty that was bearable only because their
mastery of the music assured us that someone was in control here
and we were safe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. REVIEW CAN END HERE.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the performance, when the stage darkened, the
audience remained utterly silent for a long while, until the house
lights came on and the ovation started. Whatever the strengths and
shortcomings of ``The Noise of Time'' as a multimedia theatrical
piece, it offers a chance to lose yourself in a musical work that
McBurney has aptly called ``a kind of prayer about the 20th
century.''

U.N. MISSION BEGGING FOR FUNDS TO KEEP KOSOVO FUNCTIONING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At the end of January, the director of
the U.N. government in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, suddenly rushed
off to Paris and Brussels. The reason, he explained in an interview
here, was insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 0.00 German marks in our bank account,'' Kouchner said,
exaggerating only slightly. The entire U.N. mission established to
administer Kosovo after the war last year was to run out of money
on Feb. 3 _ it requires $325 million this year to pay salaries for
workers, teachers and doctors, manage utilities and traffic lights,
and pay police officers and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The French came up with an emergency transfusion of $3 million,
the Americans helped, and the deadline was extended to Feb. 23,
officials say. Two weeks ago, at a meeting in Berlin, the
bankruptcy date was March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with some $16 million in the bank, that date has been
pushed to March 23. The same Western governments that belong to
NATO and fought the war over Kosovo are clearly reluctant to fund
the day-to-day operations of the protectorate they installed to
govern until local authority can be re-established.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absurd, humiliating and self-defeating way to run
anything, let alone a project that embodies the prestige of NATO
and the West,'' said a senior U.N. official who works for Kouchner.
``Running Kosovo is hard enough without running around the world
with a begging bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner himself is livid on the point. ``It's like being on a
drip, a resuscitation bottle for the whole society,'' said
Kouchner, a medical doctor who started Medicins sans Frontieres, or
Doctors without Borders. ``It keeps us barely alive month to month,
but only if we reduce the dosage to the minimum for survival, so we
don't collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kouchner and Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the military
commander of the NATO-led peacekeeping forces, will report to the
U.N. Security Council on the state of Kosovo. It is not expected to
be an easy ride. Moscow and Beijing are particularly critical of
NATO's management of Kosovo and its inability to prevent
interethnic violence and attempts at ethnic purging of the
remaining Serb, Gypsy and Muslim Slav populations.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt is nearly as annoyed as Kouchner over such criticism
and the ongoing problems with the mission. The difficulties of the
U.N.-led civilian side _ its inability to pay people, find enough
international police and prosecutors, jailers and judges _ means an
added burden on his troops, who are already tired of playing cop on
the beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for Bernard Kouchner is that he doesn't get the
money to pay for what he knows he needs and wants for Kosovo,''
Reinhardt said. ``But the international community _ the same
governments that decided to get us here _ doesn't give him what we
know he needs, and it has a direct impact on my soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials here explain that governments seem happier to fund
projects like post-war reconstruction. But governments do not like
to fund other governments. ``There's no glory in paying salaries,''
an official said. ``The defense and foreign ministers who backed
the war are not the finance and treasury ministers who have to fund
the peace or the interior ministers who have to provide the police.
They say, `Not my money. Not my policemen.'''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union in particular is very slow to get money
through the bureaucracy and into U.N. bank accounts, the officials
say. The Europeans have promised about $45 million for the budget
this year, but it has not arrived. They have also promised about
$340 million for reconstruction, a European commitment, but the
distribution of that money and the approval process for projects
have also been extremely slow, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The total budget for the U.N. government here, excluding state
enterprises like the electrical company and telephone service,
which should one day earn money when they start charging citizens
again, is about $240 million for this year. Including these state
enterprises, the budget is about $325 million. Earnings this year
from new customs duties, license fees and taxes that are being
progressively introduced are expected to total $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be an estimated budget gap this year of about
$120 million, and so far, governments have pledged about $90
million, still $30 million short. They have delivered only a tiny
fraction of what they have pledged, causing Kouchner to run around
the world begging for cash.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the sudden interethnic violence that began a month
ago in the divided town of Kosovoska Mitrovica has shaken Western
governments and allowed Kouchner to argue that the status quo is a
recipe for disaster. It has also allowed him to ask more urgently
for the promised international police and for more international
prosecutors and judges _ at least 26 _ given the clear intimidation
of local legal authorities by accused criminals and their apparent
difficulty with delivering ethnically unbiased decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, stung by criticism that there is no real system of
justice or deterrence in Kosovo, plans a new court _ to be headed
by international judges with local participation _ to deal with
crimes stemming from ethnic hatred and the war. Local judges and
prosecutors will deal with less sensitive, more ordinary crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But already in Mitrovica, one international judge left because
of difficult living and working conditions, and another quit but
has been convinced to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution authorizing the Western presence in Kosovo,
No. 1244, comes up for renewal in June. While Moscow and Beijing
are unlikely to veto continuing the mission, they are expected to
use the debate to urge closer consultation with Belgrade, which
still maintains formal sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, recently called the
situation in Kosovo ``very worrying,'' saying: ``Bernard Kouchner
and his team have done an admirable job. The situation is
difficult. I know there has been some criticism. But I believe
that, given what we inherited, he has done quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Washington and London wanted the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, not the United Nations, to run
Kosovo. U.N. officials here now complain that they had barely 10
days' notice that they would run the province, a compromise worked
out at the end of the war in the Security Council with Russia and
China, which were in effect negotiating for President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-Saxon dislike of the United Nations is one problem,
officials here concede, a dislike somewhat confirmed by Kouchner's
slow start. At the same time, one of his senior aides said, ``there
was no way to make a fast start without money or personnel, and
money covers over a lot of mistakes, but we didn't have that
luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner has also been criticized for spending too much time
negotiating with local politicians to win their cooperation in a
form of shared executive. But the aide said that ``With one-quarter
the authorized staff and one-tenth the necessary money, there was
no alternative'' to cooperation with the powers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Governments that promised officials, money, policemen and now
promise judges were very slow to respond. And until recently,
Kouchner was unable to pay salaries or pensions here _ simply low
stipends, not even monthly ones, that barely kept people alive.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, while local judges and lawyers are being paid about 300
German marks (about $165) a month by the United Nations,
international agencies like the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and aid agencies are able to pay local
translators at least 1,000 marks a month, or $555..
</P>
<P>
   There is also little money for garbage pickup, road repair and
other services that the Serbian state once provided, however
inefficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Money is crucial, Kouchner said, with a weary sigh. ``But
unfortunately we can't buy tolerance.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gay Democrats and Republicans _ in nearly a dozen states from
Massachusetts to Ohio, Georgia to Missouri and New York to
California _ head to the polls on Super Tuesday to make their
voices heard. These voices _ if loud and strong enough _ could make
a real difference in the upcoming presidential election.
 &HT;    ``In a close race, gay voters can be an important swing vote,''
says Sean Cahill, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute. Cahill is the author of a recently released publication,
``What's at Stake,'' a primer for the 2000 presidential elections.
 &HT;    Issues of concern to gay voters have been featured prominently
in both parties' presidential debates. Democrats Bill Bradely and
Vice President Al Gore favor lifting the ban on openly gay members
of the armed forces. Republican hopefuls Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain disagree and support the current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy ban.
 &HT;    The last two presidential elections demonstrated the growing
political clout of gay voters. At the national level 5 percent of
registered voters in the 1996 presidential election identified
themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to Voters New
Service exit polls.
 &HT;    In states such as New York and California the gay vote may be as
high as 10 percent.
 &HT;    According to exit polling data and the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, the gay vote was a key part of President Clinton's
electoral coalition in 1992 and 1996. Clinton received 72 percent
of the gay vote in 1992 and 66 percent 1996.
 &HT;    Gay voting trends can also be seen in the Republican Party.
 &HT;    ``More and more gay voters are backing Republicans,'' writes
Cahill. ``While only one-quarter of gay, lesbian or bisexual voters
(GLB) backed Republican Congressional candidates in 1992, by 1998
one third of GLB voters backed Republican House candidates.''
 &HT;    Heading into Super Tuesday, increasing numbers of gay voters _
particularly the gay Log Cabin Republicans _ are mobilized by the
insurgent candidacy of McCain. In a recent campaign speech in
Virginia Beach, Va., he called religious right leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell ``agents of intolerance. ''
 &HT;    Buoyed by his surprise victories in the New Hampshire and
Michigan primaries, McCain _ Vietnam War hero and self-described
``proud Reagan Republican '' _ appears poised to draw previously
disaffected Independents and even Democrats back into the voting
booth. Some of those voters will no doubt be gay.
 &HT;    There is no question McCain is the best choice for gay
Republicans. Despite the efforts of Log Cabin Republicans, the
G.O.P. has consistently positioned itself against any form of gay
civil-rights legislation.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, McCain met with the gay Log Cabin Republicans last
year and accepted more than $40,000 in campaign contributions.
 &HT;    ``I am unabashed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,'' he
told Log Cabin. ``There is no room for discrimination in the party
of Lincoln,'' McCain says.
 &HT;    Bush balked at the idea of meeting with gay Republican
leadership. Last fall on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush told Tim Russert
he would ``probably not'' meet with Log Cabin ``because it creates
a huge political scene.''
 &HT;    There's little comfort on McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' for
gays. Like Bush, he opposes federal hate crimes legislation, gay
and lesbian adoptions, same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships
as well as federal legislation banning employment discrimination
based on sexual orientation. In 1996 McCain voted against the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, a national employment
discrimination ban, which lost by a vote of 49-50.
 &HT;    Democrats offer a shining path of support for gay civil-rights.
Bradley and Gore are aggressively courting the gay community. When
it comes to gay voters' key issues _ hate violence,
anti-discrimination measures, parenting, adoption and foster care,
equality for same-sex relationships, health care and military
service _ the democratic contenders voice strong support for
equality and fairness.
 &HT;    ``If gay Americans can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department _ why can't
they serve openly in the military?'' Bradley says. ``It doesn't
make sense.''
 &HT;    ``I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on
the 'don't ask; don't tell' policy that President Harry Truman
brought about after World War II in integrating the military,''
Gore says.
 &HT;    Gay voters have countless good reasons to get to the polls and
vote on Tuesday.
 &HT;    ``The American public overwhelmingly supports our equal and fair
treatment,'' writes Cahill of the Task Force. ``This support has
increased markedly over the course of the 1990s.''
 &HT;    Let's keep that support on track and on the upswing by voting on
March 7. Swing this Super Tuesday.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    Some life stories are filled with such courage and determination
that they beckon to be told. Here is the simple tale of Shenique
Gilbert, a 17-year-old senior at Hallandale High School, a
sprawling urban campus between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
 &HT;    The mean streets of this South Florida city _ the violence, lack
of economic opportunities and low expectations _ have destroyed
many lives and prevented countless professional careers from taking
root. Most people agree only the smart, hardworking and very lucky
can successfully escape this environment.
 &HT;    Count Shenique among the smart and hardworking.
 &HT;    One of six children reared by a single mom, she has won a
$10,000 Horatio Alger Association scholarship. The scholarships are
given to 105 students nationwide who have overcome adversity and
have reached specific goals.
 &HT;    Alger, who died in 1899, wrote 100 best-selling books for boys.
The stories, such as ``Ragged Dick,'' ``Luck and Pluck'' and
``Tattered Tom,'' were about poor newsboys and other menial
laborers whose honesty and industry pushed them beyond adversity
and gained them economic success.
 &HT;    Indeed, adversity has been one of Shenique's constant
companions. Her father spent 10 years in prison, and her older
sister dropped out of high school. Her mother, Eddie Mae Ware, is a
devout Christian who has supported her children _ alone _ as a
house cleaner.
 &HT;    Drugs have been in Shenique's face all of her life, and
world-hardened brothers and sisters have tried to lure her away
from her dream of attending college and becoming a high school
history teacher.
 &HT;    But she has chosen to follow her dream.
 &HT;    In the fall, Shenique will attend Florida A&AMP;M University in
Tallahassee. She is president of Hallandale's student government, a
star in five sports and a scholar in the top 10 percent of her
class.
 &HT;    Shenique is not perfect, but try to find someone who has
anything negative to say about her.
 &HT;    Deidre Mobley, lead instructor for the school's Institute of
Business and Entrepreneurialship, said Shenique has more ``drive''
than any other student she has ever taught. The program is tough,
teaching students how to write resumes, how to dress and how to
venture into business with confidence and assertiveness. Each
student is carefully selected.
 &HT;    ``Shenique is out of this world,'' Mobley says. ``You don't see
this kind of motivation in most people her age. She will succeed
because of her positive attitude toward education. She looks toward
the future. When I first met her two years ago, she was quiet and
shy.
 &HT;    ``But she had a spark in her eyes, and she paid attention in
class. She has changed a lot. Now, she is outspoken. She takes
leadership both in class and out of class. I am very proud of her.
This is a tough two-year program.''
 &HT;    When asked to account for her bright future, Shenique does not
care if she is called a goody-goody.
 &HT;    ``I am doing well because of God, my mother and my family,'' she
says. ``All of my teachers, coaches and our principal help me. My
classmates are real supportive. My mother, though, is my role
model. She works hard and takes care of us. She motivates me, and
the rest of my family motivate me. They are depending on me to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``I will be the first one in my family to attend college. I'm a
good basketball player, and I hope to get a basketball scholarship,
too. I want to succeed for me and for them. After I finish college,
I want to come back here and teach history and own a business.''
 &HT;    In May, when Horatio Alger scholarship winners travel to
Washington, D.C., Shenique will be there, too. She and her peers
will spend a week visiting the Smithsonian Institution, touring the
Capitol and listening to some of the nation's political leaders,
including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who will deliver a
special motivational speech.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, she will continue to study, run the student
government, play sports, help her mother clean their home and keep
her three siblings still living at home out of trouble.

THE DIALLO CASE: A QUESTION OF RACE

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    My more than 40 years as a journalist cushioned me from the
shock of learning that four black jurors joined eight white jurors
in a not-guilty verdict for the four New York City police officers
who, on Feb. 4, 1999, fired 41 rounds at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
22-year-old black man from West Africa, striking him 19 times.
 &HT;    Diallo's only crime was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
home.
 &HT;    Unlike many of my younger friends, I did not predict a hung jury
simply because there were four black women on the panel. I was
prepared for anything, because I've grown to understand a lot about
contradictory ``black responses'' that might confound the best of
America's social critics.
 &HT;    However, I was indeed stunned when, on Feb. 22, I heard two of
the black jurors say in a television interview that race never came
up during the 21 hours of jury deliberations.
 &HT;    How could race have been so consciously ignored? Surely the
frequently debated issue of ``racial profiling'' might have been
introduced at some point.
 &HT;    The verdict makes me question many things:
 &HT;    Would Diallo have been shot down so quickly and mercilessly in
his doorway if he had presented the typical ``boy next door'' image
_ like that of the blond, young, white gentleman who was convicted
of blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City? Would Diallo
have fared better if he resembled the Columbine High School killers
_ also white _ instead of exposing a dark round face, a broad nose
and a fuzzy mustache over thick lips?
 &HT;    Doesn't Diallo's face resemble the countenance of thousands of
innocent young black men across America who are suspect in the
minds of cops? Henceforth, must they quiver in their doorways every
time a car loaded with plainclothes cops drives by at night with
the power to harass them, possibly kill them and go unpunished?
 &HT;    Since all sides agreed that Diallo was not being sought for any
crime, why didn't the jury find some of his slayers guilty of at
least one of the six charges against them, such as criminally
negligent homicide?
 &HT;    Over the years, I've observed a noteworthy thought pattern among
some African-Americans that may apply here: Some will bend over
backward to prove they are not biased. Others will voluntarily
ignore a sound judgment derived from their own remarkable social
histories. Instead, they elect to view the world through lenses
fashioned by whites.
 &HT;    Initially the defense team tried to remove three of the four
black women from jury consideration because of their race. The four
black jurors successfully proved the defense wrong.
 &HT;    Then there was the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, a
black man who appeared so eager to be fair-minded that he didn't
appoint a single black lawyer to the prosecution team in a case
which arose in a borough that is 77 percent black.
 &HT;    Yet race mattered from the trial's outset: The proceedings were
moved from the Bronx, a largely black neighborhood, to upstate
Albany, which is mostly white. The cautious prosecution team even
declined to refer to racial prejudice as a serious factor in police
conduct.
 &HT;    Finally, Justice Joseph C. Teresi told the jury to walk in the
shoes of the four white cops on the night of the Diallo slaying.
Consequently the question of race became a non sequitur, even
though according to Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general,
blacks constitute 62.7 percent of people stopped by the NYPD Street
Crime Unit to which the defendants belonged _ a unit that stopped
blacks 23 percent more times than whites.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, the judge did not ask the jurors to place
themselves in Diallo's shoes in those moments before his quick,
unexpected execution.
 &HT;    Let's not forget that Amadou Diallo was the only fatality on
that February night in the Bronx when four cops acted out their
unit's slogan: ``We own the night.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gay Democrats and Republicans _ in nearly a dozen states from
Massachusetts to Ohio, Georgia to Missouri and New York to
California _ head to the polls on Super Tuesday to make their
voices heard. These voices _ if loud and strong enough _ could make
a real difference in the upcoming presidential election.
 &HT;    ``In a close race, gay voters can be an important swing vote,''
says Sean Cahill, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute. Cahill is the author of a recently released publication,
``What's at Stake,'' a primer for the 2000 presidential elections.
 &HT;    Issues of concern to gay voters have been featured prominently
in both parties' presidential debates. Democrats Bill Bradely and
Vice President Al Gore favor lifting the ban on openly gay members
of the armed forces. Republican hopefuls Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain disagree and support the current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy ban.
 &HT;    The last two presidential elections demonstrated the growing
political clout of gay voters. At the national level 5 percent of
registered voters in the 1996 presidential election identified
themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to Voters New
Service exit polls.
 &HT;    In states such as New York and California the gay vote may be as
high as 10 percent.
 &HT;    According to exit polling data and the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, the gay vote was a key part of President Clinton's
electoral coalition in 1992 and 1996. Clinton received 72 percent
of the gay vote in 1992 and 66 percent 1996.
 &HT;    Gay voting trends can also be seen in the Republican Party.
 &HT;    ``More and more gay voters are backing Republicans,'' writes
Cahill. ``While only one-quarter of gay, lesbian or bisexual voters
(GLB) backed Republican Congressional candidates in 1992, by 1998
one third of GLB voters backed Republican House candidates.''
 &HT;    Heading into Super Tuesday, increasing numbers of gay voters _
particularly the gay Log Cabin Republicans _ are mobilized by the
insurgent candidacy of McCain. In a recent campaign speech in
Virginia Beach, Va., he called religious right leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell ``agents of intolerance. ''
 &HT;    Buoyed by his surprise victories in the New Hampshire and
Michigan primaries, McCain _ Vietnam War hero and self-described
``proud Reagan Republican '' _ appears poised to draw previously
disaffected Independents and even Democrats back into the voting
booth. Some of those voters will no doubt be gay.
 &HT;    There is no question McCain is the best choice for gay
Republicans. Despite the efforts of Log Cabin Republicans, the
G.O.P. has consistently positioned itself against any form of gay
civil-rights legislation.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, McCain met with the gay Log Cabin Republicans last
year and accepted more than $40,000 in campaign contributions.
 &HT;    ``I am unabashed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,'' he
told Log Cabin. ``There is no room for discrimination in the party
of Lincoln,'' McCain says.
 &HT;    Bush balked at the idea of meeting with gay Republican
leadership. Last fall on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush told Tim Russert
he would ``probably not'' meet with Log Cabin ``because it creates
a huge political scene.''
 &HT;    There's little comfort on McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' for
gays. Like Bush, he opposes federal hate crimes legislation, gay
and lesbian adoptions, same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships
as well as federal legislation banning employment discrimination
based on sexual orientation. In 1996 McCain voted against the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, a national employment
discrimination ban, which lost by a vote of 49-50.
 &HT;    Democrats offer a shining path of support for gay civil-rights.
Bradley and Gore are aggressively courting the gay community. When
it comes to gay voters' key issues _ hate violence,
anti-discrimination measures, parenting, adoption and foster care,
equality for same-sex relationships, health care and military
service _ the democratic contenders voice strong support for
equality and fairness.
 &HT;    ``If gay Americans can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department _ why can't
they serve openly in the military?'' Bradley says. ``It doesn't
make sense.''
 &HT;    ``I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on
the 'don't ask; don't tell' policy that President Harry Truman
brought about after World War II in integrating the military,''
Gore says.
 &HT;    Gay voters have countless good reasons to get to the polls and
vote on Tuesday.
 &HT;    ``The American public overwhelmingly supports our equal and fair
treatment,'' writes Cahill of the Task Force. ``This support has
increased markedly over the course of the 1990s.''
 &HT;    Let's keep that support on track and on the upswing by voting on
March 7. Swing this Super Tuesday.

 &HT;    My more than 40 years as a journalist cushioned me from the
shock of learning that four black jurors joined eight white jurors
in a not-guilty verdict for the four New York City police officers
who, on Feb. 4, 1999, fired 41 rounds at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
22-year-old black man from West Africa, striking him 19 times.
 &HT;    Diallo's only crime was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
home.
 &HT;    Unlike many of my younger friends, I did not predict a hung jury
simply because there were four black women on the panel. I was
prepared for anything, because I've grown to understand a lot about
contradictory ``black responses'' that might confound the best of
America's social critics.
 &HT;    However, I was indeed stunned when, on Feb. 22, I heard two of
the black jurors say in a television interview that race never came
up during the 21 hours of jury deliberations.
 &HT;    How could race have been so consciously ignored? Surely the
frequently debated issue of ``racial profiling'' might have been
introduced at some point.
 &HT;    The verdict makes me question many things:
 &HT;    Would Diallo have been shot down so quickly and mercilessly in
his doorway if he had presented the typical ``boy next door'' image
_ like that of the blond, young, white gentleman who was convicted
of blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City? Would Diallo
have fared better if he resembled the Columbine High School killers
_ also white _ instead of exposing a dark round face, a broad nose
and a fuzzy mustache over thick lips?
 &HT;    Doesn't Diallo's face resemble the countenance of thousands of
innocent young black men across America who are suspect in the
minds of cops? Henceforth, must they quiver in their doorways every
time a car loaded with plainclothes cops drives by at night with
the power to harass them, possibly kill them and go unpunished?
 &HT;    Since all sides agreed that Diallo was not being sought for any
crime, why didn't the jury find some of his slayers guilty of at
least one of the six charges against them, such as criminally
negligent homicide?
 &HT;    Over the years, I've observed a noteworthy thought pattern among
some African-Americans that may apply here: Some will bend over
backward to prove they are not biased. Others will voluntarily
ignore a sound judgment derived from their own remarkable social
histories. Instead, they elect to view the world through lenses
fashioned by whites.
 &HT;    Initially the defense team tried to remove three of the four
black women from jury consideration because of their race. The four
black jurors successfully proved the defense wrong.
 &HT;    Then there was the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, a
black man who appeared so eager to be fair-minded that he didn't
appoint a single black lawyer to the prosecution team in a case
which arose in a borough that is 77 percent black.
 &HT;    Yet race mattered from the trial's outset: The proceedings were
moved from the Bronx, a largely black neighborhood, to upstate
Albany, which is mostly white. The cautious prosecution team even
declined to refer to racial prejudice as a serious factor in police
conduct.
 &HT;    Finally, Justice Joseph C. Teresi told the jury to walk in the
shoes of the four white cops on the night of the Diallo slaying.
Consequently the question of race became a non sequitur, even
though according to Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general,
blacks constitute 62.7 percent of people stopped by the NYPD Street
Crime Unit to which the defendants belonged _ a unit that stopped
blacks 23 percent more times than whites.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, the judge did not ask the jurors to place
themselves in Diallo's shoes in those moments before his quick,
unexpected execution.
 &HT;    Let's not forget that Amadou Diallo was the only fatality on
that February night in the Bronx when four cops acted out their
unit's slogan: ``We own the night.''

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    Blacks are being ignored in the 2000 presidential race by both
major parties.
 &HT;    February may have been Black History Month in America, but not
on the campaign trail. Until now, African-Americans could count on
politicians at least feigning interest in our issues once every
four years. But as we enter the 21st century, with the economic
disparity between African-Americans and other citizens looming as
large as ever, I wonder why we are seeing a Y2K ``blackout'' on the
issues of greatest importance to our community.
 &HT;    According to the League of Women Voters, Ambassador Alan Keyes,
the only African-American in the race, is the only one with a
statement on affirmative action. Keyes, of course, is against it.
 &HT;    Only Sen. John McCain has a position paper on work-family
issues, another area of interest for many African-American voters.
 &HT;    And only former Sen. Bill Bradley has a statement on civil
rights issues _ although with the primary in South Carolina fast
approaching, he forcefully attacked racial prejudice and called for
the state to stop flying the Confederate battle flag above its
Capitol. Trailing Gore in the polls, Bradley apparently hopes South
Carolina's large black population will rescue him; his sudden
attention reeks of pandering.
 &HT;    Perhaps the Democrats think the black vote is a fait accompli.
In the last three presidential elections, nearly nine out of 10
African-Americans had voted Democratic.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Republicans are busy courting the Latino vote. For
the first time, Latino voters are being blitzed with a
multimillion-dollar bilingual ad campaign launched by the
Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    In 1996, 44 percent of Latinos voted, compared with 53 percent
of African-Americans and 60 percent of white voters, according to
Census Bureau data.
 &HT;    Yet the popularly held theory is that whoever wins the Latino
vote in California will win the presidency. And 40 percent of new
voters in California are Latino.
 &HT;    Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson has been conspicuously absent this
election season. In past elections, we could count on him to be an
outspoken player and advocate for our issues, regardless of whether
he was running. But this time it seems he has also abandoned us in
party politics.
 &HT;    The Associated Press reported that Jackson and his son Jesse
Jackson Jr. (D.-Ill.) are withholding endorsements in exchange for
a Democratic presidential candidate's promise to support a third
Chicago-area airport near the younger Jackson's district.
 &HT;    That leaves African-Americans in a political black hole, as
candidates scramble for other voters of color to get them over the
hump. Once catered to and wooed _ at least at election time _
African-Americans are, for the most part, being ignored. We are
out; Latinos are in.
 &HT;    This new form of neglect comes at a time when African-Americans
still experience unequal opportunities, despite state and federal
legislation. A digital divide looms between white people and people
of color: Only five African-Americans and one Latino sit on the
boards of companies in Silicon Valley, according to a 1999 survey
by the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    Taxicabs still often refuse to stop for African-American men.
Racial profiling by police abounds as we drive, shop and live.
 &HT;    Employment discrimination is widespread, including in the arts.
On television, actors of color remain virtually absent despite
agreements last year between the NAACP and several networks to
increase the involvement of people of color in front of the camera
and behind the scenes.
 &HT;    In the past five years, while much of America has been riding a
wave of Silicon Valley-inspired prosperity, a University of
Michigan study found that the average African-American household's
net worth decreased from $8,400 to $7,500.
 &HT;    By contrast, the net worth of the median American household
increased 9 percent, to $59,000.
 &HT;    In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. said African-Americans were living ``on a lonely island of
poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.''
 &HT;    Thirty-seven years after King's speech, it seems we are still on
that lonely island. Given the extraordinarily slow rate of
progress, all presidential candidates should be addressing the
issues and proposing solutions. But they aren't.
 &HT;    If King's dream is to become a reality, America needs
leadership. And leadership begins with presidential candidates who
must acknowledge the concerns of African-Americans and propose
solutions in their platforms. The only way to end a ``blackout'' is
to shed light on the issues.

 By MARK DAVIS  
 &HT;    A recent federal tally counted 157 online brokers competing for
your business. In this crowded marketplace, don't be too surprised
or impressed if a brokerage claims to be the No. 1 firm. The
Internet is flush with online broker rankings and hardly any two
agree.
 &HT;    According to Gomez Advisors Inc., the best-known judge of online
services, Charles Schwab earns the best overall ranking. But even
Gomez (at www.Gomez.com) hedges its bet. It also issues four other
top rankings that emphasize features such as cost and planning
tools.
 &HT;    When choosing a broker, look for a ranking that emphasizes the
features that matter to you. For example, Gomez Advisors calls
Schwab the best site for a ``One-Stop Shopper.'' But the same site
ranked 10th on the list for a ``Hyper-Active Trader.''
 &HT;    Other sites rank trading sites with different systems, but let's
start with the one factor they all share _ price. Even the most
expensive online brokers charge commissions that are a fraction of
what full-service brokers charge. And if you want any brokerage
firm's lowest commission, including a discount broker's cheapest
turn, you will have to open an account online.
 &HT;    After prices dropped dramatically in the early years of online
brokering, the commissions among the 10 largest online brokers now
hover at just under $16 a trade, according to averages calculated
by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
 &HT;    However, that average masks a considerable range. A trade at
Brown &AMP; Co. can cost as little as $5. A similar transaction would
cost $8, $9.99, $12, $14.95, $20, or $29.95 at other sites,
according to a comparison by Fortune magazine.
 &HT;    The real-market cost of a trade gets more complicated than just
a flat price. For starters, the price varies depending on what type
of order you use. That $5 Brown trade, for example, is for a market
order, the simplest type of transaction. Limit orders and other
strategic techniques often cost more.
 &HT;    The most popular sites go beyond handling transactions. They
offer online big payment services, financial planning, market
research, securities analyses and personal-finance software. In
fact, Schwab is currently the biggest online broker in terms of
market share, but at $29.95 per trade, it's also one of the
costliest.
 &HT;    A cheaper choice would be Firstrade Securities Inc., which will
execute the same order as Schwab for only $6.95.
 &HT;    Firstrade scored a perfect 10 in the most recent ``overall
cost'' comparisons by Gomez Advisors.
 &HT;    But focusing so much on price sacrifices the features and
convenience that drive people to trade online in the first place. A
look at the eight most popular online brokers _ Schwab, E*Trade,
 &HT;    Waterhouse Securities, Datek Online, Fidelity Investments,
Ameritrade, DLJ Direct and Discover Brokerage Direct _ shows no
correlation to prices, which start at Ameritrade with $8 per trade.
 &HT;    As a rule, expect no hand-holding at the less-expensive firms.
 &HT;    ``They're extremely nonservice-oriented,'' says Mark Lynch, a
Firstrade customer in Kansas who switched from Schwab over the
price issue. ``You just buy and sell stocks through them.''
 &HT;    The downside of trading online includes system crashes, software
glitches and trying to climb the learning curve while making
big-money trades.
 &HT;    In general, the pricier sites earn credit for being dependable
and having all those brokers to take calls when things break down.
 &HT;    The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that customers
complain most often about not being able to access their accounts.
Also prominent have been complaints that orders were delayed or
were not processed, or that errors occurred in processing them.
 &HT;    Depending on the financial context of your investments, one
botched trade by your brokerage firm could jeopardize any
cost-savings you achieved in low transaction fees.
 &HT;    Regulators found that one of the problems with delays is a
misconception by online customers that they're directly connected
to the stock market. Because most orders are confirmed almost
immediately, they assume it really works that way.
 &HT;    But trading online is fundamentally the same as visiting your
broker's office or calling to place an order on the telephone. The
customer still makes the order, and a licensed broker must execute
it. The distinction is that online brokers let you deliver the
order over the Internet which usually means your order reaches the
floor faster and more efficiently.

CHECHEN FAMILIES RETURN UNDER PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia _ The Russians told them they would be
safe. But then Khabikha Astamirova and her family awoke to find a
large group of separatist fighters occupying her village of
Katyr-Yurt, about 15 miles southwest of Chechnya's capital of
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   It was Feb. 5. Within a few hours, before Astamirova and other
civilians could leave, Russian planes and tanks began a three-day
bombardment of Katyr-Yurt. When it was over, the Chechen fighters
were gone, most having escaped to the mountains in the south. All
that was left of Katyr-Yurt was a wasteland of smoking ruins and
dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Astamirova took her two young children and fled Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as they sat in a bus headed home, Astamirova
confronted the questions faced by more than 200,000 Chechen
refugees. Is the fighting really over, as the Russian generals say?
And is it safe to return?
</P>
<P>
   The people on Astamirova's bus had little reason to think so.
The death of as many as 37 Russian paramilitary troops in a rebel
ambush in Grozny Thursday has put the lie to the generals'
assurances that the separatists have been swept out of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia seized Grozny several weeks ago, the government said
the rebels controlled only a small area in the mountains to the
south. But a rebel commander said Friday that the ambush signals
the beginning of a protracted guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, Chechen civilians say, they could become the
targets of reprisal by Russian forces, who have vowed to intensify
security sweeps to hunt down rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels come and go, but it is the peaceful population that
faces reprisals during the sweeps,'' Astamirova said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's ruined villages provide little shelter, no food, no
work, and no amenities. But the refugees are going back because
they have nowhere else to go. Every day, columns of buses head back
from the Russian region of Ingushetia, which took in most of those
who fled the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no peace in Chechnya, but people in Ingushetia are
tired of refugees,'' Astamirova said. ``They are charging rent, and
we have no money to pay. So we'll go back. One room in our house
was not that badly damaged. We can stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   But many refugees said they were convinced that violence will
return. During the security sweeps over the past two months,
refugees and human rights workers say, Russian troops have
repeatedly gone on looting and killing sprees, leaving dozens,
perhaps hundreds, of civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Bela Guchigova was at her wrecked home in
northwest Grozny's Staropromyslovsky District, she says, she saw
the site of a massacre in which her brother, her grandparents, and
dozens of her neighbors were killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to survivors interviewed by human rights groups, about
100 soldiers systematically robbed and shot civilians in the
two-day rampage that began Feb. 5. The troops also raped several
women and hurled grenades into basements where residents were
trying to hide, survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Guchigova said survivors told her that soldiers had ordered
people into their yards and then rampaged through the ruined
houses, looking for things to take. Anyone who protested was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their only crime was that they were at home. Some of the
bodies were still lying where they fell,'' Guchigova said. ``The
soldiers wouldn't let the survivors bury them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians tell us to go back, but once you are in Chechnya,
you become an enemy,'' said Sultan Dakhayev, the Guchigovas'
neighbor in a tent camp on the Chechen-Ingush border.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Chechens want to go back to Grozny, especially after
Thursday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Staropromyslovsky District, where Bela Guchigova lives, is
also where rebels launched their assault on a column of 98 Russian
paramilitary officers who had just arrived to relieve troops that
had captured the city in early February.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels fired rockets at the first and last vehicles in a
convoy of nine heavy trucks, then sprayed the rest with machine-gun
fire and rocket-launched grenades, the survivors told Russian
television. The Interior Ministry at first reported 20 dead, but
later a military spokesman put the death toll at 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a guerrilla war,'' Baultdin Bakuyev,
a Chechen field commander, told The Associated Press. He said that
his fighters had pulled off the deadly ambush, then escaped into
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The attack evoked memories of Russia's failed 1994-1996 campaign
to defeat the separatists. In early 1996, Russian forces had chased
the rebels into the mountains and the generals were declaring
victory. But in August, the rebels mounted a surprise attack and
regained control of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has vowed not to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Thursday's attack, a police spokesman said,
Russian troops rounded up 80 suspects in Grozny. Such actions are
something else the refugees fear.
</P>
<P>
   Roza Dikayeva, who was on a bus bound for Urus-Martan, 12 miles
south of Grozny, said most Chechen women are afraid to take their
husbands and sons back with them. Fighting-age men are routinely
detained during the Russian sweeps. So is anyone with scars, or a
last name similar to that of a rebel leader. Some are taken to
Chernokozovo, a detention camp in northern Chechnya where human
rights groups say inmates are beaten and tortured.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow denies the accusations and accuses Western media of
having an anti-Russian bias; it has begun organizing media trips to
Chernokozovo. But there are other ``filtration camps'' where
suspected rebels are held, and, Chechens say, beaten and tortured.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Dikayeva said, is in the basement of an orphanage
in Urus-Martan.

TOUGH BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR CHIEF OF A FORCE IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By most accounts, Bernard Parks managed his long
rise as a black officer on the once racially divided Los Angeles
Police Department largely by knowing the minutiae of how the force
worked better than anyone else and by developing a reputation as
intolerant of infractions of the rules. He was a consummate
insider, a man known less for finesse than for overwhelming
problems with mountains of details.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his department is caught in the uncomfortable glare of
a corruption scandal, the vexing question that this intelligent,
ramrod-straight police chief faces is whether those skills as an
inside policy technician, rather than a bridge to the community,
will be his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt like his term had suddenly veered off course,
Parks, who wears a crisply ironed blue uniform on duty, insisted
not. ``Anybody that takes the job of chief of police and doesn't
understand that they may be confronted with challenges like this is
naive,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, 57, was born in Beaumont, Texas, but when he was still
young his family moved here, and his father became an officer with
the harbor police. Parks drifted into police work in 1965, after
working briefly at a General Motors plant. He quickly made the
force his home and became known for his dedication.
</P>
<P>
   When he became chief in mid-1997, he was the second black to
hold the job, and he inherited a force that had become demoralized
under Chief Willie Williams, a former head of the Philadelphia
police who was often criticized for his relaxed and vague style.
Parks' style was anything but.
</P>
<P>
   He may have irritated some officers with his toughness _ he has
dismissed on average 50 officers a year, compared with fewer than
14 a year in the preceding decade _ and he could be smug in
dismissing outside interference in his department, but his lack of
a congenial public persona was just the thing many people here
seemed to want. He won plaudits for the plummeting crime rates and
a comforting sense that everything was under control.
</P>
<P>
   And then six months ago everything changed _ except, it seems,
Chief Parks.
</P>
<P>
   A rogue officer caught stealing cocaine from an evidence lock-up
disclosed that his inner-city anti-gang unit had for years, and
seemingly with impunity, beaten, framed and, in two instances, shot
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has been aggressive in response. He has said at least 99
people were wrongly imprisoned and should be freed, a number
certain to rise. Some 20 officers have faced sanctions, and he
initiated what most agree is the most scorching self-examination in
the department's history. The 362-page report, released Wednesday,
detailed a shocking array of management lapses across a department
that Parks always maintained he knew, and controlled, better than
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The largely Hispanic communities that had been brutalized felt
vindicated, after years of having had their complaints ignored. The
mayor has offered unwavering support, but many civic leaders have
demanded more outside scrutiny and less insularity on the part of
the chief.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has responded with energy, insisting that only he knew
enough to get the department back into shape. He has heatedly
rejected the need for an outside investigation. In an often
contentious interview in his utilitarian office, Parks laid most of
the blame at the feet of his predecessor, saying, ``These are the
issues that are coming out from the five years of history when an
outsider was in charge of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   When he released the 362-page internal investigation at a news
conference last week, he said how proud he was of the officers who
prepared the report, but he did not once mention the scores of
victims of the police brutality, none of whom he has met with.
Indeed, he has not visited the neighborhood where the anti-drug
unit worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear your point,'' Parks boomed when a
reporter pressed the question of whether he might show concern for
the victims individually. ``Your point has been covered.'' And he
responded with derision to the suggestion that he should make any
special effort to reach out to the communities that had suffered
from the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're trying to correct things in the public, you can get
a public relations firm to do that,'' he said. ``If you're trying
to clean up and deal with the operational issues within the
department, you have to have someone who knows what those
operations issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks grew even more pugnacious when he was asked whether he
should resign to take responsibility for the management lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is this, I'm not going to answer that because I have
not been asked to resign,'' he said. ``I am the one who has been in
the forefront of investigating this issue, so I think that's
totally inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the civilian police commission is evaluating Parks'
report, with some of its members having privately expressed concern
about Parks' seeming insularity. The City Council has not mustered
the votes to launch a separate investigation, and the mayor has
expressed pride in his police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, who is married and has four grown children, said his life
had not changed. He never sees movies, he has said, and spends many
evenings reading reports. He said he occasionally went to the
theater and vacationed in Mexico with his wife every 10 weeks or
so. He is operating as he always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way you respond to something like this is the way
you were trained to respond,'' he said.

BATTLING DOG-OWNER DENIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your child gets dropped off by the bus at the end of the street
every day after school and must walk by your neighbor's house. The
big dog behind the fence barks and snarls and charges the slats
every time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the dog leaps high enough to get his head and paws
over the top. You worry that the dog might make it over the fence,
could possibly dig under it, could very well get loose if the gate
is left open.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you walk at a park in which you and the other owners let
your dogs romp together, off leash. There's one dog, however, who
is big and aggressive and always starts a fight. The owner seems
proud. ``He is definitely the alpha!'' she always says. You and the
other owners roll your eyes. Sometimes, the moment the duo walks
into the park, you just go home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us, at one time or another, have had to deal with a
menacing dog. And very often, we don't know what to do about it. In
fact, our society in general is not very good about identifying the
build-up of aggression in dogs and taking care of it before
something happens.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
estimates that more than 4.7 million Americans, most of them
children, are bitten by dogs each year. Experts tell us that the
vast majority of these cases are preventable.
</P>
<P>
   We consulted Carter Luke of the Massachusetts Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and two of the best known dog
training experts in the country _ Brian Kilcommons, coauthor of
``Childproofing Your Dog,'' and Matthew Margolis, coauthor of
``Grrr! The Complete Guide to Understanding and Preventing
Aggressive Behavior in Dogs'' and host of PBS's dog behavior
series, ``Woof!''
</P>
<P>
   They all agree. Current laws in most cities and towns are
inadequate in dealing with these issues because they address the
situation only after an attack occurs. Still, there are steps you
can take to stay safe.
</P>
<P>
   If a menacing dog lives on your street, take action. ``If an
adult ran behind a fence chasing and threatening your children as
they walked by, you'd call the cops,'' Kilcommons says. You should
take a dog behaving that way just as seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The first step _ if you feel comfortable doing it _ is to speak
to the owners of the dog. It's hard to imagine they would be
unaware of the dog's behavior, but you can point it out. They
should get training for the dog, socialize it, and neuter it
(nearly 100 percent of serious maulings in this country are
committed by unfixed dogs, usually male).
</P>
<P>
   Further, Kilcommons has a novel idea. Owners of menacing dogs
can use invisible fencing inside standard fencing. It provides more
than double security. It actually reduces the level of aggression
if the dog can't get right up to pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, put these people on notice. ``Owners are
in denial about aggression in their dogs,'' Margolis says. ``People
can take you insulting them easier than they can deal with you
talking about their dog. They make excuses: `He only growls at
strangers.' Great. There are only about 250 million strangers in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if an owner won't take this behavior seriously, you should.
All the experts agree: Send a certified letter to the owners
stating that their dog is exhibiting aggressive behavior that you
believe is dangerous. The letter is to give fair warning that
should something happen, they are fully responsible. Send letters
outlining the situation to your town's animal control officer, the
police, and even the district attorney and ask them to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing, however, is always safety. As Luke says, ``Use
supervision and avoidance.'' So while sending those letters off,
have your children walk a different way home, even if that means
going around the block to avoid one house. If you don't have
children, Luke says, be an upstanding member of your community and
get involved. If you see unacceptable aggressive behavior in a
neighborhood dog, say something.
</P>
<P>
   But, as anyone in a dog play group knows, speaking up can be
tough. Many of us simply have a hard time broaching uncomfortable
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the key is safety _ for you and your dog. Keeping
your own dog _ and yourself _ away from danger is worth ostracizing
someone. Tell the owner, Kilcommons says, `` `It's not you. It's
your dog's behavior. It has shown aggression repeatedly, and we
cannot persuade you to control it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Owners who say they have control because they can yank their dog
out of a fight are dead wrong. If you had control of the dog, your
pet wouldn't be acting this way in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The MSPCA is pushing for statewide laws that uniformly deal with
the issue of dangerous dogs, Luke says. One they are backing calls
for the notification to a town or city when a dangerous dog
banished from another community moves in.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue, according to Luke, is that many antiquated
rules focus on the dog instead of the owner. But aggressive canine
behavior is rarely an untreatable genetic problem, which means the
onus must be placed on the owner. These are people who have either
ignored or encouraged bad behavior. If their dog is taken away,
they will replace it with another and trigger what has literally
become a vicious cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there are places that have progressive and tough laws
to curb aggressive dogs. In Oregon, Portland established a model
dangerous-dog law with five levels of offenders ranging from dogs
that menace and threaten to dogs that cause serious injury or
death. The penalties range from confinement on a leash to, for the
worst cases, euthanasia for the dog and removal of the owner's
right to ever own a dog again.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a true dog lover and you know the incredible good
they are capable of, you will be the least patient with owners who
bring out the worst in their dogs. Reading about yet another child
killed or disfigured by an aggressive dog should inspire us all to
act now if we know of a dog with the potential for this kind of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One final note. If you buy a big, menacing dog for protection,
the statistics show the most likely victim of the dog will be you,
your children, or your neighbor's children.

   Eds: added state's delegate count
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' Super Tuesday at a Glance
</P>
<P>
   c, 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   California , with it's 162 delegates, and New York, which brings
with it 101 delegates are the two grand prizes on Tuesday, but
there are still 11 other states, worth a total of 350 additional
delegates, at play.
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was born and went to college in Connecticut (Yale
University is in New Haven), and this state elected his grandfather
to the Senate, but his prospects here didn't look too bright until
recently. A February poll showed him trailing McCain by 13 points,
but a Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC tracking poll released Friday showed the
two in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Connecticut elected former Sen. Lowell Weicker governor
as an independent, and McCain's maverick campaign appears to be
resonating. Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, has endorsed Bush,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the nation's wealthiest state per capita, went for
Bill Clinton over Bob Dole in 1996 by a large margin, 53-35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the primary takes all of the state's 25 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't yet lost a Southern state primary and he isn't
likely to lose this one: In a survey conducted Feb. 28 and 29, he
held a commanding lead, 62-23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters here are social conservatives, giving Bush a big
advantage. But the primary is open and, as in South Carolina, the
delegates are allocated by congressional district, so McCain can
win some delegates in more moderate urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia hasn't elected a Republican governor since
Reconstruction (it's the only state that hasn't elected a GOP
governor this century), but the Democrats' strength has been ebbing
over the past 20 years. Georgia voters chose Dole over Clinton in
1996, 47-46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 54 delegates are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family has a summer home in Kennebunkport, but Maine,
like the rest of New England, may be McCain country.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a poll taken recently, but there are few
social conservatives in the state and voters here have shown an
independent streak: Ross Perot beat Bush's father here in 1992, and
the state elected an independent as governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's primary is closed, although independents can register as
Republicans at the polls so long as they don't change their
affiliation again for three months.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 14 delegates will be awarded proportionally, but if
the victor gets a majority, it's winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Maryland might seem to be a winnable state for McCain because
most of its Republicans are moderate and independents can vote in
its open primary. Furthermore, the Naval Academy, McCain's alma
mater, is here and Maryland has plenty of residents with Navy ties.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the most recent polls show Bush in the lead. Two
surveys released on Wednesday showed Bush leading McCain 47-40
percent and 47-37 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland is politically diverse: Its eight House seats are
divided equally between the parties. The state gave Clinton his
third-highest percentage in 1992 and fifth-best in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 31 delegates will be allocated by congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS
</P>
<P>
   This New England state may deal Bush a New Hampshire-like
primary blow. A University of Massachusetts tracking poll shows
McCain leading Bush 66-21 percent. A Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC tracking
poll shows McCain with a 30-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a heavily Catholic, predominantly white
Democratic stronghold. Both senators and, since 1996, all its
representatives, are Democrats. Political life in the Bay State
remains dominated by the Kennedy family legacy. Sen. Edward Kennedy
has represented the state since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts voters went for Clinton in 1996 and in 1992. That
year, Clinton beat Bush's father here, 47-29 percent. In 1988, the
elder Bush lost to former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, but
by a much slimmer margin, 53-45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers up 37 delegates, winner take all, in GOP
primaries that are closed to Democrats but open to independents.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an independent streak: Minnesotans shocked the nation
in 1998 when they elected ex-pro wrestler and Reform Party
candidate Jesse Ventura governor.
</P>
<P>
   While surprising, the state's wasn't exactly out of character:
Minnesota Republicans renamed themselves ``Independent
Republicans'' after Watergate, while Minnesota Democrats call
themselves the ``Democrat Farmer Labor'' party.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota produced the nation's first anti-smoking bill, one of
the first public campaign financing plans and the nation's first
statewide educational choice plan.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been any recent polls here, where 34 delegates
will be in play at nonbinding straw votes.
</P>
<P>
   MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is a presidential bellwether state, having voted for
the winning president in every election in the past except in 1900
and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The primary here will be open, but McCain could lose a few votes
to Bill Bradley, who was born and raised here. Many of the state's
swing voters are Catholic Democrats, however, so Bush's Bob Jones
University speech could be problematic for him.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Wednesday showed Bush with a commanding 12-point
lead over McCain. Two-thirds of Republicans support Bush, while
McCain beats the Texas governor among independents, 57-26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will take all 35 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has ever been elected president without winning
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeye State looks a lot like America: close to the
national average in income, urban-rura split and racial and ethnic
composition.
</P>
<P>
   In this open primary, Reagan Democrats in Cleveland may help
McCain, while Bush may get a boost from social conservatives near
Cincinnati. With the exception of Sen. Mike DeWine, the state's
elected Republicans are backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken Feb. 23-27 showed Bush leading 53-36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won Ohio in 1996 and 1992, but by narrow margins. Only
twice in the past 100 years _ in 1944 and 1960 _ has Ohio not
picked the winning presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some 69 delegates will be awarded, winner take all by
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   RHODE ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island has a Republican governor, a Republican senator and
a Democratic senator. The most heavily Catholic state in the nation
is overwhelmingly Democratic when it comes to presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father lost there to Clinton in 1992, 47-29 percent, and
to Dukakis in 1988, 56-44 percent. The state went for Ronald Reagan
over Walter Mondale in 1984, 52-48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This GOP primary, worth 14 delegates winner take all, is closed
to Democrats, but independents may cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   VERMONT
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Vermont is just shy of 100 percent white, but it is a mixed
bag politically.
</P>
<P>
   The state voted Democratic for president in 1992 for the first
time since 1964. The state also is represented in the House by
Bernard Sanders, Congress' first socialist representative since
1928.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won here in 1996 and in 1992. Bush's dad won here in
1988 and Reagan in 1984 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is the only New England state with open primaries, which
means Democrats can vote in Tuesday's GOP contest. The winner will
get 12 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise primary result last week, Bush won in this
historically Democratic state by a whopping 58-38 percent. Bush
later said his victory here would prove to be a turning point in
the GOP nomination race this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. In a complicated system of doling out its
37 GOP delegates, Washington held a primary last week worth 12
delegates _ Bush got 7, McCain 4 and Alan Keyes 1. The remaining 25
delegates will be awarded in caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his overwhelming victory last week, Bush should be a
shoe-in.

REALITY APPEARS TO BE SETTING IN FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ When Bill Bradley was praised at a rally here
Friday by a supporter with a booming voice, he quipped, ``If only I
had your voice, I'd be on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the remark referred to Bradley's less-than-riveting
oratory, it also reflected the sense of serenity that has come over
his presidential campaign as he plays out what could be the final
act of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest stage of the emotion-packed Democratic primary,
Bradley and his opponent, Al Gore, seem to be nearing an acceptance
that the vice president will sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has toned down his previous biting attacks on Gore's
honesty and integrity. In fact, he has stopped mentioning his
rival, period. And the steely resolve he had maintained for months
continues to evolve into a gentler spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides privately acknowledge that a sense of peace, if
not resignation, has arisen in the campaign since the bruising
defeat in Washington state that robbed the former New Jersey
senator of his last chance to build momentum before Tuesday's 16
crucial primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also abandoned his attacks on Bradley. As he stumped in
Jacksonville, Fla., and Atlanta Friday, he saved his criticism for
his potential general election foes, Texas Governor George W. Bush
and Arizona Senator John McCain. This morning, Gore is to speak at
Faneuil Hall.
</P>
<P>
   So confident is Gore that he has spent much of the last two days
speaking to people who can't vote: elementary and high school
children. Local reporters have been asking Gore about potential
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile said Gore could win enough
delegates for the nomination by March 14, even if Bradley chooses
to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bradley camp, spokesman Eric Hauser said the mood should
not be mistaken for a lack of passion. ``He's where he has always
been, which is comfortable with his convictions,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore insist the contest is not over. Gore has
intoned the refrain that he is ``not taking a single vote for
granted,'' while Bradley vowed Friday to battle to the last minute
for his agenda. Both men have ambitious campaign schedules through
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the great anticlimaxes of the campaign, Bradley Friday
delivered a major address outlining his position on foreign policy.
Bradley warned, as President John F. Kennedy once did, that the
United States should not be ``a volunteer fire department'' for the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign stops Friday in Providence and in Portland, Maine,
Bradley urged voters to ignore the message of impending doom that
has been conveyed by polls and prognosticators. Surveys show him
trailing Gore in every state that votes Tuesday, and Bradley has
said he must win at least several states to justify pursuing the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Rhode Island is going to join with Connecticut and
other states in the whole Northeast and send a message that we want
a new politics in America,'' Bradley told about 200 supporters at
the Feinstein College of Continuing Education in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also run hard to get out the vote, said Brazile,
adding, ``I'm telling my people to run like we're five points
behind.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 227.
WASHINGTON, March 3 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 61 to 37, a bill that would
allow families to set up annual tax-free education savings accounts
of up to $2,000 per child for private and public school expenses.
The bill, which would raise the legal limit on the annual savings
account from $500 to $2,000, would also allow married couples with
annual incomes of up to $220,000 to participate. Supporters said
the bill will give states, local school systems and parents more
leeway on how to spend federal education dollars. Opponents,
including President Clinton, said public schools need more federal
funding and would suffer if students attend private schools as a
result of the tax-credit. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   The House, in a rare display of unanimity Wednesday, approved a
measure 422 to 0, that will allow people over the age of 65 to keep
their Social Security payments and continue working no matter how
much money they earn. Supporters, including President Clinton, said
elderly Americans are living longer, healthier lives and are needed
in the workforce. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.

for the advertising, whose source had been a mystery in recent
days, to highlight environmental issues. But McCain's aides accuse
the Bush campaign of being behind the advertising. By Richard W.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When stocks run up suddenly and unexpectedly, it can be a sign
that investors aren't doing some basic arithmetic _ and that can
spell opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the case with the shares of some companies involved
in fuel cell technology. Their stocks, in the absence of major
news, have posted sizzling returns this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells are battery-like devices that, though still in the
development stage, may some day fill a variety of power-generating
functions, replacing, say, a car's combustion engine. Often, the
cells use hydrogen to produce electricity, a relatively clean
process.
</P>
<P>
   Recent power blackouts, like those in New York and Chicago last
summer, have left many computer-dependent businesses hungry for
back-up power sources like fuel cells. Though analysts say that the
technology shows commercial potential, the industry's losses are
mounting. And the companies themselves probably won't earn a penny
in profit for another four years, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The stock that has caught most investors attention is Plug Power
Inc., a fuel cell developer in Latham, N.Y., that went public in
October at $15 a share and now trades at $120.875. That translates
into a market value of $5.20 billion for an unprofitable company
whose fuel cells, intended for home use, are still in the early
stages of testing.
</P>
<P>
   But the run-up hasn't provided nearly as much lift as one might
expect for two companies that, together, hold an enormous stake in
Plug Power. And that may provide investors with a reasonably priced
entry point into the stock.
</P>
<P>
   DTE Energy, a Detroit utility, and Mechanical Technology of
Albany both helped to found Plug Power; each continues to hold a 32
percent stake in it. Steve Ballentine of Ballentine Capital
Management of Avon, Conn., which holds positions in several fuel
cell stocks, noted that DTE is now trading at just 8.8 times
analysts' estimates of 2000 earnings. That's a 12 percent discount
to its peers, he estimates.
</P>
<P>
   And investors are getting a stake in Plug Power that is worth
$1.66 billion at current prices, amounting to more than a third of
DTE's market capitalization. ``You're basically buying a third of
Plug for nothing, as well as getting a stock that has a 7 percent
yield,'' Ballentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The math on Mechanical Technology, whose stock has nearly
tripled since Jan. 1, to $70, is even better. The company, with a
market capitalization of $820.3 million as of Friday, is actually
trading for less than half the value of its Plug Power stake.
Moreover, Mechanical Technology, which has positioned itself as an
incubator for alternative energy technologies, holds stakes in
other companies, like SatCon Technology of Cambridge, Mass., a
maker of fuel cell components.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Holman, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, thinks that the
incubator structure furnishes diversification and can result in big
payoffs from initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   There are other routes into the industry. Maurice Schoenwald,
co-manager of the New Alternatives mutual fund, is especially keen
on FuelCell Energy of Danbury, Conn., which is developing fuel
cells for the power industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, FuelCell announced that it was chosen by the
Department of Energy to help design a power plant using fuel cells.
Its stock rose 19 percent to close at $87.25. Schoenwald says
FuelCell's technology has the potential to be twice as efficient as
that of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For cost-conscious investors, a pair of utilities offer another
way to play the business. Idacorp of Boise, Idaho, has an internal
fuel cell business, as does the Avista Corp., a utility in Spokane,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Brothwell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, thinks Avista's fuel
cell business may be spun off this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brothwell urged investors to tread carefully. ``It's too
early to say what is going to be the right fuel cell technology,''
he said.

AMERICAN BALLOONIST'S SOLO ATTEMPT TO CIRCLE THE WORLD ENDS IN
ASIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Switzerland, England, Myanmar)   By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American balloonist's solo attempt to circle the world ended
well short of that goal Friday when he landed safely in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Uliassi, who had lifted off from a quarry in Rockford,
Ill., 10 days before, brought the balloon down in central Myanmar,
formerly Burma, about 300 miles north of the capital, Yangon,
formerly Rangoon. He had traveled 13,325 miles, more than halfway
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi's wife, Renee, said in a telephone interview from the
mission's command center in Homewood, Ill., that data transmissions
from the balloon indicated her husband had made a controlled
descent from about 30,000 feet. He suffered some bruises during the
landing and had been taken to a hospital, where he was expected to
spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi left a message on a family answering machine to report
that he was safe, but his support team had not heard directly from
him. ``We have no idea why he came down,'' she said. Mrs. Uliassi
said they last talked to him at about 3:30 p.m. Central time on
Thursday, about 13 hours before the landing. At that time he
reported no problems and said he was going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Uliassi said that by coincidence a British balloonist and
his team were in Myanmar and had offered to help her husband pack
up the balloon for shipment home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed whatsoever,'' Mrs. Uliassi said. ``For
Kevin and I it was a success just to put a balloon together.''
</P>
<P>
   After a relatively slow start across the Atlantic, the
160-foot-high balloon, named the J. Renee in honor of Mrs. Uliassi,
had caught favorable winds in the middle of the week and had
traveled at more than 100 miles an hour as it crossed India on
Thursday. Uliassi had been due to have a discussion with his
support team on Friday about whether he had enough fuel and oxygen
to proceed over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, 36, was attempting to become the third person to fly a
balloon nonstop around the world, and the first to do it alone. Two
Europeans accomplished the feat in a similar balloon last year.
Uliassi's trip did not even set a record for solo balloon travel;
that mark, of more than 14,000 miles, was established by Steve
Fossett, a wealthy Chicago businessman, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This was Uliassi's second attempt at an around-the-world trip,
and was far more successful than the first, which ended shortly
after launching when the balloon ruptured. Like that mission, this
one was run on a shoestring, with an all-volunteer support crew and
no deep-pocket backers. ``He's basically flying all his assets,'' a
spokesman, Scott Lorenz, had said on Thursday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plumbing is usually boring. So you can be forgiven if
the continuing tussle over stock market structure makes your eyes
glaze over. After all, no matter what happens to the New York Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq, you'll still be able to trade stocks to
your heart's content.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are like most investors, you will be lot more
interested in the price of those stocks than in how they are
traded.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the broad outlines of this debate _ which came to the
fore last week when the Big Board squared off with Wall Street
heavyweights like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter at a
Senate hearing in New York _ are worth taking a few minutes to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that big institutional investors have a lot of
advantages on Wall Street. They get the first chance to buy hot
initial public offerings. They get to meet in person with
companies' managements.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to trading stocks, the needs of individual and
institutional investors are moving closer. And that means _ almost
by accident _ that trading changes sought by the Wall Street giants
may benefit the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman and its cousins basically want all stock markets to
trade as if they were one big market. They want all orders at a
given price to be executed in the order they were received. And
they want the book of ``limit orders'' _ those to be executed only
if a stock reaches a certain price _ to be available for everyone
to see.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why that might help small investors, you need to
know something about the strengths and weaknesses of today's
markets.
</P>
<P>
   For small investors, the best market is one that allows them to
find one another quickly and directly. In this respect, the New
York Stock Exchange system, which features a single ``specialist''
setting prices for each stock, wins hands down over the Nasdaq,
where a set of ``market makers'' compete to make trades. More than
half of Big Board trades match investors directly, a much higher
percentage than on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For large investors, whose trades have traditionally been harder
to execute, specialists offer a different service. By putting up
their own capital when they cannot match buyers and sellers,
specialists help prevent big price swings.
</P>
<P>
   But rapidly improving technology has made it much easier to
cross big trades, too, without human intervention. And so the needs
of large institutional investors are becoming more and more like
those of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   That's crucial, because the Big Board's system has a hidden
cost. On the exchange, the specialists keep tight control over
their books of limit orders _ priceless information in determining
the direction a stock will take.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions can ask for a peek, but they are tired of paying to
use floor brokers to beg for that information, especially since the
technology to give investors real-time access to the books now
exists. And the privilege is not available to the little guy at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, by contrast, already gives investors some
information about limit orders, and more is coming.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Wall Street wants to combine the information offered
by the Nasdaq system with the matching offered by the Big Board.
That would be good for both big and small investors, assuming that
any new rules treat them equally.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is a big assumption, especially on Wall Street.

MR. FIX-IT REWIRES A COMPANY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since he was a child, Dick Syron has been a tinkerer. As a
teenager, he fixed TV sets and cars for spare cash. As an adult, he
rewired a 134-year-old house. And he loves working on his 28-foot
Bertram motorboat almost as much as he loves powering it through
the waves.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at 56, Richard F. Syron is facing what may be his
biggest tinkering job yet. As the chief executive of the Thermo
Electron Corp. _ a post he has held for just nine months _ he is
revamping the diverse manufacturing company top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Once he is done, Thermo Electron will no longer be a
multitentacled company with dozens of publicly traded subsidiaries.
It will be a mainstream manufacturer with one set of shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's willingness to buy small, thin-float stocks that
don't have dot-com on them is pretty low,'' Syron said. ``We're
better off as a conventional company.''
</P>
<P>
   The revamping is well under way. The company, based in Waltham,
Mass., announced on Jan. 31 that it would sell businesses that had
provided one-third of its $4.2 billion in revenues. It is spinning
off to shareholders two other businesses: biomedical devices and
paper manufacturing equipment. And it plans to buy back the public
shares of those companies that will form a business making
analytical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transformation is a tall task for someone who had never
before run a public company. Sure, Syron had been on Thermo
Electron's board for nearly two years, and yes, he had known George
Hatsopoulos, the company's founder and former chairman, for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   He has done some big-time quasicorporate tinkering, as well: as
president of the Boston Federal Reserve in the early 1990s, he
helped keep many New England banks solvent as others across the
country went under. In his most recent job, as president of the
American Stock Exchange, he was an architect of its merger with
Nasdaq's parent, the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts wondered about Syron's qualifications to run Thermo
Electron. ``When he was first named, I did have to scratch my head
a bit,'' said Deane Dray of Goldman Sachs, who nonetheless has high
hopes for Syron's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Syron acknowledges Wall Street's doubts, but says they are
misplaced. ``Organizational restructuring is not rocket science,''
he said. ``It's common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Syron's friends and former colleagues tell it, he has
that in abundance. ``Dick is extremely bright, pragmatic and
energetic _ emphasis on that middle word,'' said E. Gerald
Corrigan, a Goldman Sachs partner who worked with Syron at the
Federal Reserve. ``He isn't caught up in theology; he's a doer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Ryan, Syron's predecessor at the stock exchange, cited
a case in point. ``He knew enough not to involve the members in the
merger decision until it was time to vote,'' Ryan said, ``and then
he knew how to persuade everyone that this merger was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, why would Dick Syron take on Thermo Electron? He took a
50 percent pay cut when he left the Amex, he says. And for now, his
million stock options, priced at $19.10, do not represent any
bonanza. Thermo's stock closed at $21.9375 on Friday _ well above
its low of $12.50 on April 9, 1999, but nowhere near its high of
$44.50 on Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock has to go up substantially for this to be a good
financial move,'' Syron said. ``Anyone who says it is cheaper to
live in Boston than New York hasn't lived in Boston lately.''
</P>
<P>
   So again, why? ``I like to fix things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Syron grew up in Watertown, Mass., the child of Irish immigrants
_ his father was a blacksmith, his mother a domestic worker. They
lived in a three-family house, with relatives in the other
apartments and other relatives a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them loved to work with their hands, and Syron picked up
the knack. ``In our environment you didn't call a plumber; you
borrowed your uncle's wrench,'' he said. Uncles and cousins taught
him how to fix automobiles, and he learned to repair televisions at
an after-school job.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed destined to be an electrical engineer. But in college
in the late '60s, he discovered he had a learning disability that
made mechanical drawing impossible. He also met his future wife,
Peggy. They have been married for 28 years, and have a daughter,
Erin, 20, and a son, Brendan, 15.
</P>
<P>
   As an economics major at Boston College (he has advanced degrees
in economics from Tufts), Syron worked summers painting houses in
poor sections of Boston. At the Boston Fed, he tried to ensure that
people in poor neighborhoods were not unfairly denied mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Isaacs, a retired banker and his best friend, recalls
that Syron, an avid boater, has eschewed fancy sailing clubs,
instead joining the more blue-collar South Boston Yacht Club.
``Dick judges people by characteristics and qualities, not
titles,'' Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that is how Thermo Electron's board chose him, too.
Investors had soured on the company's strategy of constantly
spinning out public companies. In September, Hatsopoulos' brother
John, his intended successor, announced that he would resign. The
board, wanting someone familiar with the company, chose Syron.
George Hatsopoulos resigned as chairman in January, giving Syron
that title as well.
</P>
<P>
   Syron expects that it will be more than a year before the sales
are completed, the spinoffs done and the company operating as a
manufacturer. When everything is fixed, will he leave?
</P>
<P>
   Probably _ but then again, maybe not. ``There are many other
things I want to do,'' he said. ``But you can't make decisions
about what you'll do three years down the road.''

CLINTON CALLS FOR GREATER PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ President Clinton said Friday that he
considers cyberspace too insecure for him to correspond privately
by e-mail with his daughter, Chelsea, who is away at college. In a
speech to high-tech executives here in the heart of the Silicon
Valley, Clinton called on the industry to enhance computer privacy
to reassure many people like himself who are still wary of the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the president issued a memorandum Friday to the heads of
federal departments, urging them to increase the safeguards of
federal computers against intrusions like the recent spate of
attacks that overloaded and shut down major Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights in cyberspace received renewed attention this
week with the decision by DoubleClick Inc., the nation's largest
online advertising company, to back off from a plan to compile
personal profiles of people who surf the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   During a technology forum at the offices of Novell Inc., a
software company, Clinton said he believed the federal government
ought to get involved in protecting the privacy of financial
information and medical records on the Internet. But the president
called on the industry to police itself in other areas. Already,
Clinton said, 66 percent of the commercial Web sites have privacy
standards, up from 15 percent just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free because it
sparks creativity and innovation, because its infinite networks can
do so much to bring us together,'' Clinton said. ``But we also know
that cyberspace must be a community of shared responsibilities and
common values.''
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, organized by the Aspen Institute, Clinton told the
high-tech executives that computer users deserved notice about what
personal information was being collected and how it would be used,
and should be be able to choose whether the data would be shared
with third parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, ordinary folks, even people who aren't online yet,
are very excited about the prospects of this age so many of you
have done so much to create,'' Clinton told the executives,
including the heads of such Silicon Valley powerhouses as Yahoo,
Cisco Systems and Siebel Systems. ``But they are really concerned
about this. They are afraid they will have no place to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton said in a brief interview that he was
one of those people wary about sending information through
cyberspace. ``I won't send e-mail to Chelsea because I don't think
it's secure,'' Clinton said. The president added that once he
leaves office next year and becomes a ``Joe Sixpack'' he will
probably not be as concerned about his electronic communications.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton admits that he is a newcomer when it comes to the
Internet. Just last week, during a fund-raising visit to Florida,
he marveled at something as mundane as a screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas last year, Clinton ordered some gifts over the
Internet, an experience he still talks about in speech after
speech. ``Yesterday, we got a new benchmark for the new economy
when the Department of Commerce released its first ever quarterly
report on e-commerce,'' Clinton said Friday, ``telling us the
Internet sales from the fourth quarter of last year, the holiday
season, were $5.3 billion _ about $65 of those attributable to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's anxiety over e-mail clearly will not stop him from
communicating with his daughter. He said they spoke on the phone,
and in between a string of fund-raisers in San Francisco and Los
Angeles on Friday night and Saturday that will raise $1.6 million
for the Democrats, Clinton plans to spend time, face-to-face, with
Chelsea in Palo Alto.

INVESTING DIGEST WITH FUNDS WATCH AND MARKETS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)

<P>
   A Psychiatric Theory On Irrational Exuberance &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that the stock market is a pendulum swinging
between fear and greed. But what if there is no fear because
investors are chock full of Prozac or other psychoactive drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps stock prices and indexes like the Nasdaq composite, up
20.8 percent so far this year, could race to unprecedented
valuations as investors' usual reactions to things like high
price-earnings multiples and rising interesting rates are
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   That is the hypothesis being floated by Randolph M. Nesse, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, in a recent
essay posted on a Web site called Edge, (www.edge.org).
</P>
<P>
   Nesse points out that prescriptions for psychoactive drugs rose
to 233 million in 1998 from 131 million in 1988, with nearly 10
million filled last year for Prozac alone. Next, he considers the
likelihood that a disproportionately high part of the population
connected to the markets _ brokers and wealthy individuals, in
particular _ are likely to be taking antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   And he says he has noted that certain of his patients who take
such drugs seem to worry too little about real dangers. ``This is
exactly the mind-set of many current investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nesse said he did not want to belittle the positive effects that
antidepressants may be having on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are productive employees,'' he said of workers taking
such drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if investor caution is being inhibited by psychotropic
drugs, bubbles could grow larger than usual before they pop, with
potentially catastrophic economic and political consequences,'' he
said. ``If chemicals are inhibiting normal caution in any
substantial fraction of investors, we need to know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if a ``Prozac effect'' on the markets is
confirmed through further research, it might not necessarily be bad
news for stocks. Only one-third of the population that could
benefit from antidepressants is currently taking them, according to
Nesse. So, presumably, the market has room to go higher.
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: Nesse said he was not currently invested in
the market, having recently sold a position in a biotechnology
stock, Affymetrix.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Nesse is adamant that government-sponsored research
into the topic is necessary. But he is not sure whether it should
be carried out by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
National Institutes of Mental Health.

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Energize An Internet Portfolio &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is trying to get its Internet mutual fund
off the ground in Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's asset-management arm hopes to raise enough money from
investors to get the fund up and running in two weeks instead of
the usual five. The firm began an abbreviated road show for the
fund, called Internet Strategies, with a half-day get-together in
San Francisco last week that was broadcast to the computer screens
of the firm's 14,200 brokers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people assembled to drum up interest in the fund were
Jeffrey Peek, who oversees global asset-management for Merrill; top
executives of two technology companies; and Michael Lewis, the
author of ``The New New Thing,'' whom Merrill flew in from Paris as
a luncheon speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodget, Merrill's main analyst of Internet stocks, who
was beamed in live from a TV studio at Merrill's headquarters in
Manhattan, told the brokers that about 75 percent of
electronic-commerce companies would not exist in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The fanfare showed what a departure the new fund is for Merrill,
whose fund managers are still working to shed their reputation as
die-hard value investors. Merrill officials said they thought the
firm's customers were ready for an Internet fund, because Internet
funds managed by outside firms have been big sellers through
Merrill's broker network.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is managed by Paul Meeks, who rebuilt the portfolio of
the Merrill Lynch Technology fund in 1998 after it missed the first
few years of the technology-stock boom. It has since been merged
with the Global Technology fund, which Meeks also manages.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks and Robert Doll, the chief investment officer for
Merrill's stock funds, also took turns at the microphone, before
about 100 brokers Merrill brought in for the occasion broke for the
golf course or wine country.

COMMENTARY: WHEN MONEY IS THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sen. John McCain has voted consistently in the Senate
for the causes of the Christian right. He has opposed abortion
rights, gun control and anti-discrimination laws protecting gays
and lesbians. He voted to convict President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the National Right to Life Committee and Pat Robertson, the
right-wing evangelist, have bitterly opposed him in the Republican
primaries. Why?
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked himself that question in his extraordinary Virginia
Beach speech the other day. He answered: ``Because I don't pander
to them, because I don't ascribe to their failed philosophy that
money is our message.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Money is our message. &LR;  In that memorable phrase McCain caught
what has happened to the conservative movement and the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives used to take pride in themselves as the movement
of ideas. But the ideas that propelled them to control of Congress
are now mostly stale or irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting communism waned as a theme with the crumbling of the
Soviet Union and its allied regimes. The budget deficit, decried by
Republicans for so many decades, has been transformed by President
Clinton into a surplus. Slashing taxes, as Gov. George W. Bush has
learned to his regret, is now viewed by most of the public as a
threat to present prosperity and future Social Security retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Without ideas in which they have confidence, most conservatives
have focused increasingly on money as the way to get the public to
vote for them. That is why they are so furious at McCain. His
proposal for campaign finance limits would take away the
overwhelming financial advantage they get from their affluent
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has traditionally been the party of the
well-to-do. But in the past its conservative leaders _ men like
Sen. Robert A. Taft _ were not so obsessed with money. They had
strong policy views that they believed would persuade the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that the McCain campaign finance bill would be
``unilateral disarmament'' by the Republicans. He did not mean his
words this way, but what he really seemed to be saying was that the
armament of the party these days is not ideas but cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of the liberal biweekly The American
Prospect, John B. Judis describes how conservative luminaries set
out to maintain control after Republicans won the House in 1994.
Ideological lobbyists like Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax
Reform met weekly with Republican congressional leaders and
business lobbyists. The aim was to get so-called soft money flowing
from corporate political action committees. And it has flowed
heavily toward the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money, which is money contributed to political parties, is
not regulated by current federal law as is money given to
candidates. The legislation sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., would bring soft money under limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have called for the reform of campaign finance practices
that have sacrificed our principles to the demands of big-money
special interests,'' McCain said in Virginia Beach. ``I have spoken
against forces that have turned politics into a battle of bucks
instead of a battle of ideas. ... America is greater than the
accumulation of wealth, and so our party should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In those words McCain sounded like Theodore Roosevelt decrying
``malefactors of great wealth.'' Indeed, he said at the end that
Republicans should be ``the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not the
party of special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be that McCain's campaign crested in Michigan. His losses
in Virginia and Washington make his prospects look bleak unless he
can pull off a miracle next week in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against upsetting the conservative powers that be were
always daunting. But in challenging their money culture, and in
particular what he called the Christian right's ``agents of
intolerance,'' McCain has had a powerful impact on our politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I wrote, incorrectly, that Willie Horton _
the imprisoned murderer whose image figured in the 1988 campaign _
committed another murder while on a furlough from prison. He
stabbed but did not kill his target.

   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 61 to 37, a bill that would
allow families to set up annual tax-free education savings accounts
of up to $2,000 per child for private and public school expenses.
The bill, which would raise the legal limit on the annual savings
account from $500 to $2,000, would also allow married couples with
annual incomes of up to $220,000 to participate. Supporters said
the bill will give states, local school systems and parents more
leeway on how to spend federal education dollars. Opponents,
including President Clinton, said public schools need more federal
funding and would suffer if students attend private schools as a
result of the tax-credit. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

ORGANIZATION EFFORT FAILS AT DELTA AIR LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management at Delta Air Lines, the least unionized major
carrier, won a key victory Friday with the overwhelming rejection
of organizing efforts of its ramp workers and baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline has a labor cost advantage over its
top competitors because only its pilots, dispatchers, and flight
instructors are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing effort by the Transport Workers Union was soundly
defeated by the airline's 10,800 ramp workers who had to return a
ballot to vote for unionization. Only 1,868 ballots, or 17 percent
of those eligible, were returned. At least 50 percent of the
ballots needed to be returned for the election to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted favorably, with the stock jumping 3 1/8 to
close at 46 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also is an endorsement of Maynard-native Leo Mullin,
Delta's first chief executive from outside the company. The former
banking executive was brought in to reestablish customer service
and improve employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the airline had very good relations with its
employees and in the early 1980s the workers bought the airline a
Boeing 767 with voluntary pay deductions. But morale was shattered
by an aggressive cost-cutting program instituted in the early 1990s
by the previous management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a strong endorsement of Leo Mullin and the new
management team,'' said Candace Browning, an airline analyst with
Merrill Lynch Global Securities. ``Many people thought the covenant
was broken. Leo has worked very hard to reestablish that covenant,
and this vote is a sign that he has done that. I think this is
great for management.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning said that many people expected the union organizing
effort to work.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Transport Workers Union were shocked by the
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what went wrong,'' organizer Steve Roberts
told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was the first major union vote at the airline in many
years, although other organizing efforts are under way with
mechanics and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin has made defeating those a priority and earlier this year
gave 3 percent raises to every domestic nonunion worker at the
company, which employs about 72,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The raises were the most recent in recent months and last month
the company said it would give every worker a personal computer at
reduced cost.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials would not predict what the ramp workers vote
might mean for ongoing orgnization efforts of mechanics and flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta employees made a signifigant positve choice for their
future and Delta's future,'' said spokeswoman Cindi Kurczewski.
``We plan to work hard to keep the trust they placed in the company
with this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the vote ``removes a bit of a distraction'' and permits
the airline to refocus on customer service.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The music seems plucked from the darkness, as if strings had
been turned into shadows. There are eight men onstage at that
point, the four members of the Emerson String Quartet and another
foursome, long-limbed figures in suits, as anonymous as the neatly
dressed men in Magritte paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The light is such that you can't always distinguish between the
performers and the onstage listeners, who have come to seem like
nonthreatening dopplegangers of the musicians, and it's as if that
collaboration _ which by extension embraces the audience _ were
necessary to produce the exquisitely sad sounds of Shostakovich's
String Quartet No. 15 in E flat minor.
</P>
<P>
   The pools and glints of light, reflected off faces and the
burnished surfaces of violins and cellos, are sustained, you have
the feeling, by the notes themselves. Yet when the stage again goes
as dark as a starless night and the music has stopped the melody
has by no means ended in your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness is the earth and oxygen of ``The Noise of Time,'' the
exquisitely realized elegy of a performance piece created by the
Theatre de Complicite.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Simon McBurney, this remarkable contemplation of
the life of the great, famously troubled Russian composer Dmitri
Shostakovich (1906-75) presents darkness as an element that while
all-consuming is by no means sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary things emerge from the cosmic night that has been
so expertly conjured by McBurney and his technical team for this
production, which was commissioned by the Lincoln Center Great
Performers series. The evening is divided into halves: an abstract
multimedia preface, which limns the life and times of Shostakovich
in strewn mosaic fragments, and the performance of the final
quartet, thought to be the composer's personal requiem.
</P>
<P>
   Projected images compose themselves slowly, as if brought into
focus by memory itself, onto screens that are pieces of clothing,
the disembodied front of a cello, the entire back wall of the
stage. The images, which sometimes dissolve into nothingness and
sometimes into other things, include a strangely heartbreaking
silhouette of a lanky grown man and a small child, an immense X-ray
of 10 fingers and, again and again, photographs of Shostakovich at
different ages, often with his hand partly blocking his face.
</P>
<P>
   Forging a connection between the tellingly camera-shy composer
and the haunting string quartet _ composed in the year before he
died _ that reads as his own epitaph is what ``The Noise of Time''
seeks to achieve. Well, among other things. The ambition of this
piece, which lasts a mere 90 minutes but seems infinitely longer
and shorter than that, is hubristic.
</P>
<P>
   As conceived by Simon McBurney, with the collaboration of his
brother, the composer Gerard McBurney, ``Noise'' aspires to create
not just a biographical frame for a piece of music. There is also
the implicit goal of setting that life in the context, both moral
and technological, of the century in which that life occurred.
Beyond that, ``Noise'' boldly considers the essential nature of
music and the ways in which we experience it.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds a bit schoolteacherish in the description, a sort
of adult equivalent to Young People's Concerts, with their
visualization exercises and careful explanatory metaphors. But
anyone who saw the Theatre de Complicite's brilliant production of
``Street of Crocodiles,'' adapted from the densely poetic stories
of Bruno Schulz, knows with what seamlessness this troupe can find
theatrical equivalents for seemingly nontheatrical material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noise'' builds a beautiful and enlightening bridge into one
artist's sensibility. But it never mistakes the bridge for what it
is leading us to. The production respectfully and wisely lets the
music itself, so magnificently performed by the Emerson group, have
the last word. Its ultimate and most valuable achievement is that
it has successfully asked us to hear that music with newly attuned
ears.
</P>
<P>
   The evening begins with a single old-fashioned radio spotlighted
on a chair, an image that segues into a parade of illuminated
radios, floating through the darkness. There's an aural background
of static and shards of speech and music. (The highly sophisticated
sound design is by Christopher Shutt and Gareth Fry.) The sounds
coalesce into a variety of more comprehensible patterns.
</P>
<P>
   One hears a snatch of music for dancing the Charleston; a
newscast from World War II; technical explanations of how sound is
transmitted by radio. A BBC-style voice emerges to say
didactically, ``Tonight we pose the question: what happens when we
listen to music?''
</P>
<P>
   There are bits of accounts of Yuri Gagarin's pioneer flight into
space and of the legendary premiere of Shostakovich's Symphony No.
7 during the siege of Leningrad, performed by a skeletal,
starvation-devastated orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   There are also reminiscences of Shostakovich, often spoken in
English against blurs of monologues in Russian, ranging from tales
of his precocious boyhood to a wry and somber description of the
composer waiting on the telephone to be connected to Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich's relationship with the Stalin regime is famously
complicated, still a subject of debate as to the degree of the
composer's artistic and moral compromises. The sound of taped
applause that erupts again and again throughout the evening's first
half accordingly seems as sour as it is sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, too, the production unfolds in snippets, giving off a
sense of a whole decomposing into pieces and then recomposing
again. The show's four nonmusical performers (Antonio Gil Martinez,
Richard Katz, Tim McMullan and Toby Sedgwick) manipulate bodiless
shoes and items of clothing into the semblance of walking phantoms,
waiting to be given corporeal form.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of Shostakovich skiing with his young son (the composer
was terrified of the sport and wanted his son to know no fear) are
echoed by the actors being blown together and apart, as if by angry
winds. A cello falls apart and then reconstitutes itself.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of fragmentation and recomposition _ given artfully
immaterial-seeming physical life by Joanna Parker (design), Paul
Anderson (lighting) and Jan Hartley (projections) as well as the
actors _ is the shaping rhythm of the evening. It prepares us for
the consummate act of self-dissection and reconfiguration that is
the liturgical 15th quartet.
</P>
<P>
   As haunting as McBurney's preface to this piece of music is it
is the staging of the performance of the quartet that is the
production's real epiphany. The movements of the remarkable
musicians _ Philip Setzer, Eugene Drucker, Lawrence Dutton, David
Finckel _ and their shadows, the four actors, have been
choreographed with stately precision in ways that seem both
surprising and inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which the quartet members seem to toss, quite
literally, individual notes among themselves is astonishing. And
you never, ever feel that the music is being imposed upon with
metaphorical conceits. Its own images are not polluted by
extraneous ones, in the ways that everything from Mozart's 21st
piano concerto (remember ``Elvira Madigan''?) to Tchaikovsky's
``1812'' Overture (that appalling puffed rice commercial) have
been.
</P>
<P>
   The entire evening takes place before a wall of sheets of music,
which at moments are perilously stirred by currents of air. Against
this wall, a series of increasingly less identifiable images are
projected, morphing without your even being aware of it. By the
evening end's that wall has turned to dull silver: it suggests both
the face of a memorial monument and an uncontainable space,
glistening with possibilities.

ECONOMISTS CITE WEATHER IN SLOWER FEBRUARY JOB GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Job growth suddenly weakened in February, the Labor Department
reported Friday, but almost nothing in the unexpectedly sharp
decline suggested a softening of the economy itself.
</P>
<P>
   Employment grew by 43,000 jobs, way off the recent pace of
250,000 or more a month, and the unemployment rate edged up to 4.1
percent from 4 percent. But the February performance was mostly a
result of abnormal weather, economists said. An unusually warm
January caused a surge in outdoor jobs, especially in construction,
and those jobs disappeared in the colder February weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the more remarkably irrelevant job reports that
we have seen for some time,'' said William Dudley, chief U.S.
economist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``There are plenty of indicators
that show the economy is still really quite strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock market investors, however, took a different tack. They
seemed to see in the weak employment report a sign that the Federal
Reserve will not have to raise interest rates that much after all
because the economy is beginning to slow on its own. So they bought
stocks with abandon, driving up the Dow Jones industrial average by
202.28 points, or 1.99 percent, to 10,367.2. The Nasdaq, where most
Internet stocks are traded, jumped even more, to another record.
</P>
<P>
   That bullishness may turn out to be self-destructive. The
Federal Reserve seeks to slow the booming economy to avert
inflationary shortages of goods and services. But the Fed also
seeks to slow the stock market, on the ground that the growing
market wealth encourages people to spend freely, and thus
contributes to the inflationary shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, made these points in
congressional testimony last week. He warned, in effect, that the
Fed will raise interest rates in coming months partly to cool the
stock market. Stock prices plunged in the aftermath of his remarks,
but they have been recovering all this week and the February
employment report only fed the bounceback _ almost in defiance of
Greenspan's warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market could compel the Fed to raise interest rates even
more than it had planned,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist
at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration stressed the economy's strength.
Alexis Herman, the labor secretary, noted that while February's job
growth was the lowest number since last May, when only 28,000 new
jobs were created, the performance is much better when viewed over
a longer period. The surge in January created 384,000 new jobs, so
the monthly average for January and February was 214,000, she
noted, and that was not much below the 1999 average of 226,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything in this report that shows the
economy is weakening,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   The wage measure included in the employment report also showed
no sign of rising. Average hourly earnings for production workers _
one measure of whether a tight labor market is forcing employers to
raise wages _ went up only 6 cents, or 0.3 of a percent, leaving
this measure of wage growth hovering, as it has for months, at a
mild annual rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What stood out in this report were construction workers. In the
mild January weather, this industry added 116,000, jobs but in
February employment fell by 26,000 _ a huge downward shift.
</P>
<P>
   A fall in service sector jobs, however, was harder for
economists to explain. The overall rise was only 62,000 jobs _ way
below the monthly norm of 200,000 or so, and the lowest increase
since August 1997. The biggest falloff was in the service category
that includes office work, computer processing, ski resorts,
amusement and recreation, health care and temporary help agencies.
Here the job growth was only 6,000, the smallest increase since
April 1991, at the end of the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may suggest that we have had some softening in consumer
spending on services in February relative to the very strong
showing in January,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting and data gathering firm in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the falloff was also weather related: Outdoor work in
restaurants, and amusement centers fell, for example. But so did
jobs in transportation, particularly trucking, where rising fuel
prices appear to be taking a toll. And rising mortgage rates appear
to have reduced employment in that industry, said Thomas Nardone,
chief of the division that prepares the employment reports at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing jobs, on the other hand, are beginning to revive,
rising by 5,000 last month and by 31,000 since October after having
fallen by 527,000 over the previous 18 months. Overtime in
manufacturing also edged up. And with energy prices rising, a more
profitable oil and gas industry added 9,000 jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   The small February gain, while pushing the nation's total
employment to 131.33 million, produced very little change in the
unemployment rate for men, women, blacks and Hispanics. Tee-nage
unemployment rose to 14.1 percent from 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the labor force as a whole, however, the pool of people who
might be drawn into seeking and taking jobs seemed smaller than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The work force as a percentage of the total population is now a
record 64.8 percent, the level reached in January from 64.4 percent
in December. The labor force participation rate _ all those
employed plus the unemployed actively seeking jobs _ rose to a
record 67.6 percent of the population from 67.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   The average time that unemployed workers go without landing a
job has fallen to 12.5 weeks from 13.8 over the last year, the
lowest level since the last recession. And the unemployment rate
among people with less than a high school education is now only 6
percent, the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics
began tracking this group in 1992.

CHECHEN REBELS AMBUSH CONVOY OF ELITE RUSSIAN TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a daring assault deep inside territory that the
Russians thought they controlled, Chechen rebels ambushed a Russian
convoy near Grozny on Thursday, killing 20 police officers and
wounding 29.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports reaching here Friday, the rebels blasted
the first and last truck of the nine-truck convoy and engaged the
stranded soldiers in a four-hour firefight before melting into the
mist.
</P>
<P>
   The daylight attack was also a challenge to Acting President
Vladimir Putin, whose popularity stems in part from his decision to
mount a military campaign to subdue the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential election scheduled for March 26, Putin
still appears to be unbeatable. But the extensive coverage of the
bloody ambush on television news, which first reported the extent
of Russian losses, was highly likely to sharpen the debate over the
five-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Siberia, Putin described the ambush as a tragedy
but insisted that laxity on the part of Russian commanders, and not
Kremlin policies, was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room for carelessness,'' Putin said. ``Here we
have to talk about the competence of those people who organized the
movements of servicemen in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party
and a presidential candidate, argued that the Kremlin had led the
nation into a military quagmire and called for a negotiated
settlement. ``The main danger today is a guerrilla war and a wave
of terrorism that could flow out of the North Caucasus to engulf
the whole country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when a detachment of 98 policemen from the
OMON elite militia units set off in nine military trucks from the
Russian military town of Mozdok and headed along a fog-bound road
for Grozny, the devastated Chechen capital that was taken by
Russian forces last month.
</P>
<P>
   The OMON, a Russian version of SWAT teams, are generally used
for riot control and major law enforcement operations. The Chechnya
detachment was assembled from units in the Moscow region.
</P>
<P>
   The militia's mission was to relieve a police unit in the
Staropromyslovsky district of the Chechen capital. The convoy was
not accompanied by armored personnel carriers, which had been
standard practice during most of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, rebels opened fire with grenades on the first and last
trucks in the convoy. Twelve policemen were killed by the initial
volley, which froze the convoy in place.
</P>
<P>
   Mines placed prevented Russian troops from advancing toward the
rebels' firing positions. By the time Russian reinforcements
arrived 20 minutes into the battle, the convoy had been badly
mauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most serious losses occurred during the first two to four
minutes minutes when the servicemen were in the trucks and
unprepared for combat,'' said Gen. Ivan Golubev, the deputy Russian
interior minister who is leading a government investigation into
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-hour firefight the rebels fled. Russian officials
said that up to 50 rebels were involved in the attack and that they
may have come from nearby villages or been hiding among the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action was well prepared and skillfully designed,'' said
Golubev. ``We don't exclude the possibility that the rebels knew
about the movement of this convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor Luchikhin, the deputy commander of the OMON unit from
Sergiyev Posad, a town near Moscow, said that negligence on the
part of Russian forces, not espionage, was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it was betrayal,'' he said. ``I think it was our
carelessness and lack of order.''
</P>
<P>
   The assault pushed the already considerable Russian toll even
higher. Russians officials said Friday that 1,420 Russian troops
and militia have been killed and 3,869 wounded since Oct. 1, the
official start of the military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was hardly the first time the rebels had caught the Russians
by surprise. In early January, the militants launched a
counteroffensive, briefly seizing the towns of Argun and Shali and
ambushing a Russian column on the road near Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians took advantage of their superior fire and larger
forces to regain control. The militants' attacks, however, showed
their ability to elude Russian roadblocks and sneak around the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Thursday's ambush was a rude shock to many Russians
as it occurred just days after Russia's generals all but declared
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders said on Monday that they had delivered a
knock-out blow to the militants after Russian forces seized the
town of Shatoi, the rebels' last major stronghold in the southern
highlands. Russian officials were even talking about starting troop
withdrawals from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military phase of the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya
is drawing to a close,'' Vladimir Rushailo, Russia's interior
minister, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A day later disaster struck. After learning of the ambush,
Rushailo, who oversees the nation's militia, cut short a trip to
Belarus to race back to the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   He described the attack as a ``black page in the history of the
Russian militia.'' Some of his aides suggested that Russian
officers may face criminal prosecution for failing to take
precautions against a Chechen attack.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush dominated the television news Friday night. Instead
of the presidential campaign, viewers saw grim images of wounded
soldiers and heard analyses of a one-sided fight in which the
Chechens bested some of Russia's elite milita.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Russian Interior Ministry troops did not welcome the
news coverage. After the ambush, a television crew from the
state-owned ORT network went to the mortuary in Mozdok where the
OMON dead had been brought. The Interior Ministry troops took out
their frustrations on the ORT correspondent and roughed him up.

 &HT;    Coke adopts casual dress policy
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coke execs are taking off their suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   The company told all its U.S. employees Friday that they could
start dressing casually for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on associates' questions and interest, and consistent
with our desire for more flexibility and agility in our culture,
the time has come for more flexible business attire,'' company
President Jack Stahl told employees in Coke's internal newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The move to casual business attire, from dress attire, comes at
a time when the company is trying to improve employee morale in the
wake of massive jobs cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The dress change is effective immediately and applies every day
_ not just on Fridays or special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The company did point out, however, that suits and ties still
may be appropriate on certain occasions, including when employees
are interacting with customers, partners, visitors and other
``stakeholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Associates should use their judgment to determine how to dress
in a way that is flexible, but still exemplifies a professional
image for our company,'' the newsletter said.

 &HT;    Plaintiffs ask judge to punish Coke
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plaintiffs in the racial discrimination suit against
Coca-Cola want the federal judge in the case to punish the company
for continuing to withhold ``damaging documents.''
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Friday, plaintiffs' attorneys say the material
includes a study of pay equity among African-American and white
employees, and ``an adverse impact study analyzing promotions by
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also is accused of not supplying documents created
after June 9, 1999, and data created after April 22, 1999, even
though it is under orders to turn over material produced after Jan.
1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola's entire discovery strategy is designed to prevent
plaintiffs and the Court from obtaining a true picture of the
company's treatment of African-Americans,'' plaintiffs say in their
motion.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, eight
current and former employees allege Coca-Cola has discriminated
against African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which denies the suit's allegations, declined to
comment Friday on the latest motion.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are now in the pretrial ``discovery'' phase of the
case, in which documents are exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Steven Rosenwasser said the plaintiffs know
the documents and data on pay equity and promotions exist because
they have been provided to the U.S. Labor Department's Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have asked U.S. District Judge Richard Story to

FORMER DICTATOR STEPS FIRMLY ON NATIVE SOIL

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Declared unfit to stand trial in Europe for
human rights violations, former dictator General Augusto Pinochet
projected strength in a triumphant homecoming Friday, lifting
himself out of a wheelchair and walking steadily across an airport
tarmac to the cheers of adoring supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But as military officers saluted him and throngs serenated him,
Chileans victimized or exiled by Pinochet's military dictatorship
angrily questioned whether he escaped justice by fooling British
doctors into believing he was too mentally and physically enfeebled
to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't in a wheelchair despite all that they said about him
being ill and unable to move and that he was a broken man,'' said
Carlos Reyes, director of a London-based group of Chilean exiles
who lobbied to try Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping on his native soil Friday for the first time since his
arrest in Britain 16 months ago, Pinochet smiled, hugging senior
military officials and family and waving to 200 applauding friends,
associates and decorated soldiers at the airport. He cast aside a
wheelchair to walk purposefully with a metal cane to a helicopter
that ferried him to a military hospital in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the 84-year-old Pinochet _ wearing a dark blue
suit, white shirt and lavender tie _ paused and raised his cane to
the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have lots of inner peace that this is finally over and
he's back home,'' said Lucia Pinochet, the general's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival ended an international legal saga that put dictators
worldwide on notice. He still must wait for a Chilean judge to
decide if he must begin another legal odyssey in his own country
for crimes committed during his 17 years of iron-fisted rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constant legal and political pressure to free
Pinochet applied by Chile's conservative president, Eduardo Frei,
no government officials showed up at the airport to formally
welcome Pinochet, now a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 flag-waving supporters crammed the streets around
the military hospital where Pinochet was taken, waiting for a
glimpse of the general from the balcony of his suite.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet opponents, meanwhile, held their own smaller marches
downtown, calling for the former dictator to be tried for
atrocities, such as the 3,197 people who, by official government
count, died or disappeared at the hands of his secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, small groups of anti-Pinochet demonstrators
scuffled with supporters outside the hospital before dozens of
police officers stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Raul Troncoso criticized Friday's
demonstrations by both sides because of the unresolved legal
questions. ``It appears improper to organize this as if it were a
party, in spite of the circumstances under which Pinochet was
allowed to leave London,'' Troncoso said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet critics have asked a Santiago appeals court to strip
Pinochet of his legislative immunity so that he can face 60
lawsuits that have been filed against him in Chile, all of them by
relatives of victims of repression.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, the Frei administration, which is scheduled to
leave office in eight days, is reportedly trying to push Pinochet
to retire completely from pulbic life while allowing him to keep
his parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement cannot be reached, the Pinochet dilemma will
fall to socialist President-elect Ricardo Lagos, who has said his
government will not pursue a deal but rather let the courts decide.
</P>
<P>
   While at the military hospital, Pinochet is scheduled to undergo
another series of tests to check his physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   British doctors who examined Pinochet last month found damage to
the frontal lobes of his brain, which had been caused by a series
of strokes linked to cardiovascular illness and diabetes. They also
concluded that he was unable to stand trial because of memory loss
and a limited ability to understand complex sentences.
</P>
<P>
   It was that diagnosis that led British Home Secretary Jack Straw
to drop extradition proceedings brought by Spain, which wanted to
put Pinochet on trial for crimes committed against Spanish citizens
during his dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing Straw's decision, Pinochet and his wife immediately
boarded the Chilean military Boeing 707, which had been waiting in
England. About 24 hours later, after a refueling stop at an
undisclosed site, the jetliner landed in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's appearance upon landing raised new doubts about
the British teams' conclusions, said Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the
Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical foundation has suspected from the outset that
General Pinochet has sought to present himself in as poor a state
of health as possible in order to avoid extradition,'' Hogg said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Pinochet's return, it remains unclear how Chile will
repair its damaged political and diplomatic relations with several
countries. It has recalled its ambassador to Britain and runs the
risk of hurting an important economic partnership with Spain. Even
Argentina, its neighbor, refused to allow Pinochet's pilots to
cross its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The global tension played out on Santiago's streets, where
Spanish and Argentine reporters covering the developments were
frequently heckled and pushed by angry Pinochet supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our liberator and he freed us from communists and from
becoming a second Cuba,'' said Sandra Torre Alva, a 31-year-old
housewife who joined the thousands of jubilant Pinochet supporters
outside the hospital. ``It doesn't matter what the rest of the
world thinks. We're grateful to Pinochet.''

IN SHIFT, ANALYSTS SAY GOP LIKELY TO RETAIN HOUSE IN 2000

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of twists in their favor,
Republicans have improved their chances of keeping control of the
House in this year's elections, according to party leaders,
analysts and strategists from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of one House Democrat, the decision of another to
retire from his swing district and the fact that fewer Republican
seats will be as tough to defend as anticipated have all
contributed to the Republican turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they are still confident they will recapture the
House but acknowledge that Republicans have made strides since last
fall, when it was widely predicted that the House would switch
hands. A net gain of only six seats would give Democrats control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to put a pinky on the scale,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst who handicaps House races, ``it
would be for the Republicans holding the House.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and strategists also caution that the general
election is a long way off and that much could happen between now
and then to weaken Republican odds, including an increase in
retirements. And, with such a narrow divide between the two
parties, they emphasize that the dynamic of the presidential race
could tip the advantage, depending on which candidates are
nominated and how their campaigns play out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a long way from Tipperary,'' said Paul Begala, a former
senior White House aide and campaign strategist for President
Clinton, who added that Democrats were better positioned on the
issues and had more money than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political report on
individual races, said in his newsletter this month that
``beleaguered'' Republicans ``seem to be getting a few breaks'' and
have ``at least an even-money shot'' right now at keeping control
of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And just this week, a Senate Democratic leader struck a note of
caution about the prospects of his party's winning back the House,
which it lost in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are very overconfident about the House,'' said Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, the second-ranking Democratic leader in the
Senate, in an interview, adding that he believed that Democrats now
stood a better chance to retake the Senate than the House. ``There
aren't that many competitive districts.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls asking people which party's House candidate they
would vote for showed Republicans and Democrats neck and neck, with
Democrats winning more support on the issues. But a recent New York
Times poll gave House Democrats an 11-point advantage. Early last
year, during the impeachment battle, the surveys showed Republicans
consistently lagging by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race for the House is a lot like a really good basketball
game where one side might go up by a couple of points, and the
momentum might shift every few minutes,'' said Amy Walter, a Cook
Report editor who covers the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the perception is that maybe the ball is back in their
court,'' said, Walter, referring to the Republicans. ``But it's
still a tossup.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The critical numbers are these: Republicans need to defend 22
open seats _ those without incumbents, who typically enjoy an
enormous re-election advantage. That is an average number of
retirements, but it is in sharp contrast to the Democrats, who have
only 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more open seats in our favor than in theirs, and
historically open seats in general are more likely to switch
parties than other seats,'' said Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff
for Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But as the matchups in many races have become clear, analysts
agree that there are fewer than a dozen truly competitive races.
The Cook Report concludes that only two of those open seats are
leaning toward changing hands, and both are Democratic seats seen
as likely to go Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to several crucial twists that have gone their
way in the past two months. First, Rep. Virgil H. Goode Jr. of
Virginia, a conservative Democrat, announced in January that he
would become an independent, but would align himself with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Rep. Owen B. Pickett, another Virginia Democrat,
announced he would retire. Republicans have already recruited a
strong candidate for that district, considered Republican
territory, while Democrats are still scrambling. In addition, a
seat in Pennsylvania, now filled by Rep. Ron Klink, a Democrat who
is vacating the seat to run for the Senate, is also vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Pickett and Klink seats are the sole open seats that Cook
rates as leaning toward changing hands.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, they were throwing dirt on the coffin,'' said
J. Kenneth Klinge, a Republican political consultant. ``Now the
coffin is back out of the ground, they've got the dirt off and they
are beginning to take the flowers back to the florist.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, House Republicans, led by Rep. Thomas M.
Davis of Virginia, the chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, made several strategic moves that they say
are starting to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   To calm the jittery nerves of big business, traditionally the
Republicans' strongest ally, Republican leaders brought in Dan
Matoon, a seasoned lobbyist to head the internal operations of the
campaign committee. They also began to draw more on the expertise
of Bill Paxon, the former New York congressman who helped engineer
the 1994 Republican takeover of the House, and Haley Barbour, the
former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   To blunt the Democrats' current financial advantage, the
Republican leaders completed a list of 350,000 new donors, people
the party can rely on to make small, hard money contributions for
individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The donor list is critical,'' said Paxon, now a
lobbyist.``It's the best donor list in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As of late last year, the most recent figures available, House
Democrats had more than double the cash in the bank than
Republicans: $19.8 million to $9 million. While Republicans raised
substantially more money last year, they also spent it to pay off
debts and for the Virginia state races as well as a special
congressional election in California, among other things. The
Republican won control of the Virginia Legislature but lost the
special election.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said money did not worry him too much, adding that
Democrats have only $1 million more than Republicans in hard money,
which comes from individuals and is more difficult to raise than
the unrestricted soft-money contributions from corporations and the
rich, which go to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We way outraised them last time,'' Davis said, ``and we'll
outraise them this time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans usually run into trouble on the issues, and it
is here that Democrats say they are confident they now hold the
edge. So far, Republican leaders have carefully avoided explosive
floor skirmishes and focused on small bills they can pass: tax
savings for married couples, and most recently, a break for working
people 65 through 69 on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But there are land mines ahead _ a proposed overhaul in managed
care, a plan to have Medicare pay for prescription drugs and gun
control legislation, to name three _ that will prove far trickier
and more politically dangerous for Republicans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for the Republicans' strategy on issues so far, Begala said:
``They are selling tax cuts, and nobody is buying. Their whole
approach is very '80s. They pine for Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race is also expected to be a factor.
Republicans, who had built a strategy around Gov. George W. Bush's
popularity, said they still expected him to receive the nomination
over Sen. John McCain. The good news, they argue, is that voter
turnout in Republican primaries is sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running with Bush or McCain you have a little bit of a
different dynamic,'' Davis said. ``But with everything going on
here, I don't see anything that at this point does anything but
good things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dispute that rosy view, saying Bush has been weakened
in the primary campaign and will no longer carry the party to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is scrambling to raise money to get himself elected,''
Elmendorf, the Gephardt aide, said, ``and he is not going to be an
advantage to them.''

PURSUING PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because British doctors found him mentally unfit to stand trial
in Spain for crimes against humanity, Chile's former dictator,
General Augusto Pinochet, was able to elude prosecution abroad and
return home Friday. For survivors of the tyrant's killers and
torturers, and for relatives of the murdered and the disappeared,
Pinochet's homecoming betokened a thwarting of justice.
</P>
<P>
   On the night before his return, 500 Chileans conducted a
candlelight vigil in front of La Moneda, the presidential palace
that Pinochet's mutinous troops bombed and strafed during his
military putsch of Sept. 11, 1973. The demonstrators chanted, ``No
to the amnesty, no to immunity, the blood of the dead is not
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Their chant was a way of saying that political niceties must not
stifle the requirements of justice. Terrible crimes were committed
under Pinochet's regime; he ordered them, and he has not been
punished. Another unmistakable message of the vigil in Santiago was
that the pursuit of justice did not come to an end in London.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to the political leaders of a democratic Chile to
decide on lifting the immunity that Pinochet enjoys as a senator
for life, thanks to the constitution created when he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy to bring to justice the 84-year-old
patriarch of Latin American fascism. Although a judge of the
Santiago Appeals Court is currently investigating 60 criminal
complaints against Pinochet and there is no shortage of witnesses
to testify against him, he cannot be tried for the crimes committed
during his reign without a constitutional change. And he still has
fierce partisans in the military and among Chile's traditional
elites.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult as it may be to judge and punish Pinochet in Chile, it
must not be forgotten that his case before the Law Lords in
Britain's House of Lords has established a legal precedent of great
significance for the cause of human rights. The Law Lords found
that there is no sovereign immunity for Pinochet or others like
him; their exercise of state power cannot protect them when they
travel abroad. This Pinochet precedent will outlive its namesake,
and may save many lives.

   PARIS _ Watching from overseas in the 1990s, it was often hard
to tell just what the NBA was. Was it a sports league; a global
merchandiser; a public relations company building a global brand?
Or was it a bit of all three?
</P>
<P>
   After the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when millions of
non-Americans were hypnotized by the artistry of Magic Johnson,
Michael Jordan and the rest of the Dream Team, the National
Basketball Association started pushing harder to make its logo, and
the superstars who populate its universe, household images
worldwide. By and large, it has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are problems. The NBA is hurting a bit on the home
court, where average attendance at games is depressed, television
ratings have sunk to their lowest level in a decade, and
merchandise revenue has plummeted. And many assumptions about
global growth have been cast into doubt, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, sales of jerseys, balls and backboards are flat, as
is television audience growth. Magazines about the NBA draw fewer
readers than they used to. There is no crisis, but as in the United
States, the figures partly reflect the impact of the owners'
lockout that canceled 464 games last season, as well as Jordan's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   But they also underscore the challenge of keeping fans who are
an ocean apart from actual sweating, dunking teams from spending
their sports money elsewhere. In 1998, the soccer World Cup in
France captured audiences outside the United States; last year, the
rugby World Cup began a wave of rugby-inspired fashion.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the 57-year-old NBA commissioner, is not fazed. The
league is expanding its network of offices abroad, and the league's
Web site, a vehicle for sales, is popular outside the United
States. Recent deals to bring pro basketball more actively onto the
Web by making its games and its products available to fans
worldwide via computers, televisions and phones are expected to
revive revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing ahead unabatedly,'' Stern said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the league opened an international headquarters in
Geneva after hiring Paul Zilk, a former Nestle executive, to run
global operations. In 1997, Zilk moved the headquarters to Paris,
then opened smaller offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mexico City, and
most recently Milan, Italy, and Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The investment paid off, as kids from Melbourne, Australia, to
Marseille, France, donned Chicago Bulls jerseys, sending
merchandise sales soaring. They also took part in league-sponsored
clinics or swapped NBA trading cards. A tournament started in 1988
and sponsored by McDonald's was polished up after the Barcelona
Olympics. Held every two years in different cities, it drew large
numbers of fans to watch league champions play international teams.
</P>
<P>
   Added revenue flowed in through the sale of television rights,
as cable and digital networks proliferated. By the time of this
year's All Star Game, the NBA was broadcasting to more than 240
countries in 44 languages. By the mid-1990s, league executives were
predicting overseas revenue growth of 15 to 20 percent annually _
but after 1997 growth actually stagnated or fell.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not that the NBA was alone. Major League Baseball spread its
wings, particularly in Latin America and Japan; the National
Football League played exhibition games abroad and in the early
1990s started a league in Europe. And National Hockey League games
are broadcast to about 180 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA has had the most success, partly because basketball,
like soccer, requires little equipment. Moreover, basketball is
already played by amateurs and professionals alike in many
countries, notably in Europe, and the league gets most of the
credit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich Woestehoff, spokesman for Premiere World, a German
digital channel controlled by the Kirch Group, said the channel
broadcasts about 1,000 hours of American sports a year, including
baseball, hockey, football, and track and field, but nearly half is
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Denisot, director of sports programming at Canal Plus in
Paris, said fans of American sports want just two things: pro
basketball and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The image of American sports in the European imagination is what
makes them attractive to broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally started with the NBA,'' Denisot said. ``It's part
of our history and our identity. It's modern, it's young, it's
creative, and those are our ideals.'' Canal Plus broadcasts about
50 league games a year, including the All Star Game and the
playoffs. It also owns the broadcast rights for Spain and Italy,
the biggest NBA markets in Europe, after Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   As basketball thrived, so did the culture it created. In
sporting goods stores, like the Decathlon chain in France, or the
Footlocker unit of Venator, which opened hundreds of stores in
Europe in the 1990s, NBA jerseys and other products were hot items.
</P>
<P>
   To feed interest in basketball superstars, magazines sprouted
widely. In both France and Germany, a half-dozen dedicated to the
NBA popped up. ``The explosion came after the Dream Team, in '93
and '94,'' said Frederic Lesmayoux, editor of Mondial Basket, the
No. 1 basketball magazine in France.
</P>
<P>
   What also drew young Europeans was the growing presence of
European players. From Germany, Detlef Schrempf went to the Indiana
Pacers, but now plays for Portland; more recently from France,
Tariq Abdul-Wahad joined the Orlando Magic, but is now at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But the magic of the NBA has faded. In Europe, as in the United
States, the league was hurt by the lockout and Jordan's retirement.
It also fell victim to changing fashion tastes. With the NBA off
the TV screen and Jordan gone, sales of merchandise fell.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though the league will not say how much of a decline has
occurred, a measure of it came in 1997 when the league approached
Adidas, now known as Adidas-Salomon, about selling NBA apparel
outside the United States. Adidas, after a year of talks, declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt there wasn't value in it,'' said Tom Harrington,
the executive who negotiated for Adidas. ``A kid in Germany buys a
Bulls shirt, although he's never seen a Bulls game, and maybe never
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Zilk left, and his job is being filled in New York
by Stern.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Television executives insist they have clung to a hard core of
loyalists, but there, too, interest is down. In Germany, DSF, a
sports channel owned by the Kirch Group, recently moved its NBA
broadcasts to 11 p.m. from late afternoon, despite protests from
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Jordan's withdrawal, growth came to a halt,'' Woestehoff
of Premiere said.

<P>
   To be sure, the league continues to push the game, via
television, into the world's untapped nooks and crannies. After
signing up four new stations this fall _ in Malta, Kazakhstan,
Serbia and Montenegro _ the NBA boasted that it could reach 650
million households abroad, more than six times the American figure.
But how many are actually watching from abroad is impossible to
determine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the league runs into bureaucratic hurdles. Two years
ago, British broadcast authorities forced the private broadcaster
Channel Four to drop its NBA and NFL coverage because it had too
much American material on the air. Pro basketball immediately found
an alternative in the Independent Television Network.
</P>
<P>
   But other evidence suggests that in major markets interest in
the NBA is flagging. In 1992, after the Dream Team's triumphant
march, a publisher in Cologne, Germany, started Basket, one of four
or five new German magazines about the NBA. In five years,
circulation climbed to 50,000. After the lockout, it plummeted to
25,000, though it has since clawed its way back to about 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 12 months, interest has been low,'' said the
editor, Robin Barberan. Of five German monthlies, only two survive.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lack of interest is apparent in France. Circulation at
Mondial Basket, one of five French magazines dedicated to the
league, has dropped to about 50,000, half what it was in the years
immediately after Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It corresponds to a trend in fashion,'' Lesmayoux, the editor,
said. ``In France, rap and street were popular; now, that's
passe.'' The market for sports apparel, he estimated, is down about
a third.
</P>
<P>
   Little of this appears to upset Stern. Indeed, if anything, it
serves to steel his resolve to thrust changes already under way
within the NBA out into the global business.
</P>
<P>
   To increase the league's reach, officials are considering
opening offices in Warsaw, Poland; and Shanghai, China, to go with
those just added in Munich and Milan. For 2000, he said, the league
is projecting revenue outside the United States of about $500
million, unchanged from recent years, thanks to increased sales of
videocassettes and electronic games to offset the decline in
apparel. The league has been approached to support regional ``super
leagues'' in Asia and Europe. But he said putting NBA teams abroad
was not part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and overseas Stern puts much hope in the
Internet. Five years ago, the league began NBA.com, which now draws
some 4 million visitors a week, about a third from overseas. In
November, Stern began NBA.com TV, making the league the first to
manage its own network via satellite and digital cable. The screen
carries images in one corner and streams of statistics and news
scrolling across the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Stern announced a deal with Barry Diller of
USA Networks to sell league merchandise on the Internet and on
Diller's Home Shopping Network. The league is already talking to
overseas broadcasters, including ITV2 in Britain, to provide a
24-hour NBA channel.
</P>
<P>
   But can the league successfully hawk merchandise via the
Internet if it cannot do so in stores?
</P>
<P>
   David M. Carter, principal of the Sports Business Group, a Los
Angeles sports consultancy, called the Internet push a ``very
positive trend.'' He said Stern was being encouraged in this
direction by team owners like Ted Leonsis, president of America
Online Interactive Properties, who owns part of the Washington
Wizards, and Mark Cuban of Broadcast.com, who paid $280 million
last month for the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter added: ``It will not be easy to pursue what he's
doing overseas.'' For one thing, Internet use abroad significantly
lags that of the United States. Moreover, can interest in the NBA
be sustained without actually having teams nearby?
</P>
<P>
   Stern said it could. Planting a franchise flag outside North
America, he said, is ``less remote than five years ago, but it
doesn't seem close in the short to medium term; I don't see that as
the model.''
</P>
<P>
   The model, he says, is the rock concert. ``Sell lots of
records,'' he said. ``Tour occasionally.''

KENNEDY'S UPLIFTING CANDOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representative Patrick Kennedy performed an important service
when he told a Rhode Island political gathering that he has been
treating depression with medications. In doing so, he demonstrated
that it is possible to lead a successful career while coping with a
mental condition requiring medical treatment _ an example to
counter the stigma still applied to those who suffer with mental
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Democrat in his third term, was taking part in a
campaign appearance Tuesday with Tipper Gore, the vice president's
wife. She too has told the public about her own bouts of depression
and about treatments she has undergone.
</P>
<P>
   Depression is an insidious condition that can undermine
self-esteem and disrupt normal life. But it can be overcome enough
for remarkable accomplishments. Abraham Lincoln is thought to have
had periods of serious depression, yet he is regarded as perhaps
America's greatest president. Ludwig von Beethoven, the great
German composer, was similarly afflicted. Winston Churchill
referred to periods of depression in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Depression strikes about one in 10 Americans at some time in
their lives, with varying durations. In extreme cases it can lead
to suicide, but it diminishes the lives of all sufferers, as well
as their families and associates. Mental illness costs nearly $100
billion annually in lost productivity and is ranked by the World
Bank as the fourth leading cause of disability in developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other even more disabling mental illnesses,
depression remains a stigmatizing condition that unnecessarily
deprives society of the full contribution its sufferers can make.
That stigma probably accounts for the fact that Kennedy is only the
third member of Congress to say publicly that it has been a
problem, although raw statistics suggest several others have
similar difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, great strides have been made in the clinical
treatment of depression through the use of drugs. Kennedy's
comments advance the day when such conditions are no longer
debilitating.

OVERLOOKED ISSUES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tax cut proposals and abortion have received a vigorous airing.
Al Gore and Bill Bradley have had a mostly healthy debate on race.
George W. Bush and John McCain have discussed religion, mostly in a
divisive way. But too many major policy issues have not been
addressed at all, or only perfunctorily, by any of the candidates
for president. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --One tax issue never mentioned is the impact of the Social
Security tax on low income workers. The tax is 6.2 percent on
incomes up to $76,200, which means that someone making $40,000 a
year pays $2,480, while a $200,000 income levels results in a tax
of $4,724, proportionally much less. The income subject to the tax
has gone up over the last 20 years, but far slower than top-end
salaries. The Social Security program is popular because all
segments of the population contribute to it and receive benefits,
but surely it is time to adjust the tax to reflect the burden it
imposes on workers with moderate or low pay.
</P>
<P>
   --An abiding national scandal is the fact that 43 million
Americans have no health insurance. Bill Bradley, to his credit,
proposes a plan to reduce that number, mostly through tax
incentives that would make coverage more affordable, while Al Gore
favors smaller steps. But neither comes close to the universal
coverage promised by Gore and candidate Bill Clinton in 1992, and
the Republicans are nowhere on this issue. Meanwhile, the number of
uninsured has risen by 4.4 million since 1992. There is a consensus
that society has an obligation to provide for the medical needs of
the elderly through Medicare and for poor children through
Medicaid. Are adults of working age any less worthy?
</P>
<P>
   --American peace and security have not annulled history's ebb
and flow. Crucial strategic and moral questions will have to be
faced by the next president and should be aired by the candidates.
Voters should know how the candidates propose to deal with Russian
aggression on its borders and the debilitating effects of the
Russian kleptocracy. There has been a superficial discussion of
Beijing's threats to Taiwan, but the crucial elements of China
policy require more substantive debate, as does the willingness of
the candidates to invest in a comprehensive peace for the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   --If ever there was a moral question that cried out for public
debate, it is the horror of slavery in Sudan under the regime of
the National Islamic Front. The branding and selling of human
beings in southern Sudan should be condemned by any American
president. The candidates should be telling voters what they would
do to break Khartoum's food blockade in southern Sudan and to end
that regime's genocidal policies of forced Islamization.
</P>
<P>
   --One issue that bridges foreign and domestic policy is the
environment, a problem that respects no boundaries. Since 1997,
when 159 nations meeting in Kyoto agreed to reduce the greenhouse
gases that are warming the climate, carbon pollution in the United
States has only increased.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, Gore may bear the most responsibility for
this lapse because he went to Kyoto and held himself up as the
premier protector of the environment. Bradley says he would pursue
the Kyoto goals ``in a cost-effective manner.'' The Republicans are
skeptical. All four need to address fossil-fuel pollution and ways
to lessen it.
</P>
<P>
   Voters should demand that candidates address such issues, more
crucial to the nation's future than much of what passes for
campaign debate today.

EICHMANN'S ADMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 5, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because free and unconstrained historical inquiry is the best
antidote to distortions and falsifications of the past, future
generations will benefit from Israel's release this week of Adolf
Eichmann's self-serving 1,200-page handwritten memoir of his role
in the Third Reich's bureaucratic annihilation of 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when neo-Nazis in Europe and North America are
attempting to deny the Holocaust and the Syrian regime of Hafez
Assad is pretending the genocide supervised by Eichmann was a
Zionist ``myth,'' it should be evident that there will always be a
need to have as much documentation as possible about what
Eichmann's manuscript calls ``the greatest crime committed in the
history of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate, however, that the immediate reason for
Israel's release of Eichmann's prison writings is a need to assist
in the defense of Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
has been sued for libel in a British court by David Irving. The
notorious Irving alleges that Lipstadt defamed him in her book
``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has tried to claim that Hitler never knew the full
truth of what was being done in the death camps, claims that he
cannot be called a Holocaust denier merely because he questions the
number of Jews murdered and denies that the Nazi death machine
administered by Eichmann included the use of gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   A good cause will be served if Eichmann's prison writings help
disprove Irving's charge of libel. Despite their transparent and
contemptible pretense that he was merely a ``cog in the giant wheel
of the Third Reich,'' Eichmann's memoirs offer a detailed
perpetrator's account of what he calls genocide _ ``Volkermord.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the pursuit of historical truth does not belong in
a courtroom. It should not be up to even the most fair-minded judge
or jury to decide if a historian has lied about the past or been
defamed by another historian. Not even when the subject in dispute
is the ultimate evil of the genocide that Hitler's heirs wish to
deny.

   THIRD OF FEBRUARY, Mozambique _ The old people called to each
other from the treetops, and their cries soon filled the night.
</P>
<P>
   One grandfather wept that his crippled wife had been swallowed
by flood waters. Another man shouted, ``Plane, plane!'' as a
shimmering sliver streaked through the sky. But the plane passed,
leaving the wrinkled men and women clinging to swaying branches
like birds with broken wings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after having been stranded for five days in the trees
above the flooded Limpopo River valley, the survivors finally
stumbled from a military helicopter onto firm ground. But their
rescue from this submerged village _ named for the date that marks
Heroes Day _ solved only one of their pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' said Joaquim Novunga, a 73-year-old
farmer, who lost his cattle, his house and his village to the
floods that have devastated this country. ``Now, how will we
live?''
</P>
<P>
   This misery in Mozambique, a country that has been heralded as
one of Africa's success stories, has played out most vividly in
this week's dramatic rescues of nearly 9,400 people. But the
economic consequences, while less visible, are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that about a third of the
Mozambique's corn _ Mozambique's staple crop _ has been destroyed.
The government says that more than 250,000 acres have been washed
away, more than 40,000 cattle have drowned and 141 schools have
been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mozambique, which was expected to have one of the
fastest-growing economies in the world, may see its gross domestic
product shrink by as much as a third as thousands of people find
themselves without work or a place to live, according to officials
familiar with the government's finances.
</P>
<P>
   And government officials, who had hoped to focus this year on
boosting the blossoming economy, will now find themselves
scrambling to build thousands of homes, replace washed-out roads
and feed tens of thousands of people who have lost their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need, the government has already issued an
urgent appeal for $65 million. But so far, only $13 million has
come through, the United Nations said. Nearly 1 million of this
country's 17 million people have either lost housing, farms or food
supplies to the floods that began in February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've been telling people, `Let's get through the immediate
crisis,''' said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the United
Nations' World Food Program, which estimates that at least 500,000
people will be unable to feed themselves for the next six months.
``But the devastation to the infrastructure and economy is
massive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the shifting priorities, relief workers began
emphasizing the emergency delivery of food and supplies Friday as
the flood waters and the number of people stuck in trees or on
rooftops declined.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots for the South African National Defense Force, which has
led the search and rescue effort, say they are seeing fewer and
fewer stranded people. The defense force plans to send three
helicopters flying over the Limpopo River valley on Saturday to
assess exactly how many people are still waiting to be rescued.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, relief workers say, the most crucial needs are food, tents,
medicines, plastic sheeting and blankets for the thousands of
people who lack food and shelter. In Chiaquelane, for instance,
nearly 30,000 people desperately need such items.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding has also severely damaged the country's
infrastructure, knocking out bridges, making many major roads
impassible and preventing the free movement of people, cars, and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer possible, for instance, to drive directly from
Maputo, the capital, to Xai Xai, which is near here. The narrow,
two-lane road simply ends in muddy water in the town of Palmeira,
forcing villagers to slog through the waist-high tide to carry
sacks of corn meal to friends and relatives on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a team of high-ranking ministers from Mozambique and
other flood-affected countries _ which include South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe _ met in Pretoria to assess such damage and
to develop a program to rebuild the regional infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   And next week, the World Bank plans to send a team to Mozambique
to conduct a full evaluation of the flood and its impact on the
country's economy, which was expected to grow by about 8 or 9
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank representative based in Mozambique, James Coates,
who advises and monitors Joaquim Chissano's government, said he
believes the country's economy will recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is going to be significant, but it's not a death
bell,'' Coates said. ``It's a setback, but it's something the
Mozambicans can manage and deal with. The real problem, of course,
is the humanitarian crisis and all the lives at risk.'' The
humanitarian crisis here cannot yet be precisely measured. No one
knows exactly how many people have died, for instance, although
relief agencies have estimated that thousands were killed by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
   But the toll is clearly visible in the red eyes and weary faces
of the survivors, who were battered again last week when Cyclone
Eline pushed the angry Limpopo River beyond its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, their entire world was water, with thatched roofs
floating in the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Matevelo, who believes he is about 69, said he was
sleeping on Sunday night when the water rushed into his house. ``My
father told me when the water gets up high to climb high,'' he
said, explaining how the villagers ended up in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   They survived by eating the carcass of a dead bull, drinking the
muddy flood water and frantically waving for help.
</P>
<P>
   But when the roaring, Oryx military helicopter finally rescued
them this afternoon, pulling them from the trees into the arms of a
South African soldier, they began to wonder if they could ever
truly remake their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Luckier survivors, who were processed along with everyone else
at the refugee center in nearby Chibutu, managed to salvage
something useful _ a wooden hoe, a plastic plate, a pair of sturdy,
rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12 people who flew out of this village Friday left most
of their best things behind. Some of their most valuable
possessions _ a black metal pot, a blue suitcase with red-trim, an
orange plastic water jug _ remain tethered to the green, tree
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Novunga bundled his clothes into a leather bag and tied them to
his shoulders with rope. He has spent his entire life as a farmer,
working the land, but now he does not even own a handful of seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have even a plate,'' he said. ``It's all in the
water.''

A HEATING OIL RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, March 6, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's suggestion that America's strategic
petroleum reserve might be used to help stabilize world oil prices
was obviously an attempt to influence markets, but it had little
effect as oil prices _ at least briefly _ set nine-year highs.
Clinton could, however, stave off a repeat of last month's price
spike by establishing a fuel reserve of heating oil that could help
reduce wild price swings.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic reserve of crude oil was established after the
1979 Iranian revolution to cushion Americans from political
disruptions of oil production and sales. By itself the reserve
could not do much to stem price increases resulting from either
genuine shortages or arbitrary production cuts by the oil cartel
OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   After years of being no more than marginally effective in
controlling prices, OPEC recently pulled itself together long
enough to create tight markets in crude oil, driving up prices,
improving its members' revenues, and making its production quotas
easier to live with for countries (Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran among
others) that used to produce more than OPEC permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Some OPEC leaders say that their ultimate objective is to
stabilize oil prices at about $25 a barrel, compared with $31 a
barrel at the end of February and with less than $10 a barrel in
late 1998. This price may be the level at which OPEC can get
maximum revenue without provoking increased exploration and
development of oil by non-OPEC competitors and still be a price
that does not disrupt customer economies.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil, a refined product of crude, is a different matter.
Last month's price spike was caused by failure of American oil
companies to build adequate inventories to cope with surges in
demand brought on by severe cold spells or interruptions in
refining and shipments of heating oil. That failure was the result
of fear that oil prices were going to drop rather than rise _
reasonable, perhaps, but wrong. A publicly held reserve would have
at least dampened the price hike. Such a reserve should be
established to help avoid a repeat performance.

<P>
   The seven weeks of ups and downs that have enlivened the
presidential campaign since the Globe made presidential
endorsements before the New Hampshire primary have only reinforced
our confidence in those choices.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore entered the race as possibly the
best-qualified candidate ever, having gained invaluable domestic
and foreign policy experience through a genuine delegation of power
from President Clinton _ and this on top of a successful career in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Gore has shown remarkable steadiness, responding
to attacks but keeping his eye on his own forward-looking issues,
especially the primacy of educational improvements. He has made
gradual progress toward a goal he deserves _ the delicate task of
taking credit for his White House experience while distancing
himself from Clinton's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain has contributed to the
rough-and-tumble nature of the Republican primaries, in most cases
by keeping to his belief that truth and candor, while sometimes
awkward in the short run, will serve the candidate and the country
best in the end.
</P>
<P>
   This has drawn in thousands of citizens who say they likely
would not have voted except for McCain's fresh approach. McCain's
proposals give evidence that he can be trusted to cut taxes and
reform the military and the campaign finance system sensibly.
</P>
<P>
   While they differ markedly on an array of issues, Gore and
McCain are the most experienced candidates in each party on foreign
affairs, and they also demonstrate the deepest understanding of the
new worlds of technology and telecommunications. This means that
each is the best candidate in his party to lead the nation's own
economy and its participation in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reaffirms its endorsements of Democrat Al Gore and
Republican John McCain in Tuesday's primaries in Massachusetts and
10 other states.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ With only four days left before crucial
primaries that are likely to seal his fate as a presidential
candidate, former Senator Bill Bradley defied conventional
political wisdom on Friday and spoke about foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that has not been a major concern of voters this
year, Bradley offered his most detailed remarks to date on
America's foreign policy, criticizing the Clinton-Gore
administration's handling of Russia and China and promising to
pursue a broadly internationalist policy.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the next president should be able to juggle rapid changes
in globalization and technology, Bradley said it was essential to
reduce barriers to trade, capital, immigration and ideas. But he
also said it was crucial for America to have a consistent foreign
policy and military infrastructure, _ something he excoriated the
current administration for failing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past decade we have sometimes been the world's
volunteer fire department, a role that we have executed with
considerable success,'' Bradley said before a boisterously
supportive crowd at Brown University. ``But we have been
inconsistent about when we would act and when we should stand
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no major surprises in his 50-minute speech, as
Bradley elaborated on the foreign policy framework he sketched in
November, in a short speech and question-and-answer session at
Tufts University. But the timing certainly raised some eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley talked about his foreign policy agenda in November,
his aides indicated that a fuller accounting would come in weeks.
But weeks turned into months. So now, with Mr. Bradley trailing
badly in most polls, and Super Tuesday just four days away, the
idea a weighty policy speech with the gravitas of a master's thesis
did not exactly seem like a strategy from Political Campaigning
101.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the speech almost sounded like the reading of an
important, thoughtful statement into the Congressional Record, with
an eye as much on posterity as on constituents.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the timing, Eric Hauser, Bradley's campaign
spokesman, said Bradley wanted to demonstrate leadership and
showcase a command of complex international issues, gained in part
from serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 8 of his 18
years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into a national political primary, and foreign
policy is something that people ought to know where the leaders
stand,'' he said. ``This just proved to be the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, which capped a day of campaigning before
student-dominated crowds in here and in Portland, Maine, Bradley
first talked about the importance of electing a president with the
ability to make the world a smoother place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision of this new world is one of increasing
interconnectedness,'' he said, using a turn of phrase that might
seem more apropos for an Internet speech. ``Our challenge is to
keep lowering barriers between countries so that goods, capital,
people and ideas can move even more freely and help people of
different nationalities, races and religions to co-exist and
cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   He then criticized the Clinton-Gore administration as being
inconsistent, he said, on what he described as the world's four
other major powers: Russia, China, Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the administration for failing to articulate a clear
policy on China and Taiwan, saying: ``Unfortunately, the
Administration's inconsistent signals have confused both Beijing
and Taiwan, and thereby increased the risk of miscalculation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was particularly critical of the administration's policy
on Russia, calling it ``perilously counterproductive'' and saying
it had ``resulted in a situation in which the world's only other
nuclear superpower is coming apart at the seams, a situation that
makes the world a far more dangerous place than it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Vice President Al
Gore, dismissed Bradley's foreign policy record in the Senate,
noting that Bradley voted in 1984 against sending aid to Nicaraguan
rebels fighting the Sandinista government, only to reverse field
and vote for it in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have much standing to criticize the Clinton-Gore
foreign policy records, when his own record is a series of waffles,
flip-flops and bad votes,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise of the day, though, was that
Bradley veered from his prepared text after the policy address and
launched into a version of his stump speech. He sounded almost
wistful about his days as a student at Princeton and tried to tout
the virtues of politics to the standing-room-only crowd of 350
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way you move ahead as a country; it's a way we shape
our common future,'' he said. ``Your generation of Americans can be
a great generation.''

NYSE AND NASDAQ DISCUSSED MERGER _ BUT THE IDEA DID NOT ADVANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock
Exchange have held informal discussions regarding a possible
merger, but nothing came of them, people briefed on the talks said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That the two markets _ historically bitter competitors that have
regularly claimed superiority over each other _ had even discussed
the idea was another indication of just how much the structure of
stock market trading is now in flux, with the introduction of new
electronic networks and with both the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Congress pondering what changes need to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations were reported in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   One person briefed on the talks said that Richard Grasso, the
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, had made an informal
overture to Frank Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent organization, but that nothing
had come of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a private placement memorandum, a part of which was provided
to a reporter, Nasdaq disclosed the talks but gave no details. That
memorandum was issued in connection with efforts by the exchange to
sell stock in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the two organizations would not discuss the talks
in any detail, but Robert Zito, a Big Board spokesman, said that
``everyone in the industry has been talking to everyone else in the
industry for 18 months.'' Andrew MacMillan, a NASD spokesman, said
there were ``no current negotiations'' with the New York Stock
Exchange.

   Mars Inc., the candy giant, is giving ``The Adventures of Rocky
and Bullwinkle,'' the coming summer film, a chilly reception _
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Mars is using the cartoon duo's imaginary home, Frostbite Falls,
Minn., in a tie-in promotion to get children and adults to enjoy
frozen Milky Way, Snickers, Twix and Three Musketeers bars.
</P>
<P>
   The candy maker is one of seven promotional partners linked to
the movie, which will mix live action with animation a la ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit.'' Universal Studios has also licensed more
than 60 Rocky and Bullwinkle products, from gifts to home
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   The film updates Jay Ward's slyly subversive 1960s cartoon
series, whose Cold War satire and groaning puns made it as popular
with adults as with children. This time, live actors will play the
heavies: Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as Boris and Natasha, the
hapless Pottsylvanian spies, and Robert De Niro as their Fearless
Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction for Mars, besides the nostalgia value and the
obvious fit with Frostbite Falls, was the timing _ candy sales
usually dip in the warm weather of summer, when the promotion will
run, said Michelle Weese, a Mars spokeswoman. ``We just thought it
would be a cool thing to be associated with,'' she said. &QL;

 &HT;     BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE FOR WOMEN'S VOTE IN NEW YORK  
 &HT;     (Eds: Adds 3 grafs on Texas studies, quote from McCain
campaign; pickup: McCain made no)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John
McCain battled Friday for the influential women's vote in New
York's Republican presidential primary, a contest McCain has said
he must win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put McCain on the defensive with radio commercials accusing
him of voting to cut federal funds for two New York-based breast
cancer research programs. The two programs _ at New York University
Program in Women's Cancer and the North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health System's breast cancer program _ were among a list of $13
billion in projects that McCain's web site characterized as
``garden variety pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush highlighted the breast cancer issue by visiting a breast
cancer awareness program at Stony Brook Health Sciences Center on
Long Island. Long Island has one of the nation's highest rates of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters, ``I don't think the senator should be
squealing about pork and then squealing when somebody disagrees
with one of the cuts he wants to make.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 primaries on Super Tuesday when 591 of the GOP
convention delegates will be selected. New York will provide 101 of
those delegates and McCain has said he must win the state in order
to offset his expected losses in California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, women are an influential swing constituency, with
recent elections showing that a successful candidate in New York
must garner the support of women.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, two Texas organizations for women released
information critical of Bush's record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Women's Policy Research, an Austin-based
coalition of health groups for women, said that 4-in-10 women over
the age of 50 in Texas have not had a mammogram in the past two
years and that Texas is last among the states for the number of
uninsured women.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas Campaign for Women's Health said Bush did not
support the group's request for $40 million in state funds for
breast cancer screening, a program that has been endorsed by the
state health commission.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki joined Bush at the Stony Brook
campus and complained that ``time and again, Sen. McCain has voted
against our interests.'' The governor said that what McCain called
``garden variety pork'' is instead ``important research funds to
help us beat cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded to Bush's criticism by citing his 18-year
congressional record of voting for breast cancer research. He also
touted his unsuccessful effort to levy taxes on the tobacco
industry that would have generated $50 billion in federal revenue _
some of it for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-cancer research projects sometimes are buried in
controversial appropriations measures approved by Congress that
also include treasured pet projects back home that critics dub
``pork barrel spending.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview on the Don Imus ``Imus in the Morning''
radio talk show, said the Bush campaign ad distorted his voting
record on breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've voted for it many times,'' McCain said, adding: ``It's
really an unfortunate part of American political campaigns when the
Bush people would pay for such an outrageous statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and former
congressman leading McCain's campaign here in New York, said the
Bush campaign had unfairly isolated two cancer programs among
nearly 800 so-called ``pork barrel'' spending projects that McCain
had criticized for inclusion in multi-billion dollar appropriations
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said McCain had opposed the measures not on merit but
because lawmakers had sneaked the spending into the final
legislation without scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said the Bush campaign
attacks on McCain's record were using a ``cheap trick'' of
isolating McCain's votes on legislative maneuvering to portray him
as an opponent of the spending. Davis accused the Bush campaign of
trying to boost the gender gap ``with divisive advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no reference to the fact that his sister, Sandy
McCain Morgan, has been treated for breast cancer at Johns Hopkins
University. Morgan told Salon Magazine in a telephone interview
that her cancer was in remission and that she was ``very grateful
for my brother's support for breast cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to steer the campaign debate back to his own
insurgency message of ending the influence of special interests in
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery address in the Wall Street financial district, McCain
decried a mysterious, $2 million advertising blitz launched in New
York by a mysterious group calling itself ``Republicans for Clean
Air.'' The ad attacks his record on clean air environmental
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the ad, paid for by an unknown organization with a
post office box in Virginia, underscores the impact that special
interests can have in election campaigns using undisclosed,
unregulated soft money contributions to launch message ads without
formal ties to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain railed against ``big money _ from God knows where _ that
distorts the election'' and urged New Yorkers to ``send a message
back to the special interests that we're sick of your influence in
New York and in America and we want our government back.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Texas investor Sam Wyly, a prominent Bush supporter, was
identified as the sponsor of the ad. Bush denied there was a
connection between his campaign and the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's successful effort to put McCain on the defensive over his
record on breast cancer research could bolster the edge that Bush
already enjoys among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rolled up a 16 percentage point edge among women voters in
Virginia's Feb. 29 primary and a 14 percentage point advantage in
South Carolina's Feb. 19 contest, contributing to decisive
victories that rescued his then-faltering campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Michigan's Feb. 22 presidential primary where Bush lost
to McCain, Bush held down the margin of McCain's victory with the
help of women voters; Bush trailed McCain among women in Michigan
by 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ousted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in 1998, thanks in part to a 19-percentage point
edge among women. Republican Gov. George Pataki quelled a
Democratic challenge for a second term in 1998, with a 19
percentage point edge among women. Pataki was able to defeat
Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 when Cuomo's support
among women wavered.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton captured the state in 1992 and 1996 with a
substantial edge among women, holding a 35 percent edge among women
voters over Republican challenger Bob Dole in 1996 and a 24 point
edge among women voters in 1992 when he defeated President George
W. Bush.

 &HT;    Wireless is music to Internet convention
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Internet: It's not just for desktops anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere, anyplace, anyhow'' was the slogan of nearly every
speaker and analyst to take the stage at the annual Jupiter
Consumer Online Forum downtown at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevermind broadband,'' said Richard Bressler, CEO of Time
Warner Digital Media. ``It's wireless. You can do it, and you can
do it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cable,'' he said referring to Time Warner's cable
franchise, one of the largest in the country. He pointed out that,
despite its size, it only reaches about 20 percent of U.S. homes.
``So if we don't think about wireless, we'll get our lunch eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which plans to merge with Time Warner by the end
of this year, made key deals last month with several wireless
providers, including BellSouth and Sprint PCS. AOL will provide
wireless-tailored content to those providers for use by AOL and
wireless subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   While Bressler talked about the cable and wireless combination,
Universal Music President Edgar Bronfman Jr. outlined his own
vision of bringing digital downloads from both famous and unknown
artists to the Web in a way that will benefit consumers, artists
and ultimately Universal. Bronfman, who parlayed his family's
wholesale liquor business into a multimedia empire including
Universal Pictures, Universal Music and the USA Network, spoke with
optimism about the Web as the next and possibly most profitable
vehicle for selling music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop thinking about selling people round things,''
Bronfman said in his keynote address Friday to the more than 1,600
attendees gathered here from as far away as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the Internet is about the opportunity to get more
music to more people in more places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His statements echo the strategies of other Internet and
traditional executives who hope to give users a positive Internet
experience on any electronic device, from a desktop PC to a
wireless phone or personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman even predicted a day when a button on a car radio would
let users instantly order or download songs they might happen to
hear while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we ask music buyers to do a lot of work,'' he said.
``They have to listen to the radio, try to remember who the artist
is and then go somewhere else to make a purchase.'' He went on to
outline a strategy for a collection of secure sites where users
could sample, download and purchase music from Universal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it's still all about money, and Bronfman
knows that many music purchases are impulse buys. He plans to use
the Web to make music buying easier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student may have time to wade through thousands of MP3
links, but the average consumer doesn't. They want something that's
quick and convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It facilitates impulse buying,'' he said. ``For example, when
you hear a song you like, you aren't always near a music store. But
if you're online, you are one, maybe two clicks away from making a
purchase. Music and the Internet is truly a match made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, particularly when it came to music, he wasn't
worried about the new format replacing any existing formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience shows that if you build it and it's better, they
will come,'' he said, noting the development of recorded music from
old 78 rpm records to mini-disc technology and now digital
downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman painted a rosy picture of happy music lovers buying
music literally around the clock, but the same old question came up
of whether users will pay for online content. However, unlike years
past, the answer for the first time seems to be a qualified
``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the creators want to get paid, content won't be free,''
said MTV Interactive President and CEO Nicholas Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   MarthaStewart.com emissary, COO Sharon Patrick summed up thus:
``When you have to make that Halloween costume for your child and
you've only got two hours to do it, you'll pay.'' She got a
standing ovation.

DELAWARE COUPLE WHO ABANDONED DISABLED SON AVOID TRIAL BY AGREEING
TO PROBATION  
(DW)

<P>
   The couple who abandoned their severely disabled son at a
Delaware hospital last December have agreed to a year's probation
instead of a trial in Delaware, and to limit contact with their son
to supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Richard and Dawn Kelso of Exton, Pa., a Philadelphia
suburb, had been charged with child abandonment and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos dropped their 10-year-old son, Steven, off in his
wheelchair at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in
Wilmington, Del., on Dec. 26 and left. Their actions drew national
attention from parents and advocates for children with
disabilities, and the Kelsos later told state prosecutors that they
had been facing a reduction in the visiting nursing care in January
and did not know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the couple apologized in a statement issued by
their Wilmington lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our approach at the hospital was flawed because of the
stress under which we were operating, we are sorry,'' the couple
said. ``We thought we were doing what was best for Steven at the
time. We love Steven very much, and achieving his best interests
has been our, and is our, primary goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had taken Steven to the emergency room, his
wheelchair loaded with his toys and clothes. ``I don't want to see
a nurse,'' Mrs. Kelso said as she left, when the receptionist asked
her to wait for a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, 62, is president and chief executive of the PQ Corp., a
chemical company in Valley Forge, Pa. Mrs. Kelso, 45, recently
completed a three-year term as a volunteer board member of the
Pennsylvania Developmental Disabilities Council, which advises the
state on issues affecting people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea arrangement the Kelsos reached on Thursday, four
days before their trial was to begin, the Kelsos admitted to the
abandonment charge and accepted a year's probation. Among the terms
of the probation is that they cooperate with the Chester County,
Pa., Department of Children, Youth and Families, which retains
custody of Steven. If convicted, they could have been sentenced to
two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who has cerebral palsy and who breathes and eats through
tubes, remains at the hospital, where he had often been treated
before he was abandoned. His parents will be able to visit him only
under supervision while he remains in county custody, but Jim
Forsythe, executive director of the department, said the goal would
be to put the boy back in the care of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing a plan for Steven just as we develop a plan
for all of the kids in our custody,'' Forsythe said. ``And our goal
is always to try to reunite the children with their families, so
that is still our primary goal in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Apostolico, a deputy attorney general for Delaware, said in
a statement that the abandonment had been a difficult and emotional
case, but that the Kelsos' cooperation and absence of prior
criminal records made the plea agreement the right course.
</P>
<P>
   Steven's plight brought national attention to the Kelsos, most
of it sympathetic. In their statement, the couple thanked people
who had written supportive letters. They even thanked the press for
news coverage that focused more on the difficulties faced by a
middle-aged couple rearing a disabled child than on the fact that
they had abandoned him.

WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL SENTENCES CROATIAN FOR ATROCITIES IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An international tribunal in The Hague sentenced a
Croatian general, the highest-ranking military commander yet
brought to trial, to 45 years in prison Friday for war crimes
committed during the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
sentenced Gen. Tihomir Blaskic for ordering a series of attacks on
Muslim villagers in Bosnia between 1992 and 1994 while his forces
were trying to secure the area for Croatia. It was the harshest
sentence handed down by the tribunal since the United Nations
created it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, the court also indirectly indicted the government
of former President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, openly stating that
Zagreb had overall control of the Bosnian Croat authorities and
Blaskic's militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic of Croatia did not content itself with merely
remaining a spectator on the sidelines or even seek simply to
protect its borders,'' the ruling read. ``It intervened in the
conflict, pitting Muslims and Croats of central Bosnia against each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic, 39, was convicted for crimes against humanity, war
crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, which deals
with the protection of civilians during war. Although he was not
charged with ``killing a Muslim by his own hand,'' the judges said
that as commander of the militia, the so-called Croatian Defense
Council, he was responsible for personally ordering attacks and for
failing to prevent or punish crimes committed by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   In Zagreb, officials of the new government immediately
criticized the verdict, saying that Blaskic had been far more
moderate than many Croatian nationalists. ``There is no doubt that
the sentence is very harsh and I believe it will have to be
re-examined in the appeals process,'' Prime Minister Ivica Racan
said on Croatian radio.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the ruling of the three-judge panel, Judge Claude
Jorda cited a long list of atrocities by the Croatian militia
against terror-stricken Muslims in the villages of Bosnia's Lasva
Valley, where hundreds were killed and many were beaten, raped or
burned alive in their homes. One of the worst examples was the
rampage in the village of Ahmici, which led to the death of more
than 100 men, women and children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The crimes you committed, General Blaskic, are extremely
serious,'' Jorda said. ``The acts of war carried out with disregard
for international humanitarian law and in hatred of another people,
the villages reduced to rubble, the houses and stables set on fire
and destroyed, the people forced to abandon their homes, the lost
and broken lives, are unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that as the sentence was read out in the
courtroom, Ratka Blaskic, the defendant's wife, broke down and
sobbed while he remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Croatian nationalist extremists threatened
Ante Nobilo, one of Blaskic's lawyers, who then moved his family
temporarily to The Netherlands from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The general's defense lawyers had argued that the commander was
powerless to stop the Croatian militiamen because they were
``poorly trained recruits'' in a new and ill-organized command. But
the judges ruled that the court had more ``evidence than it needs
to note that the chain of command was operating satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expressed satisfaction with the verdict and said the
sentence had helped achieve their goal of judging the most senior
commanders of the war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a turning point,'' said Paul Risley, spokesman for
the prosecutor's office. ``In previous sentences, we've been forced
to deal with the foot soldiers and camp guards and the like who
carried out crimes. Now we are moving to the more senior
commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Three senior Bosnian Serb commanders are now in custody in The
Hague, and their trials are expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic's trial took 25 months and involved testimony from 158
witnesses and some 30,000 pages of evidence. It has been held up,
both inside and outside the tribunal, as an example of how the
court should not function, paving the way for reforms meant to
speed up the proceedings.

THE REAL BOTTOM LINE FOR ALL THIS FREE STUFF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best things in life may not be free, but lately a lot of
pretty good things can be had for practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice, for instance, is one of many newspapers that
are now distributed gratis. There are also no-fee credit cards,
free income tax software and even free computers. In the investing
world, of course, there are no-load mutual funds, not to mention
stock-trading commissions that seem to be fast approaching zero.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, of course, is truly the land of the free _ from
free e-mail, voice mail and fax services to access to Encyclopedia
Britannica and major newspapers and magazines of every stripe.
Linux, the upstart operating system that some people see as a
challenge to the hegemony of Microsoft, is free, too. And until
Microsoft scotched the idea recently, there was even talk of making
Windows free.
</P>
<P>
   With news of $30-a-barrel oil and $2.85 million for a
one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, Alan Greenspan is hardly the
only one worried about inflation. In such a climate, it is
deceptively easy to overlook the opposite trend: all the cheap
stuff bubbling up to the surface of our economy. And the cheapest
of these goods and services _ the ones that cost nothing _ are
notable as harbingers of long-term social and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this free stuff is aimed at affluent people, who
in effect are trading on their status as sales leads. That suggests
that the trend offers yet another way, besides marrying each other
and investing in Internet stocks, that the rich will keep getting
richer.
</P>
<P>
   A further implication is that the recipients will be obliged to
surrender more of their already depleted store of privacy. But
despite considerable hand-wringing, they probably won't mind very
much, because even though their lives have become a more open book
to strangers, they already enjoy unprecedented physical privacy
from the people they really care about _ their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the affluent do not perambulate in watchful
villages. They cruise sprawling suburbs behind tinted windshields.
For most people, this supposedly horrifying arrangement has proven
remarkably congenial, and it doesn't appear likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing in life is really free. Providers of free
information may hope that the recipients will pay by listening to
advertisers' messages; providers of free computers make the
recipients sign long-term Internet access agreements. Yet many of
us find that the costs of our new free services are borne mainly by
other consumers, suggesting that we are at the threshold of a
golden age of free riders.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring here to turnstile jumping, but to arrangements
like no-fee credit cards with grace periods. People who pay in
full, and on time, get free use of a bank's money for a month,
underwritten by customers who maintain outstanding balances.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, investors in index funds get to ride free on the
coattails of the costly research and investment decisions made by
others, decisions in the absence of which the stocks in the index
would cease to rise. If you read this column on a Web site instead
of buying the paper, you would be free-riding, too.
</P>
<P>
   Can all this continue? Some of it surely can, because the rising
tide of free services reflects two long-term trends that show no
sign of abating. The first is global competition, which has a way
of making even things that aren't free amazingly cheap. Consider
the labor, materials and capital investment that went into what you
are picking up for a song at Wal-Mart or Costco.
</P>
<P>
   The second trend is a technology-inspired acceleration in the
commodification of goods. Is there really any material difference
between brands of vodka or cola or comparably equipped personal
computers? Stock-trading systems, mutual funds, Internet access and
other goods and services are becoming ever more alike. Even cars,
within a given model class, are more difficult than ever to tell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Given a decently managed money supply, how do you raise prices
in this environment, or stand out in the crowd? I predict
ever-higher premiums attached to marketing, which already occupies
a hallowed place in American business culture.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be innovation, naturally. Building a better
mousetrap always holds out the possibility that people will be
willing to pay more for rodent control. That won't be inflationary,
if the mousetrap really is better.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the possibility reminds us that the best mousetrap
is always likely to cost something, and that even in Freebie
Nation, you get what you pay for, one way or another. &QL;

<P>
   As the secular philosopher Mae West once posited, too much of a
good thing can be wonderful. Though she wasn't thinking of
horsepower, low-end torque and high g's on a skid pad, the racy
lady would no doubt have admired enthusiasts' primal urge to drive
faster, stop quicker and hang tighter in corners.
</P>
<P>
   Such desires are being particularly well sated by European
carmakers. Starting with something sensible _ capable sport sedans
with room for several adults _ they add sensuality in the form of
lusty engines, beefy suspensions, sexy wheels and grippy tires.
These are Clark Kent automobiles with a bit of Superman's cape
peeking through.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has mastered the art with cars from its M works. Mercedes is
turning out a whole line of rockets from its AMG tuning shop. Volvo
has worked with Tom Walkinshaw Racing, and Saab has transformed its
9-3, as sensible as shredded wheat, into the Viggen, the very model
of turbocharged anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Audi, too, has been playing the game in Europe, but only now is
it bringing one of its ``S'' cars to this country. The S4 is based
on the compact A4 sedan, still one of my favorite cars at any
price. But while the A4 has a turbocharged four-cylinder or a
normal-breathing V-6, the S4 gets a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6 that
makes 250 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive, it produces 258 foot-pounds of torque at just
1,850 rpm. The S4 zooms from zero to 60 in about 5.5 seconds; it
launches from stoplights like a mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Every A4 is a delight to drive, with a suspension that stays
buttoned down, excellent steering and brakes that mean business.
The S4 has some added attractions. Crucial components of the
suspension (four-link front, double wishbone rear) are made of
aluminum, the suspension is lowered a bit and the handling benefits
from 17-inch alloy wheels, borrowed from Audi's Avus concept car,
plus wide 225 tires. The ventilated disc brakes are beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, all S4s have quattro all-wheel drive, an
option on A4s. Quattro varies the power to all four wheels, all the
time, providing as much bad-weather prowess as most sport utility
owners are likely to need _ in a much more comfortable, sensible
package, if you ask me.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth generation of quattro detects the spin of a wheel and
redirects power from side to side to take advantage of any wheel
that does have traction. Audi boasts that while some
traction-control systems cut power when a wheel spins _ what it
calls a ``disabling technology'' _ quattro is ``enabling,'' since
it prevents the wheels from spinning, in theory, to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   With this much power trying to spin the wheels, it is good to
have some help. The S4 engine started as the 2.8-liter, 30-valve
V-6 of the A4, but Audi reduced the displacement to get stronger
cylinder walls. The two small turbos, one for each bank of
cylinders and each with an intercooler that lowers the temperature
of air forced into the engine, provide quicker response than a
single large turbo.
</P>
<P>
   Driven with a light foot, the V-6 gives few clues to its
potential, feeling nearly as demure as the plain-vanilla engine on
which it is based. But when driven aggressively it responds in
kind. Stomp the accelerator in second gear, with the tachometer
needle at 2,500 rpm, and the power doesn't just build; it surges,
tugging you back in a tightly bolstered sport seat.
</P>
<P>
   On a steep mountain road I drive regularly, the S4 zoomed up in
fourth gear on a stretch where I'd usually downshift to second or
third; its third gear handled climbs where I usually shift to
second, or even first.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an unfortunate trade-off. The six-speed manual
shifter is rubbery and out of character. Throws between gears are
too long, and a vagueness forces the driver to hunt for a gear or
risk missing it. One cannot help but make an unfavorable comparison
to the crisp Getrag shifters of BMW's M cars.
</P>
<P>
   Worth considering is the S4's five-speed Tiptronic, a
``manumatic'' that changes gears with a tap of the shift lever,
without a clutch. The six-speed actually detracts, rather than
enhances, the S4 experience.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does this Audi have the jittery, sporty edge of the M3, a
rear-drive car that feels best near its limits. The Audi handles
nearly as well, perhaps better in some maneuvers, gripping the road
like a baby primate clinging to its vine-hopping mom.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly be my choice in rain, sleet or snow. Yet
while its proficiency is never in doubt, it is a little less fun to
toss around than the M3.
</P>
<P>
   The S4's subtlety carries through to its trim. The only clues to
its special status are small badges on the grille, deck lid and
steering wheel, plus the larger wheels and a front bumper with
gaping air intakes.
</P>
<P>
   The car can be ordered with special colors, like Imola yellow
and Nogaro blue, either of which could catch the eye of a state
trooper in the next county. If you order the sport interior, you
get suede seat and door inserts _ eye-catching but bordello-gaudy _
in the same colors.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments are as good as the A4's have always been, with
red-lighted gauges and controls right at hand. The optional sunroof
is controlled by a nifty dial with detents that let you instantly
open it just so.
</P>
<P>
   Audi's timing is impeccable, since it now has the compact
supersedan market pretty much to itself. Mercedes has stopped
making its C43 and there will be no M3 until that car returns this
year in the new 3-Series body. The Viggen is far less polished and
far harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its shifter, the S4 is hard to fault. At $37,900, it
is $9,110 more than the A4 2.8, but that may be a small price to
pay for the envy of those in the know. As West also said, ``It's
better to be looked over than to be overlooked.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a people falls in love as deeply as Americans have with the
sport utility vehicle, there is money to be made. So auto
manufacturers have scrambled to produce an SUV to meet every
conceivable niche, and even some inconceivable ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the breed has grown from the pioneering
International Scouts, Jeep Cherokees and Ford Broncos to embrace an
ever-expanding universe.
</P>
<P>
   These have ranged from Lilliputian two-seaters like the Suzuki
X-90 to mastodons like the Ford Excursion, from snarling war
machines like the Hummer to leathered luxocruisers like the Lexus
LX 470, from car-SUV blends like the Subaru Outback to sci-fi
creations like the Isuzu VehiCross. More are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In this feeding frenzy, the definition of sport utility has
hopelessly moved beyond the original notion of a truck with a
covered bed and four-wheel-drive to manage the hunting trail. It
now covers virtually anything that has big, knobby tires and a
hefty dose of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there must be limits somewhere. And in my subjective
view, the Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG is somewhere just beyond them.
Yes, this is the M-Class sport utility built in Alabama, which
normally comes as an ML320 (with a 3.2-liter V-6) or an ML430 (with
a 4.3-liter V-8).
</P>
<P>
   These trucks have been praised for their design and their
competence on and off the road, but criticized, at least at the
beginning, for less-than-Mercedes levels of quality.
</P>
<P>
   But once the power-loving makeover artists at AMG, the in-house
performance tuners of Mercedes-Benz, pump the power up to 342
horses, bolt on 18-inch, 50-series sport tires and paint the brake
calipers bright red, are you not taking things just a notch too
far? I mean, niche marketing is the name of this game, but does
anyone really need an off-road vehicle capable of going 141 miles
an hour?
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes says that people who buy the ML55 will be those who
want a Porsche 911, but need utility. I have no doubt there are
people like that. Me, for example, and probably you.
</P>
<P>
   But a vehicle that has its center of gravity somewhere near a
Porsche's roof line, weighs almost two and a half tons and pushes
the aerodynamic equivalent of a sheet of plywood down the road is,
sorry, a truck. Conversely, a van with racing tires and a
supersophisticated 5.4-liter V-8 capable of sprinting from a stop
to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds _ a time recorded by Car and Driver
magazine _ is not the sort of truck you'd use to tow the fishing
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you may say, but how does that differ from the LX 470 or
the Cadillac Escalade, or the new BMW X5, vehicles that also show
little sign of longing for the great outdoors? True, the effect is
similar. But the difference is that AMG deliberately set off to
turn a competent sport utility into a hot rod, with all the
sacrifices in off-road prowess that implies.
</P>
<P>
   The ML55 sits eight-tenths of an inch lower than its humbler
M-Class siblings, and though that still leaves it with a
respectable 7.6 inches of ground clearance, the sport tires, the
nervous power and the stiff suspension beg to be left on a straight
and level road. I drove the ML55 onto a wet lawn and had trouble
modulating the power enough to get off the grass without scorching
some worms.
</P>
<P>
   Enough complaining. Let's accept that this is a very powerful
and sophisticated truck, big enough to move a college student to
campus, fast enough to run with the best and different enough to
make whatever statement you may be wanting to make.
</P>
<P>
   The latter might require some guidance, since the Germans are
not into yawning hood scoops, huge lettering and heavy chrome. But
once spotted, the two big bulges on the hood (nonfunctional!), the
red calipers peeping through the five-spoke wheels and the two big
chrome exhausts do give off an aura of excessive muscle. And
inside, the dark burled walnut, twinkling dash and nice leather
whisper ``class.''
</P>
<P>
   The power is very, very nice, especially when delivered through
all-wheel drive. AMG started with the 5-liter V-8 from the big
S-Class sedans and stretched it to more than 5.4 liters, to make
342 horsepower at 5,500 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the general trend of softening the ride on upscale
models, AMG stiffened the shocks, planting the huge tires firmly on
the road. It all made for some fun accelerator-stomping around
town, some brisk cruising on the Interstate and some pretty
impressive handling in the twisties, though there's something about
sitting high above the pavement that argues against roaring
headlong into a hairpin.
</P>
<P>
   The price is about $65,000, not so bad in the rarefied realm of
luxury SUVs, but high enough to pose a serious question: Is this
souped-up van really worth 20 grand more than an ML430, which is
not that much slower, and really can go off-road?
</P>
<P>
   Another nit: the centerpiece of the ML55's dash is a fancy
control center intended to handle the stereo, phone and navigation
system, the on-board computer and probably some other functions.
But despite considerable poking and arguing we never really
mastered it, and even if we had, the driver should not even try.
</P>
<P>
   We did get the navigation system working, but as we approached
New York City on Interstate 80, pointed directly at the George
Washington Bridge and headed for the Upper West Side, the computer
stubbornly insisted that we use the Tappan Zee Bridge, some 20
miles to the north, or the Lincoln Tunnel, 15 minutes south. Only
after the last exit was behind us did the navigational whiz
reluctantly accept our decision to take the most direct route into
Manhattan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: It's fast. It's fun. But it ain't a Porsche.

 &HT;    Coke changes waiver stance
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a sudden and rare about-face, Coca-Cola said Friday
it will allow laid-off black employees to participate in the racial
discrimination lawsuit against the company while still qualifying
for enhanced severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's move, described by observers as a wise public relations
decision, came just 24 hours before African-American employees were
scheduled to meet at St. Philip A.M.E. Church to talk about actions
they might take to try to change the company's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply overjoyed,'' said Larry Jones, a laid-off manager
and chief organizer of today's meeting. ``I think this is a
tremendous victory for all employees _ not just black employees _
and, in the end, it's a victory for the company. ... We will
absolutely have a monumental celebration. It will sound like Sunday
morning in the sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   The company changed its mind, despite the fact that it has
prevailed on the issue in court so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, this decision was guided by our desire to treat
all of our employees with dignity, respect and fairness,'' said
company President Jack Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fairness issue that Jones and other black employees
called into question when the company had required laid-off
employees to sign a release form giving up the right to sue Coke in
the future to get enhanced severance benefits. Those benefits
amount to about double the regular severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For African-American employees, the old policy meant that they
could not get the more lucrative benefits while participating in
the discrimination suit as a plaintiff or as a member of a class,
if the judge certifies the case as a class-action in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview prior to the company's change of heart, Jones
described the gut-wrenching decision hoisted on black employees as
a ``diabolical scheme.'' Take the enhanced benefits now, or take
your chances that the class will be certified down the road and
you'll share in some settlement or award.
</P>
<P>
   The company had maintained that it was just following its
standard operating procedure for reducing its litigation exposure
from departing employees. Employment experts also said it is common
for companies to offer enhanced severance benefits to eliminate
future legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies, however, are not in the middle of a
discrimination suit in which the class certification issue is still
up in the air while layoffs are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, about 150 employees attended a meeting at St.
Philip to discuss what to do, and Jones expects hundreds more
current and former employees at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the release form, or waiver, issue started to
mobilize black employees for the first time since the
discrimination suit was filed nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original release form, Stahl acknowledged in a memo Friday
to all employees, ``has contributed to confusion at a sensitive
time. ... For that reason, and to ease the challenges facing our
departing employees, we are modifying this waiver requirement, so
as not to apply to any claims against the company filed and still
pending in any court as of Jan. 12, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the date eight current and former employees filed their
amended suit, claiming the company discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
They are seeking class-action status to represent about 2,000 black
salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has denied the allegations in the suit and has opposed
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl also said the company will cancel the release forms that
laid-off African-American employees already have signed. Instead,
they will receive new forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted by the company's change of position,'' said
plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri. ``As we've always maintained,
this is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Management experts also praised the company's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another situation where that's been done
across the board for a population,'' said Rick Cobb, vice president
and national director at Challenger Gray &AMP; Christmas. Often, when
companies take a stand on a sensitive issue such as severance
agreements, he said, they tend to ``dig in their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   By extending this olive branch to workers, Coke is sending two
signals, said Daniel Rodriguez, an assistant professor at Emory
University who has studied downsizings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the incoming leadership is showing flexibility and that
it is attuned to employees' needs,'' Rodriguez said. ``And two,
they're saying, `Hey, we need to go ahead and eliminate some of the
distractions on our plate so we can focus on what Coke's all about:
maximizing market share, revenue growth and profitability.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before the company's turnaround, Jones, the organizer, said
employees would be discussing a ``national strategy.'' He would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But after Coke's announcement Friday, Jones said, ``We will now
reassess the initiative we were anticipating.''

NOISE-REVIEW)) 
(DW) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I had one idea,'' Simon McBurney, the director of
``The Noise of Time,'' said Friday. That idea was to listen to the
15th Quartet of Shostakovich ``in another way.'' He added quickly:
``I'm not suggesting that there was one way. The way the mind
decodes music is an individual mystery. But the physical
circumstances can change the way you listen.''
</P>
<P>
   McBurney changed the physical circumstances radically. As Philip
Setzer, one of the violinists of the Emerson String Quartet, put
it: ``We move around; we play on a raked stage; we play standing;
we play in the dark; we play by memory; we play separated from one
another. We are not used to doing any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Each musician has a silent someone following him around _ four
actors, one for each quartet member, carrying chairs, clapping
noiselessly, just sitting. ``Like Shostakovich's music,'' Setzer
said, ``they function on many levels. They are a Greek chorus. They
are the people. They are the part of us that listens.''
</P>
<P>
   But long before the Emerson had come out onstage, the audience
had been primed to listen differently. It had just been through a
theatrical evocation of Shostakovich's life performed by the
Theatre de Complicite, which McBurney heads. During the drama a
disembodied voice had floated the haunting question, ``Can music
lie?'' An answer was offered but it was just as enigmatic as the
question: Music can lie, but ``only if it is used like a language,
like a code.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Shostakovich use music like language? His rhythms did
occasionally contain a kind of Morse code. For example, he used the
rhythm dot-dash-dash in his 10th Symphony, which was not only a
coded reference to the name of a woman with whom he was in love,
but was also, McBurney said, the code for ``I am on fire and have
dangerous cargo on board.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th Quartet, you keep hearing the rhythm, dash-dot-dot.
It turns out this is not only Morse code for the letter D (the
first letter of Shostakovich's first name), but it also means
``Keep away, maneuvering with great difficulty.'' These are odd
collisions of meaning that McBurney relishes.
</P>
<P>
   As Setzer put it: ``Music can function on different levels.
Shostakovich had to write music that would pass the eyes of the
horrible people judging him. Thus, until recently Shostakovich was
discarded as simplistic enough to pass the eyes of the Soviet
regime. His music was viewed as a compromise. There were
constraints on what he could say. But what he was saying was
powerful'' and more complicated than anyone suspected.
</P>
<P>
   How does this relate to the actual events in Shostakovich's
life? In one sense all the events presented onstage are parts of
his life: it is true that Shostakovich played music in a movie
theater that burned down while he was playing. It is true that
Stalin personally called him up on the phone. It is true that he
had to denounce himself as a Formalist. It is true that he composed
a piece that Yuri Gagarin sang from outer space. It is true that
everyone came to know his music by listening to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the biographical content that McBurney is
concerned with: ``Everything in the drama that leads up to the
musical performance of the quartet relates to the numinous side of
the events in Shostakovich's life,'' he said. ``Shostakovich's
final pieces, his quartets, are scratching the surface of another
world.'' The radio, the fear of skiing, the images of flight, the
association with Gagarin, the fire in the movie theater, even the
Morse code relate to this numinous world.
</P>
<P>
   Take Shostakovich's relationship to Gagarin. Shostakovich not
only composed a piece that Gagarin sang in space. He was also, like
Gagarin, a Soviet icon, a puppet, or as Shostakovich called
himself, ``a cut-out paper doll on a string.'' The song that
Gagarin sang in space was called ``The Motherland Is Listening.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, McBurney said: ``It is a great piece of Social
Realism. But it's also ironic.'' Here you have a picture of the
motherland eavesdropping. ``The irony,'' he says, ``is already in
the language itself.'' In the Soviet Union, McBurney suggested:
``No one knew what was true and what was false. Photographs were
retouched.''
</P>
<P>
   When a work was not up to Communist Party standards, McBurney
said, people would say, ``It does not conform to the idea of Soviet
reality.'' So even the idea of what is real and what is false was
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   The very first moment in McBurney's drama brings the
slipperiness of truth to the fore. A man comes out onstage and
announces that the BBC is recording the performance. He directs the
audience to be silent for a moment and then to applaud when he
signals. There is grumbling in the audience: ``I don't know if I
want to applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   As some people guessed, the BBC recording was bogus. But,
McBurney said, the experience did contain a grain of truth. It
showed ``the terrible tyranny of applause.'' The audience resented
being bullied into clapping. This kind of order made the audience
``want to be silent,'' McBurney said. And that had a special
meaning for Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   Mstislav Rostropovich, the cellist, used to visit Shostakovich,
so that they could sit together in total silence for an hour.
Shostakovich used to say, ``Come quickly,'' and then they would
just sit silently together. ``He had an urgent need to be silent,''
McBurney said. Then he would say, ``Thank you, goodbye.'' Those, by
the way, are the last words that are uttered in the play before the
musicians come onstage to perform the quartet.
</P>
<P>
   When McBurney first began listening to the Shostakovich 15th
Quartet, he said he thought each movement was ``a meditation upon
death,'' but after a while, he said, ``I began to think it was more
about leave-taking.'' All the movements are a different kind of
leave-taking.
</P>
<P>
   This is a certain kind of musical truth. And a certain kind of
historical truth. ``It is extraordinary,'' McBurney said, ``There
are things in his music which tell us about our time,'' and which
you can only hear in retrospect. Then McBurney quoted Aleksandr
Blok, the Russian Symbolist poet: ``History is the noise of time.''

NORTHRIDGE HOPES CONFIDENCE DOESN'T WANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a moment of self-doubt, when the fear of
``Oh no, this can't be happening again!'' crept into the collective
mind of the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Matadors fought back. This time, they didn't fold
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge regained some of its early-season confidence in
Wednesday's 76-62 whipping of Weber State, and nowhere was that
more evident than in the first two minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' Harold Arceneaux scored the game's first five
points coming out of halftime, cutting an 18-point CSUN lead to
just 13, 41-28, with a little less than 19 minutes left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   WSU had plenty of time to come back, just like Eastern
Washington did the week before in coming from 12 down in its 70-68
win over the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Then CSUN's Markus Carr made two consecutive layups, the second
a pretty reverse that eluded Arceneaux, and CSUN's lead was back to
17 - 45-28. Thirty seconds later, Jeff Parris fought for an
offensive rebound, got a basket inside and was fouled by Arceneaux.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever momentum Weber State had was gone for the night; WSU
scored six points in the next five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys stepped up and made a couple of plays and got our
defense locked back in again,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said.
``That's what made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN carries a two-game winning streak into tonight's
regular-season finale against Sacramento State at Matador Gym. The
Matadors (17-9, 9-6) are 26-7 all-time against the Hornets (9-17,
3-12) and have won the past seven games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge was rejuvenated against Weber State, frustrating the
Wildcats into 34.6 percent shooting and handing them their worst
loss in the Big Sky this season.
</P>
<P>
   The difference: WSU came into the game with a 113-92 win over
Northridge on Jan. 29 and the conference's top offense (78.0 points
per game). Right behind the Wildcats, though, was CSUN (77.7), but
defense was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In its first meeting against Weber State, Northridge gave up 76
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to play the hardest we could on defense, and that's
what we did for most of the game,'' CSUN center Brian Heinle said.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play hard, we can be a pretty bad basketball
team,'' he said. ``Our goal tonight was to play 40 minutes the way
we did the last eight minutes of the Portland State game. That's
just hard, all-out, nothing to lose, not holding anything back,
wanting to be absolutely spent, tired, when you're done.
</P>
<P>
   ``All 12 or 13 guys believed that (Wednesday).''

FINDING WAYS TO DABBLE IN CUBA, LEGALLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the custody battle over little Elian Gonzalez in the news
nearly every day, the Cuba question is again on many minds,
including those of some frustrated American investors who see
opportunities slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union fell apart, President Fidel Castro has
been forced to flirt with capitalism and the United States dollar
he once despised. Investors from Canada and many other countries
have poured huge sums into Cuba. And a few Americans are putting
their money into third-country companies and closed-end funds with
exposure to Cuba _ although the legality of some of this investing
by Americans is, at best, blurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics aside,'' said Enrique J. Lopez, a Cuban-American
telecommunications consultant in Hialeah, Fla., ``Cuba is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The embargo enacted almost 40 years ago still forbids direct
American investments. The Cuba-U.S. Trade and Economic Council, a
business group based in New York, advises Americans that investing
in a foreign company doing business in Cuba is legal so long as
they do not own a controlling stake in the company, and provided
that Cuba is not the source of more than half its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But government regulators say the council is interpreting the
exceptions too broadly. Both sides agree that buying into a company
like Sherritt International, a Canadian mining concern, is
prohibited because a majority of Sherritt's assets are in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But other investments are less clear, and the Office of Foreign
Assets Control is reluctant to offer guidance.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent trap facing investors in Cuba is the Helms-Burton
law, enacted in 1996, which prohibits business executives who use
property that Castro confiscated from American owners from entering
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuban investment plays are not for the faint of heart. But
they have the advantage of already being in place if, and when, the
embargo ends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest Cuban ventures is Leisure Canada, a Vancouver
development company. It expects to break ground in April on a
370-room tourist hotel on a 2-square-mile beachfront property
between Havana and the resort of Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban state tourism company will put up $7.5 million in
equity, which will be matched by Leisure Canada. The remaining half
of the $30 million project will be financed by some Canadian
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid problems with the Helms-Burton law, Wally Berukoff,
chief executive of Leisure Canada, said he investigated 443
properties before selecting sites that he was satisfied had no
American links. But the bet for American investors is that the
embargo will not be in place by the time the hotel is up and
running, in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure Canada trades on Canada's new national exchange, the
CDNX. Share prices hit a high in the last year of $3.50 (Canadian)
but now trade at $1.78. Analysts expect the stock to remain flat
until construction is complete. Berukoff believes that 10 percent
to 15 percent of the company's 3,000 shareholders may be Americans.
And Robertson Stephens owns 26 percent of Leisure Canada through an
offshore fund.
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Snyder, president of Snyder Capital Management in San
Francisco, recently decided to buy into Leisure Canada. ``At these
prices,'' he said, ``the stock is kind of a perpetual option on
Castro and the future of Cuba without him.''
</P>
<P>
   More adventurous investors may be tempted to get into the Beta
Gran Caribe fund, a British closed-end fund that is not waiting for
Castro's government to fall. The fund already has 14 investments in
Cuba valued at $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mostly holding things at cost, anticipating real
increases in three to four years,'' said Peter A. Scott, chairman
of Beta.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent investments are in biotechnology. The fund,
for example, owns about 5 percent of York Medical, a private
company in Toronto that tests and licenses Cuban medical
breakthroughs like a promising anticancer vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Beta is traded on the Dublin Stock Exchange, but can also be
bought through Cedel, a European clearing house. Shares traded
recently at 4.75 Swiss francs. Scott said he did not know if
Americans participate because he never asks investors to identify
themselves. ``In theory, we care if Americans are involved,'' he
said. ``But in practice, we're not going to know anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   One way around the regulatory morass could be the closed-end
Herzfeld Caribbean Basin fund (ticker symbol: CUBA), which has
about $9.8 million invested in companies outside Cuba, many of
which would benefit from Castro's fall. The fund returned 22.9
percent last year, and closed at $5.125 on Friday, off 4.7 percent
for the year to date. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fund's top holding is Florida East Coast Industries, which
runs a railroad from Miami to Jacksonville. Thomas J. Herzfeld, the
fund's manager, says that if the embargo is lifted, the railroad
would be used to haul goods shipped to and from Cuba. Its stock
closed at $40.75 on Friday, off 20 percent from its January high.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a speculative Cuban bond play. Herzfeld's fund
holds $165,000 in face amount of Cuba's sovereign debt, known as
``Batista bonds.'' Herzfeld bought them for $63,000 in 1995 and
said they could be worth as much as $291,000, including interest,
if paid in full. (The bonds are now valued at zero.)
</P>
<P>
   Americans eager for a piece of Cuba can also invest in companies
that stand to benefit if the government pays off its debts. The ITT
Corp. used to own the Cuban telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   When ITT split into three companies in the 1990s, each inherited
part of a $130 million-plus-interest claim on property confiscated
by the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian company that now runs the Cuban telephone system is
paying ITT's successors a total of $30 million over 10 years for
the right to temporarily use the confiscated property. If the claim
is ever settled, the smallest of ITT's offspring, ITT Educational
Services, with a market capitalization of $361.5 million, could see
a modest bump up in its shares.

INVESTING WITH MICHAEL E. HOOVER: EXCELSIOR ENERGY AND NATURAL
RESOURCES FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic of Excelsior Energy &AMP; Natural Resources Fund is

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, OPEC might as well stand for Oil Prices are
Exorbitant, Chump.
</P>
<P>
   The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil was $31.51 a
barrel on Friday, up from $12.91 just 12 months ago, as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have
continued to confound the pundits by more or less sticking to the
production cutbacks they imposed in 1998. The world's hunger for
oil, meanwhile, has grown.
</P>
<P>
   But little of this squeeze is evident in the prices of energy
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the most significant value opportunities in energy,''
said Michael E. Hoover, 46, who runs the $57.5 million Excelsior
Energy and Natural Resources fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in his fund aren't likely to be complaining about high
prices at the gas pump. Excelsior Energy returned 34 percent in the
12 months through Feb. 25 while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index has returned just 8.4 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.,
the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   When energy prices were low, Excelsior Energy, which has often
invested in a variety of commodity and cyclical stocks, took a more
defensive stance. It assumed heavy stakes in utilities, gas
pipeline and integrated oil companies, whose chemical and retail
businesses make them less sensitive to the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy helped it outperform its peer group of energy
funds. For the three years through Feb. 25, Excelsior Energy
returned 8.7 percent a year, on average, compared with a 3.1
percent loss for its category.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hoover is an oil bull, having increased the fund's energy
stake to 92 percent of invested holdings, a record, from 85 percent
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   From his office in Midtown Manhattan, Hoover said he believes
that oil prices will ease, but not by as much as many experts
think. Part of the decline will result from seasonal factors this
spring: demand for heating oil will drop while gasoline demand
won't peak until summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for OPEC, which meets again on March 27, Hoover sees a desire
``to engineer prices down to the $22- to $23-a-barrel level.''
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks oil companies will keep passing along today's
higher prices for crude at the gas pump _ raising prices an
additional 5 to 8 cents a gallon by summer. And the higher gasoline
prices, he said, will further drive up the prices of oil stocks.
``That will remind investors that oil company profits are on the
rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors think oil will soon fall back to under $20 a
barrel. Hoover, while noting that ``it's impossible to forecast oil
prices,'' sees an average of $23 a barrel over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason,'' he said, ``we are very bullish on energy
stocks, which are trading at valuations that reflect oil prices of
$16 to $17.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund focuses on four sectors of the energy market. Oil
services companies account for 28 percent of the fund's invested
holdings; major integrated oil companies, 20 percent; independent
exploration and production companies, 20 percent; and natural gas
companies, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The majors, including Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and Texaco,
are long-term holdings. Hoover buys more shares after their prices
take sudden dips of 20 percent or more. His favorite is Exxon
Mobil, because of opportunities he sees in the newly merged
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon will apply its strict financial discipline to Mobil
assets,'' he said, ``and the combined company will have
opportunities for cost reduction by reducing head count and
drilling only the best wells.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover says he is bullish on Exxon Mobil's offshore drilling
properties in Angola and West Africa. And he expects the company to
resume its share buybacks during the second half of the year; the
buybacks were suspended last December.
</P>
<P>
   The fund initially bought Exxon shares in 1994, at $31 a share;
Exxon Mobil now trades at $75.6875, or 18 times his earnings
estimate of $4.15 a share for 2002. He forecasts a long-term
earnings growth rate of 9 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the independents, Hoover prefers companies that are
drilling in the same fields as the majors. ``A discovery will have
a bigger impact because they start from a smaller revenue base,''
he said. Such companies are purer plays on the path of oil prices,
in part because they seldom own chemical or retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Triton Energy, which is based in Dallas and has
operations in Colombia, Thailand and West Africa. Because of its
small revenue base, Triton will reap outsized benefits from its oil
fields along the West African coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought the stock last October at $17.25; it now trades
at $27.375, or 5 times his cash flow estimate of $5.50 a share for
2002. Hoover said the stock could climb to $35 over the next 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the fortunes of oil services companies, too, are highly
sensitive to oil prices. As their cash flow rises, the majors
invest more cash in exploration, drilling and production, creating
business for the oil service companies.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Nabors Industries of Houston, a driller that has 30
percent of the market for land-based deep drilling rigs. He bought
shares in October 1995 at $9; the stock closed on Friday at
$37.4375, or 7.5 times his earnings estimate of $5 a share for
2002.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite in natural gas is El Paso Energy of Houston, which
has announced a merger with the Coastal Corp. The combined entity
will have the largest natural-gas pipeline network in the United
States and 30 percent of the country's natural-gas market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would term this an integrated natural gas company, with a
variety of revenue streams,'' Hoover said. The company makes money
from oil and gas exploration and production, transporting natural
gas and marketing gas and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   It also has an opportunity to lay fiber optic cable along its
rights of way, he added, or to sell those rights to
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that El Paso Energy's earnings would grow 15
percent to 18 percent, annualized, over three years. The stock now
trades at $38.0625, or 13 times his earnings estimate of $3 a share
for 2001.

A SEASON TO CONSIDER VERY REAL EARNINGS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Questions may be italicized)  
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, spring is just around the corner. And while
most stocks slogged through January and February, the companies
behind the ticker symbols have been out there in the real world,
doing real business, many of them making real money.
</P>
<P>
   In about a month, when first-quarter profit numbers start to
roll in, people who have been worried sick about rising interest
rates may start to remember that there is a lot of life out there.
Of course, there is a very real chance that outside of technology,
those investors may spend the intervening period merrily selling
shares of very good companies that are making very good money.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Modigliani, a United States equity strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to talk about
profits, interest rates and the stock market. Following are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The economy barreled ahead at nearly a 7 percent annual clip
in the fourth quarter, and so far this quarter hasn't shown many
signs of slowing. Does that bode well for corporate profits?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Earnings were very strong in the fourth quarter and we think
that trend is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   For the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies, we think earnings will
rise about 15.7 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first
quarter, and 12 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some aberrations within the group, particularly in
the energy sector, where in some cases earnings will go from
negative to very positive. And we will continue to see good
earnings growth out of technology, even though some of these stocks
are ahead of themselves on fundamentals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there other sectors that will do particularly well?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We should see very strong earnings growth in basic materials
companies, the paper, chemical and aluminum stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to our calculations, the consensus projected earnings
growth rates for energy companies will go from negative in 1999 to
45 percent this year. The projected growth rate for basic materials
is 36 percent, which is a little higher than the 33 percent
earnings growth projected for technology companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the most part, investors seem to have ignored these
signs, especially in the groups you just mentioned. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even though we are seeing very strong earnings growth in
energy and basic materials, the market doesn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   We have liked energy stocks for some time, and still do. But
people seem to be concerned that oil prices will come down from
these peaks. That may happen, but they will still be way up from
where they were a year ago. And that will be reflected in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the so-called Old Economy stocks are undervalued. Even
some of the companies that are migrating to the New Economy are not
getting much credit for it right now, like the auto stocks. They
have good sales and are really jumping on more efficient
Internet-based purchasing methods. But for the most part, the
stocks are in the dumps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Isn't there also some concern that if rising interest rates
choke off growth, these kinds of cyclical stocks will get badly
hurt?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the economy gets into trouble, that would be the case. But
because of healthy growth overseas, energy companies would be a
little bit of an exception to that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about interest rates? The worry seems to be that the Fed
will tip the economy into recession. Is that likely? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the economy goes from 7 percent growth to 4 percent, it is
a slowing that on the margin is a negative. But 4 percent growth is
still very strong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Technology stocks seem impervious to the prospect of higher
interest rates. Are they really that bulletproof? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The cost of capital for these companies is extremely low, so
higher rates will not impact that. You would think stocks with a
high price-to-earnings multiple would be impacted. But people are
looking at the wonderful opportunity for technology in the future
and are not worrying about a one-year rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That said, valuations are ahead of themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. With the Nasdaq composite index being the notable exception,
most major measures are down so far this year. Are you expecting
more selling? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the beginning of the year, we were calling for a 20
percent to 25 percent correction for the Dow Jones industrial
average and the S&AMP;P 500. We are probably part of the way through
that, but there may be more to go. I am not talking about the
Nasdaq, which is an index I don't have a focus on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What stocks do you like right now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a general sense, we like the oil service stocks.
Schlumberger and Halliburton are two that I like. And I like
integrated oil company stocks like Conoco, and some of the bigger
companies, like Exxon Mobil.

WHEN TIGER WOODS IS IN CONTENTION, GOLF RATINGS JUMP

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tiger Woods plays golf, television executives swoon. With
his rare power to move ratings, he is the sports version of ``ER''
or ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'': a singular programming entity
capable of clubbing rival networks in their Nielsens in his pursuit
of tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   Woods doesn't have to win. He needs only a chance at victory to
stir viewers to watch. When he's out of contention, or not playing,
ratings for PGA Tour events remain good, but not as formidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's drawing fans who might watch a college basketball game,
the NBA or auto racing,'' said Sean McManus, president of CBS
Sports. ``But he's also drawing fans who might not watch sports on
Saturday or Sunday afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' entry in a tournament has come to mean what Michael
Jordan's appearances with the Chicago Bulls once meant to NBC's
National Basketball Association broadcasts: a near guarantee of
higher viewership than usual and a sure-fire reason to ooh and ahh.
</P>
<P>
   How important is Woods? Last year, CBS averaged a 4.1 rating in
the 11 tournaments it showed that Woods played in, 71 percent
higher than its seven events that he missed. The Woods differential
for CBS stood at 68 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Tiger Factor has led to golf's recent run of
primacy over the NBA. On the last four Sundays, final-round golf
telecasts have all drawn better than the NBA. Last Sunday, when
Woods finished second to Darren Clarke in match play at the 36-hole
World Golf Championships, ABC's 5.0 rating defeated a tripleheader
of NBA games, including the NBC debut of the league's hottest star,
Toronto's Vince Carter. It was a 39 percent increase in ABC's
rating for the same event last year and was no doubt tied more to
whom Clarke defeated than the skill he displayed in winning.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, when Woods finished in a tie for second in the Buick
Invitational, the 8.0 Sunday afternoon rating exceeded the NBA
All-Star Game's prime-time telecast by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An 8.0 for a non-major golf tournament is extraordinary, nosing
toward the territory of Sunday National Football League ratings,
which averaged an 11.0 on Fox and a 10.5 on CBS last season. No
major golf tournament, except the Masters, with a 10.1 rating,
posted a higher Sunday rating in 1999. (One rating point is equal
to about 1 million television households.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no bigger star,'' said Mike Tirico, the golf
tournament host at ABC Sports. ``A certain percentage of the
audience will watch every Sunday. A more attractive leaderboard
brings some more. Tiger on the leaderboard brings the general
sports fan in.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ABC doesn't alter its coverage to accommodate Woods, but Tirico
said, ``If he's two strokes behind the leader, producers and
directors will show his shot going to commercial to plant the seed
of coming back to see more of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Winik, the executive producer of NBA Entertainment, said
the league does not fear Woods' encroachment on its turf, which
comes at a vulnerable time. Woods is at the peak of his appeal
while the NBA, in a transition period after Jordan's retirement, is
averaging a 3.7 rating, down 14 percent from the 4.3 for last
year's lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Tiger is growing the sports audience,'' Winik said.
``Sometimes, he'll be competitive with us, sometimes the lead-in.
He's `The It Guy,' he's got buzz, which is something we're familiar
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the PGA Tour heads to Florida, starting with this
week's Doral-Ryder Open, Woods will be on NBC at the Bay Hill
Invitational in two weeks and at The Players Championship a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all evens out,'' said Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Woods chooses his own schedule and opts not to play some
tournaments, so the networks carrying golf must hope that Woods
will enter the events they show. Woods will probably play about 15
to 20 tournaments out of more than 40 this season.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The surge in golf ratings is not a tale totally about Woods,
just mostly about him.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' emergence as the central personality of professional golf
has helped other golfers reap the benefits of higher ratings and
greater prize money. His sudden renown and success in 1997 _
including his transcendent Masters victory _propelled the PGA Tour
to dramatically higher network rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ratings are better than ever, even when Tiger's not
there,'' said Donna Orender, the PGA Tour's senior vice president
of television. ``People like to see Tiger, but they like to see the
rest of our players. Tiger being the biggest factor is not wrong;
but there are positives all around.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the stories are less riveting and spread among several
golfers. When David Duval won the TPC last year, the final round
rating rose 5 percent from the year before. At the Houston Open,
Stuart Appleby's victory pushed the rating up 9 percent. When Olin
Browne took The Colonial on CBS, the rating jumped 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But consider that during Woods' six-tournament winning streak,
which started last August at the World Series of Golf and ended at
the Buick Invitational last month, ratings for the Sunday rounds
increased at an accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach's rain-delayed third round saw a 50 percent ratings
leap, even though it was not a deciding round; Woods would need a
ferocious charge the next day to win. (In 1999, he finished 53rd.)
At the Mercedes Championship in January, his victory yielded a 3.5
rating for ESPN, 75 percent above a year ago, when he finished tied
for fifth.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Tour Championship, Woods' victory generated a 3.2
rating on ABC, up 68 percent from 1998 when he finished 20th in the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Well before Woods turned pro, golf's upscale demographics made
buying time on tournaments worthwhile to advertisers of golf
equipment and broader-based products like insurance, cars and
computeres. Bob Igiel, president of the broadcast division of The
Media Edge, a unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam, said Woods has ``reawakened
younger viewers toward golf and people who never watched golf.''
</P>
<P>
   For companies like AT&AMP;T, United Airlines and Metropolitan Life,
for whom Igiel purchases time on golf telecasts, Woods'
pre-eminence has helped make prudent buys smarter. Said Igiel:
``There are certain premier attractions in golf that are even more
attractive because of Tiger, bigger purses, and better golfers,
which translate into higher prices paid for golf advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's still value in tournaments where he doesn't
appear, but it's better to have him there, in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   But an advertiser would certainly prefer buying into the
Woods-driven Buick Invitational's 8.0 rating on Feb. 13, than the
2.9 for the Phoenix Open on Jan. 30, when Woods did not compete and
when golf had to compete with ABC's Super Bowl pre-game show.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of being planets in Woods' orbit prevents CBS, NBC
and ABC from moaning that his presence on a competitor beats their
programming. Since all three networks telecast golf, they know
they'll get their crack at exploiting his frequent visits on
tournament leaderboards. CBS, with the most events, receives the
most Tiger nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's doing so much to improve the stature of
golf outweighs the fact that he might be hurting our individual
ratings,'' McManus said. ``So you're not totally disheartened when
he beats us while playing on another network. If he plays
remarkably well at the TPC on NBC, a lot of commentary will focus
on how he'll do two weeks later at the Masters, which we have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Said Ebersol: ``If you love sports, you love it even if it
causes you some discomfort. What's great about sports is that it's
an unscripted drama. What Tiger does is make the unscripted drama
especially delicious.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has mediated several
international incidents and won the release of hostages, says he
wants to build a ``bridge'' between the Gore and Bradley campaigns,
although he added that it would be ``presumptuous and premature''
to offer to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the civil rights leader who endorsed Vice President Al
Gore on Wednesday, said in an interview that he understood what it
was like to lose, having lost two presidential campaigns himself.
And he said he wanted to be sensitive to the ``withdrawal process''
that former Sen. Bill Bradley might have to undergo if he fares
poorly in the many presidential primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jackson said, ``I do have a lot of friends on both sides,''
adding that he would like to serve as the ``bridge'' when it comes
time to bring the Democratic Party together.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said he was unaware of any
outreach so far from Jackson or the Gore campaign, but he did not
scoff at Jackson's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is March 7 and beyond, and we are competing very
hard to do well on March 7 and take off and go from there,'' Hauser
said. Jackson's desire to mediate a rapprochement between the two
candidates, he said, ``is not relevant right today, although Bill
Bradley has a lot of respect for Jesse Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson himself offered effusive praise for Bradley, adding:
``He got people involved who have never been involved before, and
we must maintain his involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that Jackson's desire to help bring
Bradley into the Gore fold partly explained why Jackson's
endorsement of Gore came at a time when it seemed designed not to
get maximum media exposure _ five minutes before the start of the
candidate's debate Wednesday night in Los Angeles. They said that
the endorsement had long seemed inevitable, but that Jackson did
not want to do it in a high-profile way that would alienate
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also noted that Gore himself had lost a presidential
campaign _ in 1988, losing primaries to Jackson _ and that Gore too
was sensitive to the process that Bradley might have to go through.
``He has been there himself,'' Jackson said of Gore. ``He couldn't
get traction, and he had to go through a withdrawal process.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Jackson said, it would be too early for him to
approach Bradley now. But the March 7 primary states, including New
York and California, all seem poised to go overwhelmingly for Gore
and could prove decisive for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The concern in the Gore camp at the moment is making sure that
even with his nomination seeming like a foregone conclusion, his
supporters still get to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore and his campaign have swung into high gear to
get out the vote. For the Democrats, that means paying special
attention to blacks, labor, gays and various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is courting them all in these last days before March 7, and
aiming television and radio commercials at each group.
</P>
<P>
   March 7 is not only primary day in several states but the 35th
anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Alabama from
Selma to Montgomery. Gore will mark the occasion by appearing by
satellite from Washington at a church service in Alabama on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As he moves through each media market, Gore counts on local
endorsements, like that Friday of Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat
from Jacksonville, Fla., which came when Gore spoke at a black high
school there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president not only talks the talk but also walks the
walk on our issues,'' Brown told the students.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Atlanta, as he visited Chanterelle's restaurant, Gore
posed with numerous black patrons, including some students, about
whom he enthused: ``These students are from Morehouse and Spelman,
the greatest colleges in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second radio commercial in New York touts Gore's record on
civil rights and his support for affirmative action. It features
prominent blacks like Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem,
and the state comptroller, Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Jackson, who is planning to make
radio commercials for Gore, will concentrate on the labor vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need him to get the black vote,'' said one campaign
official. ``Gore can do that. He'll do liberals, progressives and
labor.''

A BICOASTAL GOOD DEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 05, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all their seeming simplicity _ dorms, classrooms, playing
fields, and Old Main _ universities have long been very complicated
places, fiercely proud of their role as producers and conservators
and arbiters of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   So the ruckus was no surprise in 1982 when scientific instrument
entrepreneur Jack (Edwin C.) Whitehead tried to give away a fortune
to establish a research institute that would be in the university
but not completely of it, more focussed on basic research than on
teaching. Duke turned him down, several others took a pass. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a reliable minority kicked
up a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Nobel laureate David Baltimore indicated he
would leave the biology department if MIT didn't seize the day.
(Thirty years earlier, MIT had taken a pass on the semiconducting
properties of silicon, and Robert Noyce had moved to California.)
The faculty overwhelmingly embraced the deal. And so the Whitehead
was established in 1982 with a grant of $132 million.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, lightning struck. A rapid series of
breakthroughs became a revolution; the new field of molecular
genetics was born. Some of its most important tools were devised by
a man who was at MIT only because of the peculiar strength of
Whitehead Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lander was a mathematician who had learned molecular
biology evenings while teaching entrepreneurial finance at Harvard
Business School. Baltimore hired him _ no biology department would
have seated him without a degree _ and before long Lander and
molecular biologist David Botstein were devising new ways of
mapping fragments of genes that in due course led to the project to
map the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not without significance that last week computer
publishing moguls Patrick and Lore Harp McGovern committed $350
million over the next 20 years to establish a McGovern Institute
for Brain Research at MIT, modelled on the lines of the Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern is founder and chairman of the privately-held
International Data Group, the world's leading computing publisher,
market research and exposition firm. His wife is a successful
venture capitalist wife in her own right. An annual Forbes magazine
survey places them among the 200 wealthies families in America.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no fuss. The man tapped to head the McGovern
Institute was Phillip Sharp, a biologist who had been a firm
(though not romantic) supporter of the Whitehead. ``You have to
realize that the idea is to set up an institute with a big
endowment and taking three of our best and most notable biologists
to start it,'' Sharp told science journalist Philip Hilts at the
time. ``They will be adding 20 more people on the faculty. So, for
the 43 of us left behind, your power and influence is going to be
diluted.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sharp has become a Most-Notable himself; he shared
the the Nobel Prize in 1993 for his discovery of surplus DNA and
gene splicing. Presumably no one would argue today that the
Whitehead had done the university or the biology more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   A twenty-year boom, scientific as well as economic, has changed
the climate of opinion nearly completely. Thus the McGoverns,
advised by a panel of scientists headed by David Baltimore,
interviewed seven schools over a period of three years. All of them
responded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Brain science is widely believed to be on the brink of explosive
growth, thanks to dramatic advances in imaging technology,
computational power and molecular genetics. Proposals were
solicited for MIT and Columbia University in the East, and Stanford
University, California Institute of Technology, and University of
California campuses in San Francisco, Berkeley, and San Diego in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's roots are in the East. (Lore McGovern was raised in
Germany) He grew up in Philadelphia, graduated from MIT with the
class of 1959, and founded his company in Boston. IDG employs some
12,000 in Massachusetts, publishing everything from the ``Computers
for Dummies'' series to ``Computerworld,'' ``PC World'' and ``The
Industry Standard'' among its 290 magazines and newspapers, not to
mention reams of market research.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple lives in San Francisco. (``Pat himself lives on a
plane'' says a friend.)
</P>
<P>
   California apparently mounted a very strong bid _ especially San
Francisco, where UCSF chancellor and Nobel laureate Michael Bishop
presides over a new 43-acre campus being built on old railyards on
the city's southeast side along Mission Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The man who apparently made the difference was Abraham Siegel,
long-time dean of MIT's Sloan School. It was Siegel who smoothed
the negotiations with the Whitehead family in 1981, making the case
to MIT that the Whitehead children should remain involved, making
the case to Whitehead that MIT should have seats on the Institute's
board. He filled one himself for many years. And it was Siegel who
got the McGoverns involved with the Whitehead several years ago,
before they had any idea of attempting to clone it.
</P>
<P>
   What was wanted was an organization with the same strengths as
the Whitehead. ``We have the luxury of investing in young
scientists, and we take a lot of chances that might be considered
too far out for government funding,'' says Whitehead director
Gerald Fink. ``We only supply seed money, enough to get a lab
started. After that, investigators have to attract their own
grants, from government or industry. You can eat up a lot of money
if you fund the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' says Susan Whitehead, an
attorney who is the Whitehead's chairperson. ``Strong leadership. A
lot of community-building. We have a lot of stars, and stars can
get temperamental if they don't know each other, each others'
families very well. And of course the science has been moving at an
incredible pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead members are all obligated to teach; many do so in
MIT's mandatory freshman year course. ``You can't tell them apart''
from members of the bioloogy department,'' said Paul Joskow, a
member of the Institute's board.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the McGovern Institue will not enjoy quite the same
arrangement. This time MIT drove a harder bargain. The university
will own the land, supply the building, pay the staff. But the
basic architecture of the McGovern Institute is the same: a core of
15 or 20 principal investigators with faculty appointments at MIT,
and more than 300 postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and
undergraduates from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most creative of all, the Brain Institute sticks it
pretty good to Harvard University, a couple miles down the street
from MIT. After years of relative neglect, Harvard recently had
begun scrambling to catch up in the neurosciences, behind the
leadership of Arts and Sciences dean Jeremy Knowles. Large sums
were budgeted. Some 166 scientists from all over the immense
university have been loosely yoked together in a ``Mind, Brain
Behavior Interfaculty Initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McGovern Institute succeeds to anywhere near the degree
of the Whitehead, Harvard will find itself even farther behind. But
then this cheek-by-jowl competition between not-so-friendly rivals
is precisely the mechanism that has kept Boston at the forefront of
modern biology and medicine for fifty years.

AN EARLY GLIMPSE OF ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: tonight is SATURDAY, March 4 in this story. Fact box below.) 
 
 
By RIB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mystery fans have something to puzzle over and cheer about this
weekend with ``Murder Rooms: The Dark Origins of Sherlock Holmes''
and ``The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective has gone beyond his
creator's original intention. Holmes is the most filmed detective
character in history for sure, and one survey has him as the most
filmed character _ period. And the hints Doyle left in his writing
about the sleuth with the amazing powers of deduction who was also
guarded about his past have fascinated writers and filmmakers for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more successful of these was the 1976 film ``The
Seven Percent Solution,'' adopted by Nicholas Meyers from his own
novel, which finds Holmes on a cocaine binge (the 7 percent refers
to the amount of the drug in a dose) trying to exorcise demons from
his past.
</P>
<P>
   While speculation about those demons usually centers around
Holmes' fictional past, writer David Pirie took a look at the early
life of the detective's creator, who had been a medical student at
Edinburgh University in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Doyle worked as a clerk for pioneer forensic
pathologist Dr. Joseph Bell, thought by many to be the inspiration
for Holmes. Most of Doyle's personal papers have been withheld from
the public, but it is known that Bell, while a professor at the
university, did investigations for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins in 1893 with Doyle (Robin Laing) having caused a
public uproar by having Holmes apparently die in the detective's
latest adventure. For Doyle, who first introduced Holmes in the
1887 novel ``A Study in Scarlett,'' his creation's popularity had
become a burden. (Doyle, of course, was eventually forced to bring
back the sleuth.)
</P>
<P>
   But the moment is used as a way for Doyle to reflect on his time
with Bell, played with great flair by veteran British actor Ian
Richardson. Pirie's script is as clever as any Holmes mystery, but
it is the dark shadings he uses to fill in the past that make this
production intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Set against the background of an investigation into the murders
of a prostitute and a beggar, ``Murder Rooms'' also serves as a
glimpse into Victorian England, where the victims are considered to
be of no importance and their deaths not worth investigating, where
women are treated as second-class citizens and the rich get away
with, well ... you'll have to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Pirie is careful not to make Bell a carbon copy of Holmes, but
there are nuances that parallel the detective's life; Bell treats
drug addicts, while Holmes may have been one. (Ironically,
Richardson played Holmes in an HBO series in the '80s.)
</P>
<P>
   And the film offers an interesting scenario to events in Doyle's
life that would be put into his writing. While this is not a true
story, there is a wonderful blending of fiction and truth
(including the fact that a member of Doyle's circle at the time was
later hanged as a serial killer and may have been Jack the Ripper)
that makes ``Murder Rooms'' superior television. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GOLDEN SPIDERS: A NERO WOLFE MYSTERY'
</P>
<P>
   After having middling success with Gene Wilder's ``Murder in a
Small Town'' telefilms and with Joe Mantegna as Robert Parker's
``Spenser,'' A&AMP;E has finally found a detective to compete with
Hercule Poirot of the BBC. Based on the novels by Rex Stout, Nero
Wolfe in ``The Golden Spiders'' is suitably odd, suitably brilliant
and expertly played by veteran character actor Maury Chaykin.
</P>
<P>
   Like Poirot (and Holmes for that matter), Wolfe is guarded about
his personal life _ so guarded that he never leaves his apartment
in Manhattan, leaving the legwork in a case to Archie (a jaunty
Timothy Hutton), so odd that his meals must be served precisely on
time with exactly the right seasoning or he's put off, and so fussy
that his obsession for orchids rivals that of Poirot's for his
mustache wax.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Poirot and Holmes, he has a strong moral sense, and
underneath his rigid exterior is a soft spot for people's troubles.
In ``The Golden Spiders'' this is shown when he agrees to split the
fees on a possible case with a young boy who has seen what he
believes is a woman being abducted. When the boy is subsequently
run down, Wolfe pursues the case anyway in order to bring the boy's
killers to justice. The case eventually involves three murders,
money, the plight of European refugees after World War II and, of
course, a pair of gold spider earrings.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Spiders'' is a well-plotted tale with an Agatha
Christie- style ending (``Come to my parlor and I'll tell you which
of you is a killer''), the joy is in the eccentricities of the
characters. Chaykin and Hutton make a wonderful team. Chaykin
blusters over silly things, but only betrays the slightest emotion
when he is obviously touched. Hutton shows a light comedic flair
that he hasn't been able to use much in his career.
</P>
<P>
   And Archie's team of investigators under Wolfe's direction give
the proceedings a razzle-dazzle feel, never letting the action
flag.
</P>
<P>
   If the people at A&AMP;E are smart, they will order up a a lot more
Nero Wolfe mysteries. They have a winner. &QL;

   Never Mind the Watch. Stock Options Are Golden. &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do you give the retiring chief executive who has
everything? A gold watch? A Caribbean cruise? How about a bundle of
stock options worth more than $30 million?
</P>
<P>
   The American Express Co. gave Harvey Golub, its chairman and
chief executive, options on 750,000 shares of stock last March,
according to a proxy statement filed last week that valued the
``special award'' at $30.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The options raised Golub's total pay to about $52 million. He
got an additional $38 million from exercising other options the
company had granted.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the options rewarded Golub for a job
well done and gave him ``an incentive to stay during the
transition.'' Golub, 60, will give up his job as chief executive to
Kenneth I. Chenault, the president, in April 2001, and his
chairman's post a year later. Chenault, 48, received options worth
$16.5 million plus stock worth $4.9 million, raising his 1999 pay
to about $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Until not that long ago, companies stopped granting options to
executives about five years before they retired, said Graef
Crystal, a compensation consultant. Now, more boards hand them out
as going-away presents, or, as in Chenault's case, coming-in
presents. These days, Crystal says, ``there's always a cause for
celebration in the world of executive compensation.''

   After building cars for more than 40 years, Harold A. Poling,
the former chairman of Ford, is taking on a new job. Poling, once
an avid pilot, will announce Monday that he is becoming chairman of
the Eclipse Aviation Corp., a fledgling company in Scottsdale,
Ariz., that will build small jets, primarily for executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was involved in business, the use of airplanes was
essential,'' Poling said. ``But I became a little concerned at Ford
that we were spending so much on the company jet and not have very
many people on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Poling's new job, part of his attention remains with
Ford. Of particular concern is Ford's stock, which fell to
$41.0625, a 52-week low, on Wednesday, before recovering to
$42.6875 on Friday. ``Aside from the stock, Ford is doing great,''
Poling said. ``But investors are not interested now in auto stocks.
They're caught up in the Internet.''

public relations people, he described how Haymarket had gone from
selling its medical reference books in the United States, beginning
about 10 years ago, to publishing an American edition of PRWeek in
late 1998, to starting an American edition of Revolution, a
magazine about online marketing, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't e-anything a crowded field? He dismisses the investing
craze as ``a gold rush.'' But he says that public relations
executives like Richard Edelman asked him to bring PRWeek to the
United States, and that Revolution answers similar demands.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, with the tall stature and shaggy mane that brought him
the nickname ``Tarzan,'' Heseltine has other United States ventures
in store. ``I can't see the point of retiring,'' he said. ``What
would I do?''

STUDY QUESTIONS BREAST CANCER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An aggressive and controversial form of treatment for advanced
breast cancer has been shown to be ineffective, researchers Friday
said in a report that will probably end the practice of combining
high-dose chemotherapy with bone-marrow transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts law currently requires insurers to cover the
procedure, which was once considered a last hope for women dying of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors said they could find no evidence that the procedure
works. In an editorial accompanying a medical journal report that
was rushed into publication Friday, Dr. Marc Lippman, a noted
breast cancer specialist at the Lombardi Cancer Center in
Washington said: ``This form of treatment for women with metastatic
breast cancer. . .has been proved to be ineffective and should be
abandoned'' in favor of other new experimental therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The report was hurriedly posted on the Web site of the New
England Journal of Medicine, which will publish the study in its
April 13 issue.
</P>
<P>
   Survival three years after high-dose chemotherapy and
bone-marrow transplanation was about the same for women who
received four to six cycles of chemotherapy alone at standard
doses.
</P>
<P>
   Studies reported last year had come to much the same conclusion.
But that verdict was clouded with uncertainty because one of the
studies, from South Africa, showed a benefit from high-dose therapy
and transplantation; that study was recently found to contain
fraudulent data.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal posted the report urgently because of
confusion created by the falsified study, said Dr. Marcia Angell,
its editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   That study, she said, ``left a lot of concern and confusion
among women and insurers who weren't sure whether to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   The new report, she added, ``is is the best of the studies'' on
the issue ``and it was negative, and we felt that we owed it to the
public'' to air it immediately, said Angell.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward A. Stadtmauer, director of bone marrow
transplantation at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center,
headed the research group that published the new study, begun in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   All of the volunteers were women with breast cancer that had
metastasized to other parts of the body, but whose disease had been
in check temporarily by standard chemotherapy. The theory behind
the combination treatment is that it might be possible to eradicate
all traces of disease with chemotherapy so potent it would be
lethal if the woman wasn't subsequently given a transplant to
restore her blood-forming tissues.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 110 patients were randomly assigned to the aggressive
treatment while 89 received standard chemo. After three years,
there was no significant difference in survival between the groups
(32 percent in the transplanted patients and 38 percent in the
standard group) or in how long the treatment kept the cancer from
recurring (9.6 months in the aggressive treatment group and 9.0
months in the others.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in large studies, researchers will identify a subset
of women who benefited from a treatment even when the overall group
did not. Dr. John K. Erban, a New England Medical Center cancer
specialist who participated in the study, said in an interview
Friday that there was no subgroup that clearly benefited, but that
the study might ``not be the final word'' because some very small
set of patients might still be found to do better with the
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Erban also said that a transplant might be a reasonable option
for women with metastatic disease that can only be held in check by
indefinite standard chemotherapy. ``There might be quality of
life'' advantages to the transplant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Erban said that the study ``is going to very much, and
appropriately, limit the number of times when it should be
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the report's conclusions, Massachusetts insurers
still have to cover bone marrow transplants if the doctor and
patient request it.
</P>
<P>
   But those requests may well decline. ``I think we're going to
see, hopefully, no physicians recommending this treatment,'' said
Dr. Kurt Sligar, chief medical officer for Blue Cross/Blue Shield
of Massachusetts. He said that numbers of the procedures, which
cost $50,000 to $100,000, have declined in recent months.

MCCAIN ATTACKS BUSH ADS   ON BREAST CANCER FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 48 hours of being pounded by ads that
criticized John McCain for proposing to cut breast cancer research
funding, the Arizona senator's campaign lashed out at George W.
Bush Friday for exploiting the fears of cancer patients and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unfortunate,'' McCain said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
``It's not the first time or the last. They have done nothing but
run negative ads in state after state.''
</P>
<P>
   With a critical round of primaries on Tuesday that includes New
York, the McCain campaign also continued its attempts to link the
Bush campaign to a television ad, running in four states and
financed by $2.1 million in unregulated ``soft money,'' that
attacks the senator's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island borough president Guy Molinari, a cancer survivor
who heads McCain's New York campaign, called on Bush to stop using
cancer patients as political pawns. ``I know what cancer is all
about,'' he said. He also noted that ``John McCain's sister has had
breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari demanded that Bush apologize and pull the ads off the
air. ``Do you want to win that badly?'' Molinari asked of Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning at a breast cancer research center on Long
Island, faced his harshest questions yet about the decision to air
radio ads criticizing McCain's record on breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent almost an entire news conference defending his
decision to politicize the issue of breast cancer. ``This is an
issue. The ad came right off the man's Web page. This is what he
laid out. This is what he thought was important,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the senator should be squealing about pork and
then squealing when somebody disagrees with one of the cuts he
wants to make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ad features Geri Barish, a Long Island woman who was
initially described by the Bush campaign as a breast cancer
survivor and longtime advocate, but who is in fact an area
Republican operative. Barish lost but has continued to work with
Governor George Pataki to secure funding for breast cancer
research. At Friday's event, Pataki introduced her as, among other
things, a research-funding lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has an overall record in support of cancer
research and as a foe of big tobacco, he includes several small
breast cancer research projects on his Web site in a list of
hundreds of congressional measures he calls wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, wearing a pink ribbon symbolizing the fight against breast
cancer, thanked about 100 guests at a forum at the Stony Brook
Health Sciences Center for letting him take ``a little time off the
campaign trail to talk policy.'' But it seemed evident that Bush _
flanked by several politicians, including Pataki, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and former presidential candidate Elizabeth
Dole _ was carrying out the third day of a strategy to use women's
health issues against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two days of tough questions, Bush did not back down from
the ad, and instead attacked McCain for saying on his campaign Web
site that he would ax two Long Island programs that he considers
``garden variety pork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A legitimate role of the federal government is to fund
research to cure disease,'' Bush told the panel, in an apparent dig
at McCain. ``It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when we cure
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also defended Bush's ad and was critical of McCain's
suggestion that the two medical research programs should be funded
through health agencies instead of unrelated federal agencies such
as the Energy and Defense Departments. Giuliani, who is in a tough
Senate race here against Hillary Rodham Clinton, remained
uncharacteristically quiet, saying it was possible for him to back
Bush as a ``friend'' without getting involved in the particulars of
this debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of breast cancer is sensitive on Long Island, where as
many as one in nine women has contracted the illness, and where
many activists believe the environment has contributed to the high
rates. But it is also an issue the Republican Party here has
recently sought to turn to its advantage. Former GOP senator
Alfonse D'Amato funded numerous breast cancer research projects
here _ a point made several times at the Bush panel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who accompanied
McCain as he campaigned in Manhattan Friday, called the Bush radio
attack ads ``last-minute desperation smear tactics. . . scurrilous
. . . malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ad on the environment aimed against McCain is
funded by a group linked to longtime Bush supporters in Texas that
calls itself ``Republicans for Clean Air.'' The ad has been
criticized as a distortion by independent environmental groups like
the Sierra Club, as well as media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After the McCain campaign complained to the Federal
Communications Commission, which concluded that the ad failed to
adequately identify who paid for it, news organizations tied the
commercial to wealthy Texas businessmen with connections to the
Bush campaign and administration.
</P>
<P>
   At a cold but sunny noontime rally on Wall Street, McCain warned
that ``$2 million has come into this campaign from a source we
don't know, alleging things that are untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ``machine'' that tried to keep him off the ballot
in parts of New York, ``is trying to fool you again,'' McCain told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are being sponsored, coordinated and managed by the
George Bush for president campaign,'' charged McCain campaign
manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ``raise serious questions about the integrity of the
campaign finance system,'' said Davis.

 &HT;    Bradley rips Gore on China, arms pacts
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In a lengthy foreign policy speech Friday,
Democrat Bill Bradley said rogue nuclear powers and a destabilized
Russian nation pose the greatest threats to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for failing
to ensure the safekeeping of Soviet nuclear weapons material and
for being the ``first four-year government since the 1960s not to
conclude even one nuclear arms treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have squandered an opportunity of historic proportions,''
Bradley told students and faculty at Brown University here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also criticized Gore individually for telling labor
leaders recently that the agreement bringing China into the World
Trade Organization needed to be strengthened to safeguard workers.
Gore acted ``for short-term political gain,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suggested Gore's statements to labor could torpedo the
deal, a stated priority of the Clinton administration and of many
major business groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from stoking Chinese antipathy, it probably capsized one
of the most significant agreements this country has ever signed,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the accusation, Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said
the vice president ``made it clear that he supports this agreement
and wants Congress to act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway also criticized Bradley's own foreign policy record,
noting he supported aid to the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s and
opposed the congressional resolution authorizing U.S. intervention
in Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley opened his speech by lamenting the fact that foreign
policy no longer is a central part of running for president. ``It
almost makes you nostalgic for what campaigns used to be about,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the substance of his remarks, Bradley said U.S.
foreign policy around the world must be clear, consistent and
founded on a trust between the president and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States should use diplomatic muscle
aggressively, but military force sparingly. Quoting the late
President Kennedy when he was a Massachusetts senator, Bradley said
the United States could not be the world's ``firefighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called for military force when U.S. interests are
threatened and, in some cases, when humanitarian tragedies occur
around the world. He said the use of force for humanitarian reasons
is justified only when there are no other options and U.S. victory
is assured.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also must work to preserve strong relations
with Russia, China, Mexico, Japan and the countries of the European
Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to China, Bradley said the world's most populous
nation should be given permanent, normal trading relations with the
United States.

   Keys? Check. Snack? Check. Foreign language tape? Cheque.
Aromatherapy air freshener? Uh, OK, why not? If it works for you,
go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in general peace of mind and a non-aggressive temperament,
and now, say the experts, you're ready for the daily traffic grind.
You're road-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   So many of us in Southern California have a
longer-than-civilized daily commute to and from work. And on Los
Angeles freeways, one of our lovely traffic snarls can instantly
double what is normally a 45-minute ride.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for a daily commute don't differ substantially whether
your commute is five minutes or 90 minutes. Most of the rules
involve the use of common sense, and your neighborhood Department
of Motor Vehicles office _ or, if you're unlucky, CHP officer _
will be more than happy to remind you what they are: Watch the
road, don't drive when angry or sleepy, obey the speed limit, no
using cell phones while driving ... yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can't significantly change the amount of time we
spend on the road, but here are a few ways psychiatrists and
traffic experts say you can make that time a little less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Happy driving. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
PRE-ROAD PREPARATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a luxury most of us don't possess, but psychiatrists say
the better prepared you are mentally before you get behind the
wheel, the more comfortable and relaxed you'll be on the drive.
That could mean a series of stretches, meditation or even a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about people's mental health,'' says Dr. Lourdes
Villegas, a psychotherapist at Kaiser Permanente's Imperial Medical
Offices in Bellflower. ``If you're already stressed, whatever
happens on the road is going to make you twice as stressed. Put it
into perspective: `This is only 45 minutes. This is not my whole
life.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, get calm, get centered _ and then get going. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
AT HOME IN YOUR CAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Keep your vehicle at your comfort level. Know your ideal
temperature and seat settings. Use a pillow or other means of
support if it helps your comfort. Or an air freshener if a certain
scent makes you feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't make things so relaxing that you'll doze off at the
wheel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
THE ROUTE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Find an alternate way (or ways) to get to and from work. Do this
not to save time _ although that could happen _ but to vary your
routine and mix in a change of scenery. An ugly drive is an ugly
drive, which can get depressing. Study new neighborhoods that you
might pass through. Know the territory between your home and your
office in case you're ever forced to make a stop.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the journey even more challenging by trying to
memorize street names and other landmarks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
THE ROAD/TAPE OR CD PLAYERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Our cars now come with VCRs, and navigation systems and vehicle
Internet access aren't far behind, but any traffic expert will tell
you that your stereo system is the ONLY part of your car that
should be allowed to distract you while you're driving. Granted,
talking on a cell phone, shaving or eating might help break up the
time, but those activities can also cause accidents. The radio is
safe, provided you're not fumbling for CDs when you should be
changing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your listening carefully. Since the name of the game is
comfort and relaxation, watch out for the type of music that gets
your heart pounding or your blood rushing. Aggressive music can,
experts say, put you in an aggressive mood, which is not what you
want when you're behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Many people recommend books on tape. Travel and foreign language
tapes can aid those who need to feel they're actually accomplishing
something while being stuck in the quicksand that is the 405
freeway.
</P>
<P>
   If the radio is your entertainment of choice, make sure you know
a place to find reliable traffic reports. ``I would try to find a
station that doesn't make you feel more tense and stressed out than
you might ordinarily be,'' says Sandra Ball-Rokeach, professor of
communications and sociology at USC and an expert in traffic-injury
prevention. ``Too many people I find are stuck on the freeway. Very
few people just get off and take a surface route.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
YOUR ROADMATES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slowly you think they're driving, or how close
they came when they nearly cut you off, people in the other cars on
the road are not out to get you and have no real interest in
ruining your commute. Once you understand this principle,
psychologists say, you will have beaten road rage. Then nothing
that happens on the road can touch you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to want a peaceful drive,'' says Dr. Arnold
Nerenberg, a clinical psychologist and authority on road rage.
``You've never seen these people before, and you'll probably never
see them again. Do you want to turn control of your emotions over
to them? To those people who you call `idiots'? Most people
don't.'' &QL;

 McCAIN'S SENATE RECORD: CONSERVATIVE, BUT NOT IDEOLOGICAL  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At one level, John McCain has been a model of
conservative Republican orthodoxy in his 13 years in the Senate,
with a voting record close to that of Jesse Helms, who sets the
standard for Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's career gets an 85 from the American Conservative Union,
a 9 from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action and an 89 from
the National Right to Life Committee. Helms, the dean of Senate
conservatives, gets 99 from the ACU, 3 from the ADA and 99 from
Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   But a Senate career is more than just showing up to vote. And a
review of McCain's record shows that, by subtler measures, his
interests, even passions, are hardly ideological. His biggest
continuing concern has been the armed forces _ not necessarily in
giving them what they want, but what he thinks they need.
</P>
<P>
   His most striking achievement came when he joined with another
Vietnam veteran, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to puncture the myth
that Vietnam continued holding U.S. prisoners. The pair then worked
to get Senate approval of an end to the trade embargo against
Vietnam. That led to the start of diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain passion which on its face seems most conservative,
and is certainly unorthodox Senate behavior, is his insistent
opposition to pork barrel spending. He is especially hostile to the
variety of pork in which an influential senator quietly gets some
money ``earmarked'' for a particular local interest, like a
university or a hospital, without going through the peer review
that governs most federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   For years that opposition drew attention but usually lost in the
Senate. But this week, Gov. George W. Bush's campaign seized on
earmarked grants that McCain opposed, in the form of $104 million
for a breast cancer program at New York University, and another $1
million for the program at the North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health system, to contend that he opposed breast cancer research in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatively, McCain's highly visible losses on campaign
finance and the tobacco settlement overshadow not only the Vietnam
effort but also his substantive but less than striking
accomplishments as chairman of the Commerce Committee since 1995,
his work for Indian tribes and his success in getting a line item
veto law passed in 1996. The Supreme Court has found the law, which
allowed presidents to veto specific pieces of spending measures,
unconstitutional, and McCain blames himself for losing control of
its language. He still calls it his proudest achievement: ``If we
could have kept it, it would have had the most profound effect on
the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing campaign finance or the tobacco measure, though, involve
a degree of difficulty so high that if McCain had succeeded, he
would have been seen as a legislative magician, an achiever on the
level of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Those huge issues aside, it seems clear that McCain's success in
the Senate has been limited by his temperament in two ways. There
is no question that he sometimes loses potential allies by his
penchant for telling off other senators. One friend, Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., said, ``He's not afraid to embarrass people and
go after people.'' The Senate, after all, remains an institution
where the bitterest enemies call each other ``my distinguished
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, McCain is an impatient man _ perhaps because
he lost five years of his life as a prisoner of war _ in an
institution that worships delay and rewards endurance.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years in the Senate, today McCain is involved in a
presidential race in which he somehow appeals not only to moderate
Republicans but even to liberal Democrats, and in which Republican
enemies have labeled him a ``moderate'' with liberal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the basis of those labels, it's not McCain's voting
record, which also include a career 15 percent rating from the
AFL-CIO and a 28 from the League of Conservation Voters (for whom
his dedication to the Grand Canyon is outweighed by his commitment
to environmental deregulation generally).
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is clearest on abortion. Intensity matters.
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee, supplied the 89 percent rating. But he said that while
votes mattered, they were not everything, and the group feared that
``if elected president, Mr. McCain would be unlikely to use the
office's powers to advance the pro-life cause.'' He cited
statements made by McCain which, he said, acknowledged that
abortion was a ``necessary evil.'' Whether or not that view is
fair, it is clear that neither in the Senate nor in his
presidential campaign has McCain sought to lead the anti-abortion
movement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's heroic military career and ex-POW status made him an
obvious choice to serve with Kerry, a Silver Star veteran who
turned against the war, on the special committee that examined the
POW-MIA issue. On Jan. 13, 1993, he concluded ``I have seen no
evidence that convinces me that there are Americans alive, or that
there are likely Americans alive'' in captivity.

   McCain's concern over prisoners carries over to current members
of the armed services. On the Armed Services Committee, he has
worked to improve pay and benefits for active duty personnel and
veterans. But he has also challenged major weapons spending, such
as the Seawolf submarine, C-130 transports and B-2 bombers. In
committee, said Cochran, ``he was rather hard on the military. He
made them talk about what they really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   That posture led to his frequent criticism of pork-barrel
spending _ a McCain target not confined to military budgets but one
where the Pentagon figured large. He tangled with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and even
Appropriations Committee chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, over money
matters they slipped into bills.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not won any big floor fights over pork barrel
spending. But even Stevens says his opposition has been useful,
since it can be used to scare off some greedy members. ``We've sort
of used him as the bogey-man,'' said Stevens, with warnings that:
``If you do that, McCain will be after you.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is not an issue which wins McCain friends. His web site,
www.itsyourcountry.com, lists spending that he considers
outrageous, not by sponsoring senator, but by state, which is close
enough. Items like ``$750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska''
or ``$1 million for rehabilitation of a U-505 submarine at the
Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois'' have easily
discernible parentage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's colleagues call him a hypocrite for attacking
their projects while pushing for goodies for Arizona. He has argued
that the difference is that he seeks his projects openly, through
hearings, while others add theirs in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has merged his attacks on campaign finance
with attacks on pork. ``Pork barrel spending is a direct result of
unlimited contributions from special interests,'' his web site
maintains. When combined with the list of projects, that charge
implies that senators who get listed projects for their state has
been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators who don't like McCain's campaign bill don't
like that implication either, and they harangued him over it the
last time the campaign finance bill came up, in October 1999. One
who took particular offense was Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah, who
got $2.2 million earmarked to help build sewers for the 2002 Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City. He demanded that McCain tell him what
``soft money'' influenced him. McCain did not answer directly but
just complained that the money had been sneaked into a bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's own party revolted against his tobacco settlement bill,
which would have increased the price of a pack of cigarettes by
$1.10 a pack, and filibustered it to death in 1998. It had gone
through the Commerce Committee easily, but the tobacco industry ran
millions o dollars of ads attacking it before it died.
</P>
<P>
   McCain became an advocate of campaign spending law changes after
what he has called his worst mistake in the Senate _ attending a
meeting with regulators in which Charles Keating, a constituent and
contributor, sought leniency from savings and loan regulators. The
Ethics Committee eventually found he did no more than exhibit bad
judgment, but its partisan proceedings were an ordeal he has called
worse than captivity in hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., have
together sought to ban ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions
from rich people, corporations and unions which dominate
presidential and congressional elections, and to curb the use of
``issue ads'' which interest groups buy to influence elections
(anti-abortion and tobacco groups ran ads against him in South
Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute and a supporter of the campaign legislation,
said ``I've worked with him pretty closely on campaign reform. He
has been ``a mix of principle and pragmatism, what you hope for''
in managing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has never won the support of more than eight
Republicans, and in a Senate with 45 Democrats, that is seven short
of the number needed to break a filibuster.

PLANS TO RESCUE SATELLITE PHONE COMPANY ARE DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Cellular telephone pioneer Craig McCaw said Friday
that he was dropping plans to acquire Iridium, the troubled global
satellite telephone company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last August.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McCaw's private investment group, Eagle River
Investments, said the company had decided to focus its investing on
satellite services that had high-speed data capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes as a serious blow to Iridium, which was
counting on McCaw's money and reputation in the wireless
communications world to save an ambitious $5 billion satellite
telephone service that had once promised to communicate ``with
anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the move leaves Iridium on the brink of
collapse. On Monday, the company is scheduled to lose access to $5
million in emergency financing under a bankruptcy court agreement.
Motorola said Friday that its agreement to operate the service
would also expire on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the death blow,'' said Armand Musey, an analyst at
Banc of America Securities. ``It looks like even at a ridiculously
low cost structure McCaw doesn't think it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, which is based in Washington, issued a statement Friday
saying it was still committed to a sale of its assets, which McCaw
was expected to bid on to form a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received expression of interest from other potential
buyers,'' said Randall Brouckman, the company's chief operating
officer. The company did not disclose the names of other interested
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said they were surprised by McCaw's decision
because it came less than a month after he had agreed to provide
$74.6 million in emergency financing to Iridium. Eagle River and
Motorola, which helped develop the Iridium system, have already
made $5 million in emergency financing available.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw said his aim in rescuing Iridium was to restore confidence
in the satellite industry and to create a network of satellite
systems that included Iridium, ICO Global Communications _ which he
is also trying to rescue from bankruptcy _ and Teledesic, the
``Internet in the sky'' satellite system that is expected to be
ready by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, McCaw said he had revised his strategy to focus
primarily on delivering data capabilities through ICO and
Teledesic. Iridium is a narrow-band service primarily intended for
voice and paging services.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said McCaw's change of heart was unusual and
could be a negotiating ploy or a sign that his due diligence turned
up troubling details at Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   But Eagle River officials said the decision was primarily
strategic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explored Iridium, and we did a very thorough review of the
assets, and we decided it was just best to stick with Teledesic and
ICO,'' said Roger Nyhus, a spokesman at Eagle River in Bellevue,
Wash. ``This is a final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Motorola, which developed the Iridium system and
took huge charges against earnings in the last two years because of
Iridium's difficulties, said the company regretted the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed to hear that Eagle River decided not to
bid on Iridium's assets,'' said Scott Wyman, a spokesman at
Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. ``From our perspective
the future of Iridium now rests with the bankruptcy court.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Motorola is unlikely to rescue the company, which
it helped found. Iridium has not paid Motorola to operate the
system since November 1998, and the company recently told reporters
that it would not bid on the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has also taken a hard line on the company, saying it
would not provide additional aid unless the company reorganized its
operations and attracted substantial financing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Iridium, which began offering service in early
1999, has been a dearth of subscribers. Many also complained of
bulky telephones, operational glitches and expensive service.
Iridium recently said it had about 50,000 subscribers. At one
point, there were estimates of 42 million subscribers by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This McCaw deal never made sense to me,'' said Andrew Cole, a
vice president at Renaissance Worldwide, a consulting firm that has
worked with Iridium. He said that Iridium was incompatible with ICO
and Teledesic and that it had no data capabilities. ``To do what
McCaw would like to do, he'd have to rip the thing apart and then
start over.''

CHILDREN OF GAY PARENTS FARE BEST AMID HONESTY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Eds: Repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 3-year-old daughter of a lesbian couple flew for the
first time, the preschooler struck up a conversation with the woman
in the seat behind them. ``Who are you traveling with?'' the
parents heard the woman ask their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two moms,'' the 3-year-old answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is your real mom?'' the woman replied.
</P>
<P>
   The child was incredulous. ``Do you believe in ghosts!?'' she
asked. ``They're both real!''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of social worker Jade McGleughlin's favorite
anecdotes and not just because it makes her chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything she can think of, it illustrates two points
widely agreed on by professionals who study children raised by
same-sex parents. The first is how accepting and matter-of-fact
young children are about their family's differences. The second is
how important it is for parents to be open and truthful about those
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's interaction with a culture that is homophobic
impacts parenting every step along the way,'' says McGleughlin.
``They don't just need practical strategies; they need inner
strength that comes from feeling secure within their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: Children fare best when there are no secrets.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 6 to 14 million children in the United States
who are being raised by same-sex parents, this isn't always so,
says Manhattan psychologist April Martin, the nation's foremost
clinician specializing in gay and lesbian family issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were born to heterosexual couples and have been
raised by a homosexual couple after a divorce. If they are
struggling not only with the split-up of the family, not only with
a parent's changed identity, but also with a secret, ``this is a
child in distress,'' says Martin. She is the author of ``The
Lesbian and Gay Parenting Handbook'' (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   When a parent's sexuality is hidden from a child, he senses
something is wrong; lacking information, he fills in with his
imagination, which is often worse than the truth: ``Dad must be
sick or dying.'' When the family story is hidden from the world, it
becomes a source of shame: `` `There's something wrong with my
family' typically evolves into `There's something wrong with me,'
'' says social worker Jennifer Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a child's sense of shame can be so deep that Firestone
counsels partners not to become parents unless they are willing to
be open. Firestone is the founder of Alternative Family Matters, a
counseling and resource agency, and leads workshops for prospective
lesbian and gay parents at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For partners who can't be out for fear of losing custody or a
job, she urges at least being open with your child. Otherwise, says
McGleughlin, ``children have no way to voice their distress about
the way the world is treating them.'' McGleughlin is the founder
and codirector of the Center for Alternative Families, also in
Cambridge, and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you have left a heterosexual marriage, a good rule of thumb
is to tell a child as soon as possible that you are gay, no matter
what his age, says Martin. For instance, a mother might say:
``Something I have discovered about myself is that I love women.
I'm not involved with anyone now, but I might be and you might have
questions and feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time (or in preschool, if your child has been raised
since birth by you and a same-sex partner), give a child the
language he needs, for instance: `` `Hetero' means `different' in
Latin, and `sexual' refers to gender, so heterosexual parents are
parents of different sexes, a man and a woman. `Homo' means `same,'
so homosexual parents are two men or two women.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are partners whose child has been with you from birth,
begin then to tell him his story, not just how he came to be born
but also that there are different kinds of families, some with a
mom and a dad, some with a stepparent, some with two moms or two
dads, some with grandparents. Talking about this with relatives and
strangers as well as with your baby is as much for you as it is for
your child, notes Martin: ``For many parents, it takes some getting
used to to speak these words out loud. You need to build up your
muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Establishing your own comfort level comes in handy soon enough.
All children of same-sex parents come home with uncomfortable
experiences early in life, from a classmate's innocent question _
``What do you mean, you have two moms?'' _ to being excluded: ``My
mom says you can't come to my birthday party because you have two
dads.''
</P>
<P>
   By far, children with two dads have the hardest time, says
developmental psychologist Charlotte J. Patterson, a professor at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to notice two men and a child, so more
notice is drawn to these kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why what parents model counts so much, even when a
child is only a baby. Are you afraid of questions or do you respond
with good faith and information? Do you go into the school and
advocate for your child _ ``This is who we are; what can we do to
support/help you present this to the community?'' _ or shirk from
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do becomes the equipment a child works with. The
toolbox,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes every toolbox includes community support. ``All
children of gay parents need to see and know other children who are
like them,'' says Firestone. McGleughlin says, ``It's a source of
strength to see that life isn't just about not being something but
also about being something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Witherill and Susan Brace of Cambridge are convinced of
the truth in that. They became involved with a group of lesbian
families even before their daughter, Moira, now 13, was born. For
years, the group of mothers traded baby-sitting and overnights for
the kids and shared summer vacations. In fifth grade, when Moira
faced a barrage of nasty taunts by peers, it was the support of
children from that group that helped her through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk to them, one friend in particular,'' says Moira.
``There were some things I didn't even tell my moms.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stages of development
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Moira's response was driven by her stage of
development. This can play a key factor in how a child of any age
copes:
</P>
<P>
   --Infants and toddlers. What their family looks like to the rest
of the world matters not at all to them, as long as they are well
loved, says Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   --Preschoolers. Children begin to notice all kinds of
differences: the color of a playmate's skin or hair; that someone
has a mom and dad instead of two moms. They don't know, however,
that there is a cultural message attached to it, says Patterson.
Keep your response matter of fact and simply acknowledge the truth
in the observation: ``You're right, Sally has a mom and a dad. You
have two moms.'' Expand on it if you have other examples to point
to _ ``Gerard has a stepmom and a dad, and Maya has brown skin and
her parents' skin is white'' _ but also point out ways in which
your families are alike: ``We have a dog and so does Gerard's
family. You have a sister just like Maya.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wealthy Texas businessman who is one of Gov.
George W. Bush's biggest campaign contributors said Friday that he
had paid $2.5 million for political commercials that sharply
criticized Sen. John McCain and promoted Bush's environmental
record.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Sam Wyly, who recently sold two software
companies he co-owned for $7.9 billion, said that he and his family
had paid for the advertising, whose source had been a mystery in
recent days, to highlight environmental issues at a time when the
public is paying attention to the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's aides accused the Bush campaign of being behind the
advertising and called the ads a scurrilous attempt to evade
campaign finance laws. They said the Bush campaign was trying to
steal the election by placing a huge amount of anti-McCain
advertising on the air in New York, California and Ohio just days
before primaries in those states that could decide the outcome of
the Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The law is somewhat fuzzy when it comes to advertising about
political issues paid for by people or groups outside of a
campaign, with money that is not disclosed as a contribution. But
it generally bars a candidate from coordinating such an effort with
outside supporters, and it prohibits the commercials from making
direct appeals to vote for or against a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in our campaign's mind that the ads are
being sponsored, coordinated and managed by the George Bush for
President campaign,'' Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, told
reporters in New York. ``I think it's incumbent on the Bush
campaign to prove somehow that they are not involved in this
incredible act.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis offered no direct evidence to support his assertion, but
cited a tangle of personal, business and political relationships
between Wyly and his family and the Bush campaign to suggest that
their interests were so close as to be indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference on Long Island, N.Y., Bush denied
any link between Wyly's commercials and his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no knowledge whatsoever that Sam Wyly was going to run
this ad,'' Bush said. ``There is no coordination. I can't put it
any more plainly to you: I had no idea the ad was going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Dallas, Wyly had the same message.
Asked if he had had any contact with the Bush campaign, even
indirectly, over the commercials, Wyly said, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said that ``of course'' he hoped the commercials would
benefit Bush, but added that he had laughed as the commercials were
being prepared at how surprised Bush and his team would be when
they learned about what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the episode gave McCain an opportunity to turn
public attention back to the centerpiece of his agenda, an overhaul
of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe the Bush campaign is out of money and somebody's
putting in $2 million to try to hijack the campaign here in New
York,'' McCain said on the NBC News ``Today'' program before Wyly
revealed his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows where it came from,'' McCain said. ``We'll
probably find out, but probably too late. This is why campaign
finance reform is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials open with a picture of McCain superimposed over
smokestacks belching dirty air. The voiceover says that McCain
voted against solar- and renewable-energy programs, leading to
``more use of coal-burning plants that pollute our air.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator goes on to say that Bush ``led one of the first
states in America to clamp down on old coal-burning electric power
plants,'' and that the Texas governor was ``leading so each day
dawns brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said that the claim that Bush had cut down on
coal-burning plants was exaggerated, and that while McCain had
voted against spending programs to promote solar power and
renewable-energy sources in the case cited, he had also supported
them in other votes.

 UNDATED: ... like Maya.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Early elementary age. In kindergarten and first grade, you'll
begin to see some recognition of cultural values, from, ``Why am I
the only one in the class with two moms?'' to, ``I don't like being
the only one.'' This is a dawning sense that being different has
consequences, and it's your cue to talk about how the world works,
says McGleughlin.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends couching it in terms a child can grasp: ``You
know how the teacher has more to say about what happens than the
kids? Well, in the world we live in, there are more heterosexual
families than homosexual families, so they have more to say about
how rules work. Some of the rules in the world are good and some
are bad. One rule says that families with two moms aren't as good
as families with a mom and a dad, and that's a rule we want to help
change because we know it isn't true and it's not a good rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Follow through by being a visible advocate in your child's
school, being available to talk to parent groups, to girl or boy
scout groups, etc., says Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   --Late elementary and middle-school age. Because this is a stage
when children want more than anything else to be like everyone
else, it's the trickiest time for parents. ``Even the most loving
and accepting kid can be embarrassed by same-sex parents or at
least be more cautious about disclosure,'' says Martin. She says
it's not unusual for a 10-year-old to come home saying ``I hate our
family!'' or to ask ``Could you not hold hands in front of my
friends?'' or even ``Can I call you Uncle instead of Dad?''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson calls this one of the ``bumps'' same-sex parents have
to deal with. (Another one: mothers teaching a son to pee. ``You
draw on friends or relatives,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   As hurtful as the apparent rejection can be, Martin urges not to
take it personally. ``It's about the need to fit in, not about
you,'' she says. Her advice is to be as respectful and responsive
as possible: ``OK, we won't hold hands.'' If you have to draw a
line, try to negotiate around it: ``I can't pretend to be your
uncle, but maybe there's some other way we can make this more
comfortable for you.'' Some children are sad or withdrawn during
these years. ``Learn to tolerate the sadness but don't be silent
yourself,'' says McGleughlin. Let her know you're available to
talk, and initiate conversations even if she doesn't: ``Has there
been any teasing lately?''
</P>
<P>
   --Mid- to late-adolescence. A developmental task of these years
is coming to grips with your sexual identity. Once this is resolved
for a child, family differences are less of an issue, too, says
Patterson. Firestone points out that studies show that children of
gay parents are no more likely to be gay themselves than children
in the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some children have thicker skin than others. McGleughlin tells
of a 9-year-old who was tired of getting hassled about having two
moms. ``Look,'' he told his classmates one day, ``this is the way
it is. Get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moira Brace, now an eighth grader, says having two moms makes
her feel special. ``It feels good,'' she says. ``It's the same as
having a mom and a dad. They love you. You don't really think about
it day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Clue in all the adults in your child's life, from baby sitters
to parents of peers, on the story of your family: ``Charlie has two
moms. His biological dad lives in LA.''
</P>
<P>
   --Explaining homosexuality and heterosexuality need not include
a discussion of sex until you would have that discussion with a
child in any other family, usually about 9 or 10. When younger
children ask how babies are made, tell them honestly, but also
include the story of how they were made: ``Mama Sue and I could not
make a baby ourselves, so we adopted you!''
</P>

A BIRDIE BARRAGE ON THE BLUE MONSTER IS LED BY AMES WITH 61  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For the second consecutive day, players feasted on the
fabled Blue Monster golf course like hungry teen-agers at an
all-you-can-eat buffet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Monster course at Doral Golf Resort and Spa was
remodeled last year and 25 bunkers were removed, it was expected to
play easier than before. But nobody expected Friday's birdie
barrage during the second round of the Doral-Ryder Open.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ames set the course record with an 11-under-par 61.
Edward Fryatt shot 62, including a string of eight consecutive
birdies, which tied the PGA Tour record. Instead of the usual
strong winds that put teeth in the Blue Monster, conditions
remained calm, and the course looked defenseless. How low can they
go this weekend? If the wind stays away, Greg Norman's 72-hole
record of 23 under par (265) set in 1993 will be in serious
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a nine-under-par 63 to pace a hard-charging field,
Franklin Langham held a three-stroke lead at 15 under par (129)
after Friday's second round. Ames, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk and
Shigeki Maruyama were tied for second place at 12 under par.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was much different from the past few years at
this tournament, when many players complained after Raymond Floyd
remodeled the course in 1996. Floyd added bunkers and made an
already challenging course more difficult, causing some players to
balk. But the course was remodeled again last year by Jim McLean,
and the new version is far more player-friendly. After Friday, some
may argue that the course is too easy. But most players who were
asked seemed happy with the changes, and attributed the low scores
to the lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only reason it lacks the feel of a challenge is
because the wind is not up,'' said Ames, who broke the previous
course record of 62 held by Norman and Furyk. ``If the winds aren't
blowing, it's going to be easy. If it's blowing, it's going to be
tough. You have to accept that one year you're going to have 24
under winning, and the other year, eight under might win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryatt, a tour rookie, may never have another round like this
one. Starting on No. 4, Fryatt made eight consecutive birdies,
tying the mark established by Bob Goalby in 1961, and equaled by
Fuzzy Zoeller in 1976 and by Dewey Arnette in 1987. Fryatt had a
legitimate chance to make nine consecutive birdies, but his 12-foot
attempt for birdie at No. 12 slid past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty incredible,'' said Fryatt, who shot 29 on the
front nine. ``I felt like a guy tossing a no-hitter out there.
Nobody was talking to me. When I looked up, every putt was pouring
into the center of the hole. It was eerie.''
</P>
<P>
   After a birdie at No. 14, Fryatt was 10 under par through 14
holes. He could have become only the fourth player in tour history
to shoot 59 if he had finished with three birdies and a par, but
Fryatt bogeyed No. 15 and birdied No. 18 to settle for his 62.
Fryatt gave credit to David Frost, one of his peers on tour, who
gave him a putting lesson on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed my grip and it really worked,'' Fryatt said. ``I
have to send a bottle of wine his way. I admit, I was thinking
about 59, but I forgot about it after the bogey at 15. But I have
no complaints with a 62.'' &QL;

NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT TO FOCUS ON 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF `BLOODY SUNDAY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala._ For more than three decades, U.S. congressman John
Lewis has returned every March to this sleepy town on the banks of
the Alabama River to stand on the bridge where state troopers
cracked his skull in an infamous civil rights clash.
</P>
<P>
   Aptly known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' the March 7, 1965, attack on
600 freedom marchers by troopers armed with tear gas, bull whips
and billy clubs riveted the nation. Three weeks later, the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. led another voting rights march to
Montgomery, this time 25,000-strong and under the protection of the
Alabama National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Congress passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act that
banned the poll tax as a requirement to vote and imposed strict
federal oversight of Southern voting laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, D-Ga., has returned every year but one, to re-enact the
march across the hulking Edmund Pettus Bridge and most of all ``to
never, ever forget.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, at the 35th commemoration marking that galvanizing
event, he will not come alone. In a media event that precedes the
Georgia primary election on the actual anniversary, Lewis will be
joined by President Clinton, several Cabinet secretaries, 50
members of Congress, the cream of the civil rights community and,
again, attract the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the city's lingering racial woes and inequities
will be exposed; and some of the country's as well. But this time,
Lewis hopes the major focus will be on how much closer Americans
are to reconciling their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beaten. I was hit by a night stick. I had a concussion
right there on the bridge. To this day, I don't know how I made it
back to the church where we started,'' recalls Lewis, then a
21-year-old freedom fighter armed with only a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come from that to where the president of the United States
is going to join us; it is unreal. It is unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' trek to Selma's annual ``Bridge Crossing Jubilee''
intensified three year ago when he and Rep. Amory Houghton, R-N.Y.,
reached across the aisles separating races and political parties to
begin ``conversations on race.'' Working with Washington's Faith
and Politics Institute, Lewis and Houghton now lead other
congressmembers on pilgrimages to what some consider the holy
trinity of the civil rights movement: Birmingham, Montgomery and
Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Before descending on Selma, the group Saturday will tour the
haunting images in the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and take
the ``Freedom Walk'' around Kelly Ingram Park, where police dogs
and fire hoses were turned on marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, they will contemplate the Civil Rights Memorial,
a black granite tribute to 40 people slain in the struggle, and
visit King's somber Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before proceeding
to Selma, they are to attend services at the 16th Street Baptist
Church, Birmingham's first black church and the site of a Sept. 15,
1963, racist bombing that killed four young girls and appalled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   From the late-1940s until the mid-1960s, nearly 50 unsolved
bombings earned the city the nickname ``Bombingham.'' The 16th
Street pastor, the Rev. Chris Hamlin, says he will tell the
congressmembers that a another kind of tenacious violence still
tears at the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of inequities still exist; a lot of suffering
continues,'' says Hamlin. ``They don't have to look further than
that whole black belt of rural counties around Selma where there
are so few jobs and such deep poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis says congressional members who have joined the pilgrimages
have been profoundly affected. ``Some have compared their visit to
going to the Holy Land. Some have called it a spiritual renewal.
Some have gone and literally cried. Some have just found it
unbelievable,'' says Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis reminds them that measurable strides have been made,
albeit at great human cost. In 1963, says Lewis, blacks and whites
couldn't sit together at lunch counters, drink at the same
fountains, go to the same schools, live in the same neighborhoods
and only 2.5 percent of voting age blacks were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1965, the struggle to vote moved to Selma after the
murder of a young black activist named Jimmy Lee Jackson. The
slaying sparked plans for the 50-mile march to Montgomery that was
turned back by troopers in riot gear, Dallas County Sheriff's
deputies and white vigilantes. On March 9, troopers turned back a
second march led by King after the fatal beating of the activist
Rev. James J. Reeb drew national outrage.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, under federal protection, King, flanked by Lewis
and other civil rights stalwarts, finally reached Montgomery where
they were joined by 25,000 marchers from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, the new legislation allowed blacks to vote
who had never been to the polls and dramatically increased the
number of black elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Selma City Council and Dallas County Commissioners
Court are biracial and the police chief and fire chief are black.
</P>
<P>
   Selma still has the same white mayor, Joe Smitherman, who stood
with the troopers as they assaulted the marchers. ``But I went back
to a book signing last year and the mayor presented me to this
biracial audience,'' says Lewis. ``Back then he called me a
trouble-maker and a dangerous man. Today, he calls me a close
friend and a brave man.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just Selma. It's Alabama, it's the South, it's
the country. We're a better nation, we're a better people and at
least in the American South, we're in the process of laying down
the burden of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Houghton, a white Republican, believe they can bridge
America's racial distances one congressional member at a time. But
until last year, an emblem of the Confederate flag adorned the
pillars and arches that read, ``Welcome to Selma,'' at the foot of
the bridge. Just down Water Street, not far from where Clinton will
address a rally and near the site of a slave trading post and
Confederate munitions plant, blacks live in grinding poverty amid
overgrown lots and rusted vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Selma's black children are living in poverty,
says Rose Sanders, founder of the Voting Rights Museum and guiding
spirit behind the 3-day annual jubilee. A carefully planned
interfaith church service Sunday deliberately draws whites and
blacks but few of those whites ever return for the re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   Whites mainly live alongside whites and the same for blacks.
There is a surface and symbolic sharing of power, says Sanders,
whose husband is state Sen. Hugh Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whites still hold all the real economic and political
power, and there's a lot of lingering racial hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman postponed a trip abroad to join
Clinton. But even as members of Congress tour the state's civil
rights landmarks Saturday, Southern preservation groups are
scheduled to hold a counter-rally at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the League of the South, a group that wants Alabama to
secede and return the Confederate flag to the Capitol dome, the
Southern preservationists include the Alabama Heritage Coalition,
Alabama Proud and the Sons of Confederate veterans. The group has
announced it will unveil a ``Declaration of Southern
Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still problems,'' concedes Sandra Holley, a white
Chamber of Commerce volunteer who leads hundreds of tourists each
year through Selma's historic swath of blocks along the river.
</P>
<P>
   She takes them past the old cotton warehouses, the slave trading
post, the arsenal; she tells them Selma, far below the Mason-Dixon
line and a destination for Birmingham's steel and iron ore, was the
Confederacy's second largest source of cannons, horseshoes, uniform
buttons and other articles needed in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them that, today, a bi-racial, civic-minded group
called One Selma regularly meets, discusses problems, plans events
and maps out a path to better race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we can always make improvements,'' said Holley.
``But our town is pulling together and working together like never
before. This is a wonderful time for the eyes of the nation to be
on Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, pointing to the record migration of blacks to the
prosperous cities of the New South and even the small towns of the
old, agrees. ``To bring the dirt and the filth out from under the
rug of the country, we almost had to have Selma,'' says Lewis. ``It
had a cleansing effect on the very psyche of America.'' &QL;

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ On paper, New England ought to be George W.
Bush country. Not only does he have roots here _ his father was
raised in Greenwich, Conn., and his family has a home in Maine _
but he also enjoys broad support from New England's Republican
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are
supporting Bush. In stark contrast, his chief rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain, has no
state-level official supporting him in Connecticut, and only a
scattering of relatively obscure state legislators, former
congressmen and retired military veterans working for him in all of
New England. In Maine, for instance, McCain's state campaign
chairman is a retired Marine from Dresden who coaches college
softball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that McCain has a good chance of winning all five
New England primaries on Tuesday, and their 102 collective
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where McCain was trailing Bush last September
by 30 points, he now leads by more than 20. Ditto in Rhode Island,
where the GOP is weak and more than half of all voters are
independents. In Vermont, McCain's campaign chairman bragged this
week that victory was a foregone conclusion. Many experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain will sweep New England,'' said Darrell West, a
political science professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
``This is a segment that has a tradition of going for mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that tradition works in McCain's favor _ polls
indicate Bush has a good shot only in Connecticut and Maine _ it
may not be enough. Bush appears stong in California, Ohio and
Georgia, and is close in New York, with 101 delegates. So it is no
wonder that before Friday, neither Bush nor McCain had set foot in
New England since Feb. 1, the day McCain won the New Hampshire
primary by 19 points. McCain visited Fairfield, Conn. Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, the region's five states simply do not add
up to much Tuesday, said Jay Malcynsky, Bush's Connecticut campaign
manager. ``They don't have the number of delegates to deliver to
one candidate or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain is able to win most or all of New England, the rest
of the races, particularly California, New York and Ohio, will pull
him through,'' he said of Bush. But he conceded, ``It's been a
battle for Bush in New England since New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other region in the country, the
five-state New England region, from Connecticut up to Maine, offers
McCain a tailor-made, fiercely independent bloc of voters whose
counterparts delivered McCain primary victories in New Hampshire
and Michigan. In every state in this region except New Hampshire,
independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats, and only in
Connecticut are non-Republican voters banned from crossing over to
vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 in Massachussetts have switched registration in
time for Tuesday's primary, mostly Democrats to independents, state
officials said. Such momentum does not seem to have waned after
McCain's triple primary defeat last week in Virginia, Washington
and North Dakota, said Scott McLean, a political science professor
at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those elections were in different parts of the country, and I
don't see them slowing him down in Connecticut,'' McLean said in an
interview this week. ``I'm not sure anyone even paid attention in
Connecticut. People I talked to, they were asking me who won in
those states.''
</P>
<P>
   The last poll taken in Connecticut, by Quinnipiac College on
Feb. 17, after McCain's resounding win in New Hampshire but before
Bush's win in South Carolina, showed the Arizonan ahead, 52 percent
to 39 percent. But the McCain momentum, Malcynsky said, has
subsided since then, at least in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be competitive here,'' Bush's Connecticut
campaign manager said on Wednesday. But McCain _ who has no
state-level elected official openly backing him here _ still seems
to have a grip on Connecticut's electoral imagination. In Cheshire,
Conn, an affluent town southwest of Hartford with more unaffiliated
voters than Democrats and Republican combined, six of 11 registered
Republicans interviewed Friday said they will vote for McCain
Tuesday, based mostly on their perceptions of his character and
willingness to shake up Washington's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want George Bush's son in office; I've had enough of
Bush,'' said Sue Paulik, 59, who works in a Cheshire drug store.
``I think his policies would follow Reagan and what happened under
his father. The economy really suffered under his father.''

DOMINICAN AID HALTED OVER WESTCHESTER FUGITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of the House Committee on International
Relations has invoked a rarely used power to block $6 million in
aid to the Dominican Republic unless it hands over a man charged
with a 1991 murder in the legislator's district in Westchester
(N.Y.) County.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican, announced the move last
month after sending two letters about the case to President Leonel
Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Republic without receiving a
response.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Munson, a spokesman for Gilman, said that the attempt to
force an extradition by withholding aid was very unusual. ``It's
the first that I know of,'' he said. ``It's definitely not an
everyday occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The action already appears to have had some effect on the
Dominican government, which has responded with promises of a search
and has convicted the suspect in absentia. The suspect, Carlos
Grullon, has been a fugitive since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon, who lived in Westchester County at the time, was
indicted by a grand jury there in December 1991, charged with
murdering his wife, Yolina Arcenia Camacho. The police said the
killing took place in Tarrytown, N.Y., in front of five witnesses,
among them the two children of Grullon and Camacho. The children,
Richard, 10, and Dahiana, 14, now live with their maternal
grandmother in Sleepy Hollow, north of Tarrytown.
</P>
<P>
   Ater the killing, Grullon fled to the Dominican Republic, where
he was arrested. He spent several months in a Dominican jail before
being released on bail in 1992. He has been on the run ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gilman's office last week, a high-level Dominican
official said the government would ``deploy all necessary efforts''
to catch Grullon. Dominican officials have also met with Gilman's
staff, offering further assurances.
</P>
<P>
   And last Tuesday, a Dominican court tried and sentenced Grullon
in absentia for the murder and his bail violation, according to
U.S. and Dominican officials.
</P>
<P>
   The frozen aid money is earmarked for programs to promote
democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Gilman allowed more
than $1.5 million for AIDS prevention and for the coming
presidential election to go through at the request of the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Once Grullon is caught, Dominican officials said, the Dominican
attorney general will consider the case for extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said in a statement: ``The government of the Dominican
Republic has informed me that it will do all it can to arrest
Carlos Grullon. This is a significant first step toward securing
his extradition. While I am pleased by this positive response, we
await further concrete action.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Munson, three other legislators besides Gilman have
the power to freeze aid money: the head of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the chairmen of the House and Senate
subcommittees on foreign aid appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman stressed that the money would not be restored until
Grullon was in the custody of U.S. officials. ``I am not prepared
to relinquish my holds on assistance funds for the Dominican
Republic until we see real progress in achieving the arrest and
extradition of Carlos Grullon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had an extradition treaty with the Dominican
Republic from 1910 until the country passed a law in 1969
precluding Dominican citizens from being extradited. But three
years ago, after lobbying from U.S. officials, the Dominican
Republic passed a law allowing extradition.

 &HT;    New Orleans initiates anti-ludeness campaign
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Anyone who has ever been to Mardi Gras has a
favorite lewd story.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that time the girl on Bourbon Street contorted her body
like a crab and the guy... Or the time the two women on the balcony
took their shirts off and... How about the beads that woman got for
showing her...
</P>
<P>
   If the New Orleans police could be all places at all times,
there would be no such stories at this year's Mardi Gras
festivities, which kick into high gear this weekend. The police are
cracking down on the Mardi Gras ``tradition'' of flashing breasts
or even private parts in exchange for strands of brightly colored
plastic beads. The beads usually are thrown from parade floats, but
they can also be bought all over the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The police last week taped 1,000 posters around the French
Quarter_epicenter of the bustling breasts for beads trade_warning
revelers that ``flashing'' is a crime and could cost $1,000 and
some jail time.

   This isn't the first year New Orleans has enforced laws barring
public nudity. Last year, police arrested 360 flashers during Mardi
Gras. But it is the first time there have been posted warnings and
public announcements about the campaign against lewdness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known them to make a big deal about it,'' said Ken
Kneipp, who was in town this week from Minnesota but lived in New
Orleans for 30 years. ``I think it's kind of crazy. No one gets
hurt or injured or even offended.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sandy, agreed, but with a caveat: ``It's fine down
here on Bourbon Street, but if it is in the neighborhoods, with the
children, it would matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus is the divided nature of Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   To most residents, Mardi Gras is about the parades that begin
several weeks before Fat Tuesday, March 7 this year. The parades
weave through Uptown New Orleans, the Garden District and Mid-City
and usually end downtown on Canal Street. They never enter the
French Quarter. The Quarter, especially Bourbon Street, is for
tourists who want to attend one of the world's largest, and
lewdest, street parties.
</P>
<P>
   But there is breast-baring along the parade route, and there is
no question the act prompts generous bead tossing from the float
riders. Robert Johnston, a New Orleans native who is in the
parading krewe of Bacchus, which rolls down St. Charles Avenue
Sunday night, said things begin to get raunchy around Lee Circle,
at the edge of the warehouse district downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wall-to-wall extravaganza down there,'' he said. ``To
harass people for that is the stupidest thing I have heard in my
life. If you don't want to see it, don't go past Lee Circle. And
you enter the French Quarter at your own peril.''
</P>
<P>
   While some residents could care less what goes on downtown,
others say the police are right to crack down on public nudity.
More than 3,000 people flooded the New Orleans Times-Picayune with
calls, e-mails and faxes when the newspaper asked what readers
thought of the crackdown. Two-thirds sided with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ruining Mardi Gras,'' one reader wrote of the
flashers. ``It's become trash, strictly trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the suburbs, where Mardi Gras is decidedly tamer, the
issue of obscenity arose this year. The Gretna City Council voted
to ban ``sexually explicit throws'' from their carnival floats.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governing body decided to allow the tossing of
women's panties from floats.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're pro- panties _it's on the record,'' Councilman
Vincent Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   On Bourbon Street, the police warnings carry some weight, but
they aren't exactly scaring the, ahem, pants off any partyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking me if they'll go to jail if they flash,''
said Jimmy Burgin, a bartender at Tropical Isle, home of such
famous drinks as the Hand Grenade and the Horny Gator. The warning
sign that was up at the bar keeps getting torn down. ``If I see
someone out on the balcony dropping pants or whatever, I tell them
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Atchue, a tourist from Boston, didn't seem too worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get awesome beads when I flash,'' he said. ``I showed some
lady mine, she showed me hers_she even took her shorts off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask a tourist on Bourbon Street what Mardi Gras is all about and
you usually get the same answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think beads, and I think flashing,'' said Matt McCue of
Wooster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Magazine, which has a nine-page spread of flashing from
last year's Mardi Gras in its current issue, has incensed some city
officials, who are determined to remind the world that Mardi Gras
is about more than beads and breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck: Playboy.Com even has instructions on what women will
do for beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Present an ordinary strand of those worthless, little plastic
pearl necklaces to the right woman, and she might give you a peek
at her muffalettas,'' says the site, referring to women's breasts
as a traditional New Orleans sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   So far, police say they have arrested more than 50 people for
public nudity and lewd acts.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a long weekend.

TESTIMONY OF PETE ROSE'S GAMBLING HABIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dying for a little sports ``action'' because the Bruins and
Celtics aren't giving it to you? Then get on-line, set aside a
couple of hours, read the 225-page Dowd Report, and understand why
baseball commissioner Bud Selig is so adamant about not reinstating
Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   This report was presented to the public May 9, 1989. John M.
Dowd, a Washington lawyer, was hired as chairman of the special
committee set up by then-commissioner Peter Ueberroth, to look into
Rose's alleged gambling. The full report can be found at
www.dowdreport.com, and it's fascinating reading.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, you will not have one doubt in your mind that
Rose bet on hundreds of baseball games, and many of them were games
involving the Cincinnati Reds, the team he was managing. No matter
how much Rose denies it, this report has him every which way but
loose. It has testimony from his ``friends,'' who placed bets for
him and from bookies who took the bets. It also includes betting
slips and telephone records to support the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Pages 119-190 are riveting. It is a daily journal of every bet
Rose made from Opening Day, April 8, 1987, to July 5, 1987, which
was the All-Star break. Here is Rose's action on Opening Day: he
won $2,000 on the Reds; lost $2,200 on our heroes, the Red Sox; won
$2,000 on Minnesota; and another $2,000 on California.
</P>
<P>
   On April 11, he bet eight games: he won $2,000 each on the Reds,
St. Louis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Detroit, Seattle, and Houston,
and lost $3,200 on Philadelphia. Obviously motivated by his
winnings, Rose bet heavily the next day, and won $2,000 each on the
Phillies, Dodgers, Royals, and Twins. However, he lost $3,400 on
the Reds, $4,800 on the Mets, $2,800 on the Indians, and another
$2,600 on the Angels. So on April 11, he made $10,800, and gave
back $5,600 the next.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that Rose's life in that period (1986-1988),
was consumed by sports gambling. It has him locked into betting
with three bookies _ one in Ohio; one in Tampa where the Reds
trained; and one in Staten Island, N.Y., where he would go when he
owed money to the other two. Rose used a friend as a ``straw'' to
make the bets, and it is the sworn testimony of one of these
straws, and the bookie in Ohio, that negates any alibi Rose tried
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's typical bet was $2,000. When he was short on cash, he
would often go to card/memorabilia shows, and leave with a satchel
of cash, carried by one of his buddies. There are a couple of
humorous asides in the report. Early in one of these seasons, the
scoreboard in Cincinnati was not working for a couple of weeks, so
Rose could not keep up with the out-of-town games he bet on. So his
straw at the time, a friend named Paul Janzen, sat in the stands,
and by hand signals, told Rose whether he was winning or losing on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen had a cell phone and would call the national sportsline
to get inning-by-inning scores. Often Rose would come to the top
dugout step, look at Janzen, give him a signal asking ``what's
going on?'' and Janzen would respond with a thumbs up or thumbs
down. In another episode, Janzen's girlfriend placed a bet on
behalf of Rose and Janzen, and realizing that she bet more than
they wanted, tried to cancel the bet. The bookie refused because
the team they bet on was losing, 6-0, after the first inning.
However, she got off the hook when the team rallied in the ninth to
win, 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Rose and his friends was masterful, and
until Rose admits he not only bet on baseball, but lied about it to
the investigators, then no commissioner is going to lift the ban
and give him a chance to get into the Hall of Fame. There is no
evidence that he ever bet against his own team, and although there
is no final accounting of if he won or lost money, he clearly comes
across as a loser.

   John Wooten should be given the ``Most Courageous'' award in the
NFL for 2000, even though he's retiring and hasn't played in 25
years. Wooten was one of the best offensive linemen in the league
for the Cleveland Browns when Jim Brown was posting record-breaking
performances.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement as a player, Wooten worked all across the
league from scout, to personnel director, through the league
office, winding up in the front office of the Baltimore Ravens,
where he got to know Ray Lewis, who has been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a Chicago Tribune interview, here is what Wooten had to say
about Lewis, and the current state of affairs in the NFL: ``I
personally feel almost fooled because born-again Christians (which
Lewis purports to be) don't go to places like that _ too many drug
dealers and strippers. We're hearing that he didn't do the
stabbing, but you wonder how a young man who makes so much money
($26 million contract) and who is so popular in our community could
risk it all by running with the people he was with.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that players used to go out with players and
protected each other from situations like that. But today's players
have to surround themselves with these ego people who are only
interested in the player's name and money. Now I go into the locker
room and hear our players calling each other (racial slur) and it
hurts my soul. We've had people killed for saying that word, and
now they are using it like nothing. People didn't want to listen to
(former Steelers coach) Chuck Noll a few years ago when he said
there's a thug element in our game and if we weren't careful,
they'll take it over. He was right.''

   Jamie Fox of Northeastern University, one of the foremost
authorities on criminal behavior, was asked to talk about the
increasing frequency of professional athletes being involved in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these athletes have roots in poor neighborhoods and
gangs. Just because you can take the player out of the
neighborhood, that doesn't mean you can take the neighborhood out
of the player,'' Fox said. ``A lot of these players have developed
a sense of entitlement because other people have taken care of
things for them; done their thinking for them; not given them a
sense of responsibility, and sometimes they take things too far.
You can't say (in the cases of Lewis and Rae Carruth) that their
background is responsible (for being implicated in murders) because
there is a direct correlation between poverty and murder, and these
players are not poor. They had money. But money doesn't bring you
good sense, or the ability to understand certain situations. When
people in other businesses are a success, and gain wealth, they've
done it with their brains. With a ballplayer, it's brawn not brain.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL they are conditioned to use their brawn, to be
aggressive. When they get into a situation where they have to made
a decision, brawn or brain, brawn is going to win most of the time.
That's when they get into trouble. But when they do, people start
making excuses for them.''

   Buffalo's Doug Flutie and St. Louis's Kurt Warner (this year's
regular-season and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player), might have a
lot in common next season. Word out of St. Louis is that the Rams
still feel Trent Green, who was the starter before he was injured
in the final preseason game, is the better quarterback. New coach
Mike Martz is going to have a lot of explaining to do if Green
starts after what Warner did last season. In Buffalo, Rob Johnson
will go into training camp as the starter. Your humble reporter
asked a top Cleveland Browns executive last week why the team
passed on Warner when St. Louis placed him on the expansion list,
making him available to them for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked out his background,'' the executive said. ``We were
told that the only reason he was with the Rams is that they were
doing a favor for some coach. The coach who had this guy (Warner)
in Arena Football was going to work in our (NFL) European League,
and wanted to keep Warner with him. To play in Europe, a player has
to be on an NFL roster, and that team has to assign him to the
European League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach knew someone in St. Louis and asked them to do a
favor. They did it, because it didn't cost them anything. When you
assign a player to Europe, he doesn't count against your own
roster. You can have an exemption, but you still have the rights to
him. So the Rams didn't know how good he was, and our people
didn't, either. Then he shows up as the MVP. What does that tell
you?''

   The FleetCenter is going to take a financial beating this spring
with the Bruins and Celtics both blowing the playoffs. The teams
receive about $1 million at the gate for every playoff game, and
the FleetCenter's take is close to $200,000 per contest, as it's
end of the business ranges from suites, preferred seats, and
concessions. The Red Sox won't have any money problems. In spite of
increased ticket prices, they have had a record-breaking 99 percent
season-ticket renewal after their big 1999 season. Less than 50
accounts, out of more than 7,000, didn't renew. Generally, the rate
of renewal is less than 95 percent.

   Football Hall of Fame inductee Howie Long, on some people who
helped him along the way when he was growing up in Charlestown, and
later playing football at Milford High School: ``Ron Burton gave me
the first uniform I ever had when I was a kid in Charlestown trying
out for Pop Warner. He was a very nice, gentle kind of man. I'll
always respect what he tried to do for us over there. And then Ray
Hamilton gave me a nice call after I was voted into the Hall. Ray
was my camp counselor on Cape Cod one year in a football camp my
high school coach, Dick Corbin, sent me to, and he was very
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was the original Patriot draft choice, a black man who
started Pop Warner football in, at the time, almost all-white
Charlestown as a favor to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know anyone over there,'' says Burton, an
executive with John Hancock who is known across the state for his
wonderful charitable work. ``But a friend asked me to start it up.
I was over there for four or five years, almost every night in the
fall. I had to borrow the money to buy the uniforms from Bucky
Warren (Sporting Goods Co. at the time) and old Bucky thought I was
crazy. But I paid it all back eventually, and the program helped a
lot of kids. I was thrilled when Howie got picked for the Hall
because I felt like I had a small, very small, part of it, but
still, I had a part of it.''

Dolphins, after Bruce Smith left Buffalo and joined the Redskins:
``As soon as every left tackle in the AFC East heard that Bruce

he's near the end, he can still crank it up on Sundays when he

   Harry Sinden remembers where he was 40 years ago last Monday. He
was the captain of the Canadian Olympic hockey team that had just
lost the gold medal to the United States in a tremendous upset at
Squaw Valley: ``A bunch of us decided we were going to go to Reno
and cry in our beer. The nearest town to Squaw Valley was Truckee,
Calif. You got the train there to go to Reno. We were early for the
train and decided to stop in a bar right across from the station.
The bartender found out who we were, and made some smart remark.
Next thing I know, one of our guys jumps over the bar and starts
throwing punches. Then the wildest brawl you ever saw broke out. It
was like an old wild west movie, and a lot of us got to Reno with
lumps on our head.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Riley, who coached the winning US team, had a different
experience. ``I was coaching at West Point, and when I arrived back
there, I couldn't wait to see the superintendent. When I asked him
for a leave of absence to coach the team, he told me yes, but
(kiddingly) said don't come back unless you win. Three jeeps with
military police met me. The search lights were turned on as we
drove up. All 2,400 cadets came to the superintendent's house. They
had the Zamboni in front of his house. And they had a seven-gun
salute with the West Point cannons, one for each win. Then we all
went back to the hockey rink and had a party.''

CLINTON STEPPING UP EFFORTS TO NORMALIZE TRADE WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Mont., Nev.)  (js 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, amid signs that support for an
important China trade accord is slipping away, will send a bill to
Congress as early as Wednesday that permanently normalizes trade
relations with Beijing, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated timetable answers calls from pro-trade members
of Congress, who have urged the Clinton administration to push for
an early vote because of mounting evidence that the measure will be
an even tougher sell as election-year politics intensify. Organized
labor has made defeating the China trade measure a top priority,
and a senior House Democrat has warned that as many as two-thirds
of his rank-and-file are ready to vote against the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Even pro-trade Republican leaders say they are having trouble
rallying support among their members. China's renewed threats to
use force against Taiwan and the administration's own report that
the human rights situation in China has deteriorated have given
fresh ammunition to right-wing opponents of the trade measure as
well as to those on the left.
</P>
<P>
   The administration calls the vote its most important remaining
foreign policy goal. The president has said a loss would be
``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is being asked to surrender its annual review of
China's trade status and to grant the country permanent normal
trade relations, a privilege enjoyed by most other nations. Last
year, the administration pledged to Beijing that it would work to
grant it normal trading rights as part of a broader package that
paves the way for China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A `no' vote would not necessarily derail China's drive to join
the trade body. But China could then revoke normal trading rights
for the United States, denying U.S. businesses some trade benefits
it grants other nations. Failure to pass the measure might also
lead to a serious rift with Beijing, which has long pushed to
eliminate the annual trade review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's really in everyone's interest to see this vote
happen soon,'' said Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who is leading
Clinton's campaign to drive the measure through Congress. ``There
is a sense that the chances get marginally worse the longer we
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shift in strategy, the administration will seek a Senate
vote before a House vote, reversing the usual order for such
legislation, administration officials said. Supporters hope that a
favorable vote in the generally pro-trade Senate will give them
momentum for the looming battle in the House, where both Republican
and Democratic leaders say scores of undecided lawmakers make the
outcome too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a carefully calculated campaign to step up pressure
on Congress, Clinton has also decided to devote an unusually large
amount of time to lobbying lawmakers, coordinating strategy with
business executives and giving public speeches extolling the
benefits of increased trade with China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the president plans to deliver a broad address
here focused on the future of U.S. relations with the world's most
populous country, and administration officials are considering
sending the bill to Capitol Hill that day as well.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its congressional allies say they have
found a way around one tall hurdle that pro-trade legislators had
feared could delay a vote for months. They plan to include a
provision that makes China's permanent trade status conditional on
China joining the World Trade Organization on terms equal or better
for the United States than those negotiated last year.
</P>
<P>
   That should put to rest any talk in Congress that a vote cannot
be held until the European Union, Mexico and a handful of other
countries complete their own talks with China about joining the
Geneva-based trade regulatory body, administration officials said.
Europe's talks are dragging on far longer than anticipated _ some
observers say that Europe is using China's eagerness to get
permanent trade status here as leverage in its negotiations _ and
the administration says it can no longer hold off until Europe
seals a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the bill's passage are good in the Senate, which
traditionally is more supportive of trade agreements than the
House. ``It's a done deal,'' said Sen. Max S. Baucus, a Montana
Democrat who favors permanent trading status.
</P>
<P>
   Other pro-trade lawmakers agree that the Senate will approve the
measure, but only after a bumpy ride. Some Senate Republicans have
grown increasingly alarmed over Beijing's recent bellicose warnings
to Taiwan. Many Democrats are under pressure from organized labor
to reject the pact on the ground that it does not ensure adequate
worker and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are potholes in the Senate as well,'' said Sen. Pat
Roberts, a Kansas Republican and strong supporter of permanent
trading status with China. Roberts said his fears were reinforced
Friday after a conversation with Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman. ``Privately, he's worried that this is coming apart,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   In another troubling sign for supporters, Sen. Harry Reid of
Nevada, the second-ranking Democrat, said in an interview Monday
that he was leaning in favor of passage. But after meeting with
labor leaders this week, Reid is now having second thoughts, top
Democratic aides said. Reid is concerned, aides said, that passage
of the bill could so alienate labor unions that they would depress
Democratic voter turnout in battleground states like Michigan,
where Democrats hope to pick up a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe the toughest fight will be in the House.
Labor has made the vote a litmus test for Democrats, with the
Teamsters and United Auto Workers lobbying legislators especially
hard. Even Vice President Al Gore, who has been courting labor's
vote, has sent mixed signals about his support for the China
accord, which gives wavering Democrats political cover to vote
against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposite camp, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group
for some of America's largest corporations, will kick off a $1.5
million television advertising campaign this weekend in support of
China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking Democrat, said
this week that 128 of 211 House Democrats now oppose the measure.
``The administration is in trouble in the House, and they know
it,'' Bonior told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But a key pro-trade Democrat, Rep. Robert Matsui of California,
dismissed Bonior's vote-counting. He said the trade vote this year
is higher-profile than previous annual votes of whether to renew
China's trade status and that most members, in the end, will favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get this bill to the floor, we'll win it,'' Matsui
said.

SOX REACH TERMS WITH FIVE MORE PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Then there were two: The Red Sox came to
terms with five more players Friday: outfielder Jermaine
Allensworth, pitcher Tomo Ohka, second baseman Donnie Sadler, and
pitchers Brian Rose and Jin Ho Cho. The Red Sox have cleared the
decks of all players except for closer Derek Lowe and catcher Jason
Varitek, both of whom they would like to sign to multiyear
contracts and be spared future arbitration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who was renewed for the minimum salary of $200,000 last
season, which left a bad taste, will be paid $250,000. Brian
Daubach, who was at $215,000 in 1999, will be paid $295,000, with
Trot Nixon believed to be at $275,000, and Sadler at $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Red Sox policy is to pay players with fewer than 45
days' service time the $200,000 minimum.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Coming/going attraction
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Twins ace Brad Radke will soon grow accustomed to the
scene he encountered in the Twins' clubhouse Thursday night after
his two innings of work _ a cluster of visiting writers wondering
if he'll soon be pitching in (fill in the team of your choice)
because of his uncertain contract status. The Twins want to sign
Radke, who is eligible for free agency after the season, to a
contract extension, but Radke is insisting on the right to demand a
trade after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it,'' Radke said when asked if he will be
changing zip codes any time soon. ``That's the way I am. Things
happen for a reason. If something gets done here, great. If not, we
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   No writer's block
</P>
<P>
   The Twins and Red Sox play back-to-back games this weekend,
which could raise the question of how Pedro Martinez will react
when he encounters La Velle E. Neal III, the Minneapolis writer who
left the Sox ace off his MVP ballot last winter. Neal said Thursday
night that he received more than 400 e-mails when his vote became
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of 'em were pretty descriptive,'' he said. ``One guy said
he was going to e-mail me every day to remind me of what a big
idiot I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he won't turn from anyone who wants to talk to
him. ``I don't see any reason to approach him,'' said Neal, who
added that he still wouldn't vote for a pitcher. ``Based on what
I've read, he's not upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But Twins manager Tom Kelly had a little fun with the writer.
When Neal noted that the Twins were missing Martinez Friday night,
Kelly said: ``You may be trying to avoid him, but we're not. No, we
like facing Pedro. It gives us something to go by with our young
guys. Let's see how we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Nomar?
</P>
<P>
   No wine before its time: The April edition of Wine Enthusiasts
magazine has a story about Nomar Garciaparra joining fellow
shortstops Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter in purchasing a new
winery in Napa Valley, which they plan to call Position Six. The
name, of course, corresponds to the number used for the shortstop
when keeping score. The story said the three had enlisted the aid
of wine consultant Heidi Barrett, who is as big in the wine biz as
the players are in their game.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next, a wine rack next to the bat rack in the Sox
dugout?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The piece was all in jest, part of the magazine's
April Fools edition. Mike Schachner, senior editor of the magazine,
is a Yankees fan. ``All in fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the surprise. Garciaparra said Friday he has become
quite the avid wine collector. ``Strictly reds,'' said Garciaparra,
who noted that several teammates are ahead of him in their
expertise. ``Sabes (Bret Saberhagen) knows his wines, Val (John
Valentin), Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea (of the winery). I'll have to talk to Derek
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen all cleared up
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen worked out after missing three days with a sinus
infection, similar to what laid up Lowe last weekend . . . The Sox
have 57 players in camp, compared with 58 a year ago. The
breakdown: 27 pitchers, 7 catchers, 14 infielders, 9 outfielders.
Forty-two of the players in camp have played in the big leagues . .
. CEO John Harrington arrived in town earlier this week.

BRADLEY CRITICIZES CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IN FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Four days from the elections that could
derail his presidential campaign, Bill Bradley switched gears
Friday from his campaign rallies and delivered a major speech on
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Bradley criticized the Clinton administration's
approach to Russia and China while singling out campaign foe Al
Gore on related issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's foreign policy message was a topic most voters
don't name in surveys about their top concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As for the timing of the speech, Bradley said shallow treatment
of foreign policy in this year's campaign makes him nostalgic for a
time when such a contest turned on whether a candidate was
qualified to help protect the world.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley had always promised to lay
out his vision for global peace and prosperity, and that Friday was
as good a time as any.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states conduct primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday,
and Bradley, who trails Gore in the polls in every one of those
states, has said he must win some to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized what he views as Bradley's ivory-tower
approach to several issues, saying that the presidency is not an
academic exercise. Bradley shared his foreign policy thoughts in a
50-minute address to about 600 students Friday in a cathedral-style
lecture hall at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey said that as president he
would be prepared to use military force _ in certain situations _
to resolve human rights crises in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment of U.S. troops should be considered only to
stop egregious human rights violations; only when no other
solutions are available and only when our military leaders are
confident that their strategy will be successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for a stronger U.S. role in the United Nations
and further use of its humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said
the government has botched its relationship with post-Communist
Russia. It has produced a situation ``in which the world's only
other nuclear superpower is coming apart at the seams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not ignore Russian corruption or human
rights violations against Chechnya and should consider cutting off
financial aid to Russia unless there are assurances that the money
won't go to the military or the elites, Bradley said. But at the
same time, he continued, the United States needlessly antagonized
Russia by swiftly adding more European countries to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also sent confusing signals on its role in
supporting Taiwan's relationship with China, Bradley said. At the
same time, China should be granted permanent normal trade status
with the United States as a way to expand not only trade but also
democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his most specific reference to Gore, Bradley said the vice
president hurt the chances for a trade agreement with China last
month when labor leaders claimed he pledged to them that he would
negotiate tougher requirements on China. The White House insisted
that Gore meant he would seek tougher labor standards in future
trade agreements, not the one pending with China.
</P>
<P>
   While criticizing Gore in the foreign policy speech, Bradley's
statements about the vice president were generally muted.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is Bradley questioning Gore's truthfulness or the
consistency of his voting record on abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville and looking beyond Florida's March 14 primary,
Gore assailed Gov. George W. Bush's stances on gun control and
federal aid for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the nearly 2,000 students at Raines High, where the
student body is almost entirely African-American, that he
vigorously opposes the anti-affirmative action campaign called
``One Florida'' that is led by Gov. Jeb Bush, the brother of the
Texas governor, whom Gore may be opposing in the November
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chided George W. Bush, as well as GOP presidential
candidate Sen. John McCain of Arizona, for not calling for
mandatory trigger locks on guns to avert tragedies like this week's
fatal shooting of a Michigan first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   In his plea to preserve affirmative action programs, Gore said
those who want to abolish the concept ``have blinders on'' and
refuse to acknowledge racial inequities that have persisted for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the conviction of Maria Hsia, a political fund-raiser
and longtime associate of the vice president, Gore said ``... the
jury has spoken, and I'm not going to comment further on a matter
that is still working its way through the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsia was convicted Thursday of channeling more than $100,000 in
illegal contributions to Democratic candidates in 1996, including
$65,000 in tainted money she brought in the day after Gore's
controversial appearance at a Buddhist temple.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ No one doubts that there is tremendous money to be made
helping companies do business with one another over the Internet.
And judging by the enormous multiples that investors are paying,
they seem pretty sure which kinds of companies are going to make
that money. But are they right?
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business electronic commerce, known as B2B, covers a
lot of ground. For some years, companies have been developing
digital links with customers, distributors and suppliers to improve
supply-chain management and demand forecasting and to squeeze out
inventory costs.
</P>
<P>
   But lately the concept has taken a quantum leap in scale, to
encompass whole industries buying, selling and trading with one
another online.
</P>
<P>
   Now growing numbers of software companies and dot-com start-ups
are pouring in, enticed by the prospect of billions of dollars of
transactions in, say, auto parts, freight-hauling services or
specialty chemicals passing through a Web-based ``exchange'' or
``marketplace,'' akin to an eBay for big business, that they could
build and control.
</P>
<P>
   And investors have followed, sending stock prices soaring for
B2B companies like i2 Technologies, based here in Dallas, whose
market capitalization of around $26 billion is about 1,000 times
last year's earnings; i2 began life 12 years ago as an enterprise
software concern.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba and Commerce One, two of i2's competitors, have also seen
their stocks shoot up 20- and 30-fold from their offering prices,
standing out even in the highflying technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement by General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler
that they would combine forces to create a single Internet
marketplace through which to do their buying has called into
question whether the keys to the gold mine will ultimately be
claimed by the B2B players or the Old Economy companies they want
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the automakers' announcement froze out the technology
companies: Oracle, the Redwood City, Calif., database and
e-commerce concern, was chosen to be a key technology provider to
the new venture along with Commerce One, and both stocks have
jumped since the announcement. But it is not certain that playing
the limited role of technology supplier will ever yield enough
revenue to justify today's sky-high stock valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say most B2B exchange revenue will come three ways:
from recurring subscription and maintenance fees from participants,
from a small commission on each transaction and from equity stakes
in the new exchanges. Together, the amounts should be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few hypotheticals. Total B2B transactions are
expected to rise from $145 billion last year to $7.3 trillion in
2004, according to the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. A cut of,
say, 0.25 percent of that in transaction fees would yield nearly
$20 billion in annual revenue, with much more growth to come.
</P>
<P>
   As for equity, some Wall Street analysts are already estimating
that the Big Three's exchange could, as a publicly traded company,
have a market capitalization of more than $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably at least a trillion dollars in market cap up
for grabs in the B2B industry,'' said Andrew Roskill, an analyst at
Warburg Dillon Read. ``At the end of the day, there are probably
only going to be a very few winners in each vertical industry
sector, but those guys are going to command a very high premium.''
</P>
<P>
   For some others, it won't be pretty, as the aftermath of the
carmakers' Feb. 25 announcement suggested. As it became clear
during the day that i2, which had been helping GM with its own
Internet site, had been left out of the new venture, its stock fell
by more than one-quarter from its high that day.
</P>
<P>
   The stock recovered some of the lost ground last week, thanks to
happier news about new Internet exchanges in the apparel and ground
transportation industries and a successful meeting here with
analysts; i2's shares closed Friday at $170.75.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the episode shows that for all the talk of the New
Economy triumphing over the old, some e-business highfliers cannot
count on being masters of their own fate. Many traditional
companies are rapidly deciphering the B2B world and demanding
better terms for their participation, sometimes leaving smaller
slivers of equity and lower fees for the technology companies than
they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect Oracle's cut of the new auto venture to be
smaller relative to Ford's than the two had initially discussed for
Ford's own Web site project, although terms have not been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, competitive tensions run high. The chief
executive of i2, Sanjiv Sidhu, said in an interview last week that
his staff was still negotiating for a role in the automakers'
exchange. Sidhu argues that Oracle is not in his company's league
technologically. ``It's tough to really understand what they have
to offer if you measure it based on what they have up and
running,'' Sidhu said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, an Oracle spokesman said new products due in the
next few months would make the company ``the best of the breed for
supply-chain software'' and that i2's exclusion, so far, from the
Big Three's venture meant that ``i2 is now irrelevant in the auto
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gilbert, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, agreed
with Sidhu that Oracle lagged behind i2 in some crucial areas of
technology. He said i2, struggling to cope with a huge flow of new
proposals, was searching for a more standardized and efficient way
to strike deals.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Gilbert said, i2's ``biggest challenge has been
marketing, because they've seen farther down the road than most,
and they've had to bring people along.'' But lately, he said, ``the
market has caught up with them. It's like everything is coming
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about B2B in general, Sidhu said fears that fees and
equity stakes for companies like his would be squeezed were
overblown. Demand for new Internet exchanges and associated
software is so great, he said, that everyone is focused simply on
getting sites up and running, not on the financial fine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many patients needing attention,'' Sidhu said, ``and
there's a shortage of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies may have an easier time in fields where
both buyers and sellers are fragmented, like agriculture, than in
concentrated industries where a handful of companies hold all the
cards. Leah Knight, a principal analyst at the Gartner Group, said
the automakers must have realized that they could dictate terms,
and ``if they want to take a larger percentage of the transaction,
that comes with the turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Roskill said the same dynamic was developing elsewhere. ``The
last six months or so, we've seen a bit of a wake-up call from
traditional industry players trying to shift the balance of power
away from the technology providers to the actual people who provide
the order flow,'' he said. But, he added, there is a limit to how
far the pendulum should swing: ``It makes sense to give the
technology provider a stake that's meaningful, so their interests
are tied together'' with the users'.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, Knight sees a shakeout ahead. While some
B2B players ``have the potential to become companies in the upper
end'' of the Fortune 500, she said, ``maybe not even half'' of
those now in the field will be winners. The current stock market
valuations of the remainder leave them a lot of room to fall.

HOW THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL STRAINED GORE'S TIES TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not until the night of Aug. 10, 1998, after
seven months of public denials, that President Clinton told Al Gore
the truth about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president and his vice president lunched alone
together each week, before that night, in the back of a darkened
limousine in Chicago, Gore had never asked and the president had
never told whether he had had a sexual liaison with the White House
intern, according to close associates of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore learned the truth just a week before Clinton grudgingly
admitted to a federal grand jury, and then to the public, that he
had had an ``inappropriate'' physical relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man has ever publicly discussed their conversations
about the affair, which ultimately led to the president's
impeachment, but their actions offer some clues about the strains
that Clinton's disastrous dalliance brought to their partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared buoyed by his belated confession to the vice
president, leading aides to speculate afterward that Gore had given
him a vow of unconditional support that he later made good on. That
night, aboard Air Force One on the way to Los Angeles, he bantered
with reporters about disaster movies and seemed relaxed to senior
members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, emerged from the car stunned and sobered.
Friends and associates say he was angered by Clinton's deceit,
repulsed by his behavior and appalled at his recklessness. Gore
brooded then and afterward about what the episode might mean for
his own presidential ambitions. His sense of loyalty struggled
against an offended morality, a conflict that, his friends say, has
not yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left that night for a long-planned vacation in Hawaii,
where he went into virtual hibernation with his family in a
borrowed beach house. On the day of Clinton's grand jury testimony,
Aug. 17, the vice president did not appear in public to defend him.
Gore's Washington office issued a brief statement saying in part,
``I am proud of him, not only because he is a friend, but because
he is a person who has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was an effort to reconcile two competing impulses
that often tugged at Gore over the course of the Lewinsky
controversy: his desire to remain loyal to Clinton while distancing
himself from the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in January 1998, when accusations that the president
had had an affair with a White House intern were first published,
the vice president's words and actions concerning the Lewinsky
matter followed an intricate trajectory. One question that Gore has
left unanswered, over the course of the controversy and its
aftermath, is whether he soon began to doubt the president's denial
of an affair _ a denial Clinton maintained even as more evidence of
his entanglement with Lewinsky emerged _ and, if so, when.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few days after the January reports, Gore issued a
vigorous defense of the president. But he then retreated into
months of nervous silence. After Clinton confessed the truth seven
months later, Gore defended the president's performance in office
while conspicuously saying little about his personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, released his incendiary report on the Lewinsky episode,
Gore, first at a White House prayer breakfast and then at an
evening event honoring Irish-Americans, praised Clinton's character
and courage. But within days he again fell silent, letting others
defend the president and attack Starr.
</P>
<P>
   That December, when the impeachment debate became a matter of
partisan combat, Gore again spoke out forcefully on the president's
behalf, most memorably on the day of the House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign for the presidency, Gore has tried to avoid
the subject, issuing rote answers about the president's ``mistake''
and asserting repeatedly that the public cares about the future,
not the past. He and his wife, Tipper, have put substantial
physical and symbolic distance between themselves and the White
House, appearing there infrequently and shunning campaign
appearances by Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical separation has been only partly successful. Half
the public believes that Gore has been tainted by his association
with Clinton, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll
released this week. Responding to the statement ``Al Gore is too
close to Bill Clinton to provide the fresh start the country
needs,'' 49 percent of respondents agreed and 49 percent disagreed.
The numbers are unchanged since September.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore relationship has always been complicated and is
already drawing scrutiny in this year's campaign. At its core is a
mystery: How has Gore reconciled his essentially conservative,
family-centered personal values with the looser morality of his
mentor and partner?
</P>
<P>
   Gore will not say. He declined requests for an interview for
this article, and in responding to written questions a spokeswoman
said the Lewinsky matter had been studied exhaustively for two
years by an independent counsel, Congress and the press. She added
that the vice president did not discuss his private conversations
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made clear a number of times that the president is his
friend, but he was as disappointed as all Americans were by the
president's personal mistake,'' said the spokeswoman, Laura Quinn.
``The vice president shares the view of all Americans that it is
time to turn the page and focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore frequently refers to Clinton's ``mistake,'' without ever
specifying what he means. Was the mistake getting involved with
Lewinsky? Lying about it under oath? Deceiving the public, his
family, his staff and his vice president?
</P>
<P>
   ``Res ipsa loquitur,'' replied Gore's chief campaign spokesman,
Chris Lehane, using a legal term from Latin that means ``the thing
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Did Clinton ever apologize directly to Gore for the affair or
the deception? If so, neither man is saying, and Gore would be one
of the few to have received an apology. Spokesmen for Clinton and
Gore say any such conversations were private and will remain so.
But two White House advisers say they suspect that Clinton offered
some sort of apology to Gore that August night in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed in interviews to say how he views the president's
conduct, Gore has always tried to escape the subject as quickly as
possible. His most extensive comments were made to Diane Sawyer of
ABC News as he was beginning his presidential campaign last spring.
He evaded one question that dealt with his learning the truth of
the Lewinsky affair, saying, ``You can imagine how I felt.''
Pressed further, he said, ``What he did was inexcusable, and
particularly as a father I felt that it was terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sawyer asked directly if the president had lied to him, he
replied, ``Certainly the impression that he gave me and the others
that he worked with was not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Gore has ducked the issue entirely. When Jay Leno
asked him on ``The Tonight Show'' how he could remain a friend of
the president while distancing himself from the Lewinsky affair,
the vice president's body tensed, and his face became a rigid mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever have a friend who made a mistake?'' he answered.
``I'm running for president on my own, with my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the public eye, Gore has struggled with his feelings
about Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Neel, a longtime aide to Gore and one of his best friends,
said that the matter had left the vice president alienated from
Clinton but that the two remained ``mutually supportive,'' at least
on a political level.
</P>
<P>
   And on a personal level?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't even venture to guess what's in his heart of hearts,''
Neel said of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore, two moderate Southern baby boomers, seemed a
perfect fit when they first came together in 1992, campaigning by
bus across the country to the sound of Fleetwood Mac and cheering
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But their public camaraderie masked an intense rivalry and
mutual wariness. Clinton, who had assiduously avoided the draft as
a young man and was now already suspected of extramarital
dalliances, was disappointed that Gore did not defend him more
forcefully that fall in a debate with Vice President Dan Quayle,
who said Clinton lacked the character and integrity to be
president. Despite their apparent close relationship during the
campaign, it soon became clear that contrary to Clinton's early
assertions that they would have an unusually close governing
partnership, he would not be operating any kind of co-presidency,
at least not with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal only added to an unbridgeable distance
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the investigation and the impeachment battle,
Gore was stalwart in his public defense of the president, while
keeping his private doubts entirely private, even from his closest
friends and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal first broke, Gore said, ``The president has
denied the charges, and I believe him.'' He added then, as he has
so many times since, ``He is not only the president of our country,
but he is my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the vice president introduced Clinton at a raucous
rally in Champaign, Ill. His hands slashing the air and his voice
rising to a shout, Gore said, ``I want to ask you now, every single
one of you, to join me in supporting him and standing by his
side!''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements stood as Gore's public testament for seven long
months, until Clinton finally confessed his version of the truth to
the vice president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the White House staff
and ultimately the grand jury and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, was outraged at both the president's
actions and his breach of trust, friends say. Her unforgiving view
of the affair affected Gore's attitude then and now, according to
these associates. She has appeared at few White House functions in
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, between denial and confession, what did Gore
believe? Most Americans _ even most White House officials and
Clinton loyalists _ suspected that something unseemly had occurred.
Was Gore the last person in Washington who thought Clinton wholly
innocent?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between believing something and wanting
to believe something,'' said the political consultant James
Carville, a friend of both Clinton and Gore. ``I'm sure he hoped it
wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to the vice president said Gore's duties had
never included spiritual counsel to the president and that he could
thus plausibly claim ignorance of the truth of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton may have been trying to protect Gore from
the matter by not involving him in scandal strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But after the grand jury testimony _ and particularly after the
release of Starr's damning report _ Gore rose again to the
president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the House voted four articles of impeachment against
the president, Gore watched part of the proceedings with Clinton in
the private study off the Oval Office where Clinton sometimes met
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair, what they've done to you,'' Gore told the
president just after the vote, according to an aide who was
present.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Gore introduced the president to an odd pep
rally of Democrats on the White House South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the saddest day I have seen in our nation's capital,''
Gore told the die-hard throng. He chastised Republican leaders for
engineering the impeachment vote and said, in words that will most
likely provide fodder for Republican television advertisements this
fall, ``What happened as a result does a great disservice to a man
I believe will be regarded in the history books as one of our
greatest presidents.''

GIRARDI, SOJO AND DAVIS WILL BE MISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Players come and go every year, but a few leave a
small part of themselves behind, some trait that will be woven into
the fabric of the team for a year or two, or a generation of
players.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard for anyone on the New York Yankees to gripe
about a lack of playing time without remembering Joe Girardi's
unselfishness, the way he tutored his successor at catcher without
any complaint.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard for anyone to be unprepared for a game without
thinking of Luis Sojo, who might play twice a month at second base
and still be effective, and have fun doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will talk about an opposing pitcher in the dugout
between at-bats and think of designated hitter Chili Davis and how
much he liked to discuss hitting.
</P>
<P>
   But Girardi, Sojo and Davis are gone. So, too, is designated
hitter Darryl Strawberry, whose corner locker was cleaned out
before Friday's game, his equipment packed away, his nameplate
removed a few days after he was suspended from baseball for failing
a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are beginning the process of adjusting to their
absence. They lost to Toronto, 7-2, Friday, their second defeat in
two days to the Blue Jays at the outset of this exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Bradley, among the most talented of the Yankees' pitching
prospects, continued to struggle with his mechanics. He allowed
five hits, four runs, a wild pitch and a hit batsman in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid, but he's a little lost out there,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   If the regular season began Friday, the Yankees would be
scrambling for healthy pitchers. Orlando Hernandez was scratched
from his scheduled start in Saturday's exhibition against the
Pittsburgh Pirates because of a muscle strain in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good,'' Hernandez repeated Friday in response to
virtually every question that related to his health.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza continues to suffer from what the Yankees believe
is bronchitis, but his treatment has been adjusted and he may be
told to stay at his apartment for a few days. Ed Yarnall, too, has
had a sore back. He hopes to throw in the bullpen in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi and Sojo were seen by their Yankees teammates as future
managers, smart men who had a knack for leadership and for adapting
to other personalities, and now Girardi is with the Chicago Cubs
and Sojo is with the Pirates. Davis would make a great hitting
coach, others say, now that he has retired. The three were
important to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a big part of the team, on and off the field,'' said
Paul O'Neill, who will one day leave his own keepsake of
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, the third-base coach, said, ``We lost three
real good teammates, three good people, and those guys are going to
be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees players lamented the departure of Tim Raines last
spring, feeling that his sense of humor, his easygoing nature and
his high-pitched laugh would be missed because he managed to keep
others from taking defeat and success too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo had filled some of that void. He, too, has an acute sense
of humor, has enjoyed a long career and has a deep knowledge of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be the most respected teammate I've ever been
around,'' David Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo speaks English, but his pronunciation of the language is
imperfect, and for the amusement of teammates, he would sometimes
accentuate the imperfections. Sojo would play intermittently,
sometimes after weeks of sitting on the bench, and he always
managed to do something significant with his awkward, flailing
swing, and then he would laugh about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis had a lot of fun playing, and you do need that throughout
the course of the season,'' O'Neill said. ``You need to laugh once
in awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo was very close to Derek Jeter, counseling him on his
defense. And Sojo devoted a lot of time to younger players,
particularly the younger Spanish-speaking players.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Ricky Ledee said if he had a bad day, Sojo would
make a point of asking him if he was all right. Randolph would go
to a restaurant late at night and he would see Sojo eating with the
younger players, like D'Angelo Jimenez or Alfonso Soriano.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi was the field leader when he played, Cone said. You knew
he was in control; you knew he would set a tone sprinting to and
from his position. Even as Girardi's playing time decreased and
Jorge Posada gradually developed into the Yankees' front-line
catcher, Girardi maintained his status as a clubhouse leader.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi sometimes spoke in team meetings, and it seemed to
others that his words were carefully chosen. And there was no doubt
everything he said was heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   He called a meeting last May and told his teammates that he did
not like the way they were going about their business. His words
were sharp and direct, and others listened closely.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph spoke to Girardi in the winter and told him how much he
would be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably one of my top 10 all-time teammates,'' Randolph
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was with the Yankees for only two seasons, missing a
substantial period because of injury. In that time, teammates came
to appreciate his devotion to the craft of hitting. Some of the
Yankees were more comfortable waging their hitting wars privately,
but Davis would sit on the bench between each of his at-bats and
talk about what the opposing pitcher was trying to do, how he was
trying to get hitters out. He was a sounding board for others,
someone to compare notes with.
</P>
<P>
   He lingered in front of his locker after games, talking about
baseball. After Ed Yarnall's first spring training appearance with
the Yankees last year, Davis _ who had faced Yarnall in the game _
told the left-hander that his fastball was good enough to win with
in the majors, to keep pitching to his own strengths. The words
still resonate with Yarnall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of guys are showered and walking out the door
quickly after games,'' Cone said. ``Chili was very old school in
that regard. We're going to miss that. It's hard to say who's going
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have other leaders. Tino Martinez and O'Neill
continue to establish a high level of intensity, and each year,
Jeter takes on more responsibility. Cone often speaks for the team
en masse, something the others appreciate. Roger Clemens seemed to
make an overt attempt to blend in, but now he is in his second
season and might inject himself into a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you'd like to have the exact same team,'' O'Neill
said. ``For me, Joe was probably my best friend I had on the team.
When you see people leave like that, you're going to miss them.''

BRUINS MUM ON BOURQUE   SPECULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ Ray Bourque and president/general manager Harry
Sinden declined to comment Friday on the increasing speculation
that the Bruins captain will be dealt to a Stanley Cup-contending
team before the March 14 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met Friday, but both said they elected not to talk
because there was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   However, as unthinkable as it may seem that Bourque would ever
play in a different uniform, recent events could prompt him to
change teams _ perhaps as early as today. A source close to both
sides said Bourque will change clubs _ it's just a matter of when _
and other sources indicated Friday that the team getting Bourque's
services will be Philadelphia, Detroit, Dallas, St. Louis, or
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the key reasons it will happen:
</P>
<P>
   --Injuries: A few days ago, Bourque believed the Bruins were
still a contender for a playoff berth. However, the team's abysmal
performance against Montreal Thursday indicates that even if it was
to claw its way into the top eight, there is no hope of going far,
given the losses of Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Byron Dafoe.
Carter announced Friday he will have wrist surgery soon and that
his season is over. It's unlikely No. 1 goalie Dafoe will be back,
either, after undergoing an arthroscopy on his right knee Friday.
The talent level of this team is so thin, the consistency so
lacking, that a playoff miss is all but guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   --Coaching: Bourque has been a big booster of coach Pat Burns,
especially in the worst of times. He has never been a controversial
figure in his 21-year career and has always been loyal to the
organization. But Bourque's vocal support of Burns after the coach
came under fire from team ownership was eye-opening. Bourque is
rumored to have been very upset with management about the way Burns
was being hung out to dry, but Bourque steadfastly maintained that
rumor is false. Bourque felt there was plenty of blame to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   --No Stanley Cups: Five Norris trophies and perennial trips to
the All-Star Game aside, Bourque's most cherished moments as a
professional were the two years _ 1988 and '90 _ he went to the
Stanley Cup finals. He enjoyed going through what he called ``the
wars'' of each round as the stakes went higher and higher. Since
it's clear the Bruins aren't going near the finals this year, it
makes sense that Bourque have one more shot _ especially since this
may be his last year.
</P>
<P>
   --His stance: Bourque has consistently said that if he won a
Cup, he wanted to do it in Boston. Bourque briefly considered
changing teams during the horrid 1996-97 season when it was clear
the Bruins were going to finish dead last. Beyond that, he always
said he would finish his career in the Black and Gold. He planned
to win a Cup in Boston, or not at all. But in the last few days,
Bourque hasn't nixed the idea. He hasn't confirmed he wanted to
change teams, especially because he believed the Bruins still had a
chance. Now that it appears they are headed for an early offseason,
it seems obvious Bourque is considering it.
</P>
<P>
   --Family: Bourque's family has always meant everything to him.
He has three children who are old enough to lead busy lives. If
Bourque were to play for another team for a couple of months, he
wouldn't have to uproot his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   If Bourque were traded, the question is: What would the Bruins
receive in return? No team that believes it has a real shot at the
Cup is going to give up a player of importance. Given that Bourque
would likely not have the same dominant role with a loaded team
would decrease his value. Add that to his age and it's likely
Bourque would net a draft pick, which would help Boston's
rebuilding status.
</P>
<P>
   If the Flyers were to get Bourque, he would be met there with
open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard it's something that, you know, I think
it's not a bad thing for hockey or for him,'' said defenseman Eric
Desjardins, who practiced with his teammates at Northeastern
Friday. ``He's played 21 years here and he feels his chances to win
with the Bruins are not good . . . why not? I think he deserves it.
He's played so hard for the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins said he likes the Flyers' chances to go deep into the
playoffs, but the addition of Bourque would be a big plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when you have a player like him on your team, you
improve by a lot,'' he said. ``We have what it takes to go all the
way; it's what I believe. If you have a guy like Ray on the team,
it gives you a lot more chance to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Flyers captain Eric Lindros said it would be strange to see
Bourque in a different uniform given that he's so closely
associated with the Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``To gain a player like Ray Bourque, a player of his character,
stature, and demeanor, just the way he handles himself on and off
the ice, you're picking up a fine hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzz is definitely in the air despite both sides staying
mum. Local sports radio station WEEI is saying a deal for Bourque
is already done, although the Bruins deny that vehemently.
Management said there is no indication any deal will be made to add
to the struggling squad or to accommodate Bourque's wishes to end
his career with a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many players out that it's difficult to do right
now,'' said O'Connell when asked, in general, about making a trade.
``We haven't ruled anything out but people who are looking to do
something in the playoffs don't necessarily want your injured
players. There's nothing going as of yet but there's still some
time.''

THERE'S NO BEATING BIG LEAGUE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, FLA. _ If it's a regular Red Sox spring training
game, the entire visiting team isn't standing on the top of the
dugout watching the home team take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's a regular college game, the school's athletic
director isn't watching his own team take B.P.
</P>
<P>
   For the big league team, it's a peculiar irritation, a spring
training game that really isn't a spring training game, a game that
has only two conceivable outcomes: validation or humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   For the college team, it is a fantasy game, a chance to tell the
grandchildren about the day grandpa either batted against
fill-in-the-blank or whiffed Mr. X, the noted big leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday night at City of Palms Park the Red Sox played their
annual spring training game against Boston College. Call it the
photo album game. This is the night when the mothers, fathers,
aunts, uncles, grandparents, brothers, and sisters snap away,
proving to whoever will later need to know that, yes, our
Billy/Mike/Andy/Jarett/Whomever really did get to play a game
against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our kids, this is the experience of a lifetime,'' says
Boston College coach Peter Hughes, a Brockton native. ``For me,
it's also the experience of a lifetime, since I grew up rooting for
the Red Sox. This game is everything for us in terms of recruiting.
We can say to kids that if they come to B.C. they will play against
the Red Sox in spring training and they will play in Fenway Park
during the Beanpot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big for us,'' confirms athletic director Gene
DeFilippo. ``Our kids get to play here and dress here. The Red Sox
are just wonderful to us. They put on a nice buffet before the game
for the alumni. I can't say enough about them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, lose-lose for the Red Sox and win-win for the
B.C. Eagles. So what if a Red Sox pitcher goes six-up, six down? So
what if a regular hits one halfway to Sarasota? Against Boston
College you're supposed to do these things, no?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but for B.C. there is no real down side. True, the B.C.
officials were a bit worried four years ago when they came off a
19-0 loss in 1995 with an even more gruesome 22-0 loss that
featured a first inning in which the Red Sox scored 13 runs before
the Eagles retired a man. In fact, from 1994-1998, the combined
score was 76-2. But Red Sox CEO John Harrington, (B.C. '57 with a
Masters in '66) assured the folks at The Heights that the series
would continue.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been reconsidering that position last year, when,
with two outs in the seventh and final inning and his alma mater
trailing his ball club by a 4-3 score, there were men on first and
second and 6-foot-7 inch Sean McGowan, arguably the nation's
leading collegiate power hitter, striding to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' says Hughes. ``I didn't know what
I was supposed to feel. I knew that it definitely wasn't going to
be a good idea to beat them. I mean, after all that flap during the
offseason with Mo, now we're at the start of spring training, the
first game, and they might lose to us?''
</P>
<P>
   So here was McGowan, who would wind up with gaudy .430-25-70
Triple Crown stats, who slugged a stratospheric .916 and who is now
a valued prospect (third round) with the San Francisco Giants, at
the plate. What if he put one over the palm trees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was a great fastball hitter,'' Hughes recalls, ``and when
he was up there we verbalized to him, `Inside fastball.' And he got
an inside fastball! But he didn't get the head of the bat out there
fast enough, and he grounded out. So it worked out real well. They
beat us by one, and we outhit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your eye on the Boston College baseball program. DeFilippo
is committed to making B.C. a force in the Big East, and when Mo
Moloney left the post following the 1998 season, he sifted through
an astounding number of applications before deciding on Hughes, who
had been the head coach at Trinity College in San Antonio for two
seasons. Hughes presided over a team of bashers who hit a
you've-gotta-be-kidding-me .354 while establishing a season high in
victories. The 26-21 Eagles averaged 7.5 runs. The only problem was
that they gave up an average of 8.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a guy who always believed in hitting and scoring a lot
of runs,'' Hughes says. ``Last year made a believer out of me. We
can hit with anybody. But we've got to find some kids who can throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   These games ordinarily bear little resemblance to a real affair
_ for either team. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams starts a veteran
lineup, but one at-bat for the regulars is the norm. After that
you're looking at the players they'll be seeing in Trenton and
Pawtucket. But they're still professionals, and they are wearing
the timeless white uniform with the red lettering.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, meanwhile, has a solemn obligation. ``We put in more
time preparing for this game than any other on our schedule,'' he
says. ``We have to make sure we get nine pitchers and 19 position
players into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean coach Hughes ignores his competitive
juices. In the midst of all his substitutions last year, isn't it
interesting that when Sonny Nictakis and Scott Foley reached base
in the ninth, Mr. McGowan just happened to be the next man up with
the game hanging in the balance?
</P>
<P>
   There were some nice B.C. moments last night. Starter Andy
Sullivan fanned Jose Offerman and Mike Stanley in a scoreless
first. Brian Durkin ripped a low outside Jason Sekany pitch down
the right-field line to score Neal McCarthy and give B.C. a 1-0
lead in the second. Shortstop Mike Hubbard made a sensational stop
of an Israel Alcantara smash for a great forceout at second to end
the third. Scott Foley made a leaping four-star robbery grab of an
Andy Sheets liner. Chris Rosado hawked a Gary Rath pitch over the
left-field fence in the seventh. B.C. looked like a ball club, all
right.
</P>
<P>
   But by the seventh-inninmg stretch, it was 6-3, pros. In other

 WASHINGTON: other votes.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commercials are part of a rapid expansion in the use of
so-called issue advertising. Issue ads can be paid for by the
political parties _ a technique President Clinton used to his
advantage in 1996 _ or by outside interest groups. As long as they
do not contain overt appeals to vote for or against specific
candidates and are not directly coordinated with a candidate, they
are as a rule not subject to regulation under campaign finance
laws, meaning that the sources and amounts of money behind them do
not have to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the groups behind issue advertising are vague
about their membership, Wyly's effort was a rare instance in which
commercials were aired without any hint of their origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrecy aspects of this are taking campaign finance
problems to yet another new and dangerous level,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group advocating tighter
campaign finance laws. ``What we're seeing here is the use of
unlimited, undisclosed money to influence a federal election, and
that's totally at odds with the whole notion of campaign finance
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance laws are fuzzy about what it takes for
issue advertising to step over the line into run-of-the-mill
political appeals. The McCain campaign's argument Friday was that
Wyly, his family and his advisers, in putting the commercials on
the air, did not need formal consultations with the Bush camp to
know that their effort would amount to a direct boost for their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother, Charles, gave more than $200,000 to Bush's
two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas. Charles Wyly is a
``Pioneer,'' the designation given to the top fund-raisers for
Bush's presidential campaign, those who have brought in at least
$100,000. An investment fund run by the Wylys has received business
from the University of Texas, whose board was appointed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican political consultant from Texas who helped to put
the commercials on the air, Jeb Hensarling, was once a business
associate of the chairman of the Pioneers, James B. Francis Jr.,
one of Bush's closest friends and advisers. The advertising firm
that bought time on television stations for the commercials in New
York has a long record of working with Gov. George E. Pataki, who
is helping to run the Bush campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Bush camp said they knew of no communication
between Wyly and his team and the Bush campaign concerning the
advertising. Francis, for example, said in an interview that he had
not even spoken to Hensarling in about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said he had been thinking for some time about creating an
organization, Republicans for Clean Air, to promote his message
that the party should do more to clean up air pollution. Wyly owns
a stake in a power company, GreenMountain.com, that bills itself as
producing and selling electric power generated with a minimum of
environmental damage _ a claim disputed by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's campaign said that Wyly had frequently donated
money to Republicans judged by environmental groups to have less
than sterling reputations on working for clean air and water. And
they said that it could not be a coincidence that Wyly chose the
days leading up to the most critical round of primaries in the
campaign to begin airing the commercials in New York, California
and Ohio, the three states with the most delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly went public Friday after the McCain campaign on Thursday
raised questions with the Federal Communications Commission _ which
McCain oversees in his role as chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee _ about whether the commercials adequately disclosed who
was paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign did not raise the issue of campaign finance
laws, but rather whether the commercials met a requirement of the
Communications Act of 1934, which holds that television stations
must say who has paid for commercials other than product
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Allyn, a media consultant to Wyly, said that Wyly was now
providing stations and networks with additional documentation, and
that the commercials would run as scheduled through Tuesday.

ALLEGED HACKER UNDER STATE, FEDERAL SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON AND RAFAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOLFSBORO, N.H. _ Dennis Moran's life had been fairly
unremarkable until FBI agents showed up at his door. They wanted to
talk to him and then they took the 17-year-old's most prized
possessions: three computers Moran says he used to hack into three
secure Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty boring without the computers,'' said Moran,
who describes himself as a loner with few friends in this small
town on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, Moran has been under investigation by
federal and state authorities after they said he used his screen
name ``Coolio'' to penetrate secured Web sites operated by a
leading computer security company, and DARE.com, a national
anti-drug Web site managed by the Los Angeles Police Department.
Phillip McLaughlin, the New Hampshire attorney general, said
charges of computer related crimes may be filed soon against Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Moran could face up to 15 years in prison and as much as a
$4,000 fine, McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Moran seems unfazed by the possibility of jail. For the
moment, his biggest concern appears to be his confiscated
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I just read books and watch the news,'' he said
standing in a cluttered three-bedroom apartment that he shares with
his father and two younger sisters. ``It would be nice to have
those computers back, and the FBI agents said that they plan to
return them to me sometime. When? I actually don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said investigators are combing through computer
records to gather evidence that could be used against Moran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job at this point is very mechanical. We're trying to
collect sufficient evidence through mountains of data, and that is
taking us longer than we had hoped,'' McLaughlin said. ``Our
investigation has been going on about three weeks. It's based on
having technicians carefully scrutinize the evidence. It's computer
forensics, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are also investigating whether Moran was responsible
for the attacks last month on YAHOO! and Amazon.com, two major
electronic-commerce companies. The sites were shut down for hours
after they were bombarded with simultaneous messages, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Moran denied hacking into those two sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jokingly told a few friends in a chat room that I did it,
but I really did not,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager said he regrets hacking into two of the Web sites _
a US Commerce Department site that sets rules for exporting
chemicals that could be used to produce weapons, and Rsa.com, a
leading Internet security firm _ but said he had no second thoughts
about infiltrating DARE's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret hacking into the DARE site at all,'' Moran
said. ``The organization puts out misleading propaganda, and I
think that drugs should be legalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he dropped out of Kingwood Regional High School last
year because he became ``bored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally keep to myself and stay inside the house,'' he
said, adding that most of his friends are people he met online.
</P>
<P>
   Camera crews and reporters swarmed around Moran's apartment
Friday, leaving this small, quaint town of 5,000 people overwhelmed
by the national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing to happen in Wolfsboro in a long
time,'' said Johanna Kent, 16, who attended school with Moran last
year. ``He was the kind of person who always wanted to get
attention, but I never thought he had the ability to do something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace Napoli, 73, a longtime resident of the town said she was
outraged by Moran's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young children have too much time on their hands,'' she
said. ``Where were his parents? Why weren't they supervising their
child's behavior on the Internet? I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran's father, Dennis F. Moran Sr., who works as a computer
consultant for a small company in Londonderry, N.H., could not be
reached for comment. The younger Moran said that the two have not
spoken about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, an increase in computer hacking incidents has
forced the US Justice Department to crack down after several high
profile cases. Two weeks ago, a Northeastern University student was
charged with hacking into the computer systems of several federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attorney General (Janet) Reno had a meeting in Palo Alto
(Calif.) a few weeks ago to talk about coordinating expertis to
combat hacking,'' McLaughlin said. ``She made one point abundantly
clear: this kind of situation is not going to go away any time
soon, so we have to be much better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kazanciyan, 18, a computer science and economics major at
Duke University calls himself a former hacker.
</P>
<P>
   He has designed and maintains a former underground Web site
called hideaway.net that focuses on computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, everyone tries to make themselves well-known. It's
hard to know who's genuine and who isn't,'' he said. ``A lot of
people brag about amazing hacks, and it's true. A lot of people
brag, and it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazanciyan said he believes that hacking is far more pervasive
than authorities are willing to admit. ``I guarantee that at least
half to three-quarters of all teenagers on the Internet have at
least dabbled with these programs. It's no longer like you're a
geek if you can work your way around a computer. Now it's getting
to the point where you're the cool one. You have power. That's an
amusing turn of affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McLaughlin said, the fact is hacking is against the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in the year 2000, even if they're young, have
the same obligations we've always had: You don't hurt your
neighbor, you don't hurt your friends, you don't hurt your
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he doesn't know what all the fuss is about. He claims
he inflicted very little damage and acknowledges that he is only
``semi-concerned with going to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something that a lot of people can't do,'' Moran said.

 &HT;    Severance deal worth millions to ex-Coke chairman
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Coca-Cola cut a check today to cover all future
benefits former Chairman M. Douglas Ivester could receive as part
of his severance, it would be about $14million.
</P>
<P>
   The severance deal also gives him immediate access to 335,000
shares of formerly restricted Coca-Cola stock, worth about $16.8
million as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 million figure is the estimated present value of what
Ivester, and his wife, Kay, will get over their lifetimes because
of the separation agreement he signed with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who will be 53 on March 26, stunned the business
community in December by announcing he would retire this spring,
saying Coca-Cola would ``be best served by fresh leadership.'' He
wound up leaving in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first ``in recent history'' in which no top
executive at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola was paid a bonus, according to
spokesman Chuck Reece. It was a year marked by declining profits,
dismal stock performance, troubled acquisitions and a massive
recall of the company's soft drinks in parts of Europe after a
health scare.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his separation package, Ivester receives:
</P>
<P>
   _ Payments of $1.5 million in February of this year and in
February of 2001 and 2002. The payments are in lieu of bonuses
Ivester might have gotten in the future, had he stayed at
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monthly payments of about $66,300 from now until March 2002,
when Ivester will be 55.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monthly payments of about $56,300, starting in April 2002, and
continuing as long as Ivester and his wife live. That's apart from
his monthly retirement benefit, which will run about $58,700 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consulting fees of $675,000 a year from 2002 through 2007.
</P>
<P>
   _ Title to his company car _ a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis _ plus
``suitable office space and secretarial services, maintenance of
home security systems and club dues for existing clubs'' until May
1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester had no employment contract, according to Reece. The
separation package was approved _ after his retirement decision _
to fulfill four goals of the board of directors, Reece said.
</P>
<P>
   One was to ``help ensure a smooth and orderly transition,'' he
said. ``Another was to recognize Mr. Ivester for his many
contributions during his 20 years with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The board also wanted to retain Ivester as a consultant, as well
as keep him from competing against Coca-Cola in the non-alcoholic
beverage industry, Reece added.
</P>
<P>
   Under Coca-Cola's agreement with Ivester, he cannot compete
against the company for seven years, according to Reece.
</P>
<P>
   Has Ivester indicated an interest in competing against
Coca-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to my knowledge,'' Reece said. The non-compete clause was
included to protect the interests of Coca-Cola, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy statement that outlines Ivester's benefits includes
the fact he received a salary boost in mid-1999, to an annual rate
of $1.5 million, from $1.25 million. It was his first salary boost
in 23 months, the proxy statement notes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his severance, Ivester got immediate access to an
additional 1,615,000 shares of restricted stock. That came under
conditions of an early retirement program Coca-Cola offered as part
of its plan to cut 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also received a $3 million benefit in immediate access
to outstanding stock options.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Ivester owns or has the rights to 4.4 million shares
of Coca-Cola, worth $221 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy statement does not disclose how much Ivester's
successor, Doug Daft, or President Jack Stahl will make in their
new jobs. Information on that will be disclosed in next year's
proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, formerly head of Coca-Cola's Asia, Mideast and Africa
operations, was paid $459,833 in salary last year and was awarded
options for 125,000 shares of stock. His annual base pay was
boosted to $750,000 in December when he was named president and
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, formerly head of Coca-Cola's U.S and Latin America
operations, was paid a salary of $485,000 in 1999, and also got
options on 125,000 shares of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has thousands of stockholders in Georgia,
will hold its annual meeting April 19 in Wilmington, Del. Among the
issues to be voted on is a proposal to end bonuses and stock option
programs.

 &HT;    Cremins wants win for seniors, to avoid Duke
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech basketball fans wish nothing other than
the best for Bobby Cremins, who today coaches his last home game as
Yellow Jackets boss.
</P>
<P>
   However, one Cremins desire won't be acknowledged this afternoon
at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is going to be for the seniors,'' Cremins said
Friday about Tech's regular-season finale against Clemson.
``Everybody has been great to me, and the accolades have been
incredible. But I don't want the focus to be on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Cremins announcing two weeks ago that he would not
return for a 20th season as the Jackets' coach, the crowd will
express lots of sentiment for the 52-year-old native New Yorker who
made Tech basketball magical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked Georgia Tech not to do anything,'' Cremins said.
``I'll come back in a few years, hopefully, and watch a great
Georgia Tech basketball team. ... I'm fine with everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is going to be some emotion, but I know it's
over for me. It's time for Bobby Cremins to move on. ... I just
want to go play the game, get out and go play the ACC Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Jackets (12-16, 4-11 ACC) do not have
anything to play for. A win over the Tigers (10-18, 4-11) would
allow Tech to avoid opening the ACC Tournament against top-seeded
Duke at 9 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a reversal of last month's 70-58 defeat at Clemson
would land the Jackets in a first-round match at 7 p.m. Thursday
against the loser of Sunday's N.C. State-Florida State game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cremins is dreaming of a 5-0 run to the ACC
Tournament championship that would make his exit grander than his
arrival. Even with a win today, the Jackets would have to at least
make the ACC title game just to qualify for an NIT berth.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Cremins _ the winningest coach in Georgia
Tech annals _ would settle for just one more triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about Clemson than anything. There's a lot
on the line'' he said. ``We are playing better, and I'm proud of
the way the team has responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, that Jackets' magic has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three or four weeks ago; I could just see it wasn't
coming together,'' Cremins said. ``What caused it? I don't know.
All I know is I failed in my attempt to get us back.
</P>
<P>
   `` It just wasn't there.''

SUCCESS ELUDED EX-COCA-COLA CHIEF, BUT BIG RETIREMENT DEAL DIDN'T

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's former chairman and chief executive left the company
last month after two turbulent years in which Coke's growth
stagnated, its earnings fell, and its image became stained by
problems like the biggest product recall in company history and a
racial-discrimination lawsuit. So dismal was the company's
performance in 1999 that no one in Coke's top management got a
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the executive, Douglas Ivester, is walking away
with a generous bon-voyage package: $17.8 million in payments and
benefits including stock options that can be immediately vested and
the release of nearly 2 million shares of formerly restricted stock
worth about $97.7 million at the close of trading on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When Ivester announced that he was stepping down from the top
job at Coke, at the age of 52, he and others at the company
described the move as a voluntary retirement. But the details of
the payments to be made to him, upon that retirement, create the
impression that Ivester departed on less than the best terms with
the board.
</P>
<P>
   A Coke spokesman said the board offered Ivester the retirement
package for reasons that included expressing appreciation for the
20 years he had worked for Coke and wanting to ensure a smooth
transition for Douglas Daft, who became chairman and chief
executive last month.
</P>
<P>
   The board also wanted to retain Ivester, who is no longer a
director, as a consultant and ``to preclude Mr. Ivester from
competing in the nonalcoholic beverage industry'' until 2007, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes $704,400 in annual pension payments, plus
an additional $795,600 a year beginning this month and continuing
until March 2002, when Ivester turns 55. At that point, Ivester
will begin receiving $675,600 a year, beyond his pension, through
his lifetime and that of his wife, Kay.
</P>
<P>
   He will also be paid $1.5 million a year for three years,
starting this year, in lieu of what he might have received under
long-term incentive plans that Coke offers its senior executives.
Elsewhere the proxy notes that ``neither Ivester nor Daft earned an
award for the performance period ended Dec. 31, 1999.'' And Ivester
will receive $675,000 a year for ``consulting services'' from 2002
through 2007, the proxy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a company will structure a severance package to make
it seem as if they are getting something back,'' noted Graef
Crystal, a compensation expert and a columnist for Bloomberg
Business News. ``But if I were him, I would not take my consulting
title so seriously as to start installing extra phone lines in my
house, because the lights are not going to go on at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One money manager expressed dismay at the size of the package,
which also includes a laptop computer, cellular phones, club dues
through May 2001 and the title to a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis,
Ivester's company car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compensation is outrageous, considering the mediocrity of
performance,'' said Fredric E. Russell, a Tulsa, Okla., money
manager who recently sold his stake in Coca-Cola. ``And it raises
serious questions about whether Coca-Cola can really be clear about
turning the ship around for its shareholders. This stands as a
monument to the close, cozy and perhaps nefarious relationship
between the board of directors and top management.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Scott Wilkins of Deutsche Bank, said the package
covered Ivester's entire two-decade career at Coke and should be
viewed that way. ``He had a very important contribution toward
building the Coke model prior to taking the helm of the company,''
Wilkins said, ``and those last two years coincided with some very
turbulent times for the company.'' The proxy notes that no bonuses
were handed out to Ivester, Daft and other senior managers,
although they did get stock options of up to 250,000 shares each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Coke said it would not ask employees who are
being laid off or offered early retirement as a result of the
company's plan to cut 20 percent of its work force to give up their
rights to participate in the racial discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The issue emerged a day after Coke announced on Jan. 26 that it
would lay off 6,000 people worldwide as part of a restructuring. In
order to receive better severance packages, employees had to sign
waivers that promised they would not take any legal action against
the company. While such waivers are commonplace, lawyers for the
plaintiffs in the racial-discrimination case said it put an unfair
burden on Coke's black employees, who might have joined a class
action against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has contributed to confusion at a sensitive time for
employees departing our company,'' said Jack L. Stahl, Coke's
president, in a memo explaining the change.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said in the memo that workers who had already signed
waivers would be contacted and their waivers canceled, and new
waivers would be issued to everyone affected by the layoffs. ``Our
goal all along has been to treat departing employees with the
dignity and respect befitting Coca-Cola people and minimize any
problems, not cause more anxiety,'' the memo said.

   Cyrus Mehri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said, ``This is a
triumph for all the courageous African-American employees who
challenged the company on this issue, and it will be better for
both the company and the employees.. A rally by those concerned
about the lawsuit is scheduled for Saturday in Atlanta.

SCALABRINE WILL TRY TO PLAY THROUGH PAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine was still
limping Friday from the strained hip he suffered against Stanford,
but said he would try to play today against California because the
Trojans' postseason hopes are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind is powerful,'' Scalabrine said. ``I'll convince
myself it doesn't hurt. I'm icing it like 150 times a day. I can
play. We need this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine injured his hip Thursday during the first half of the
Trojans' 111-68 loss to Stanford while trying to change directions
on the court. He sat out the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have limited movement,'' Scalabrine said. ``It's not like a
pain, but your mind doesn't let you move it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (14-13, 7-8) can ill afford to lose Scalabrine.
After weeks of mulling what they needed to do to make the NCAA
Tournament, they are now fighting just to stay in contention for a
bid to the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (16-11, 8-7) is probably a more attractive NIT
candidate because it draws larger crowds at home and features
explosive guard Eddie House, so the Trojans might have to sweep
their final three games for a bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop thinking about the NCAAs and NIT and just
look at Cal,'' Scalabrine said. ``We have to stop thinking we need
to go 3-1, or now 3-0, and look no further than the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Scalabrine refused to write off USC's NCAA chances
when assessing the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got blown away by Stanford, but if we finish 10-8 (in
conference), we would be in fourth place,'' he said. ``The last
five years, every team that finished 10-8 got in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy update: Forward Sam Clancy felt fine Friday after making
his highly anticipated return from a broken right foot against
Stanford. Clancy had four points and five rebounds in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Clancy said. ``There's no soreness today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy actually played more than USC coach Henry Bibby
anticipated against the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought more than anybody against Stanford, Sam competed,''
Bibby said. ``He was physical. We haven't had that presence in a
while. He showed the promise of what he can create inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket home: Bibby told injured forward Jarvis Turner (broken
ankle) he would send him home if he tried to grab another player by
the shorts during a game. Turner lunged out and grabbed Stanford
guard Casey Jacobsen by the shorts Thursday, and was quickly
assessed a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does it again, we send him home,'' Bibby said. ``That's
not something we stand for. He's trying to help the team, but he's
hurting the team. We don't condone that at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheepish Turner tried to defend his actions, with limited
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just out of frustration. I wanted to win and I got
carried away and caught up in the emotion of the game,'' Turner
said. ``It was real stupid. I shouldn't have done it. I was
frustrated sitting on the bench all season.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   YEKATERINBURG, Russia _ Igor Varov, wearing a pistol on his hip,
opens the sun roof of his big Mercedes 600 to remove the illegal
flashing light he uses to maneuver through traffic on the icy
streets of this industrial city in the Ural Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleague, Andrei Kabanov, are on the prowl in a poor
neighborhood where the heroin addicts are out at dusk searching for
dealers in the snowy courtyards and darkened stairwells. ``Look,
there's some addicts,'' he says, as the silver sedan careered into
the alley next to a dilapidated apartment block.
</P>
<P>
   Two teenage boys eye their arrival warily. Varov and Kabanov
jump out and start barking orders in almost one voice. ``Get over
here! Show me your arms. Tell me where they are selling drugs, and
don't lie.'' Varov is unfazed by protests from the teenagers _ one
is visibly shaking _ that they are not addicts and do not know
where drugs are being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Two other young men approach, believing that they have also been
summoned by Kabonov's repeated shouts to ``get over here!'' But now
Varov wheels toward them. ``What are you doing here? Get out of
here or I will break your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, where the supply
lines of opium and heroin out of Central and South Asia run into
big population centers near the frontier of the drug trade, a group
of tough guys have organized themselves as a foundation called City
Without Drugs. They are leading a brutal civic campaign to take the
streets of Yekaterinburg back from the drug dealers and the corrupt
policemen who are widely believed to be protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call ourselves the angered public,'' said Varov, 36, who
runs a construction materials company. ``And we are doing this for
people who want to be rid of these drug dealers. We go to these
drug selling sites with baseball bats and flashlights and find out
where the drug dealers are and beat them like wild dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawless vacuum that afflicts much of Russia today, Varov
and Kabanov regularly incite acts of vigilante violence against
drug dealers. They have also founded a drug treatment center where
addicts are forced to withdraw from heroin use cold turkey while
handcuffed to their beds _ or sometimes just to the nearest
radiator.
</P>
<P>
   They, and a loose knit band of business associates, are a sign
of the jarring social transition under way in many parts of this
country where vigilante violence and paramilitary organizations
have assumed a greater role in policing and guarding Russian
businesspeople and ordinary citizens. In the process, they often
intimidate and extort money from people who get in their way.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Varov went on television and said that if the drug
epidemic raging here ever touched his own family, the top law
enforcement officer in the region, Gen. Aleksei Krasnikov, ``would
not live beyond that day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They are up-from-nowhere street toughs, gang leaders or
sportsmen who in the last decade have muscled their way into one
business or another. As their power and wealth have grown, they
have embraced religion or taken up public causes. In some cases
this was genuine, but in others it was a means to clean up their
image and wrap themselves in the mantle of public-spiritedness
while staving off prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all for killing drug dealers on the spot without trial
because they are poisoning our children,'' says Kabanov, 40, a
onetime professional card player and former heroin addict himself,
who built a yacht club for the nouveaux riches of this region.
</P>
<P>
   He dresses in a natty black outfit and has a stubble of red
beard that enhances his roguish presentation. He and Varov have
determined that the heroin plague that is sweeping across Russia is
a conspiracy by Muslim nations and Chechen warlords to lay low
their motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants a strong Russia,'' Varov contends, ``including
America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute about the problem they confront. The opening
of borders and of formerly closed cities in Russia, along with the
collapse of the Soviet-era economy, ignited a wave of illicit trade
in everything for which there is a market in the world _ arms,
drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of less than a decade, the number of heroin addicts
here increased to an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 from a few dozen.
Drug addiction across the country is expected to reach 3 million in
Russia this year. That is well behind the United States, where
there are an estimated 12 million drug users, but the rate growth
in Russia is phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1999, heroin use in Russia was up 4.5 times
compared with the same period in 1998. And the number of HIV
infections, many of them from shared needles, doubled in 1999,
according to an Interior Ministry report issued in November.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where alcoholism already is rampant, a culture of
soaring drug addiction is gaining ground, further undermining the
basic health of the nation. Russia is suffering a sharp rise in
overall mortality and declining birth rates. The average life
expectancy for Russian men has declined to 61.3 years. For women it
is 72.9 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most serious problems facing the country
because it could take away an entire generation of Russians,'' said
Boris M. Tepliakov, a psychiatrist and the head of the state-run
hospital here that treats drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of government control, or feckless enforcement by the
central and regional law enforcement authorities, has given rise to
the spread of gangs and private security groups that assert their
own authority. On some days, it is difficult to sort out the
criminals from the noncriminals. Varov and his associates say they
stepped into the vacuum last summer, when the law enforcement
authorities were either overwhelmed or unwilling to act.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up with another business syndicate here called
Uralmash, and together they sent several hundred security guards
from their various enterprises to the Gypsy Village neighborhood
that serves as the center of the drug trade in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The security guards beat some suspected drug dealers and went to
the homes of others, threatening to burn them down if drug dealing
did not stop. Not long after, Uralmash security guards who patrol
an open-air market on the other side of town seized a suspected
drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   They tied him to a tree, hung a sign on him saying he was
poisoning the city's youth, pulled his pants down and jabbed old
hypodermic needles into his hind quarters while a film crew was
summoned from a local television station.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, City Without Drugs lent its expertise, and
perhaps some of its muscle, to a civic group in the nearby town of
Reftinski, where 18 suspected drug sellers were taken to a wooded
area and severely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Though incidents of vigilantism have been aired in the local
news media, neither the governor nor the mayor has commented on
them. Both declined requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official, Fedor Anikeyev, said he had received
``unofficial'' reports of vigilantism. The police were powerless to
act unless one of the beaten drug dealers walked into the police
station to swear out a complaint, which was not likely, he said,
because that would only subject him to further threats and
beatings.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts here, the antidrug crusade has significant
public support _ although it is impossible to measure _ from
citizens who are struggling in an economy of high unemployment,
industrial contraction and cynicism toward anyone who claims to be
working for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers of drug-ravaged teenagers have staged rallies and
organized drug patrols in courtyards and apartment building
stairwells. An electronic pager system set up by City Without Drugs
to enable the public to inform on drug dealers has received more
than 6,000 calls since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only when this group got active that the police started
to do anything,'' said an elderly taxi driver named Anatoly, who
has driven the streets here most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent figures supporting City Without Drugs
is Alexander Khabarov. A decade or so ago he founded the Uralmash
gang, reputed to be an organization of small-time racketeers that
came from the sports clubs in the industrial neighborhoods near the
Uralmash heavy machinery plant here.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Uralmash started many legitimate enterprises,
and by 1993 Khabarov was running for parliament. He is still
running. During last December's balloting, a majority of the voters
in his district marked ``none of the above,'' and the election was
voided. It has been rescheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Khabarov's security forces added their muscle to the forces
mobilized by City Without Drugs for an assault in September on
Gypsy Village.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The building that houses the City Without Drugs clinic is a
rundown former kindergarten on a small wooded plot in a village on
the outskirts of the city. It is surrounded by weathered cottages
on whose roofs the late winter snow is heaped like layers of
meringue.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 47 recovering addicts are in residence, making it the
largest such facility in the city. The withdrawal regime that
begins with bread-and-water rations and handcuffs is free.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Kobyakov, 19, is handcuffed to the bed nearest the front
window in the dormitory where the addicts spend their first two
weeks. He had been shooting up for four years. Getting heroin in
his neighborhood, he said, was as easy as ``buying a pack of
cigarettes.'' He decided to subject himself to handcuffs because
other clinics had failed him and ``because I have a great desire to
cure this addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to become a truck driver. His eyes look out from
hollowed sockets after four nights of pain and the insomnia of
withdrawal. ``I think my life will get better,'' he says, ``If you
lie here in handcuffs, you understand what it is and that you want
to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tepliakov, the chief narcologist in the regional government, is
highly critical of the withdrawal regime at the clinic. ``I thank
God that no one has died there,'' he said, ``but if someone does,
it is going to be a big scandal.'' He calls the City Without Drugs
methods dangerous and ``illiterate,'' and he condemns the
vigilantism that is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, let the devil himself fight this evil, but by
civilized means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Back in the city, in the curtained alcove of a restaurant,
Natalia Zernova, a journalist who has been chronicling the
political life of this city for three decades, tried to explain how
the explosion of drug addiction here triggered not only a
vigilante-style response, but political recriminations over the
failure of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian mentality demands action because we always demand
a strong hand,'' Zernova said, ``It is a tragedy that we have come
to vigilantism. Unfortunately, for the people who founded this
movement, vigilantism is part of their mentality, and no matter how
they try to appear as civilized people, their criminal past is
written on their faces and in their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zernova's reservations about the leaders of the anti-drug
movement do not overcome her basic support for their actions, and
this was a common thread in interviews conducted during a visit to
the city in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, I think it is better to do something than nothing
at all,'' she said. ``In a country where the use of physical
violence is the norm, using force against drug dealers is not going
to cause any anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Added 16-year-old Leonid Pavlukov, a lanky student who goes to
one of the best high schools here and wants to become a lawyer:
``Thanks to the activities of this foundation, people are afraid of
selling drugs. Of course it is not ideal that they are beating
people, but Russia is in a period of transition and so long as
there are no good laws on the books, and so long as the police are
corrupt, it seems to me that it is acceptable to use vigilantism to
fight against the drug problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Sannikov is the local television journalist who first put
City Without Drugs on the air, including the footage of alleged
payments to the police, a broadcast for which he is now under
formal investigation by the city prosecutor for possible
``slander'' against the ``honor of the uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has created a unity that you won't see in any
other sphere of public life,'' Sannikov said in his studio, from
which he has also shown his viewers exclusive footage of vigilante
raids. In these raids, masked men burst into the apartments of
suspected drug dealers, beating and kicking them in the face, head
and groin.
</P>
<P>
   Sannikov's program also runs ads for the private business
ventures of Varov and his colleagues at City Without Drugs, in what
has become a symbiotic relationship. ``We are in a condition of war
in this city, and war is not aesthetic; it is frightening,'' he
said. ``If we were to keep silent and not show what was really
happening, we would not change the consciousness of the people.''

AS NEW YORK REDUCES CRIME, SO DO OTHER CITIES, BUT WITHOUT THE
CONFLICT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With this city's stunning drop in crime in the 1990s,
many New Yorkers have come to assume that aggressive police tactics
and crime reductions are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at other cities around the nation suggests that large
reductions in crime can be achieved in places that rely less on the
confrontational law enforcement measures that New York has used,
like the stopping and searching of thousands of people for guns by
the Street Crime Unit, four of whose officers were acquitted in the
killing of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, notably San Diego and Boston, have recorded as big
or even larger drops in violence while employing police strategies
that rely on close cooperation between the police and the community
and have ended up improving race relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many police chiefs and criminologists, San Diego
and Boston have become the new national models of policing, and
while New York's accomplishments are also studied and admired by
some experts, there is a sense of sadness that a great opportunity
has been squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see crime rates down but people still fearful of the police
is not a healthy situation,'' said Jeremy Travis, the director of
the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice
Department, and a former deputy police commissioner in New York.
``The national challenge is to bring crime down while
simultaneously enhancing public confidence in the agencies of
justice, and that is what dropped out of the picture in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Rana Sampson, a former police sergeant in New York who is
director of public safety for the University of San Diego, said:
``New York has paid a huge price. What the NYPD did was throw
people at the problem, putting cops on every corner, but who wants
to live in a society like that? It could have been done
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But New York City police officials dispute suggestions that the
department is more confrontational than others, and they say that
its outreach efforts simply do not receive enough attention. ``The
commissioner and the precinct commanders do community meetings all
the time,'' said Maureen Casey, a deputy commissioner for policy
and planning. ``Not only is the feedback positive, but consistently
the thing that the community asks for is more police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, New York, Boston and San Diego have all achieved
enormous declines since crime began dropping nationally in 1991.
From 1991 to 1998, the murder rate fell 76.4 percent in San Diego,
the largest decline of any major city, with New York second at 70.6
percent and Boston third at 69.3 percent, according to Alfred
Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh. Their robbery rates showed a similar pattern. During
those same years, the robbery rate dropped 62.6 percent in San
Diego, also the steepest decline in the nation, 60.1 percent in New
York and 50.2 percent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the three cities employed very different law enforcement
strategies. New York has stressed tough enforcement, San Diego
pioneered community and problem-solving policing, and Boston
developed an approach combining careful research, participation by
local ministers and selective action against the worst criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Several other large cities have also reported sharp decreases in
crime _ the murder rate fell 62.8 percent in San Antonio from 1991
to 1998, 61.3 percent in Houston, 59.3 percent in Los Angeles and
52.4 percent in Dallas _ without as coherent a strategy as those in
New York, San Diego or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, law enforcement experts acknowledge that they are
baffled by the decline in Los Angeles, whose Police Department has
been plagued by scandals and low morale and has seen a drop in
arrests. This suggests some, or much, of the nationwide reduction
in crime may well stem from factors beyond better policing, like
longer prison sentences, the improved economy and changes in the
attitude of young people toward drugs and crime.
</P>
<P>
   One way to understand the variations in police tactics in
different cities is to look at the cities themselves and their
leaders, said Herman Goldstein, a professor emeritus at the
University of Wisconsin Law School and perhaps the most widely
respected authority on policing. ``A community gets the policing it
deserves, or demands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ a former federal
prosecutor _ and his first police commissioner, William J. Bratton,
there was a two-pronged approach. They began a new emphasis on the
rigorous collection of crime statistics and holding precinct
commanders accountable for addressing them.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, they had the police crack down on petty
crimes like graffiti, stop large numbers of people in high-crime
neighborhoods to check for guns, and created the Street Crime Unit
to patrol for violent armed criminals. Community policing, which
makes citizens the allies of police, was scorned as social work by
Giuliani and abandoned by his second commissioner, Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to do all this too quickly,'' Goldstein said,
``without the investment of years of groundwork in refined training
and supervision and discipline. Historically, this is a
prescription for runaway police organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took almost the opposite approach, he said. By the
1990s, it had already invested heavily in careful training and was
already using the kind of statistical crime mapping that Bratton
brought later to New York. Its innovation was a decision that
police by themselves could not suppress crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise was, we didn't have enough police officers
to do it all, so we needed participation by the community,'' said
Jerry Sanders, who retired as San Diego's police chief last year.
San Diego has only 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents, compared with
5 per 1,000 residents in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   So San Diego adopted community policing. After a series of
meetings with citizens, the police divided the city into 99
neighborhoods, with a police team assigned to each, so that
residents could get to know their police officers and feel
comfortable giving them information. The city also recruited l,200
volunteers, many of them retired, to watch over neighborhoods. They
receive police training, wear policelike uniforms and drive
official vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   San Diego borders Mexico and has a constant problem of illegal
immigration. This could be a source of racial friction, but the
police receive special training in Spanish and how to deal
nonviolently with the immigrants, an approach that has minimized
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to crime figures, Sanders decided to measure his
department's success with an annual survey of public satisfaction.
The most recent one, by an outside consultant, showed approval at
89 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's approach began with an effort to figure out the real
source of crime in the city and how to reduce it with the least
racial confrontation. David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, was hired to help,
and he advised focusing on gun violence, not on gangs or drugs, a
seemingly small distinction, but a crucial one for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, along with a team of Boston police officers and
representatives of the district attorney's office, the United
States attorney's office, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
began tracing how guns got into the hands of criminals and
discovering who the most serious offenders were. They then began
consulting black ministers to win their cooperation in going after
the ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   The team, including the ministers, began inviting known
criminals, drug dealers and young gang members to what they termed
``call-ins,'' meetings at which they were warned the violence had
to stop or there would be federal prosecutions. The few who did not
heed the warnings have been arrested and are now facing long
federal sentences. The number of arrests and confrontations on the
street with the police were minimal, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been so successful that in the past
two-and-a-half years, only one juvenile has been killed by gunfire
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, who was appointed by Giuliani in December 1993 after
serving as Boston's police commissioner, said that given New York's
high crime rate, an aggressive approach was needed at first. But
then as crime dropped, he said, ``the mayor made a conscious
decision not to put in place the other half of the strategy,
reaching out to the black religious and political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The former commissioner, a frequent critic of Giuliani since his
ouster, added, ``If we had reached out in New York the way we
reached out in Boston, we could have not only solved the crime
problem, but we could have begun to resolve the race problem too.
We could have had it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston model, which evolved over time, has been used
successfully in several other cities, including High Point, N.C.;
Indianapolis, Ind.; New Haven, Conn.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Portland,
Ore. In High Point, where it has been directed by Walter Holton
Jr., a U.S. attorney, a team like the one in Boston has called in
150 known criminals and given them warnings. Since it started in
December 1998, Holton said, there has not been a single drug- or
gang-related murder, after nine murders each in in 1997 and 1998.
The number of citizen complaints against the police have been cut
in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nontraditional approach to law enforcement,''
Holton said, and it has the benefit of getting the cooperation of
the black ministers, who have told criminals that if they do not
stop their illegal activities, ``don't expect to come hide in my
church.''

GM RECALLS ELECTRIC CARS AND ADMITS IT CAN'T FIX DEFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Maine, N.Y.)  (jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ General Motors has said that half the electric cars
it has built have a safety defect and that it does not know if it
can fix them.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the company asked 450 drivers who lease the cars,
EV-1's, to return them immediately, and possibly permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, there's no known engineering solution,''
Jennifer L. Schmit, a spokeswoman for the company, said of the
defect in the recharging system.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects a model leased from December 1996 until
August 1999, representing about half the EV-1's built. A second
generation car, also called the EV-1, uses a different part and is
not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who turn them in are ``going through an interview
process to determine what their needs are,'' Schmit said. They will
be offered gasoline-powered cars for temporary use, and can
terminate the lease, or, for more money, lease a newer version of
the car that does not have the defect, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are recharged by inserting a frisbee-shaped power disk
into a slot on the hood. But on several cars, the slot and
surrounding components have been damaged by excessive heat, Schmit
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hepke, director of propulsion engineering for GM's advanced
technology vehicles, said engineers could build a replacement part,
but it would be bigger. ``To find a space to package a fix into is
very difficult,'' he said. ``Every inch is taken up.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem also affects another electric vehicle, the S-10
pickup, but it has room for the replacement part.
</P>
<P>
   GM's director of advanced technology, Bob Purcell, said the EV-1
``remains a tremendous learning exercise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The S-10 is no longer available. The EV-1 is, but production has
stopped; it will be resumed if demand warrants, the company said.
For new customers, the two-seater leases for $499 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for electric cars sought to minimize the setback and
emphasized that more recently built EV-1's are not affected.
``They've learned to make the car bigger and better as they've
learned the technology over time,'' said an official at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   California, Massachusetts, Maine and New York plan to require
electric vehicles beginning in 2003.

</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola will pay M. Douglas Ivester, its former chairman and
chief executive who left last month, $17.8 million in payments and
other benefits and release nearly two million shares of formerly
restricted stock worth about $97.7 million. The package includes
$704,400 in annual pension payments, plus an additional $795,600 a
year beginning this month and continuing until March 2002, when
Ivester turns 55. At that point, Ivester will begin receiving
$675,600 a year, beyond his pension, through his lifetime and that
of his wife, Kay. He will also receive a laptop computer, cellular
phones, club dues through May 2001 and the title to a 1996 Mercury
Grand Marquis _ his company car.

   McCaw Drops Plan to Buy Iridium
</P>
<P>
   The cellular telephone pioneer Craig McCaw is dropping plans to
acquire Iridium, the troubled global satellite telephone company
that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August. Wall
Street analysts said the move left Iridium on the brink of
collapse. On Monday, the company is scheduled to lose access to $5
million in emergency financing under a bankruptcy court agreement.

</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to submit a bill to Congress that would

mounting signs that it will be a tough sell in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Surge on Economic Report
</P>
<P>
   Stocks soared after the government's report on unemployment
allayed concern that the Federal Reserve would have to push
interest rates sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose
160.28 points, or 3.37 percent, to a record 4,914.79. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 202.28 points, or 1.99 percent, to
10,367.20. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased 27.41
points, to 1,409.17.

TWO GOOD TO SIT FOR PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To distinguish the first team from reserves on the
Pepperdine basketball team, the starting players wear
different-colored jerseys during practice.
</P>
<P>
   All seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Waves haven't figured a way to get two more players in
the starting lineup. They use five just like everyone else.
However, Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff doesn't consider
bench players Craig Lewis and David Lalazarian as normal reserves.
</P>
<P>
   So van Breda Kolff treats Lalazarian and Lewis as he does the
other starters. In practice, they shuttle in and out of drills with
the starting five. During games, they play only slightly fewer
minutes, both averaging about 20 per game. Depending on the
opponent and the rhythm of the game, there are times when they play
more than the starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say this so much around here that I'm sure it sounds like a
broken record,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``But the fact is, with
David and Craig, we feel we have seven starters.''
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of guys coming off the bench, van Breda Kolff's
treatment is a welcome touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gives you a little more confidence,'' Lewis said.
``It's like a mental boost, and it lets you know that he knows you
can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalazarian, a 6-foot-7 junior transfer from Notre Dame, is
averaging 8.4 points and 3.3 rebounds per game, one of seven
Pepperdine players who average between seven and 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   A versatile forward, Lalazarian can step out to hit the outside
shot but is quick enough to get past defenders that play up on him.
When other teams go small, he can post up, using his speed and
strength around the basket to score. And when the Waves (22-7) are
in transition, Lalazarian and Brandon Armstrong are the best
finishers on the team.
</P>
<P>
   He's more competent than flashy, but his contributions helped
Pepperdine win its first West Coast Conference championship since
1993. The Waves start play in the WCC tournament today in Santa
Clara against Loyola Marymount at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is the type of guy that respects the game of basketball
so much, maybe more then anyone on the team,'' van Breda Kolff
said. ``In terms of knowing about the opponent, what their
strengths and weaknesses are, what that particular game means and
where he fits into it all. He thinks the game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalazarian has flourished in van Breda Kolff's uptempo system
after an unspectacular year last season under Lorenzo Romar, who
preferred a slow-down, grind-it-out attack. Lalazarian, who
averaged 6.7 points after redshirting in 1997-98, was inconsistent
and never seemed comfortable offensively.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has showed the skills he had at Tustin High (23
ppg as a senior) and as a key freshman reserve at Notre Dame in
1996-97. Lalazarian left Notre Dame after one season because he
missed California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lets you play,'' Lalazarian said. ``And in this system, we
run the court and we press, and guys enjoy playing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So much that Lalazarian doesn't mind coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always about starting anyway,'' Lalazarian said.
``The important thing is how many minutes you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a 6-3 sophomore from Oregon, is a unique player. He's
easily the most versatile guard on the team, and maybe the most
intelligent. He's averaging 7.3 points and 2.1 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a cerebral player, which I don't think people are
aware of,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``I think people see Craig as a
smooth, easy-going kid out on the floor, but after the game you
look at the box score and he put together a nice line. He does so
much that gets overlooked or doesn't show up in the box score. But
he does a lot of important things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis uses his time wisely while watching from the bench,
continually processing information like an opponent's press
rotation, its offensive sets and defensive matchups. When he enters
the game, his first goal is to disrupt the other team's flow, then
help the Waves any way he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be a spark, just give the team a boost,'' Lewis
said. ``On some teams a guy comes off the bench basically to give
the starter a break. When we come in we want to take things up a
notch and contribute as much as possible.''

STAPLES GETS BOOST FROM SUCCESS OF IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staples Inc. reaped its first reward from its venture capital
arm Friday, when New York's Register.com Inc. went public and
surged more than 138 percent in its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Staples invested about $7 million in Register.com, a domain-name
registry, in May. Staples holds about 3 million shares, according
to regulatory filings, which were worth $171.8 million at the close
of trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com's shares jumped to $57.25 from an IPO price of $24
per share.
</P>
<P>
   The news appeared not to move Wall Street, which pummeled
Staples shares Thursday after the Framingham-based office-supply
giant said its online division, Staples.com, would run up $150
million in losses this year, double the expectation. Staples shares
gained 13 cents Friday, after tumbling $4.69 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, senior editor at Private Equity Analyst in
Wellesley, observed that investors may have to start paying more
attention to the venture capital operations of Staples and other
big companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these corporations are making investments for
strategic purposes,'' he said. ``But the pace at which they're
going public has enabled these companies to accumulate some great
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Staples jumped into the growing corporate venture arena last
year, following big players including Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp.,
and Lucent Technologies. Corporations poured $7.3 billion of
venture capital into young firms last year, more than quadrupling
their 1998 investments, according to Venture Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com is a rival to Network Solutions Inc., which
formerly had a monopoly on doling out domain names that end in
.com, .net, and .org. Last September, the US Department of Commerce
agreed to allow competitors into the market.
</P>
<P>
   From June through September, Register.com signed up 159,000 new
domain names. In the first nine months of 1999, the company lost $1
million on $791,000 of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber Inc. analyst Aram Rubinson said investors are still
most interested in Staples's operating businesses. But, he added, a
gain like Friday's ``certainly enhances the value of the
organization.''

AYALA GOES AT IT AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Paulie Ayala, perhaps the least-known fighter ever
named The Ring magazine's Fighter of the Year, defends his WBA
bantamweight title against Johnny Bredahl of Denmark tonight at
Mandalay Bay Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala (29-1, with 12 knockouts) gave one of boxing's most
impressive performances last June when he narrowly outpointed
previously unbeaten and favored Johnny Tapia here.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth, Tex., resident outpointed Sahoiu Sithchai Condo
in October in his first title defense.
</P>
<P>
   The light-punching Bredahl (45-1, 23 KOs) is the European
Champion but not given a good chance of beating Ayala, a slick
boxer and one of the toughest guys around.
</P>
<P>
   An 10-round undercard matchup of junior middleweight contenders
Yory Boy Campas (74-3, 63 KOs) and Oba Carr (49-3-1, 29 KOs) is
much more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the pay-per-view card: WBA super bantamweight champ
Nestor Garza (37-1, 29 KOs) defends against Bones Adams (38-3-3, 18
KOs); super bantamweight contender Danny Romero (37-3-1, 32 KOs)
faces Adarryl Johnson(11-3-2, six KOs) in a 10-round bout; and Eric
``Butterbean'' Esch (52-1-2, 39 KOs) takes on George Linberger
(18-4-1, 17 KOs) in a four-round heavyweight matchup.

SAUDI LEADER SEEKS COMMON ARAB FRONT FOR MIDEAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add new info, reconfigure lead, change time element)  
 (HLW)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday
ended a two-day visit to Lebanon, which Arab diplomats said was
aimed at strengthening a common Arab front after Israel's recent
bombing of three Lebanese power plants, the breakdown of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, and the similar impasse in negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah bin Abdel Aziz's visit to Beirut followed others
in the past 13 days by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and by
Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
Abdullah's visit, with some of the most elaborate security
arrangements seen in the Lebanese capital in several years,
followed his talks with Mubarak in Cairo and with the Syrian
president, Hafez Assad, in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats and newspapers have said that the purpose of the
flurry of visits has been to send a signal to Israel at a critical
moment in the stalled Middle East peace effort. Also, these
analysts have said, the Arab nations have been keen to show support
for Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have continued
attacks on Israeli troops in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon
ahead of Israel's promised withdrawal by July.
</P>
<P>
   The visits have taken place against a background of angry
polemics between Israel and its neighbors, particularly Lebanon.
Passions have been stirred on both sides by events in recent weeks
that included attacks by Hezbollah killing seven Israeli soldiers
in southern Lebanon, Israel's retaliation by destroying the
Lebanese power plants, and warnings to Lebanon by David Levy,
Israel's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week in Parliament, Levy warned of Israel's
``burning the soil'' of Lebanon, and acting on the basis of ``blood
for blood'' and ``child for child'' if Hezbollah's attacks
continued. In Lebanon and other Arab nations, Levy's words prompted
angry denunciations and the appearance of cartoons and commentaries
that have reverted to an old Arab tactic of comparing Israel to
Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   One of Beirut's most popular television channels, Future TV, has
been running a 30-second film in its commercial breaks comparing
Levy to Hitler, with images of the two men speaking interspersed
with shots of Nazi and Israeli warplanes on bombing runs. The film,
prepared by Beirut college students, is accompanied by subtitles
saying, ``Same racism, same hatred, same criminality, same
history.'' It ends with the images of Levy and Hitler dissolving
into a swastika.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the vitriol and street protests that have been held
in Beirut, Cairo, Damascus and other Arab capitals, Arab leaders
appear to have been concerting efforts to get the peace talks back
on track.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Mubarak, who issued a joint statement
with the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, that criticized Israel's
attacks on the power plants and supported Hezbollah's right to
attack Israeli troops on Lebanese territory, also brought proposals
involving a cease-fire in southern Lebanon ahead of the Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same approach appears to be behind the journey of
Abdullah, the Saudi Arabian leader. Reports in some newspapers in
the Arab world said that he was pressing for agreement on an early
summit meeting of Arab leaders, the first in years, to forge a
common front on the peace effort. The 22-nation Arab League has
already decided to switch its coming meeting of foreign ministers
from Cairo to Beirut, where it is to open on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the public remarks made in Beirut and Damascus by Abdullah,
who carries considerable weight in the Arab world as the effective
day-to-day leader of the world's largest producer and exporter of
oil, conveyed the impression of a man eager to cool tempers and
prompt an early resumption of the peace talks between Israel and
Syria. The talks were suspended in January because of differences
on terms for the return of the Golan Heights, Syrian territory
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, which Israel
has extensively developed and settled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a speech in Beirut on Thursday, Abdullah used tough language
to signal to Israel, and by implication the United States, that
they cannot expect any more concessions from Syria and the
Palestinians. ``No power, regardless of how important its role is,
can force others to abandon their legitimate rights,'' he said. ``I
tell the Israelis that it's high time to reactivate the peace
process and steer it out of the dark tunnel, away from the language
of guns. We are a nation that does not beg for its rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, he appeared to be taking a more
conciliatory line. A pro-Syrian newspaper in Beirut, As Safir,
quoted him as telling Syrian officials that Saudi Arabia is
``committed to and seeks peace which is just and fair and which is
capable of giving each party its right so that there will be
stability and security in the region,'' a standard formulation of
Saudi policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Abdullah appeared to be counseling Arabs to take a
long view, and not to allow passions over the power plant bombings
and Levy's remarks to upset the peace effort. ``The Middle East
peace train will resume its journey until its reaches its
destination, despite the obstacles,'' he said in his Damascus
remarks, according to the Beirut newspaper. ``The weak today will
be strong tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A report that appeared on Thursday in Al Hayat, an Arab-language
newspaper published in London, said Syria was preparing to return
to the talks after a statement this week by Ehud Barak, Israel's
prime minister, on the Golan Heights issue. Barak said he stood by
a commitment made by Yitzhak Rabin, one of his predecessors, to
return all Syrian territory captured in the 1967 war.

EDITORIAL: HOMECOMING FOR GENERAL PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   Britain's decision on Thursday to drop extradition proceedings
against Gen. Augusto Pinochet and allow him to return to Chile is
understandably frustrating to those who hoped that the former
dictator would face trial in Spain for the many crimes of his
17-year rule. In relying on a secretive medical examination and
ignoring earlier objections expressed by courts in Spain, France,
Belgium and Switzerland, Britain has clouded its otherwise
admirable contribution to international justice in this historic
case.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds given for the decision were not by themselves
unreasonable. Jack Straw, the home secretary, said the 84-year-old
former dictator's ability to understand the charges against him and
to direct his defense had been seriously impaired by a series of
strokes. If so, justice would not be served by proceeding against
an enfeebled and mentally incompetent defendant.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical evidence that led Straw to make that judgment
has not been fully disclosed, and Pinochet was spirited out of
England before the decision could be challenged in court. That is
unfortunate, for it leaves the world wondering if Straw's action
was justified. Courts in Belgium, France, Switzerland and Spain,
which were seeking the general's extradition and had been given
copies of the British medical report, were not persuaded that he
should be excused from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean courts must now make their own determination of
Pinochet's fitness to stand trial. For nearly a decade before his
arrest in London, the general and his top associates managed to
intimidate elected Chilean governments and avoid prosecution for
the crimes of his regime, which included more than 3,000 murders
and disappearances. But the Chilean judiciary has been emboldened
by Pinochet's London arrest. He now faces 60 criminal complaints in
Chile for kidnapping, murder and torture. He should be immediately
stripped of his status as a senator for life, which affords him
immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's president-elect, Ricardo Lagos, has wisely pledged to
let justice run its course. But the outgoing government of
President Eduardo Frei is pushing a constitutional reform that
would allow Pinochet to step down from the Senate and retain
parliamentary immunity from prosecution. Chile's Parliament should
abandon this attempt to subvert the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's return to Chile ought not to diminish the lasting
legacy of this case. It established that former heads of state no
longer enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity, and that they
may be tried for such crimes in any country under the principle of
universal jurisdiction. The fact that Pinochet was arrested in
London in October 1998 and that his claim of immunity as a former
head of state was rejected by British courts has put tyrants and
former tyrants around the world on notice that they, too, could be
prosecuted some day.

CHIEF OF LOS ANGELES POLICE DISBANDS ANTIGANG UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chief of the Los Angeles Police Department
directed the department Friday to disband the semiautonomous
antigang units at the heart of the city's police corruption and
brutality scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The units, called Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums,
or Crash, were formed in the late 1970s in the administration of
Chief Daryl Gates in response to the city's growing problem with
street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, such units have come under scrutiny as giving
officers too much independence, which, if unchecked, could lead to
the abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Perez, the former Los Angeles police officer who pleaded
guilty to cocaine theft last September and revealed a wide range of
corruption and brutality in exchange for a lighter sentence, was a
member of the Crash unit in the low-income neighborhoods patrolled
by the department's Rampart division.
</P>
<P>
   In his statements to investigators, Perez portrayed the units as
having a culture and mission much like the gangs they tried to
thwart, with officer initiations similar to gang ``jump-in''
beating rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers bore anti-gang-unit tattoos, Perez said, and
awards were given out to officers who wounded or killed suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A broad department inquiry report made public on Thursday said
that the units lacked ``conscientious supervision,'' that
supervisors' signatures on booking approvals and reports may have
been forged, that detention reports often lacked description of
sufficient probable cause and that many of the units had drifted
from their mission of combating gang activity to deal with drug
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement late Friday by Chief Bernard C. Parks that the
units would be discontinued made no mention of the scandal that has
engulfed the Los Angeles Police Department in recent months. Parks
said the units would be disbanded effective March 12, and would be
replaced a month after that by ``special enforcement units'' in
each of the city's 18 police divisions. The new units will have
stricter requirements for both officers and supervisors and will
limit the time they can serve with the units.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, all people arrested by the new units must be
presented to the supervisory officer in the area. Under the setup
being replaced by the new units, some Crash units operated out of
separate quarters and had limited contact with regular-duty
officers and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the new units' duties would
differ from those of the Crash units. Parks' statement said only
that the department would reveal the new units' mission in time.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office on Thursday, the day before making
his announcement, Parks denied that he was contemplating any
changes in the way the antigang units operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue we're dealing with is, we're aggressive
toward problems, we are not aggressive toward people,'' he said
heatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't declare war on a community,'' he said. ``We do not
declare war on people. We will always have an aggressive strategy
on gang problems, as long as there are gang problems.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat who has taken a lead role in
criticizing the department, said the disbanding of the units was
encouraging. But Hayden added that it remained to be seen whether
real change would occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's only symbolic, it's an important step,'' Hayden
said. ``But we have to look at the details very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrecy has to end, the budget has to be published, the
members of these details have got to have human rights training.
The purpose of the patrol should be to arrest people who are
breaking the law.''

SQUANDERING A BUNDLE, IN HIS MIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Brancaccio hit town the other day, he was
ready to spend money _ spend big and spend fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it,'' he said excitedly upon emerging from a radio
interview. ``We can park in front of Petrossian and buy some of
those expensive truffles, and then get our car towed. How much
would that cost?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, this was to be a make-believe shopping spree.
But no matter. Brancaccio, host of the public radio program
``Marketplace,'' has just written a book called ``Squandering
Aimlessly,'' an account of roaming the country gathering tales of
what people do, or could do, with a chunk of extra money. And now
Brancaccio, who lives in Los Angeles, wanted to do a bit of
Manhattan squandering, if only in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Precision journalist that he is, he even came armed with his own
news peg. This was publication day, and Simon &AMP; Schuster owed him
$25,000; he wanted his check, and he wanted to imagine what he
could do with that sum _ right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see,'' he said, giddily pulling out a calculator.
``Minus the agent's commission, that's $21,250.'' Less taxes, of
course, unless he gave the money away. I was game to throw a bit of
Monopoly money around, and off we headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend Marty says the ante to play the game in this town is
$7 an hour,'' he mused. ``You're on the street, and first you buy
pretzels, then something else _ the money just falls out of your
pocket. I showed up last night at 11:30 and most of my cash was
gone. It's cheaper to go to the movies than not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Times Square, where we paused under the
latest ground zero of glitz mixed with market fever: the huge
Nasdaq sign at 43rd Street, its market images dancing. ``Watching
the market,'' said Brancaccio, 39, an intense, animated man with
touches of gray in his short brown hair, ``is like watching a team
that wins most of the time _ it's fun! But what happens when it
goes down?''
</P>
<P>
   He covers the market on ``Marketplace,'' of course, but don't
dare call him a market wonk. He notes proudly that ``none of us
have MBAs'' at the program. ``We are anthropologists on the
business beat,'' he said, a line he had clearly used before.
``People remember things if they're told as stories, not with
charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on radio. The half-hour program, produced by the
University of Southern California, is broadcast on about 280 public
radio stations five days a week. The formula must work, for the
program now has 3.7 million listeners a week, up 54 percent since
Brancaccio became host six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a mischievous look, he remembered his mission, pulled out a
cell phone and called his publiser. Forced to leave a message with
an assistant, he said mischievously: ``Tell him I was looking
through my author's contract, and it says Simon &AMP; Schuster owes me
my last payment today. Where's my check?''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Brancaccio is at play, his delivery is polished,
precise _ a radio pro in the flesh. It is disorienting in the
extreme to stand on 42nd Street and hear that distinctive voice. I
suppressed an urge to look around for a radio.
</P>
<P>
   But come on, Brancaccio, what would you really be tempted to
splurge on? His answer was quick: cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go past 9th Avenue and 34th,'' he said, for there
sits the siren of the B &AMP; H Photo store. ``I'd spend all the
money.'' He loves photography. ``Radio is a powerful medium,'' he
said. ``You draw word pictures, but you don't feel the visual side
of your brain is working.''
</P>
<P>
   He had warned me that he had to squeeze in a quick radio
interview, and we headed downtown to the Municipal Building. ``I
shouldn't be so cavalier about live radio, but I just have faith
and it works out,'' he said as, barely in time, we hurried into the
offices of WNYC, the public radio station that carries his program
on weekdays (6:30 p.m. on FM and 7 p.m. on AM).
</P>
<P>
   It's a jumbled warren of rooms, recording equipment seemingly
perched haphazardly against one wall, a box of ``Morning Edition''
mugs nestled against a table, a couple of black-and-gray
``Marketplace'' mugs on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   His interview, with Northeast Public Radio, was by telephone,
and he got on the line, looked up and whispered with relief, ``Two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second, I thought. He's doing a phone interview? We raced
down here, slogged through the building's metal detectors and
negotiated a labyrinth of elevators _ to get to a phone? Are there
no other phones in this city? This, I realized, is a true radio
guy.
</P>
<P>
   He looked coiled, primed to pour forth market wisdom and promote
the book, his first.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was on live, and the mantras tumbled out: ``It's a
personal finance book for people whose SAT verbal is higher than
their SAT math.'' ``Before you ask for investment advice, find out
what kind of car the person drives. I ride a bike to work.'' ``We
are anthropologists of the business beat.'' Asked about the book's
cover (he is shown tossing a bill out of a car), he said: ``I work
for public radio. That's a $1 bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He had warned me that one bane of his existence was being asked
investment advice, and when listener call-in time came, he covered
the phone and said, ``I know just what they're going to ask: `I
have this fund, and ...''' Sure enough, that's what the first
question was.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One place he had visited in preparing for the book was the New
York Stock Exchange, and we headed there next.
</P>
<P>
   Standing amid a scattering of badged traders on smoking breaks,
Brancaccio recalled his earlier visit, when ``one guy came out
holding his half-eaten lunch and a copy of `The Art of War.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a blast!'' he said of being on the trading floor. ``It's
not like watching hockey, it's like being in the middle of the
game. You want to play!'' Not that he'd want to play himself. ``It
involves a lot of math,'' he said in awe. ``All those 16th's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the more you trade,'' he intoned, ``the more you lose.''
Looking expansively around this Grand Canyon of finance, he
proclaimed, ``This is the center of the universe _ or so we're led
to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing my cell phone when his failed, he dialed Simon &AMP;
Schuster again and, to his delight, got through to David Rosenthal,
publisher of the trade division.
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio was really enjoying this game. ``They say the check
is in the mail,'' he told me with a smile. ``They'll take up a
collection for us if we need car fare.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting off the phone, he did have some serious thoughts
on soaring stock prices. ``This is the wealth effect,'' he said.
``You have expectations, and your wallet gets a little looser.
That's the main reason for the roaring spending.''
</P>
<P>
   As we walked away, he talked of the roots of the book, which
tackles, from all different angles, the topic of shedding excess
cash: gambling, investing, buying real estate, philanthropy,
starting a business, socking it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a vague sense that I needed to get some street smarts,''
he said. He received a letter from a listener in Maine who objected
that a full half-hour was devoted to financial news and suggested,
basically, that Brancaccio get a life. His first thought: ``He
doesn't know how funny that is.'' But then he wondered, ``Am I
submerging myself, turning myself into a creep?'' But no, ``you
can't be a hermit _ you can't forsake money.''
</P>
<P>
   So his quest became: ``What are the possibilities for money?
What are the goals?'' To try to find out, he took numerous short
trips around the country _ browsing in the giant Mall of America in
Minnesota, attending a convention for would-be entrepreneurs in
Pasadena, Calif., exploring the whole idea of mortgages in
Levittown.
</P>
<P>
   When he visited Trinity Church, deep in the financial heart of
Manhattan, he picked up this bit of wisdom from the rector, the
Rev. Dan Matthews: ``When I have a vision for my life, money is
then a tool to make the vision a reality. If I have no vision for
my life, then money is in fact the only way I can gauge my worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio, poking around for his own vision, wanted our fantasy
spending binge in New York to include the possibility of donating
some or all of it, and he suggested returning to something that
caught his fancy during his research for the book _ a community
boat-building project called Floating the Apple. We found it now on
a pier in the Hudson River at the end of Houston Street, with a
sometime commercial photographer named Don Betts applying glue to
what would be a piece of a 25-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   The boats are built mainly by volunteers and are used by, among
others, high school rowing groups to take advantage of what Betts
called ``New York's biggest open public space'' _ the water.
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio, after calculating with Betts various permutations
for what $20,000 would buy _ so many supplies, so many days on the
water for so many kids _ asked about volunteering his time. ``Is
there anything I could offer?'' he said hopefully. ``I've done some
cabinet-making.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Betts replied: ``You'd probably learn more at the
dentist.'' Boat building, he explained, is all about fighting rot
and decay.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to the subway, I asked Brancaccio if there was
another Manhattan social cause to which he would consider donating.
After a pause, he said: ``Probably something to do with literacy.
That's an investment in the community.'' Warming to the thought, he
added, ``Is it naive to think that a prison literacy program would
reduce muggings?''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that at one talk he gave, a man in the audience
asked, ``What do you feel about the Kozenovsky Fund?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A voice in me said, `Bluff, bluff. Pretend you know what he's
talking about,''' he remembered. ``But another voice said, `Don't
bluff,' and I didn't. So the man said, `My name is Kozenovsky, and
I want to buy time to spend with my kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio is a firm believer in investing in family, which he
says is why a priority in his own family _ himself, his wife, Mary,
who works in communications at USC, and their three young children
_ is travel.
</P>
<P>
   What of his own investing? He owns no individual stocks _ partly
to avoid conflicts of interest as a journalist, partly because ``if
you're fooling with your portfolio instead of reading to your
children, I have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``I do have a stake in capitalism.'' He invests in
a ``socially responsible'' mutual fund, and at first the returns
nearly matched the regular fund offered by USC, his employer. But
last year, Brancaccio said, it lagged way behind. The poor results,
he said with a laugh, made him ask, ``How much am I committed?''
</P>
<P>
   With children, ``the hardest question is `What's a stock?''' he
said. ``My 10-year-old is starting to get a sense of it because of
Pokemon cards, their trading value.''
</P>
<P>
   When his children are, say, 15, would he talk to them of
retirement accounts? ``That would be a great discussion to have,''
he said. ``My 10-year-old, Nick _ he'll take to stocks. But I'm a
little afraid to get him started too early. Here I am wrestling
with `Is this turning me into someone I don't want to be?' Do I
want to turn him into that person?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see him going to a themed dance someday where people go
dressed the way people did in the '90s,'' he said, ``and I can see
him going as a stockbroker.''
</P>
<P>
   A book signing loomed that evening, and our last stop was to be
the glittering heart of ``if you have to ask, you can't afford it''
land, Fifth Avenue in the '50s. Brancaccio had grown more relaxed,
less scripted, as the afternoon wore on, and as we walked along
Central Park South from the subway, he said suddenly, clearly
tickled, ``I'm impressed that the publisher picked up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked again what he would do on a real spree. ``I'd find an
interior decorating place,'' he said quickly, ``one that does
kitchens. Since I'm Italian and Jewish, food is a big thing in our
family.'' (The Brancaccios are now ``trading up'' to a larger home
in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'd have an outrageous meal. I hear there's this sushi
place where the more you spend, the smaller the portions are.''
He'd go to B &AMP; H Photo, for that Hasselblad. And ``an Edward Weston
print _ I'd spend money on that.''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned suddenly. ``There's this thing in the contract,'' he
said. `` `Author's portion of theme-park rights: 100 percent.'''
Warming to this thought, he went on, ``This could be seed money for
Squandering Aimlessly: The Ride!'' Pause. Mock-soberly: ``We need a
business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to squandering. As we wandered the glittering aisles of
Tiffany's, I asked what he would buy his wife. ``I owe her,'' he
said. ``She helped so much with the book.'' But what?
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't wear any of this _ let me find something
plausible.'' He stopped at a counter, a small sign reading:
``$60-$102,000.'' ``Now is that $60 or $60,000?'' he asked,
puzzled. ``$60? I could do that.'' But no, ``there's nothing to her
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   On to Trump Tower, where a prominent display of the Donald's
latest literary effort was set up amid the lobby's towering,
blinding glitz. ``This is what owning the building gets you,''
Brancaccio said. ``Good placement of your book. That doesn't say
`squandering aimlessly' _ but the building does!''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. In the Cartier window within Trump Tower, he spotted a
watch. Brancaccio has a weakness for watches; he's always searching
for the perfect one. And when the clerk told us the price, $11,400,
I could see Brancaccio's mind gleefully ``doing the numbers,'' as
he says nightly on ``Marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Out popped his calculator. With sales tax, that's $12,340. After
income taxes, his publisher's payment would come to $12,750.
Perfect! ``And I could go spend the $410 on that camera!'' he said
triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to round out the fantasy spree on a sober note:
``No, let's invest that for retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   As we passed Brooks Brothers, I made one last attempt to lure
him with luxury. A suit, perhaps? ``I'm in radio,'' he replied. ``I
could be naked for all anyone knows.''
</P>
<P>
   He spied a pretzel stand _ in our wandering, we had neglected
lunch _ and treated us both. That $3, I realized _ aside from a few
swipes of a MetroCard _ was the first actual money we'd spent. And
it silenced two growling stomachs quicker than imagined riches ever
could.
</P>
<P>
   Walking toward his hotel, he stopped abruptly as we came upon
Radio City Music Hall, adorned by both vertical and horizontal neon
signs. ``That's my idea of visual heaven,'' he said. ``The
illuminated word `radio' twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the radio the first time when I was 13,'' he said.
``A high school kid did a DJ show, and he needed a newsman.''
</P>
<P>
   He could be tempted by a sabbatical, Brancaccio said, but ``I
really still love radio _ it's like having a term paper due every
day at 2, and the penalty for an incomplete is death.''

MO GOES DEEP ON FIRST PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Last year, it took Mo Vaughn 57 at-bats over 29
games before he hit his first and only home run of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, it took all of one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn ripped a two-run, first-inning homer off the Mariners'
Jamie Moyer to propel the Anaheim Angels to an 8-5 victory in their
Cactus League opener Friday afternoon at the Peoria Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Vaughn didn't hit a home run at all during the
Angels' stay in Arizona. The homer came at Edison Field in the one
Freeway Series game against the Dodgers. But the first pitch he saw
Friday ended up on the grass embankment beyond the right-center
field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the second time around, you get used to things,''
Vaughn said. ``I think overall it's just good to drive the baseball
at the start like that. You want to get out there in a game and
test yourself. I'm glad to get the first one right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo can hit,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``I don't care if he
hits no homers in the spring, or 40 homers, he can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels totaled 13 hits in all, but none was more impressive
than Tim Salmon's home run which cleared the ''blue monster'' in
center field, a 40-foot brick wall that serves as the hitters'
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see not only me but everybody taking good swings,'' Vaughn
said. ``Definitely Mike's attitude has already rubbed off in our
approach and how we go about our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a spring training game, it was Scioscia's first
as a major league manager. But he said he wasn't thinking about the
significance of it for himself.

   ``My mindset is trying to get our guys ready to go, and of the
few spots we do have available, to look at them closely,'' he said.
``I was impressed with the way we swung the bat and with the way
the pitchers lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn was less than impressive in his
two innings, allowing two runs and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problems in the past have been consistency in the strike
zone, getting ahead of hitters and my breaking ball,'' Washburn
said. ``Today I had the same problems. I couldn't throw my breaking
ball and I think I was behind 2-0 on every hitter. The only
positive was I didn't walk anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bonita High and Cal State Fullerton standout Matt Wise was
impressive in two innings, striking out three and allowing only one
hit. The one hit was a home run by Jay Buhner, but Wise did strike
out Carlos Guillen, Edgar Martinez and John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   ``For guys like me who have never pitched up here, there's
always the question of 'Can you?' '' Wise said. ``It's a great
opportunity to see what it's all about. But it was just one outing,
I still have things to work on. There's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Angels coach Larry Bowa survived the catastrophe that was
the Angels' 1999 season and landed on his feet in Seattle as the
Mariners' third-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Angels and Mariners played each other Friday Bowa
said he didn't think the Angels would repeat their troubles of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good guys over there,'' Bowa said. ``I know
they'll do a lot better just because they're healthy. If they're
healthy they're going to score a lot of runs. ... I don't think
last year can repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowa likes his new situation with the Mariners, and said
Mariners manager Lou Piniella told him Bowa's intensity was just
what the Mariners needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou said we needed a little fire,'' Bowa said. ``I said I see
you on ESPN, it didn't look like he needed any fire. But he told me
if I see something I don't like, say something. The work ethic is
very good over here, just like it was over there (with the
Angels).''
</P>
<P>
   Bowa said he's spoken with several Angels since the end of last
season, including shortstop Gary DiSarcina several times.
</P>

WEEK IN REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Best story of the week: Rumors of trades involving Jim Edmonds
or Garret Anderson dying out.
</P>
<P>
   Best subplot: Competition for starting spots between Ramon
Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn, Brian Cooper and Scott Schoeneweis begins.
</P>
<P>
   Spring surprise: Nobody's hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Progress made with: Troy Percival. His shoulder strength is up
to 85-90 percent following off-season surgery. He should get into a
spring game around March 10.
</P>
<P>
   No progress made with: Second base. Lots of candidates, no
clear-cut favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The week ahead: It's reunion week. The Angels play Colorado
Wednesday and will see former pitching coach Marcel Lachemann. They
play Milwaukee on Thursday and see former hitting coach Rod Carew.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STONY BROOK, N.Y. _ There he was, the suddenly reticent mayor of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his New York campaign
chairman, Gov. George E. Pataki, held a forum at Stony Brook
University Hospital here Friday to accuse Sen. John McCain of
failing to support breast cancer research, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, a man who is not known for holding his tongue, did.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the event was apparently so uncomfortable for Giuliani
_ who had to sit next to his sibling rival, Pataki _ that the mayor
likened it, in front of a wide swath of the state Republican
hierarchy, to an unpleasant medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Pataki called me yesterday and said I could get a
virtual colonoscopy here _ you guys ready to do it?'' said Giuliani
as the audience broke out in laughter, some of it confused. The two
have been feuding since the mayor rejected Republican-sponsored
attacks on his friend McCain, even though he has endorsed Bush for
the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Pataki genially called the mayor's joke a ``very good
line'' and cheerfully described the internecine politics roiling
through the room as ``relatively mild'' for New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus among New York Republicans, however infuriated
by the mayor's behavior, is that Giuliani's strategy will serve him
well during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in the fall. His
actions, they say, simply re-emphasize what everyone knows: that
the mayor has never been considered a loyal Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``His market right now is crossover voters and independents,''
said Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist who was the spokesman
for Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, ``and he doesn't want to
be seen as bashing John McCain. I don't see what's in it for Rudy.
And he's definitely a `What's in it for me?' politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani endorsed Bush in October, back when virtually the
entire state Republican leadership thought the Texas governor was
the best and most likely candidate to become president. Left unsaid
was the belief that Bush and his campaign, at the time a richly
financed machine, could best help Giuliani's campaign, by either
sharing lists of donors or helping with fund-raising. McCain wasted
no time in pointing that out when he was asked why Giuliani was
supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' he replied. When asked what he meant, McCain
repeated, ``Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in October, Giuliani spent a day campaigning with Bush in
New York City, and then called on him at the governor's mansion in
Austin in November. But by the time of the South Carolina primary,
when Bush began embracing religious conservatives, Giuliani's
advisers grew nervous. They worried that if the mayor made too many
appearances with Bush, he might alienate the Democrats and
independents he needs to beat his Democratic opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's reluctance broke out into the open this week. On
Wednesday, Bush campaign officials said they were expecting the
mayor to accompany Bush on a Friday and Saturday campaign trip
across the state, but by Friday morning, Giuliani's campaign
advisers said the mayor would only greet Bush as he arrived at
MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma and then afterward attend the forum
at the hospital. One factor in Giuliani's reluctance may have been
worries about being away from New York City during demonstrations
in the Bronx after the police shooting of an unarmed man on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the mayor never did get to MacArthur Airport.
(His aides said he left City Hall late, stopped for a sandwich and
hit traffic.) But Bush campaign officials, who were watching the
rest of the state Republican hierarchy shake Bush's hand on the
tarmac, brushed off Giuliani's nonappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand he's got his own race to run,'' one senior Bush
adviser said. ``Obviously there are some tensions between Mayor
Giuliani and Governor Pataki, but we have both of their support and
we'll try to rise above it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the breast cancer forum, Giuliani
stood by as Bush and Pataki repeatedly attacked McCain for what
they said was his lack of support for breast cancer research.
Finally, Giuliani was asked how he felt about the accusations and
the negative advertising the Bush campaign has begun against McCain
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani ignored the question. ``I'm here because I support
Governor Bush very, very strongly,'' he said, adding, ``It's quite
possible to argue very, very strongly in favor of the governor and
not get involved in the other part because of a personal
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``the other part,'' Giuliani meant negative campaigning, and
on Friday McCain acknowledged his gratitude. In a ``Dear Rudy,''
letter sent to City Hall and released to the media, McCain thanked
the mayor for his ``extraordinary effort to keep the tenor of the
presidential campaign in New York on a positive plane.''

OF BOB JONES U., AMERICAN CULTURE AND ANTI-CATHOLICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is really quite impressive, all this outrage about the
anti-Catholic views of Bob Jones University. Until campaign workers
for Sen. John McCain began alerting Michigan's Roman Catholics
three weeks ago, it is questionable whether there were enough Roman
Catholics upset by anything emanating from Bob Jones University to
fill an old-fashioned confessional.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, opposing anti-Catholicism in the United States by
denouncing Bob Jones is about as relevant to today's reality as
combating medical errors by condemning leeches and snake oil. The
Catholic Church takes more nasty hits weekly on cable television
than yearly from Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The solicitude of the Democrats for Catholic sensibilities is
especially remarkable. Fears that the party's unqualified support
for abortion rights might drive away Catholic voters in a big way
have so far proved groundless, to the dismay of Catholic bishops
and other anti-abortion leaders. But now the party has gone
further: its leading candidates for the presidency are dueling to
prove who is pro-choicer than whom, as if having ever held any
reservations whatsoever on the topic of abortion were evidence of
not being a worthy Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   This is a standard _ dare one say litmus test? _ that would
disqualify virtually any Catholic Democrat, including such liberal
abortion rights stalwarts as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, who voted to ban what opponents term partial-birth abortions,
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who, a year before Roe
vs. Wade made abortion generally legal, declared that
``legalization of abortion on demand is not in accordance with the
value which our civilization places on human life.'' Such life, he
added, ``even at its earliest stages, has certain rights which must
be recognized _ the right to be born, the right to love, the right
to grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much traveling in Catholic circles to encounter
once politically active Catholic Democrats, liberals not at all
drawn to the Republican Party, who feel they have become pariahs in
their own party's ranks. Consequently some no longer vote, or no
longer vote for national Democrats. They no longer send
contributions to the party. They no longer stir up campaign fervor
among those they influence.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many such Catholics there are. But it is
reasonable to guess they outnumber Catholics worked up about Bob
Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, anti-Catholic animus rooted in the theological polemics of
the 16th-century Reformation still exists in the United States. But
the anti-Catholic animus rooted in the political polemics of the
18th-century Enlightenment and the cultural polemics of
19th-century American nativism have long since taken over all the
traditional themes: The church is an authoritarian monolith; its
doctrines are hopelessly premodern; its rites are colorful but
mindless; its sexual standards are unnatural, repressive and
hypocritical; its congregations are anti-Semitic and racist; its
priests are harsh and predatory; its grip on the minds of believers
is numbing.
</P>
<P>
   These themes still ring in some fundamentalist pulpits. But they
are far more apt to be interjected into the more adult sitcoms and
late-night comedy, and to be reflected in films, editorials, art,
fiction and memoirs considered enlightened and liberating.
</P>
<P>
   If the best-selling anti-Catholic tract of the 19th century,
``The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,'' was a forgery promoted by
Protestant clergymen, the best-selling anti-Catholic tracts of the
20th century, treating Catholicism and communism as parallel
threats to American liberty, were the 1950s books by a liberal,
Paul Blanshard, that first appeared in a left-wing weekly, The
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is often an astonishing lack of awareness about
stereotypes of Catholicism, nicely captured at a Washington social
event. A woman with an impressive track record in liberal,
humanitarian causes was singing the praises of her daughter-in-law.
``She's a Catholic, you know,'' the woman said, ``but she's a
thinking Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Can one imagine that woman saying of someone, ``She's an
African-American, you know, but she's an educated
African-American''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking,'' or an equivalent term like ``independent,'' is
usually a code word. It refers to a Catholic who disagrees with
church teachings on abortion, contraception, ordination of women,
etc., regardless of how much or how little actual thinking or
independence has gone into the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking'' Catholics do not include those who have read and
listened to conflicting opinions, struggled with pros and cons and
finally concluded that church teaching on one or more of these
neuralgic topics is right.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how much to make of this. American
culture, after all, is a maelstrom of prejudices and stereotypes,
some of them expressed only in private, some allowed in the mass
media, some relished (while others are reprobated) among the
well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims, Italians, Latinos, gays, blacks, women, atheists, even
Protestant bluebloods can justifiably complain about some of the
ways they are popularly portrayed. Indeed, if rebuking Bob Jones
University is a low-cost way to oppose anti-Catholicism, the reason
is that evangelical and fundamentalist Christians are farther down
in the national pecking order of prejudices than Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   A few of these stereotypes can be lethal; most are merely
corrosive. The constant pitter-patter of gibes, jokes and sneers
about Catholicism on television, in films, in celebrity interviews,
in university and alternative newspapers probably makes it harder
for some impressionable adolescents and young adults to avow their
beliefs and ultimately to maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Catholic animus is not keeping Catholics out of board rooms
or country clubs, however, although it may complicate the careers
of those in academic life, journalism or some professional fields
who don't make sure they are seen as ``thinking'' Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Catholicism would be a worthy subject for study and debate,
freed, one hopes, from the manipulative politics of victimhood. But
the place to begin is not Bob Jones University.

QWEST LOOKS FOR BUYER AS IT DISCUSSES ACQUISITION, EXECUTIVES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepared to cash out, Qwest Communications International Inc.'s
top executive, Joseph Nacchio, and biggest investor, Philip
Anschutz, are highly interested in selling their company, even as
they explore renegotiating Qwest's agreement to acquire U S West
Inc., executives close to the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidate to acquire Qwest, an upstart long-distance
company based in Denver, has been Deutsche Telekom of Germany,
Europe's largest communications carrier. But around the middle of
this week, Deutsche Telekom cooled its negotiations with Qwest as
the German company became newly aware of the many factors that
would complicate such a deal, executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   So over the last 72 hours, Deutsche Telekom has reinvigorated
acquisition talks with other companies, including Global Crossing
Ltd. of Bermuda, which is building undersea communications systems
around the world, executives close to those discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of many executives close to the negotiations is
that the chance of Deutsche Telekom's consummating a deal with
Qwest _ a process that in any case could take weeks _ is now less
than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, Qwest has transformed itself from an
obscure construction operation digging ditches for fiber-optic
cables into a muscular newcomer with a market value of more than
$40 billion. Anschutz, an oil and railroad magnate, has always been
seen as an investor rather than as someone committed to running a
communications company for the long term, and people close to the
company say he and Nacchio, a former executive at AT&AMP;T, now believe
that the time is ripe to lock in some of their spectacular gains.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest agreed to acquire U S West, the smallest of the Bell local
phone companies, just last summer. But that deal has not gone
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unaware that Qwest was in merger discussions with
Deutsche Telekom at all, U S West's chairman, Solomon Trujillo,
announced earlier this week that he would not join a combined
Qwest-U S West. Executives close to the companies said Nacchio had
devised a management structure that would have minimized Trujillo's
authority.
</P>
<P>
   One of the underlying sources of tension in the Qwest-U S West
relationship is that it would be far easier for Qwest to sell
itself to Deutsche Telekom, or indeed to just about any other
company, had Qwest not already agreed to acquire U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest says it is still committed to the U S West deal. But it
struck some analysts as telling that this week Nacchio, Qwest's
chairman, made his first strong comments suggesting that Qwest was
considering ways to back out of the U S West deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like at any costs,'' Nacchio said in an interview
with the Denver Post. ``I want the merger to go through, but I'm
not going to get blackmailed to do dumb business things to make it
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest could argue that significant regulatory delays in
acquiring U S West would allow it to walk away from the deal after
paying U S West an $800 million breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, U S West went on the offensive against that
potential outcome. In a letter to Qwest's general counsel, Drake
Tempest, his counterpart at U S West, Mark Roellig, wrote, ``As a
lawyer, I am certain that you are aware that any damages in no way
will be limited by the breakup fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, he added, ``Such damages would very likely make the
Pennzoil judgment pale in comparison,'' In 1985, Texaco, the oil
giant, was ordered to pay Pennzoil $10.5 billion for enticing Getty
Oil to back out of a previous deal to merge with Pennzoil in favor
of a bid from Texaco. After filing for protection under the
bankruptcy laws, Texaco agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For Deutsche Telekom, the prospect of trying to acquire only
Qwest and being sued by U S West appears highly discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary is that acquiring both U S West and Qwest would not
be a simple matter either. As a Bell company that emerged from AT&AMP;T
in 1984, U S West is regulated far more strictly than is Qwest.
Were Deutsche Telekom to attempt to acquire both Qwest and U S
West, the Qwest portion of the deal could sail through in months
while the U S West portion would be subject to regulatory reviews
that could take more than a year and could even entail Deutsche
Telekom's making further concessions to open its systems in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply embarrassed after he was left at the altar by Telecom
Italia last year, Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, is said
by people close to the company to be searching for a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Deutsche Telekom does not appear to have nearly as
much interest in becoming the local phone company in states
including Idaho and North Dakota, which are served by U S WeSt, as
it does in acquiring Qwest's state-of-the art national fiber-optic
network.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with Deutsche Telekom, Qwest still appears to
be spoiling to persuade U S West to renegotiate their deal so that
Qwest would control more of their combined company, executives
close to Qwest said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Deutsche Telekom, its trans-Atlantic ambitions are well
known. The German company has repeatedly said it wants to create a
global network and is keen on finding a partner in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has been circling potential prey in the United
States for at least a year, putting out feelers to communications
carriers of every size and description. Ever since Deutsche Telekom
lost the opportunity to acquire Sprint Corp., its partner in the
ill-fated Global One alliance, when Sprint agreed to be acquired by
MCI Worldcom last October, the German company has stepped up its
search for potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Global Crossing, which operates out of Los
Angeles. Executives close to Deutsche Telekom said Global Crossing
might even be a better match than Qwest and U S West because Global
Crossing's ambitions are already truly global. Deutsche Telekom
also has made preliminary contact with Bell Atlantic, SBC
Communications and BellSouth, though none of those talks have
beyond preliminary stages, executives close to Deutsche Telekom
said. Deutsche Telekom has also cast an eye at PSINet Inc., the
Internet backbone carrier, though no talks are currently under way
with that company, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, Deutsche Telekom has also held
exploratory discussions with Telefonica of Spain and Cable and
Wireless of Britain.

<P>
   THIRD OF FEBRUARY, Mozambique _ The old people called to each
other from the treetops, and their cries soon filled the night.
</P>
<P>
   One grandfather wept that his crippled wife had been swallowed
by flood waters. Another man shouted, ``Plane, plane!'' as a
shimmering sliver streaked through the sky. But the plane passed,
leaving the wrinkled men and women clinging to swaying branches
like birds with broken wings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after having been stranded for five days in the trees
above the flooded Limpopo River valley, the survivors finally
stumbled from a military helicopter onto firm ground. But their
rescue from this submerged village _ named for the date that marks
Heroes Day _ solved only one of their pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' said Joaquim Novunga, a 73-year-old
farmer, who lost his cattle, his house and his village to the
floods that have devastated this country. ``Now, how will we
live?''
</P>
<P>
   This misery in Mozambique, a country that has been heralded as
one of Africa's success stories, has played out most vividly in
this week's dramatic rescues of nearly 9,400 people. But the
economic consequences, while less visible, are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that about a third of the
Mozambique's corn _ Mozambique's staple crop _ has been destroyed.
The government says that more than 250,000 acres have been washed
away, along with the topsoil, more than 40,000 cattle have drowned
and 141 schools have been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mozambique, which was expected to have one of the
fastest-growing economies in the world, may see its gross domestic
product shrink by as much as a third as thousands of people find
themselves without work or a place to live, according to officials
familiar with the government's finances.
</P>
<P>
   And President Joaquim Chissano, who had hoped to focus this year
on boosting the blossoming economy, now finds his government
scrambling to build thousands of homes, replace washed-out roads
and feed tens of thousands of people who have lost their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need, the government has already issued an
urgent appeal for $65 million in foreign aid. But so far, only $13
million has come through, the United Nations said. Nearly 1 million
of this country's 17 million people have either lost housing, farms
or food supplies to the floods that began in February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've been telling people, `Let's get through the immediate
crisis,''' said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the United
Nations' World Food Program, which estimates that at least 500,000
people will be unable to feed themselves for the next six months.
``But the devastation to the infrastructure and economy is
massive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the shifting priorities, relief workers began
emphasizing the emergency delivery of food and supplies Friday as
the flood waters and the number of people stuck in trees or on
rooftops declined.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots for the South African National Defense Force, which has
led the search and rescue effort, say they are seeing fewer and
fewer stranded people. The defense force plans to send three
helicopters flying over the Limpopo River valley on Saturday to
assess exactly how many people are still waiting to be rescued.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, relief workers say, the most crucial needs are food, tents,
medicines, plastic sheeting and blankets for the thousands of
people who lack food and shelter. In Chiaquelane, for instance,
nearly 30,000 people desperately need such items.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding has also severely damaged the country's
infrastructure, knocking out bridges, making many major roads
impassible and preventing the free movement of people, cars, and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer possible, for instance, to drive directly from
Maputo, the capital, to Xai Xai, which is near here. The narrow,
two-lane road simply ends in muddy water in the town of Palmeira,
forcing villagers to slog through the waist-high tide to carry
sacks of corn meal to friends and relatives on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a team of high-ranking ministers from Mozambique and
other flood-affected countries _ which include South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe _ met in Pretoria to assess such damage and
to develop a program to rebuild the regional infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   And next week, the World Bank plans to send a team to Mozambique
to conduct a full evaluation of the flood and its impact on the
country's economy, which was expected to grow by about 8 or 9
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank representative based in Mozambique, James Coates,
who advises and monitors Chissano's government, said he believes
the country's economy will recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is going to be significant, but it's not a death
bell,'' Coates said. ``It's a setback, but it's something the
Mozambicans can manage and deal with. The real problem, of course,
is the humanitarian crisis and all the lives at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian crisis here cannot yet be precisely measured.
No one knows exactly how many people have died, for instance,
although relief agencies have estimated that thousands were killed
by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   But the toll is clearly visible in the red eyes and weary faces
of the survivors, who were battered again last week when Cyclone
Eline pushed the angry Limpopo River beyond its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, their entire world was water, with thatched roofs
floating in the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Matevelo, who believes he is about 69, said he was
sleeping on Sunday night when the water rushed into his house. ``My
father told me when the water gets up high to climb high,'' he
said, explaining how the villagers ended up in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   They survived by eating the carcass of a dead bull, drinking the
muddy flood water and frantically waving for help.
</P>
<P>
   But when the roaring, Oryx military helicopter finally rescued
them this afternoon, pulling them from the trees into the arms of a
South African soldier, they began to wonder if they could ever
truly remake their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Luckier survivors, who were processed along with everyone else
at the refugee center in nearby Chibutu, managed to salvage
something useful _ a wooden hoe, a plastic plate, a pair of sturdy,
rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12 people who flew out of this village Friday left most
of their best things behind. Some of their most valuable
possessions _ a black metal pot, a blue suitcase with red-trim, an
orange plastic water jug _ remain tethered to the green, tree
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Novunga bundled his clothes into a leather bag and tied them to
his shoulders with rope. He has spent his entire life as a farmer,
working the land, but now he does not even own a handful of seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have even a plate,'' he said. ``It's all in the
water.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of twists in their favor,
Republicans have improved their chances of keeping control of the
House in this year's elections, according to party leaders,
analysts and strategists from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of one House Democrat, the decision of another to
retire from his swing district and the fact that fewer Republican
seats will be as tough to defend as anticipated have all
contributed to the Republican turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they are still confident they will recapture the
House but acknowledge that Republicans have made strides since last
fall, when it was widely predicted that the House would switch
hands. A net gain of only six seats would give Democrats control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to put a pinky on the scale,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst who handicaps House races, ``it
would be for the Republicans holding the House.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and strategists also caution that the general
election is a long way off and that much could happen between now
and then to weaken Republican odds, including an increase in
retirements. And, with such a narrow divide between the two
parties, they emphasize that the dynamic of the presidential race
could tip the advantage, depending on which candidates are
nominated and how their campaigns play out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a long way from Tipperary,'' said Paul Begala, a former
senior White House aide and campaign strategist for President
Clinton, who added that Democrats were better positioned on the
issues and had more money than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political report on
individual races, said in his newsletter this month that
``beleaguered'' Republicans ``seem to be getting a few breaks'' and
have ``at least an even-money shot'' right now at keeping control
of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And just this week, a Senate Democratic leader struck a note of
caution about the prospects of his party's winning back the House,
which it lost in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are very overconfident about the House,'' said Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, the second-ranking Democratic leader in the
Senate, in an interview, adding that he believed that Democrats now
stood a better chance to retake the Senate than the House. ``There
aren't that many competitive districts.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls asking people which party's House candidate they
would vote for showed Republicans and Democrats neck and neck, with
Democrats winning more support on the issues. But a recent New York
Times poll gave House Democrats an 11-point advantage. Early last
year, during the impeachment battle, the surveys showed Republicans
consistently lagging by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race for the House is a lot like a really good basketball
game where one side might go up by a couple of points, and the
momentum might shift every few minutes,'' said Amy Walter, a Cook
Report editor who covers the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the perception is that maybe the ball is back in their
court,'' said, Walter, referring to the Republicans. ``But it's
still a tossup.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The critical numbers are these: Republicans need to defend 22
open seats _ those without incumbents, who typically enjoy an
enormous re-election advantage. That is an average number of
retirements, but it is in sharp contrast to the Democrats, who have
only 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more open seats in our favor than in theirs, and
historically open seats in general are more likely to switch
parties than other seats,'' said Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff
for Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But as the matchups in many races have become clear, analysts
agree that there are fewer than a dozen truly competitive races.
The Cook Report concludes that only two of those open seats are
leaning toward changing hands, and both are Democratic seats seen
as likely to go Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to several crucial twists that have gone their
way in the past two months. First, Rep. Virgil H. Goode Jr. of
Virginia, a conservative Democrat, announced in January that he
would become an independent, but would align himself with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Rep. Owen B. Pickett, another Virginia Democrat,
announced he would retire. Republicans have already recruited a
strong candidate for that district, considered Republican
territory, while Democrats are still scrambling. In addition, a
seat in Pennsylvania, now filled by Rep. Ron Klink, a Democrat who
is vacating the seat to run for the Senate, is also vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Pickett and Klink seats are the sole open seats that Cook
rates as leaning toward changing hands.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, they were throwing dirt on the coffin,'' said
J. Kenneth Klinge, a Republican political consultant. ``Now the
coffin is back out of the ground, they've got the dirt off and they
are beginning to take the flowers back to the florist.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, House Republicans, led by Rep. Thomas M.
Davis of Virginia, the chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, made several strategic moves that they say
are starting to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   To calm the jittery nerves of big business, traditionally the
Republicans' strongest ally, Republican leaders brought in Dan
Matoon, a seasoned lobbyist to head the internal operations of the
campaign committee. They also began to draw more on the expertise
of Bill Paxon, the former New York congressman who helped engineer
the 1994 Republican takeover of the House, and Haley Barbour, the
former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   To blunt the Democrats' current financial advantage, the
Republican leaders completed a list of 350,000 new donors, people
the party can rely on to make small, hard money contributions for
individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The donor list is critical,'' said Paxon, now a
lobbyist.``It's the best donor list in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As of late last year, the most recent figures available, House
Democrats had more than double the cash in the bank than
Republicans: $19.8 million to $9 million. While Republicans raised
substantially more money last year, they also spent it to pay off
debts and for the Virginia state races as well as a special
congressional election in California, among other things. The
Republican won control of the Virginia Legislature but lost the
special election.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said money did not worry him too much, adding that
Democrats have only $1 million more than Republicans in hard money,
which comes from individuals and goes to candidates, compared with
the unrestricted soft-money contributions from corporations and the
rich, which go to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We way outraised them last time,'' Davis said, ``and we'll
outraise them this time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans usually run into trouble on the issues, and it
is here that Democrats say they are confident they now hold the
edge. So far, Republican leaders have carefully avoided explosive
floor skirmishes and focused on small bills they can pass: tax
savings for married couples, and most recently, a break for working
people 65 through 69 on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But there are land mines ahead _ a proposed overhaul in managed
care, a plan to have Medicare pay for prescription drugs and gun
control legislation, to name three _ that will prove far trickier
and more politically dangerous for Republicans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for the Republicans' strategy on issues so far, Begala said:
``They are selling tax cuts, and nobody is buying. Their whole
approach is very '80s. They pine for Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race is also expected to be a factor.
Republicans, who had built a strategy around Gov. George W. Bush's
popularity, said they still expected him to receive the nomination
over Sen. John McCain. The good news, they argue, is that voter
turnout in Republican primaries is sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running with Bush or McCain you have a little bit of a
different dynamic,'' Davis said. ``But with everything going on
here, I don't see anything that at this point does anything but
good things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dispute that rosy view, saying Bush has been weakened
in the primary campaign and will not carry the party to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is scrambling to raise money to get himself elected,''
Elmendorf, the Gephardt aide, said, ``and he is not going to be an
advantage to them.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As this city's biggest apartment developer, John A.
Williams and the company he founded _ Post Properties Inc. _ helped
make Atlanta a symbol of urban sprawl bursting out of control.
Through the 1970s and '80s, he turned thousands of acres of
suburban forest into vast expanses of garden apartments. But today,
Williams has become one of the nation's leading champions of
renewed urbanism. Denouncing the suburbs as eyesores and breeding
grounds for neurotic youth, he has built projects in recent years
that have added apartments, often with stores and offices, to
older, urban neighborhoods. In partnership with the state's new
governor, a close friend, he is translating his new business
practices into policy.
</P>
<P>
   The central city revival that Williams is leading in Atlanta is
spreading to cities like Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Memphis.
Neighborhoods that until recently were bereft of human presence
after working hours are sprouting apartments, restaurants, movie
theaters and grocery stores. In 1997, a Kroger store opened just
across the street from the Atlanta City Hall, where the most common
neighborhood storefronts had been the offices of bail bondsmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is still fighting a much stronger trend _ the
continuing push of Americans to own their own land and their own
homes, and the desire of builders to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County recently approved its largest housing
development ever, to turn the rolling hills on the northwestern
edge of the metropolis into homes for 70,000 people _ a project
that environmental groups and a neighboring county are challenging
in court. But leading home builders see no demand for new housing
closer to downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's own suburbs, including 4 of the nation's 10
fastest-growing counties, continue to spread. Atlantans now have
even tougher drives to work than Angelinos do. They commute an
average of 35 miles a day _ more than anywhere else in the country.
The city's pollution has become so severe that the federal
government has threatened to cut off highway funds unless Atlantans
find ways to reduce traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Atlanta residents who had followed Williams into
the suburbs have been clamoring for housing closer to the city's
core. So redirecting development has become not just a matter of
principle, but of business necessity, even desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Williams helped his old friend, Gov. Roy Barnes, form
the powerful Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, which can
veto new shopping centers or office buildings that fail to provide
mass transit or housing within an easy walk.
</P>
<P>
   Since Williams began building garden apartments around Atlanta
in 1971, his empire has grown to include 36,000 apartments in a
dozen cities, with almost 7,000 under construction. Only in the
1990s has he preached the virtues of new urbanism, before business
groups across the country. He talks with a convert's evangelical
fervor about his new philosophy of building communities where
people can live, walk and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs, frankly, are just sort of ugly,'' said Williams,
in a ninth-floor office at his signature urban community, Post
Riverside. Within the city limits, though about 10 miles from
downtown, it has street-level shops with upstairs apartments, all
set on a town square. Williams moved his headquarters here from
suburban Cobb County when Post Riverside opened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Very private despite his status as one of Atlanta's men in full,
Williams, 56, hesitates even before saying how many children he has
(three, and one grandchild). He does casually disclose, however,
that his international yacht racing has brought him buddies who
include Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference room, he flashes the slides of suburban images _
drive-in banks, fast-food pick-up windows and a low-rise Dallas
apartment complex in a sea of parking lots _ that he keeps at the
ready for visitors. He also displays his penchant for subjecting
housing developments, and their residents, to psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't live in that environment and feel good about
themselves,'' said Williams, whose warm smile and manner hardly
soften his fierce convictions. ``Children who grow up in a suburb
where you can't tell one house from the other just have an
unfortunate experience. I think it's related to the neuroses we are
seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his preferred style, Williams shows a slide of the
ancient Roman city of Bath, England: a village built around a town
center meant for people from all walks of life. It was his model
for Post Riverside and other developments that he calls new urban
villages.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper West Side of Manhattan, with block after solid block
of apartments, his projects are not. Neither are they smack in the
city's center. But in Atlanta, areas that were considered suburban
not too long ago are now considered urban and close in.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Cobb County, where Williams was once the chairman of the
Chamber of Commerce, he is regarded in some quarters as a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cooper, the chamber's current chief executive, notes that
the new Post headquarters and urban village are just across the
Chattahoochee River from Cobb. Even the wealthy Buckhead
neighborhood where Williams lives, though in the city, has a
suburban character, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   All the urban projects that anyone could build cannot possibly
accommodate Atlanta's growth, he added. ``Where are the people
going to live who work in these office buildings I'm looking at?''
Cooper asked from his office. ``Are you going to pack them all into
10-story apartment buildings? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Principle is on his side, Cooper concluded. ``Part of the
American dream,'' he said, ``is being able to choose your
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his allies have so transformed the debate here that
even some suburban developers are calling themselves urbanists, or
advocates of ``smart growth.'' Sprawl-bashing has become so
widespread that some suburbanites say they're ashamed to
acknowledge where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen H. Macauley, president of Macauley Homes and
Neighborhoods, is building what he calls an ``urban village,'' on
88 acres in Cobb County, about 30 miles from downtown Atlanta.
Twenty years ago, the area was pasture _ ``redneck heaven,''
Macauley says. Then came a mall. Now there are chain stores,
restaurants, pavement and traffic as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   Macauley plans a community where apartments, stores and offices
are all close together and easily accessible by foot. ``If you'd
told me 10 years ago I'd be building an urban development here, I'd
have died laughing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Post's in-town projects are much more in-town. As
what planners call ``in-fill developments,'' they are in older
neighborhoods _ some blighted, some thriving. ``We have no interest
at all in building suburban garden apartments,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Statements like these have made Williams a new best friend of
Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta. The mayor is celebrating because
the city itself _ a compact area whose population of 427,500
accounts for only 13.3 percent of the region's 3.2 million
residents _ has just seen its first population increase after 30
years of decline, with double-digit growth projected for this
decade. ``Here you have the premier suburban apartment developer
not just validating but extolling the virtues of urban living with
the zeal of a preacher,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees Post's credibility as fueling the in-town housing
movement. ``The development business is sheep and shepherds,'' he
said. ``If you have a developer who's successful, others will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, what looks like a gamble is actually a well-hedged
bet. While Post invests heavily in its new urban developments, the
company is still well supported by income from its suburban
apartments (though it has sold some of its oldest buildings).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it really is that much of a risk,'' said Ross L.
Smotrich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns in New York, who has watched
Post for almost two decades. ``I happen to like their strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the stock, even though the price has stagnated
over the last three years as the broader market has boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Such lackluster performance, Smotrich said, does not reflect
anxiety about Post's urban strategy but rather investors' passion
for high-technology stocks instead of real estate investment
trusts, or REIT's, like Post. Smotrich said Post's strong balance
sheet, growth prospects and management led him to expect a stock
price of $43.50 within 12 months, up from $37.1875 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most valuable asset may be its name. Instead of
following the common practice of giving every project an entirely
different label, Williams wanted from the beginning to create a
brand. He picked up the Post name from a Post Oak street sign that
he saw as he was hunting for property in Dallas. He now has Atlanta
projects that include Post Canyon, Post Renaissance and Post
Parkside.
</P>
<P>
   The Post brand proves reassuring to residents of his in-town
projects, and to the real estate trade more generally. ``The fact
that Post is doing it demonstrates that it is financially viable,''
said Adrienne Schmitz, director of residential development for the
Urban Land Institute in Washington. ``It's definitely a national
trend.''

   However enthusiastic Williams may wax about new urbanism, his
move into the cities was strictly a business decision. And his
transformation was less an epiphany than an evolution, based not on
divine inspiration but on routine market surveys.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story begins more than a half-century ago in the southwest
Atlanta neighborhood where Williams was born and raised. That area
has gone from predominantly white to black, but it has remained
economically diverse and culturally rich. As a boy, Williams walked
to school each day, passing neighbors and shopkeepers who kept a
watchful eye on the children.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses were large and luxurious; some were not. Williams
describes his home as tiny, and he recalls passing his time drawing
house construction plans as early as the age of 10. He always liked
to build things, and always had his own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from a public high school and studied industrial
management at Georgia Tech. After graduation, he took a job at the
Georgia Power Co., working with real estate developers. He soon
joined one of them, an apartment builder and manager. ``I didn't
see them doing anything I couldn't do better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1960s, and he figured out that as young women
gained better jobs, they would spend more on housing. No longer
would they have to live four to an apartment. They would want their
places nicer and cleaner, and with more flowers.
</P>
<P>
   So that is what he gave them when he started Post in 1971. ``We
figured if we got the women, the men would follow,'' he said. ``And
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical Post suburban apartments, two- and three-story
walk-ups with outside entrances, had big rooms, plush carpeting,
modern kitchens and screened porches to take advantage of Sun Belt
weather. These developments had large swimming pools with deck
furniture for lounging, plus barbecue grills, tennis courts,
clubhouses with party rooms and even laundry rooms with picture
windows. Everything was framed by lush landscaping _ even the
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The car was the only equipment required. Driving around Post
apartments to view the tulips, a Williams trademark, was a rite of
spring.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, plenty of vacant land was available within what was
then a 20-minute drive from downtown. Residents felt safer there
than in the decaying city. Singles zipped home from work, changed
clothes and headed out by car to the bars and restaurants that also
came to ring the city. Those 20- or early 30-somethings who didn't
live in Post apartments visited friends who did.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams became active in civic and business organizations,
his friends came to include Barnes, then a young Cobb County lawyer
and state legislator. The two talked business and politics over
breakfast at the IHOP on Roswell Road in Sandy Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a garden apartment complex there. But by the late
1980s, the Roswell Road corridor _ a wide swath of signs, fast-food
stops and strip shopping centers _ had become such a textbook
example of suburban blight that city planners in Atlanta would use
pictures of it to illustrate what to avoid with future zoning
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the first time since the postwar boom, these
planners began to talk about the advantages of combining housing,
shopping and offices in communities as friendly for pedestrians as
for cars.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was getting worse. Although more offices were springing
up in the suburbs, residents of Post's apartments were having a lot
more trouble getting to work. Life in the 'burbs was becoming less
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Williams paid attention. Every year he has been in business, he
has surveyed residents. ``In the late 1980s, we started to notice
in the questionnaires that people wanted to live closer in,'' he
said. ``Our move was a direct response.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he opened his first in-town project, Post Chastain in
Atlanta. As Barnes remembered, ``People thought he was nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams also noticed that in the city, conditions for
development were ripening. Crime rates were dropping. Atlanta's
economy drew residents from other cities who were already alert to
the conveniences of urban living. Apartments built for the 1996
Olympic Games furthered the urban renaissance. As the suburbs
raised taxes to deal with growth, city tax rates became more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   At Post Riverside, many residents work in the offices that are
part of the complex, including Post headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Anderson, a retired Price Waterhouse partner, moved
with his wife, Dawn, in June 1998 from a home in Buckhead. Most
mornings, he goes from his apartment to the Town Square Gym, then
the Deli Market Cafe (both operated by Post), then to his office,
where he has a small consulting firm. Each trip takes no more than
three minutes, by foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first did it, friends thought we were crazy,'' he
said. ``They're envious now, because we're really much freer. Being
able to just walk over to your office gives you a couple of extra
hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other cities, the new in-town housing here is attracting
not only young singles, but also empty nesters and couples without
children, like the Andersons. ``It's cool. It's eclectic,''
Williams said. But he grants that Sun Belt inner cities have to
improve education and race relations, and reduce crime further,
before they can attract families with school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The artful comforts of Post's new urban communities are still
not what many people consider inner-city living. Post might be to
pre-World War II urban neighborhoods what Disney World's Epcot is
to the foreign countries that its sleek pavilions seek to mimic.
</P>
<P>
   But Post's new urban communities will age well, suggested Carl
Patton, the former dean of the School of Architecture at the
University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who is now president of
Georgia State University in Atlanta. ``I think it's going to take
on more of a patina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Patton came to Georgia State, he sold off the president's
mansion in Buckhead and took a loft apartment downtown, next to his
campus. He even got rid of the president's parking space.
</P>
<P>
   But noting that he has to buy his takeout soup immediately after
work, before a nearby deli closes, he is urging Williams to build
apartments in the very center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONA TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he opened his most urban venture yet _ Post Parkside,
about three miles from downtown but within walking distance of the
BellSouth Corp. and other corporate headquarters. The development
blends so well into its century-old neighborhood that it's hard to
spot. Loft apartments built out to the sidewalks are designed to
look old, some with hardwood floors from an old shoe warehouse.
Crime fears are addressed with decorative but effective steel gates
and security systems with panic buttons. But no tulips.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford N. Green, age 34, moved there on his return to Atlanta
after five years in Copenhagen, where he walked or rode a bicycle
everywhere. He was appalled by the increased traffic, and he sought
a neighborhood that would suit his Norwegian bride, Kristin. ``It's
the closest I could get to European living in Atlanta,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and other developers are building similar apartments
across the country. In downtown Houston, Post restored the landmark
Rice Hotel, installing 312 loft apartments, a restaurant, shops, a
health club, a pool and a ballroom. In Dallas, Post has invested
heavily in a neighborhood adjacent to the downtown core. In the
last year, the company has been building urban projects in Orlando,
Fla., Austin, Tex., and, just across from the Pentagon, near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, it's a round trip. ``We're trying to build
neighborhoods that remind me and others of where we grew up,'' he
said. ``You couldn't get me to live in the suburbs for all the tea
in China.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ On paper, New England ought to be George W.
Bush country. Not only does he have roots here _ his father was
raised in Greenwich, Conn., and his family has a home in Maine _
but he also enjoys broad support from New England's Republican
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are
supporting Bush. In stark contrast, his chief rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain, has no
state-level official supporting him in Connecticut, and only a
scattering of relatively obscure state legislators, former
congressmen and retired military veterans working for him in all of
New England. In Maine, for instance, McCain's state campaign
chairman is a retired Marine from Dresden who coaches college
softball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that McCain has a good chance of winning all five
New England primaries on Tuesday, and their 102 collective
delegates, as many as are at stake in New York on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where McCain was trailing Bush last September
by 30 points, he now leads by more than 20. In Rhode Island, where
the GOP is weak and more than half of all voters are independents,
he is also leading by more than 20 points. In Vermont, McCain's
campaign chairman bragged this week that victory was a foregone
conclusion. Many experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain will sweep New England,'' said Darrell West, a
political science professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
``This is a segment that has a tradition of going for mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that tradition works in McCain's favor _ polls
indicate Bush has a good shot only in Connecticut and Maine _ there
are 613 delegates at stake on Tuesday and some formidable
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that tradition works in McCain's favor _ polls
indicate Bush has a good shot only in Connecticut and Maine _ it
may not be enough. Bush is strong in California and Georgia, with
216 delegates, and the races in Ohio and New York, with a total of
168 delegates are tight.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that before Friday, neither Bush nor McCain
had set foot in New England since Feb. 1, the day of McCain won the
New Hampshire primary by 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, the region's five states simply do not add
up to much Tuesday, said Jay Malcynsky, Bush's Connecticut campaign
manager. ``They don't have the number of delegates to deliver to
one candidate or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain is able to win most or all of New England, the rest
of the races, particularly California, New York and Ohio, will pull
him through,'' he said of Bush. But he conceded, ``It's been a
battle for Bush in New England since New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other region in the country, the
five-state New England region, from Connecticut up to Maine, offers
McCain a tailor-made, fiercely independent moderate voters whose
counterparts delivered McCain primary victories in New Hampshire
and Michigan. In every state in this region except New Hampshire,
independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats, and only in
Connecticut are non-Republican voters banned from crossing over to
vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 in Massachusetts have switched registration in
time for Tuesday's primary, mostly Democrats to independents, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such momentum does not seem to have waned after McCain's triple
primary defeat last week in Virginia, Washington and North Dakota,
said Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those elections were in different parts of the country, and I
don't see them slowing him down in Connecticut,'' McLean said in an
interview this week. ``I'm not sure anyone even paid attention in
Connecticut. People I talked to, they were asking me who won in
those states.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken in Connecticut, by Quinnipiac College taken after
McCain's resounding win in New Hampshire but before Bush's win in
South Carolina, showed McCain ahead, 52 percent to 39 percent. But
a Zogby poll of 361 likely voters released Friday showed Bush
ahead, 45 percent to 42 percent, with a five point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be competitive here,'' Malcynsky said on
Wednesday. But McCain _ who has no state-level elected official
openly backing him here _ still seems to have a grip on
Connecticut's electoral imagination. In Cheshire, Conn, an affluent
town southwest of Hartford, several Republicans interviewed Friday
said they will vote for McCain Tuesday, mostly because of their
perceptions about his character and willingness to shake up
Washington's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want George Bush's son in office; I've had enough of
Bush,'' said Sue Paulik, 59, who works in a Cheshire drug store.
``I think his policies would follow Reagan and what happened under
his father. The economy really suffered under his father.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. John Rowland, Bush's foremost Connecticut booster, has
had a distinctly less zealous outlook on winning Connecticut, whose
25 delegates are second in New England to the 37 of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The cooling down became notable 10 days ago, after Rowland
criticized Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, a South Carolina
college that espouses anti-Catholic views, as ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's chances Friday, Rowland, who is Catholic,
said, ``Governor Bush as a candidate is back on the offensive, back
on message,'' and he criticized McCain for taking ``inappropriate
advantage'' of Bush's Bob Jones debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not predict victory.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush cannot win here, Maine may be his only other reasonable
hope in New England, though Gov. Angus King, a popular independent,
has endorsed no one. Primary rules that allow same-day crossover
voting also seem to bode well for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's staple issue of taxes will make him competitive, said
his volunteer state chairman, Ross J. Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine hasn't benefited from the boom the way the rest of the
country has, so, the issue of taxation will play much better here
in Maine,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way New England voters go on Tuesday, they will do so
largely without the benefit of having a chance to see either Bush
or McCain in person. Both men are far more compelled by their
battle over New York's 101 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday afternoon, McCain diverted his New York campaign
briefly to deliver a speech at Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield, Conn. Bush's wife, Laura Bush, has stumped for her
husband in the state. On Saturday, Bush is expected to speak at a
rally at Bradley International Airport, north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the take for both men in New England, experts and even
devout McCain supporters say they believe McCain's candidacy may
decline rapidly after Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's cool, fresh,'' said Denny Maisano, 47, a
banking consultant from Cheshire who plans to vote for McCain. But
``I don't think he has a broad enough appeal or enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   West, the Brown political science professor went a step further,
predicting that after a loss in California Tuesday, ``the media
begins to turn against him, McCain's money dries up and he's forced
out the race.''

SPORTS COLUMN: LOOKING INSIDE RIVERSIDE CHURCH FOR ANSWERS TO NCAA
VIOLATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Sunday, the Rev. James Forbes walked up to the
pulpit at Riverside Church to deliver his weekly sermon. Four
police officers had been cleared in the shooting of Amadou Diallo,
emotions were raging and the congregation was waiting to hear
Forbes, the senior minister, render a fiery perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But before he began, Forbes said he had some housekeeping to do.
Many had read or heard the church's name mentioned in connection
with an inquiry by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
Specifically, the NCAA was investigating the role the Riverside
Church basketball program had played in helping Erick Barkley, a
Riverside alumnus and St. John's point guard, pay tuition to a prep
school in Maine. So Forbes assured the congregation that the church
had only been acting for the greater good and that Ernie Lorch, the
founder and director of the basketball program, was a man of
integrity, whose only intent was to help young people.
</P>
<P>
   Before Forbes called attention to the Riverside Hawks in church
last Sunday, many members of the congregation may not have known
that there was a gym downstairs, or that the gym housed one of the
most prestigious basketball programs in the United States. There is
an equal likelihood that the players down below did not know about
the legacy and long tradition of Riverside Church, an institution
that has always been in the forefront of social activism.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, this disparity between heaven and earth was more
disconcerting than NCAA rules and violations. Two days ago, Forbes
sat in his office and conceded that the NCAA inquiry had compelled
him to finally take more than a cursory look at the church's
well-known basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes arrived at Riverside in 1989, the basketball program
had already been in operation for 21 years. That year, Seton Hall
played for the national championship, and four of the Pirates'
starters came from the Riverside program. At the time, that fact
was the source of pride and celebration at the Manhattan church. In
retrospect, Forbes realizes that Seton Hall's presence in the title
game was an indication of how powerful the program had become.
</P>
<P>
   What began as an outreach program now extends across the nation.
This is a sophisticated program that hunts, scouts and recruits
talent. Forbes pointed out that Riverside Church provides
scholarships to students in ways that are not related to athletics.
``We have an S O S program _ sister to sister _ that takes money
out of the endowment to aid women,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA is not concerned with Riverside's overall
benevolence. The inquiry is focused on the relationship between the
church's basketball program, Lorch and schools like St. John's that
have been the beneficiaries of Lorch's largess. It is Lorch who has
been the key person at Riverside in determining how much aid elite
athletes, like Barkley, should get to attend high-octane prep
schools, like Maine Central Institute, which specializes in
refining fifth-year seniors into Division I players.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Thursday that the church, in anticipation of more
meetings with the NCAA, has begun its own fact-finding mission.
Church officers and lawyers have spoken with Lorch and his lawyers
to learn the truth and unravel the gnarled roots of relationships
formed over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The church is asking itself even larger questions. Has the
basketball program's mission veered off course? Has the program
lost its sense of churchmanship? Has Forbes been too detached?
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if Forbes had ever met Erick Barkley. Forbes said he
had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to the games when the Hawks were playing nearby,''
he said. ``I would go as the pastor to show support for the teams.
I would offer trophies from the pulpit on Sunday morning when they
would come back from a tournament. I did not have a hands-on
relationship with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Forbes had the idea of bringing all former Riverside
players back to the church and have them commit themselves to
supporting the program. ``We wanted to have them come back and say,
`We want to help so that other generations of kids could have the
opportunity,''' Forbes said. ``Ernie isn't going to be around
forever. We have to develop alternative sources if we are going to
keep this program going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes has temporarily scrapped the idea. ``I'm glad we
did,'' he said. ``Otherwise, it could appear that all of the good
work we have done was in a sense a delayed process of exploitation.
You can imagine that our approach to it will be much more studied
in terms of guaranteeing the absence of any conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the spirit of generosity and helpfulness, we want to save
that,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Polk has been asking questions, too. Polk came
to Riverside Church in 1960, when he was appointed minister to
youth. At the time, he was the first African-American to be
appointed a full-time minister of Riverside Church. The youth
program was 95 percent white and Asian. These were the children of
professors at Columbia and Barnard and Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   The program would invite children from the nearby Grant Housing
projects to the church for Friday night activities. Large numbers
of black and brown faces would show up. They would attend Sunday
school classes as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the church was overwhelmed; they really didn't know
how to handle this,'' Polk recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So the program's supervisors tried team teaching, and trips and
weekend retreats. ``The other part of that was these kids from the
Grant homes liked to play ball,'' Polk said. ``I needed someone to
take the most incorrigible kids from the Grant houses into a
specialized athletic program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorch's roommate at Middlebury College in Vermont was a
congregational minister who knew Polk and knew that Lorch and his
mother had recently moved from Long Island to Manhattan after the
death of Lorch's father. Polk arranged a meeting; Lorch agreed to
help establish a basketball program. He would teach Sunday school
and coach basketball on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial portion of the money for the basketball program
came from the Dyson Family Foundation, for whom Lorch worked as
counsel and board president. ``What they didn't give,'' Polk said
of Dyson, ``Lorch contributed out of his pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk left the church in 1966, then returned in 1969 as
Riverside's minister of urban affairs until 1976. By then, the
basketball program had become nationally known, and Lorch had
become a powerful figure within the basketball industry. Nike is
now one of the program's major sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, who is now the interim associate general secretary of the
National Council of Churches of Christ, feels that the original
concept of outreach has been obscured by commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ernie is a fine man and a man of integrity,'' Polk
said. ``But there doesn't seem to be a partnership between the
church and the basketball program, no sense of churchmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk added: ``The first wave of youngsters were in Sunday
School. They had to be there on Sunday morning. There was some
semblance of Christian education being imparted to these young
people. What I'm really trying to say is, Have there been missed
opportunities to bring people into the realm of faith? I do believe
that when you represent an institution like a church you have to
have some allegiance to what it's all about, and your kids ought to
know. I'm not sure if those youngsters know what Riverside church
is or what it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Thursday that these issues and questions have been
gnawing at him. He plans to close the gap in his church between
heaven in the nave and earth in the basement gym. ``Because the
issue is raised,'' he said, ``it obviously is a matter that the
church would be more conscious of potential ethical violations. Now
that we see more broadly what the implications are, we will watch
more closely.''
</P>
<P>
   For one church, at least, the embarrassment of an NCAA inquiry
has been a wake-up call. Better yet, call it a blessing in
disguise.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turning their full energies to perhaps the most
contested state in Tuesday's primaries, Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain brought their tense battle to New York Friday, as
McCain accused the state's political leaders of trying to ``hijack
the campaign'' for Bush, while the Texas governor mocked his
opponent for ``squealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges, carried in the course of a day of television
interviews, campaign bus rides, outdoor rallies and forums, came as
Bush and McCain focused on a contest that McCain suggested, in a
morning interview with radio host Don Imus, he needed to win to
stay in the Republican race for president.
</P>
<P>
   Against this clearly high-stakes backdrop, McCain dived into a
vigorous schedule of campaigning, starting at 7 a.m. with a ride
around Manhattan in his campaign bus, which provided a rolling
platform for a live interview on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, he headed for the steps of Federal Hall on Wall Street,
a traditional rallying spot in New York campaigns, to offer a
spirited attack directed less at Bush and more at the governor's
chief patrons in New York, Gov. George Pataki and William D.
Powers, the New York Republican chairman, who McCain said had
orchestrated a campaign of attacks that he said distorted his views
on breast cancer research and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be fooled by them, my friends,'' McCain told a modest
lunchtime crowd, shivering in the late-winter wind while straining
to hear his words on the muffled sound system. ``Don't let the
special interests decide who's going to win this election. This is
the whole reason for campaign reform: because this big money from
God-knows-where comes in and distorts the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew into Long Island, the state's traditional center of
Republican power, where he made a bid for support from women voters
in a primary where polls show him in a tight battle with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at a staged panel discussion of breast cancer, at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Elizabeth
Dole, a former rival for the Republican nomination, appeared at his
side for the first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides billed the event as a policy discussion on breast
cancer, an issue that has been of particular concern on Long
Island, where activists have suggested that environmental
contaminants have caused high rates of the disease. Bush's campaign
appearance was intended to underline a radio advertisement Bush has
been airing in the metropolitan area this week, portraying McCain
as hostile to breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bush's forum was devoted less to policy, and
more to the campaign at hand. Bush did not offer any new proposals
to deal with the issue. He wore a pink ribbon, a symbol of concern
for the disease, and frequently had at his side the breast cancer
research advocate Geri Barish, who narrates the advertisement
attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance came the same day that McCain said his sister,
Susan McCain Morgan, was a breast cancer survivor. But Bush said he
would have pursued the attack on McCain's views on the subject,
which even some of Bush's supporters acknowledge are based on a
selective reading of McCain's legislative record, even if he had
been aware of McCain's sister's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the more reason to remind him what he said about the
research that goes on here,'' Bush said. He said he was ``sorry if
that's the case,'' adding, ``obviously, it's very difficult for her
and the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, when Bush was asked if he personally believed that
McCain opposed breast cancer research, as asserted in the radio
advertisement, he responded: ``No, I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor went on to defend the advertisement by citing as
examples spending items that McCain had listed on his Web site of
wasteful spending by Congress. In Washington, McCain has
established a reputation as a senator who frequently denounces
spending that he says is based on political considerations, rather
than real needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad speaks to programs that he called garden-variety
pork,'' Bush said. ``I don't think the senator should be squealing
about pork and then squealing when somebody disagrees with one of
the cuts he wants to make.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, asked on his bus Friday night on the way to a rally in
Fairfield, Conn., about Bush's remarks about his sister, said only,
``I hope my sister wasn't watching television.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was talking about McCain, the senator from Arizona
was focusing on the surrogates who have been been at Bush's side
during these important days leading up to the New York vote. On
Wall Street, he referred theatrically to ``Comrade Pataki and
Comrade Powers'' as he recalled their ill-fated effort to keep him
off the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, when Imus asked him about the breast cancer attacks,
which the radio personality described as ``absurd,'' McCain quickly
agreed, as he tried to turn Bush's campaign tactics against him,
much the same way Bush tried to turn McCain's campaign tactics
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is what is so distasteful and unpleasant about
politics, that the Bush campaign would run an ad saying I'm against
funding for breast cancer research,'' McCain said. ``I've voted for
it many times.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It really is an unfortunate part of American
political campaigning when the Bush people would pay for such an
outrageous statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will figure it out,'' he said. ``And if they don't
figure it out, we'll have run an honorable campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood by the attacks that he made on McCain, saying they
were based on a fair reading of his record. ``Let me repeat what he
says in his own words,'' Bush said, reading the list of projects
from McCain's site. ``You can't say one thing and do another. This
is a man who's gone around saying he's going to cut pork, and
that's fine. But in this race, we've documented some of the things
he's said he's going to cut.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also seized on an advertisement challenging his record on
the environment as an example of what has been the central theme of
his candidacy: campaign finance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement listed its sponsor as ``Republicans for Clean
Air'' and until Friday it was unclear who was behind it. But Friday
a wealthy Texas businessman named Sam Wyly came forward to say he
had paid $2.5 million to broadcast the advertisement in New York,
California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wyly had been a big contributor to Bush, McCain's aides
asserted that Bush was orchestrating the attacks under cover of
Republicans for Clean Air. Bush emphatically denied the charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform has been McCain's central issue, and
standing on Wall Street, addressing an audience that included a
number of Democrats _ among them, the state attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer _ he invoked the advertisement as an example of what was
wrong in politics today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send a message back to the special interests,'' McCain said on
Wall Street. ``We're sick of government influence in New York and
in America, and we want our government back and we want our
political process and back, and you can go back from whencesoever
rock you came from.''

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS EPA RULES TO REDUCE SMOG IN THE NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what clean air advocates called a watershed ruling, a federal
appeals court on Friday upheld rules limiting pollution from
Midwestern states that causes unacceptable levels of smog in
Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-to-1 ruling, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit in Washington upheld the Environmental
Protection Agency rule requiring the control of smog-causing
chemicals that move from several states, among them Indiana, Ohio
and West Virginia, to states like New York and parts of New
England. Coal-burning power plants are the primary source of one of
those chemicals, nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling limits the amount of nitrogen oxide that states can
emit into the atmosphere. In some cases, the new limit may require
power plants to reduce their emissions to one-quarter or one sixth
of what had been allowed, said Peter Lehner, chief of the
environmental protection bureau of the New York attorney general's
office. They can chose to limit emissions as they wish, but are
expected to focus on power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision means that we again can move forward to bring
cleaner, healthier air to more than 138 million people living in
the eastern half of the United States,'' Carol Browner, the EPA's
administrator, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had issued regulations on emissions in October 1998,
but their implementation was delayed by litigation over them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are expected to take effect by 2003 for some
plants and by 2005 for others. The rules originally applied to 22
states; yesterday's ruling said further review was necessary to
determine how the regulations applied to Wisconsin, Missouri and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total amount of air pollution, especially in the summer,
will be dramatically less,'' Lehner said, predicting that people
would be able to notice reductions in smog and would see some
relief from asthma and other respiratory diseases, which are
worsened by air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while the current regulations focused on summertime
smog the controls might also be necessary in winter and that that
should reduce acid rain and particulate pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinarily big step toward getting year-round
controls,'' he said. Many other lawsuits have been filed to control
year-round pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental advocacy group involved in the suit, said
Ohio, one of the worst polluters, experienced a higher rate of
hospital admissions in smoggy periods than New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the states that are the biggest polluters of other
states are also the biggest polluters of their own citizens,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the lawyer representing the Midwest Ozone Group, a
coalition of utility and coal companies that fought the
regulations, were not returned last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a massive attack by industry on the EPA effort, but
the court upheld that effort, a joint effort by the EPA, many of
the states suffering from transporting pollution and environmental
organizations,'' Hawkins said. Judges Stephen Williams and Judith
Rogers sided with the EPA. Judge David Sentelle dissented.

MRS. CLINTON SET TO ADDRESS QUESTION OF POLICE CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In remarks leading up to what her aides say will be a
major policy statement on police conduct and the Diallo case
Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that New York City
``obviously has a problem when an innocent, unarmed man is gunned
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had been in contact with several members of the
clergy, business executives and political leaders in the city in
recent days ``who share my concern about creating a better climate
where we can all feel both protected and respected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very confident we can decrease the crime rate and
increase the trust rate,'' she said. Without referring directly to
either the police shooting of Amadou Diallo last year or that of
Malcolm Ferguson on Wednesday, she said, ``We must take steps to
assure that this sort of incident never happens again.'' She said
she would speak in greater detail about police brutality Sunday at
Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks to reporters at a sidewalk press conference in
Manhattan, following a meeting she held privately with the founders
of a gun control advocacy group, appeared calculated to convey a
more critical stance on police brutality than that taken by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her probable opponent in the race for the U.S.
States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I say it won't happen again?'' the mayor said on
Thursday in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting. He added:
``When we cure drug dealing, significant violent crime, then this
won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that she was an enthusiastic supporter of
the gun control advocacy group called Pax, which was founded two
years ago, after a shooting atop the Empire State Building left one
man dead and six other people injured. Matthew Gross, who was
injured in the shooting, and his brother, Daniel, are among Pax's
founders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the group for its campaign urging adults to ask
their neighbors, and children to ask their parents, if they own
guns, as the first step in keeping them out of the hands of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the same message to elementary school students in
Rockland County on Wednesday, and Daniel Gross said after Friday's
meeting that she had offered her own services, as well as those of
President Clinton, in making public service announcements to
advance the Pax campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also responded briefly to what turned out to be a
short-lived public relations flare-up for Police Commissioner
Howard Safir, who was quoted in Friday's Newsday as referring to
the ``murder'' of Amadou Diallo. However, a police recording of his
comments, made available Friday. showed that he said ``verdict,''
not ``murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton was roundly criticized when she referred to
the ``murder of Amadou Diallo'' at a Martin Luther King's birthday
celebration, long before the four police officers were acquitted in
his death. Whether she was aware of the corrected record was
unclear, but Clinton said Friday that the incident ``just goes to
show how any of us can make a misstatement.''

THE AD CAMPAIGN: USING BREAST CANCER AS AN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to damage Sen. John McCain's support among women, Gov.
George W. Bush's campaign portrays McCain as hostile to breast
cancer programs in a radio advertisement being run in New York.
Prominent Republicans in New York, including Gov. George Pataki,
have often tried to offset the party's traditional disadvantage
with women by highlighting their advocacy of breast cancer
programs. Pataki, who is spearheading the Bush campaign in the
state, is now turning to an ally active in breast cancer groups and
Republican politics, Geri Barish of Nassau County, N.Y., to help
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Hi. My name is Geri Barish, and I'm a breast
cancer survivor. For the last 20 years, I have worked hard to find
a cure for breast cancer and to make sure those of us with this
deadly disease are treated with dignity and respect. Like many, I
had thought of supporting John McCain in next week's presidential
primary. So I looked into his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I discovered was shocking. John McCain opposes many
projects dedicated to women's health issues. It's true. McCain
opposes funding for vital breast cancer programs right here in New
York. He opposes funding for the North Shore Long Island Jewish
breast cancer program and wants to cut funding for NYU's program in
women's cancer. McCain is even against funding for breast cancer
mapping. That's right, John McCain even opposes funding for breast
cancer mapping, essential to breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain calls these projects, just `garden-variety pork.'
That's shocking. America deserves better. Next Tuesday, John McCain
won't have my vote. We deserve a candidate with a record on women's
issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``Paid for by Bush for President.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The advertisement relies on a classic political
strategy: highlight a few votes and use them to paint a broad-brush
picture of an opponent. McCain did oppose these programs, which
were included in more than $13 billion of what he characterized as
pork-barrel spending requested by lawmakers this year. He also
opposed all the other projects in the measure. He says his quarrel
is not with the programs' merits, but with the way they were
approved with little or no public scrutiny. The McCain campaign
produced a list of numerous bills related to cancer research and
women's health that he had supported. The Bush campaign countered
that no matter how these breast cancer projects made their way
through Congress, they were worthy, and that McCain should be held
accountable for opposing them.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: By using a sympathetic surrogate who never mentions
Bush by name, the advertisement is intended to yield the benefits
of a more harshly worded attack on McCain, without causing a
backlash. Women, who tend to be more moderate than men, and thus
might favor McCain, might recoil at Barish's suggestion that McCain
is a cold-hearted budget-cutter. McCain has labeled the
advertisement an example of dirty-tricks politics, hoping to stoke
anger at Bush's tactics. Whether that will work will depend on how
successful he is at explaining to voters that in crusading against
pork-barrel projects, he is fighting to change Washington.

</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC VOTE INFLATION
</P>
<P>
   The share of the Hispanic vote that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
received in his 1998 re-election campaign seems to be creeping
upward. In Thursday's debate with Sen. John McCain, Bush said he
had received ``over 50 percent of the Hispanic vote.'' The William
C. Velasquez Institute in San Antonio says the actual figure is 39
percent. ``He's inflating it a little, but the important point is
that he did very well for a Republican among Hispanic voters,''
said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION AND TAXES
</P>
<P>
   California voters will have to reconcile their desire for
education reform with their longstanding antipathy to property
taxes. While education has been ranked in some polls as the most
important issue to voters this season, the Proposition 13 ballot
measure that rolled back property taxes and reduced education
financing in 1978 has long been regarded as politically
untouchable. But on Tuesday, voters will be asked to support
Proposition 26, which would reduce the approval threshold to pass
school bond measures to a simple majority of the vote from
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS ON BLACK VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Worried about overconfidence, the Maryland Democratic
establishment is putting a homestretch effort into the Super
Tuesday primary race in the face of polls showing Vice President Al
Gore with a 2-to-1 lead over Bill Bradley. The party's state
leadership, headed by Gov. Paris N. Glendening, is focusing on a
weekend drive to get out the vote among blacks in Prince George's
County. Glendening intends to capitalize on a Gore lead measured
among blacks in the latest Mason-Dixon poll as 69 percent to
Bradley's 12 percent. Statewide, the Gore lead is 59 percent to 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   DEATH WATCH
</P>
<P>
   With 453 inmates on death row in Texas, campaigns for three
judgeships on the state's Court of Criminal Appeals might be
expected to be among the hottest contests on March 14, in part
because Texas has received increased scrutiny during Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential bid. But political analysts predict that the
judges will be elected by only 4 percent to 5 percent of the
voters. One candidate, Sally L. Ray, is married to a judge on the
court, and told The San Antonio Express News that she hopes to win
because she has ``a short name and an inoffensive name, which we
all know makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY HOPES DIM
</P>
<P>
   Chances that South Carolina would join the rest of the country
in enacting a state holiday on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday dimmed this week. On Thursday, Republican
legislators added a provision to the holiday bill that would
require the state to declare the Confederate flag a symbol of
heritage, not of racism. A bill to enact the holiday had passed the
state Senate; Democrats accused Republicans in the House of adding
the unrelated flag section to kill the holiday.

<P>
   Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian institution
in South Carolina under fire for its ban on interracial dating
among students and its leaders' criticism of Roman Catholic
beliefs, responded with a full-page advertisement Friday in USA
Today. ``We are not racists in any shape, form or fashion,'' the
advertisement said. ``We do not hold one race over another.'' It
also said no one at Bob Jones, neither staff members nor students,
hated Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   A PROMISE KEPT
</P>
<P>
   One of Gov. Jeb Bush's electoral promises has come about: the
crime rate dropped in Florida last year, and by a record 10.8
percent. Bush attributed the decline to a toughening of Florida's
crime laws, prison construction and an end to early release
programs for violent criminals. The drop was the most drastic since
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began collecting crime
data in 1971.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ On paper, New England ought to be George W.
Bush country. Not only does he have roots here _ his father was
raised in Greenwich, Conn., and his family has a home in Maine _
but he also enjoys broad support from New England's Republican
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are
supporting Bush. In stark contrast, his chief rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain, has no
state-level official supporting him in Connecticut, and only a
scattering of relatively obscure state legislators, former
congressmen and retired military veterans working for him in all of
New England. In Maine, for instance, McCain's state campaign
chairman is a retired Marine from Dresden who coaches college
softball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that McCain has a good chance of winning all five
New England primaries on Tuesday, and their 102 collective
delegates, as many as are at stake in New York on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where McCain was trailing Bush last September
by 30 points, he now leads by more than 20. In Rhode Island, where
the GOP is weak and more than half of all voters are independents,
he is also leading by more than 20 points. In Vermont, McCain's
campaign chairman bragged this week that victory was a foregone
conclusion. Many experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain will sweep New England,'' said Darrell West, a
political science professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
``This is a segment that has a tradition of going for mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that tradition works in McCain's favor _ polls
indicate Bush has a good shot only in Connecticut and Maine _ it
may not be enough. Bush is strong in California and Georgia, with
216 delegates, and the races in Ohio and New York, with a total of
168 delegates are tight.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that before Friday, neither Bush nor McCain
had set foot in New England since Feb. 1, the day of McCain won the
New Hampshire primary by 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, the region's five states simply do not add
up to much Tuesday, said Jay Malcynsky, Bush's Connecticut campaign
manager. ``They don't have the number of delegates to deliver to
one candidate or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain is able to win most or all of New England, the rest
of the races, particularly California, New York and Ohio, will pull
him through,'' he said of Bush. But he conceded, ``It's been a
battle for Bush in New England since New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other region in the country, the
five-state New England region, from Connecticut up to Maine, offers
McCain a tailor-made, fiercely independent moderate voters whose
counterparts delivered McCain primary victories in New Hampshire
and Michigan. In every state in this region except New Hampshire,
independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats, and only in
Connecticut are non-Republican voters banned from crossing over to
vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 in Massachusetts have switched registration in
time for Tuesday's primary, mostly Democrats to independents, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such momentum does not seem to have waned after McCain's triple
primary defeat last week in Virginia, Washington and North Dakota,
said Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those elections were in different parts of the country, and I
don't see them slowing him down in Connecticut,'' McLean said in an
interview this week. ``I'm not sure anyone even paid attention in
Connecticut. People I talked to, they were asking me who won in
those states.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken in Connecticut, by Quinnipiac College taken after
McCain's resounding win in New Hampshire but before Bush's win in
South Carolina, showed McCain ahead, 52 percent to 39 percent. But
a Zogby poll of 361 likely voters released Friday showed Bush
ahead, 45 percent to 42 percent, with a five point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be competitive here,'' Malcynsky said on
Wednesday. But McCain _ who has no state-level elected official
openly backing him here _ still seems to have a grip on
Connecticut's electoral imagination. In Cheshire, Conn, an affluent
town southwest of Hartford, several Republicans interviewed Friday
said they will vote for McCain Tuesday, mostly because of their
perceptions about his character and willingness to shake up
Washington's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want George Bush's son in office; I've had enough of
Bush,'' said Sue Paulik, 59, who works in a Cheshire drug store.
``I think his policies would follow Reagan and what happened under
his father. The economy really suffered under his father.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. John Rowland, Bush's foremost Connecticut booster, has
had a distinctly less zealous outlook on winning Connecticut, whose
25 delegates are second in New England to the 37 of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The cooling down became notable 10 days ago, after Rowland
criticized Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, a South Carolina
college that espouses anti-Catholic views, as ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's chances Friday, Rowland, who is Catholic,
said, ``Governor Bush as a candidate is back on the offensive, back
on message,'' and he criticized McCain for taking ``inappropriate
advantage'' of Bush's Bob Jones debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not predict victory.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush cannot win here, Maine may be his only other reasonable
hope in New England, though Gov. Angus King, a popular independent,
has endorsed no one. Primary rules that allow same-day crossover
voting also seem to bode well for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's staple issue of taxes will make him competitive, said
his volunteer state chairman, Ross J. Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine hasn't benefited from the boom the way the rest of the
country has, so, the issue of taxation will play much better here
in Maine,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way New England voters go on Tuesday, they will do so
largely without the benefit of having a chance to see either Bush
or McCain in person. Both men are far more compelled by their
battle over New York's 101 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday afternoon, McCain diverted his New York campaign
briefly to deliver a speech at Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield, Conn. Bush's wife, Laura Bush, has stumped for her
husband in the state. On Saturday, Bush is expected to speak at a
rally at Bradley International Airport, north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the take for both men in New England, experts and even
devout McCain supporters say they believe McCain's candidacy may
decline rapidly after Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's cool, fresh,'' said Denny Maisano, 47, a
banking consultant from Cheshire who plans to vote for McCain. But
``I don't think he has a broad enough appeal or enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   West, the Brown political science professor went a step further,
predicting that after a loss in California Tuesday, ``the media
begins to turn against him, McCain's money dries up and he's forced
out the race.''

JAILED DRIFTER SAYS HE KILLED FAMILY OF FOUR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editors: Joeann is cq 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rail-riding drifter jailed in Del Rio has confessed to the
1987 killing of an Illinois family, including an infant girl born
during the attack, officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking, but at least this guy is behind bars,'' said
Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lynn Sells, a 35-year-old carnival worker, confessed
Thursday to Illinois State Police and Jefferson County, Ill.,
sheriff's detectives about the slaying of an Illinois man, his
wife, their 3-year-old son, and newborn daughter, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sells has confessed to 13 killings in seven states and
has been charged with murder in two separate attacks on young girls
in Del Rio and Kentucky. Investigators from across the nation have
interviewed him in the Val Verde County Jail, where he is awaiting
trial for the New Year's Eve killing of Kaylene Harris, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sells is accused of slipping through a window and slashing the
throats of Harris and 10-year-old Krystal Surles as the girls slept
in a mobile home outside Del Rio. Surles survived the attack and
her description of Sells led to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Sells is charged with slashing the throat of a
13-year-old girl and leaving her body near railroad tracks. Sells
also has confessed to and is a suspect in killings in California,
Arkansas, Arizona and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   As Sell's jailhouse confessions have tumbled out, high-ranking
Texas law officials have cautioned Texas Rangers investigating the
case to be wary of another public relations fiasco such as the one
caused by Henry Lee Lucas, a drifter who in 1983 falsely confessed
to hundreds of murders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   During an exchange at a January meeting of the Public Safety
Commission, Chairman James B. Francis Jr. warned Senior Ranger
Capt. Bruce Casteel to avoid another ``Lucas deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Bruce, let's be very careful. Let's pin him down
specifically. Let's don't get carried away and tag him with every
murder and unsolved mystery,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're establishing a timeline,'' Casteel replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I'm talking about. We're not going through a
Lucas deal again,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Frances added, ``It's up to you not to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks Sells will be transported to Arkansas for
interviews about two separate killings there in 1981, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the specific details Sells has provided, Texas
Rangers are convinced the drifter has told the truth so far, Vinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows things, little details about the crime scene, that
only the killer would know,'' said Vinger.
</P>
<P>
   Sells is a California native who has been on the streets since
age 13. He has been described by Texas Rangers as an ex-convict
with drinking and drug problems who is is prone to extremely
violent outbursts. He came to Del Rio about two years ago with a
carnival and married a woman there. He took a job selling used
cars, authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   A spiritual awakening prompted Sells to confess to his crimes,
Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy claims he found religion, and the reason why he
started confessing is ... so he can provide closure for as many
family members of the victims as he can,'' said Vinger. ``That's
what he claims, but who knows what's going on in this guy's head.''

<P>
   Police in Illinois were baffled by the Nov. 1987 slaying of
Russell Keith Dardeen, a 29-year-old water treatment worker, his
wife Ruby Elaine Dardeen, 31, and their 3-year-old son Peter. After
following more than 1,000 leads, they had no strong motive for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Dardeen was seven months pregnant at the time. She was
found in the couple's mobile home in Ina, Ill., which is 90 miles
east of St. Louis, bound, gagged and savagely beaten with a
baseball bat. The couple's son also was severely beaten as was the
infant daughter born during the attack, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Dardeen's body was found the next night by hunters in a
farm field. He had been shot in the head three times and his body
had been mutilated with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very horrendous crime of a nature that has never been
seen in this area before,'' said Jefferson County Sheriff's
Detective John Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Joeann Dardeen, Keith Dardeen's 62-year-old mother who lives in
Mount Carmel, Ill., said Sell's confession may bring an end to the
tormenting and fearful years she and her daughter have spent since
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a fear because the police thought it was
somebody Keith knew and maybe I knew him. So there was that fear we
could be entertaining this person and not know it,'' she said.
``All these years, we know they have questioned many, many suspects
but they never came up with anything that looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   Joeann Dardeen has kept in contact with the police all this time
expressing hope that the mystery would someday be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't describe,'' she said. ``People have
said you need to get on with your life and forget it but you can't
forget about your only son.''

SECOND MURDER TRIAL OPENS IN SUBWAY SHOVING CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The second murder trial of a schizophrenic man who
threw a woman to her death in front of a subway train began Friday,
as his lawyer promised to try to show jurors the depths of his
illness when he is not taking medication.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Andrew Goldstein, 30, has admitted pushing the woman,
Kendra Webdale, 32, to her death on Jan. 3, 1999, but he has
maintained that he was not responsible because of his
schizophrenia. He did not testify during his first trial in State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, which ended in November in a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, outside the courtroom, Goldstein's lawyer said he
hoped to have Goldstein stop his medication and take the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Kevin Canfield, said that jurors should be able to
see Goldstein's condition when he is not taking anti-psychotic
medication, since he was not taking the medicine when he pushed
Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Goldstein, who lawyers say agrees with the
strategy, stopped taking the drug Risperdol on Feb. 12. But two
weeks later Goldstein punched the court social worker monitoring
his care. After that, Justice Carol Berkman ordered that Goldstein
be offered his medication twice a day, and he has been taking the
drugs regularly since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Friday, Canfield argued that the subway
attack was one in a series of psychotic episodes over 10 years in
which Goldstein abruptly punched, kicked or shoved people. But
William Greenbaum, the lead prosecutor, said Goldstein was using
his illness as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, Canfield outlined a detailed history
of Goldstein's journey in and out of the state's mental health
system, highlighting how Goldstein had been rejected by his mother,
discharged from hospitals and banned from a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``His own family abandoned him, and that was just the beginning
of his slide,'' Canfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield said Goldstein believed aliens were sucking oxygen from
the Earth, his mother was poisoning his food, someone inhabiting
his body was removing his brain, and others were controlling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the act of a cold-blooded, depraved killer,''
Canfield said. ``He didn't know it was wrong if he didn't know what
he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenbaum said he would prove that Goldstein knew what he
was doing, knew it was wrong and was using his mental illness to
shield himself from the consequences of his actions. Immediately
after he killed Webdale, Greenbaum said, Goldstein claimed he was
psychotic and used ``his insanity as a tool to insulate him from
the consequences of his actions right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Greenbaum called to the stand a woman who was
standing near Webdale and saw the attack. Dawn Lorenzino, who also
testified at the first trial, said Goldstein shuffled oddly back
and forth on the platform of the 23rd Street Station of the N line.
She said he later stood behind Webdale, asked what time it was and
moved to the wall of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the train entered the station, what did you see?''
Greenbaum asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him push off the wall, and he threw her in front of the
train,'' Lorenzino said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second row of courtroom spectators, a tear rolled down
the cheek of Webdale's mother, Patricia. At the defense table,
Goldstein tugged at his lip with his hand.

DOMINIC BRUCE, 84, BRITON WHO ESCAPED NAZIS 17 TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominic Bruce, a British bomber pilot who made no fewer than 17
attempts in four years to escape from his German captors at the
famous Colditz prison, died on Feb. 12 in England. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his determination and ingenuity, Bruce was recaptured
every time he broke free from Colditz Castle, near Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest he ever made it was to Danzig, 400 miles away. He
had jumped aboard trains and had stolen bicycles left outside
churches while their owners were at worship. That time he was
finally caught while trying to stow away on a Swedish freighter.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next eight months in solitary confinement, but the
experience did little to curb his audacity.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his several escapes, he left a smirking note on the
windowsill over which he departed spelling out in German the
message: ``The air in Colditz no longer pleases me. Auf
wiedersehen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying because it was fun,'' he said after the war.
``It gave you a feeling like hitting the jackpot. And, most
importantly of all, I knew it got up the Germans' noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was repatriated in 1945 when Colditz was liberated. He was
awarded the British Military Cross for his escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce then studied history at Oxford and eventually became
principal of Kingston upon Thames College of Further Education in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 7, 1915, Bruce joined the Royal Air Force in 1935
and became a pilot. In 1941 his Wellington bomber was shot down
over Zeebrugge, the North Sea port, by German fighters. He bailed
out and was picked up by a German vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in the German POW camp at Spangenberg, he wrote to his
wife asking for an unusual and carefully specified piece of
clothing. She followed his instructions minutely, and when the
garment arrived it turned out to be a blazer that could be adapted
to look like a German uniform. He used it in an unsuccessful
attempt to hijack a German aircraft and was sent to Colditz.
</P>
<P>
   That was only the first of his many attempts. On other
occasions, he climbed down a 40-foot wall with knotted bedsheets,
crawled through a sewer, hid in a tea chest and tried to walk out
of a POW camp dressed as a Swiss doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce is survived by his wife, six sons and three daughters.

BIG 'CAP MAY COME DOWN TO HORSE SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ It's a $1 million clash of personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Handicap favorites, Budroyale, General Challenge
and Cat Thief, are well-matched according to recent results, and
Malek, Puerto Madero and Dixie Dot Com have run races that would be
good enough to win this one.
</P>
<P>
   So, what will decide this unusually contentious edition of the
1-mile Big 'Cap today? Possibly the qualities that don't show up on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to maturity, intelligence and determination, the
differences in this field of eight horses are as great as you'll
ever see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say Bud has as big a heart as any horse I've seen
in a long time,'' said Bill Morey, trainer of Dixie Dot Com,
speaking affectionately of Budroyale, the 7-year-old gelding who
will try to be the first ex-claimer to win the Big 'Cap since the
great John Henry in 1981-82.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the Santa Anita Derby and Strub Stakes
winner, ``is a big goof,'' said his trainer, Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, the Breeders' Cup Classic upsetter, ``wimped on me,''
said jockey Pat Day, when he lost close decisions in several big
3-year-old races in 1999 and established his reputation for
chicken-heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   Malek, the 1998 Big 'Cap winner, is a consistent ``trier,'' said
his trainer, Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandella's other Big 'Cap entrant, Puerto Madero, has
appeared so uninterested in four races since briefly reigning as
the nation's top older horse in 1999, the trainer fears the
6-year-old has ``gone senile.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella has made changes in Puerto Madero's training and
switched jockeys from Kent Desormeaux to Laffit Pincay, the
five-time winner who'll ride his first Big 'Cap horse since 1996.
Mandella understands if handicappers are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' he said of the lackadaisical half of his
Chile-bred odd couple. ``He wants to go to the breeding shed
instead of the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes horses so different?
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing that makes people different,'' Mandella said.
``You've got murderers, you've got thieves, you've got Boy Scouts,
you've got choirboys. ... Believe it or not, the most important
thing in getting them into a race is calming them down. The Puerto
Madero thing is a rare case.''
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale is a rare case too. He has won the last four times he
has finished in a photo, and he has held off his challengers the
last 10 times he held the lead in midstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budroyale, he's tough, and if you make a mistake, he's going
to beat you,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert-trained General Challenge is the opposite, a
still-immature 4-year-old who wilts at the slightest adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think General Challenge is the most impressive horse
in the morning (workouts) I've ever seen,'' said Ted H. West,
trainer of Budroyale. ``But I don't think he knows what his job is.
He's a free-running horse who doesn't know he's in a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do so much as a trainer. A lot of that is the
intelligence of the horse. You're not going to convert a General
Challenge into a Budroyale.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and jockey Corey Nakatani are 9-5 on the
morning line, Budroyale and Garrett Gomez second at 5-2. If they're
that close coming down the stretch, Budroyale will become the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 63rd running of the Big 'Cap, born in the Depression
with the then-astonishing purse of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first in which horses will wear the so-called nasal
strips, breathing aids that became legal in California racing on
Wednesday. The trainers of every Big 'Cap entrant except General
Challenge and Bagshot have chosen to use the adhesive strips. Cat
Thief won the Breeders' Cup Classic at 19-1 the only other time any
of these horses wore one.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella, like many horsemen, wonders if the strips have any
effect. He mused that ``if they do make a difference, we'll be
breeding a bunch of horses who've got to have nasal strips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be a little corny, but I think it's a shame to see those
funny-looking things on their noses,'' Mandella said, just as Malek
walked by, a black strip obscuring his white blaze. ``Look at that
beautiful face he's got _ isn't that a shame?
</P>
<P>
   ``But for a million-dollar race, I'll be damned if I'm going to
hold back (and not use the strips).''
</P>
<P>
   It's a clash of personalities, not a beauty contest.

<P>
   Lyndon K. Allin, who worked in the White House under three
Republican presidents, died on Monday in a hospital in Washington.
He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said his daughter,
Stephanie Allin Clemson of Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Allin went to Washington in 1967 as the national director of
Youth for Nixon. After the 1968 election, he served on President
Nixon's staff, where he was a special assistant to the president.
He continued in that capacity under President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1981, Allin served in the information agency as the
assistant information officer at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the White House in 1981 as a member of Ronald
Reagan's staff and served in the White House press office as the
deputy press secretary for foreign affairs and national security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he returned to the information agency and became the
press and cultural counselor at the U.S. consulate in Leningrad. He
retired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon King Allin was born in Detroit on Feb. 7, 1941, and
graduated from the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; a
son, Lyndon King II, of Washington; his mother, Ruth Emory Allin of
Minneapolis; a sister, Nancy Allin Nelson of St. Paul; and a
brother, Robin Nail Allin of Hoffman Estates, Ill.

ability to risk destroying the plane in order to save it. Both

why their particular design is superior. (Boeing, Airbus/The New

SANDRA SCHMIRLER, 36, OLYMPIC CURLING CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (js) 
 By KATHLEEN McELROY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra Schmirler, the star of the first women's curling team to
win an Olympic gold medal and one of Canada's most popular
athletes, died Thursday in Regina, Saskatchewan. She was 36.
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler died of cancer, the Canadian Curling Association said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Schmirler the Curler, Schmirler starred in a sport that
is one of Canada's passions, especially with families in the
western provinces. One newspaper called her the public face of a
Canadian sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you played her, you were in awe,'' Colleen Jones, a
two-time Canadian champion, told The Globe and Mail of Toronto.
``You knew she was better. You knew she was going to beat you. It
was like playing against Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   All curlers, men and women, recognized her focus and skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the best players, probably the best player
ever,'' said Russ Howard of New Brunswick. ``She raised the level
of curling. It's unbelievable what she did.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curlers slide round granite stones down a 146-foot-long,
15-foot-7-and-a- half-inch-wide sheet of ice into a 12-foot circle
known as the house, while two sweepers with straw or synthetic
brooms help steer the stone.
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler, who was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan, on June 11,
1963, was introduced to curling when she was 12. By high school,
she had won provincial prep titles in curling while also starring
in badminton and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Regina, Schmirler was
asked to join a local team. Later, she joined forces with Jan
Betker, Joan McCusker and Marcia Gudereit, forming a foursome of
friends, working mothers and Olympic gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Caledonian Curling Club, with Schmirler as the skip, or
captain, won the provincial title its first season together,
1990-91. The women then won the Canadian and world titles in 1993,
1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler was six months pregnant when she won the world title
in 1996 and was on maternity leave from her job with a recreation
center when the team went to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have success and you're having fun, it just snowballs
and gets bigger and bigger,'' Schmirler said of the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler's group won the 1998 gold medal by defeating Denmark
in Nagano, the first Olympics to make curling an official medal
sport. The first athletes from Regina to win an Olympic gold medal
became national heroines.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Anne Letheren, chief executive officer of the Canadian
Olympic Association, said Schmirler ``was a Canadian with whom
other Canadians could identify.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler's team was voted the Canadian Press team of the year
for 1998, and she was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of
Fame last March.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Schmirler gave birth to her second child last
summer, following a difficult pregnancy, doctors discovered a
malignant tumor in her chest cavity. During surgery last September
to remove blood clots, she nearly died on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were not able to pinpoint the source of the cancer as
she underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other forms of
alternative treatment.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the country rallied to support her and help pay
for her medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was that good until I started reading all the
cards and letters and faxes and e-mails,'' said Schmirler, who died
in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of
Sandra Schmirler,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said in
a statement. ``Most of us came to know her through her exploits as
a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada.
But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality
and her incredible zest for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler is survived by her husband, Shannon England; their
daughters, Sara and Jenna; her mother, Shirley; and two sisters,
Carol and Beverley.

ability to risk destroying the plane in order to save it. Both

why their particular design is superior. (Boeing, Airbus/The New

<HEADLINE>
SUTTON, COWBOYS PLAY FINAL GAME IN ANCIENT ARENA TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 ARENA-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Sutton remembers the first time he walked into
Gallagher-Iba Arena as a youngster out of Bucklin, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' Sutton recalled. ``At that time, it
still was considered one of the showcases for college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in that spring of 1954, Sutton had no idea that he
would play in some of the most memorable games in the storied
arena, that was built for the staggering sum of $400,000 in 1938..
Or, that he would someday return as the Cowboys' coach and send one
of his teams onto the inch-and-a-half-thick maple floor to play the
last game in the facility, almost a half-century later.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of weeks after today's Bedlam battle between the
Cowboys and Oklahoma, workmen will literally raise the roof and
knock down the walls and begin the next phase in a $54 million
expansion, that will transform one of the last relics of a bygone
era into a 13,000-seat comprehensive athletic facility that will
catapult the program into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Only the floor _ which will make the transition if it isn't
damaged _ and the memories will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many memories,'' said Sutton, whose experience in the
facility spans four seasons as a player and eight as the Cowboys'
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when we beat Cincinnati when theyhad Oscar
Robertson, beating Kansas when they had Wilt Chamberlain \Rboth in
1957\S _ and those are two pretty good memories. The shot that
Bryant Reeves hit from half-court to send the game into overtime
against Missouri \R1993\S, a game we eventually won. But the one
thing I'll always remember is that when this place is rocking, no
place in college basketball is louder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the loudest moment in Gallagher-Iba might have come
in 1978 when a delirious capacity crowd raised such a
ruckuscheering the outcome of a match that clinched the Big Eight
wrestling championship that light bulbs burst and glass rained down
from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The building was originally named the 4-H Club Building and
Student Activity Center, before being changed to Gallagher Hall to
honor legendary wrestling coach Ed Gallagher. After a 1987
remodeling, the last name of a more-famous legend _ basketball
coach Henry Iba _ was added.
</P>
<P>
   The late Mr. Iba provided the impetus for building the new
facility, once called ``Hank's Folly'' before being transformed
into ``Hank's House of Horrors.'' After coming to A&AMP;M from Colorado
in 1934, Mr. Iba soon began to field teams that were so successful
they rapidly outgrew a 2,500-seat bandbox home. In the new arena,
Mr. Iba established one of college basketball's endearing
dynasties, winning consecutive national championships in 1945-46
behind the play of 7-foot center Bob Kurland _ whose 58 points
scored against St. Louis in '46 still stands as the facility's
all-time scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   OSU senior Desmond Mason made his recruiting visit to watch the
Cowboys play OU in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing that game, I knew I wanted to be in this
atmosphere,'' Mason said. ``It was the most incredible atmosphere
I've ever seen for a game. There is something magical about this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the new facility, when it opens in December, will no
doubt be as impressive as the old place was to Sutton and Mason, it
will not retain the historical charm nor the opposing team's sense
of being surrounded while being bombarded with the cacophonyof
6,000 fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a selfish standpoint, I like the cozy atmosphere,''
Sutton said. ``But the architects tell me that the \Rhome-court
advantage\S will still be quite good. So many other things the
university needed badly will be included, and we need the added
revenue. So this is something that had to be done. But it will
never be the same.'' nn

``He might not like what I've done,'' says Corigliano, 62. ``But if

unreasonable, given that Americans born since 1975 - the biggest
moviegoers - are the first modern generation for whom Westerns and
the cowboy mystique are not a thread in the weft of their daily

John Wayne, was considered a landmark western about an outsider.

the Vivian Beaumont Theater after a sold-out run at the Mitzi E.

challenge of the best way to mate man and machine led Europe's
Airbus Industrie, and the Boeing Company to adopt different
philosophies when they designed the cockpits of their latest
airplanes. Airbus places so-called hard limits on its pilots to
protect them from themselves. Boeing deliberately gives pilots the
ability to risk destroying the plane in order to save it. Both
companies are quick to say that both approaches are safe. But as
fierce international rivals fighting each other for every sale from
the world's airlines they are each equally quick to make the case
why their particular design is superior. (Boeing, Airbus/The New

CON ED SAYS CUSTOMERS WILL ABSORB COST CAUSED BY LEAK AT A-PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison, the owner of the nuclear power plant in
Buchanan, N.Y., that shut down after a radioactive leak last month,
said Friday that its customers would have to absorb the
$600,000-a-day added cost as it buys electricity from other
utilities while the plant is dormant.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came at a hearing convened by several state
Assembly committees in White Plains to examine the causes and
consequences of the Feb. 15 leak at the Indian Point 2 plant, which
brought the reactor to the second of four ascending levels of
emergency, caused a regional alert and raised the ire of some
elected officials who were not immediately notified.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leonard, a Con Edison spokesman, said the temporary rate
increase would raise the $51 monthly bill for the typical homeowner
by about $2, and would be reflected in bills beginning in April.
The plant is expected to be shut for at least several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, the company also provided new details about the
troubled history of the steam generator that was the source of the
leak that sent a puff of steam and gas escaping from the plant _
and possibly a minute amount of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison is one of many utilities that sued Westinghouse, the
manufacturer of the plant's four steam generators, over what they
contended were flawed operating instructions that caused the
generators to wear out prematurely. In a settlement of the suit,
the utility received four replacement generators in 1987 but never
installed them.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the
Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and a Westchester
County Democrat, said it appeared that Con Edison, in delaying
installation of the equipment, had put business decisions before
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the live possibility that this accident was
inevitable and foreseeable,'' Brodsky said. ``They've been driving
a '75 Chevy and claiming if you just kept it up right it'd last
forever. And it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Michael Evans, the president and chief operating
officer of Con Edison, said the company had always made decisions
at the plant based first on safety, with any other factors
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison sees no reason, he said, even with the leak last
month, to replace the generators immediately. He added that the
work would take up to two years and cost at least $100 million, not
including the price of replacement energy.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Brodsky's comments, Leonard said that there had
never been any danger to the public or employees and that the
utility had abided by federal regulations. ``This is a typical
government response,'' he said. ``Pass a resolution, have a
hearing, moan and move on.''

IN LAWSUIT, JUDGE BARS COUNTY INMATE FROM HAVING ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court justice in Watertown, N.Y., issued a
temporary order this week barring a jail inmate from having an
abortion until a court hearing on whether county corrections
officials should pay for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union, which represents the woman,
has said it would contest the order in the hearing, scheduled for
Monday. The lawyers said corrections officials have a
responsibility to pay for abortions because they are part of
inmates' medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a flagrant violation of constitutional principles,''
said Donna Lieberman, director of the reproductive rights project
of the civil liberties union. ``There is an overwhelming lack of
legal basis for the temporary restraining order.''
</P>
<P>
   In an order issued Wednesday, Justice Hugh A. Gilbert of state
Supreme Court barred the Jefferson County sheriff from allowing the
woman to undergo an abortion while in custody until a court hearing
could be held. The order also generally barred the woman, Barbara
Gaddy, from having the procedure until the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gaddy was released soon after the order was entered, she
has been in the unusual position of being forbidden to undergo the
medical procedure even though no longer in custody, her lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert issued the order in response to a lawsuit filed by an
area resident who sought to prevent the sheriff from spending
county funds for the abortion. The plaintiff, Karen Jackson, argued
in her legal filing that an abortion is an elective medical
procedure and is not an appropriate expense for the sheriff's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no medical necessity, so why should the county pay
for it?'' asked John J. Broderick, the plaintiff's lawyer.
Broderick, who described his client as a ``very active pro-lifer,''
said he has represented anti-abortion campaigners in court for
about 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick said he based his legal argument on a state law that
bars officials from unreasonable or unnecessary spending. He said
the county does not pay for elective procedures, like cosmetic
surgery, for inmates, and should not pay for Gaddy's abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not have the right to have county funds pay for it,''
Broderick said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddy was released from county jail late Wednesday afternoon.
Her lawyer, Krista Chacona, said she spent 30 days in jail after
being charged with drug possession and sale. She has not been tried
on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Chacona said that since her client's release, she ``has not
acted in violation of the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gaddy has been released from county jail, Broderick said
he would not contest the removal of the temporary restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for the county to pay for it if she is
out,'' he said. ``There is not going to be a decision here on the
merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, of the civil liberties union, said a federal court
decision has determined that corrections officials generally must
pay for inmates' abortions. In a case filed by an inmate in
Monmouth County, N.J., the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
in 1987 that corrections officials must pay for inmates' abortions,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter for a corrections department to decide
whether or not an abortion is an elective procedure,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Melling, the associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project, said inmates'
ability to obtain abortions is an ``issue that arises on a very
regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Melling said her organization has been successful representing
inmates denied the procedure, although she said there are no
nationwide rules. Typically, she said, inmates rely on
constitutional grounds. The courts have held that the government
cannot set up a restriction that places a substantial obstacle in
the path of a woman who is seeking an abortion, she said.

INTERRACIAL DATING BAN TO END AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `p') 
(js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In an unexpected move, Bob Jones University,
a fundamentalist Christian institution that had come under national
criticism for a ban on interracial dating among its students,
dropped that long-held policy Friday, its president, Bob Jones III
announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in an appearance on the CNN program ``Larry King Live,''
said that he had asked the university's board Friday afternoon to
end the policy, which the university had tenaciously held for
years. ``As of today, right now, we're dropping it,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Jones, grandson of the university's founder,
provided only a brief explanation for the decision, saying that it
was based on a perception that widespread controversy over the
policy was threatening to obscure the university's Christian
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also came only days after Democrats in Congress had
proposed a resolution to condemn the university for the ban and for
statements its leaders have made about Roman Catholicism, which
have been widely interpreted as attacks on Catholics in general.
The university has denied having any such intent.
</P>
<P>
   This issue of the university's positions came to the fore last
month after the visit on Feb. 2 by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Bush's
opponents, Republicans and Democrats alike, faulted him for not
taking the opportunity to speak out against the dating ban and the
statements on the Roman Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night after Jones' announcement, Bush said: ``I'm
heartened to hear that Bob Jones University has reversed its ban on
interracial dating. It was wrong to begin with and that's why I
spoke out against the ban when I was asked about it at a news
conference immediately after my visit there. Tonight, the school
has done the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the university's president amounted to a
remarkable turnaround for the 73-year-old institution that hews to
an unapologetic adherence to classic Protestant fundamentalism.
After a 13-year legal fight, the university lost its tax exemption
over the issue in 1983. As late as Wednesday, the university was
attempting to explain the ban on interracial dating according to
its belief that the Bible teaches that God does not want a unified
and undifferentiated world.

   THE GOOD:
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga continued his recovery from lymphoma with two
hits to drive in a pair of runs. George Lombard, who hit 11 home
runs in the Arizona Fall League to tie the league record, continued
his power surge with a three-run shot. He took Chris Fussell deep
off a sign over the wall in left-center field. Brian Jordan
continued his hot start after going 2-for-2 with a homer against
Georgia on Thursday. Jordan singled and then reached second on an
error off left fielder Johnny Damon on a ball he launched to deep
left field.
</P>
<P>
   THE BAD:
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard got picked off second base by Jay Witasick,
spoiling his leadoff hit. Hubbard had advanced into scoring
position on a good bunt by Kevin Millwood. ... With the bases
loaded in the fifth inning, Mark DeRosa grounded into a 6-4-3
double play to end the inning. ... The Royals committed three
errors, contributing to four Brave runs.
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT:
</P>
<P>
   Witasick put Millwood on his back with an eye-level pitch in his
first at bat of the spring. But Millwood was able to come back on
the next pitch and lay down the bunt.

   ATLANTA _ Ricky Rudd and Scott Pruett form an ironic tandem on
the front row for the Carsdirect.com 400 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who broke through to win the No. 1 starting position
Friday after beginning on the outside pole in the season's first
two races, is a first-year driver for Robert Yates Racing. Rudd was
an owner/driver last year on the circuit but opted to sell his
operation when Tide decided not to renew its sponsorship deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's loss was Pruett's gain. Tide signed a contract to become
a primary sponsor with the new Winston Cup team of Cal Wells and
PPI Motorsports. Pruett was chosen by Wells to operate the No. 32
Ford this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be a little strange (starting next to the
Tide car),'' Rudd said. ``I got some experience with that at
Daytona; I ran around Scott some (and) I saw him during the race. I
think since it's got that 32 on the door (instead of the No. 10
used by Rudd last year), it's not quite the same thing for me. But
it will be a little awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who was clocked at 172.563 mph, was one of seven drivers
to break the qualifying record at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
Friday. Pruett, who posted a speed of 172.381 mph, also felt irony
about having his car placed next to Rudd's No. 28 Ford for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I have to applaud Yates for getting the front row
again,'' said Pruett, noting Dale Jarrett's pole position for the
Daytona 500. ``Second, it is pretty ironic (being next to Rudd), no
question about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky and I are totally fine and he is the driver putting on
the rookie meetings every time we come into the event. So we
complained to him this morning that he didn't show us the right way
(at Rockingham), because three rookies didn't make the race and the
others crashed in the race. So he gave us better points for this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett being on the outside spot of the front row was
surprising, considering that the first-year driver failed to
qualify at Rockingham last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the back row to the front row, what a big change a week
makes,'' Pruett said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. was the other rookie turning heads on Friday.
He qualified for the third position, which will be his best start
in eight career Winston Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the notable drivers failing to qualify in the first
round included Bill Elliott, Dale Earnhardt, Ken Schrader, Ward
Burton and John Andretti. Second-round qualifying for positions
26-43 starts at 2:30 p.m. today.

INTERRACIAL DATING BAN TO END AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story has also moved in the a category.) &HT;    (js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In an unexpected move, Bob Jones University,
a fundamentalist Christian institution that had come under national
criticism for a ban on interracial dating among its students,
dropped that long-held policy Friday, its president, Bob Jones III
announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in an appearance on the CNN program ``Larry King Live,''
said that he had asked the university's board Friday afternoon to
end the policy, which the university had tenaciously held for
years. ``As of today, right now, we're dropping it,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Jones, grandson of the university's founder,
provided only a brief explanation for the decision, saying that it
was based on a perception that widespread controversy over the
policy was threatening to obscure the university's Christian
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also came only days after Democrats in Congress had
proposed a resolution to condemn the university for the ban and for
statements its leaders have made about Roman Catholicism, which
have been widely interpreted as attacks on Catholics in general.
The university has denied having any such intent.
</P>
<P>
   This issue of the university's positions came to the fore last
month after the visit on Feb. 2 by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Bush's
opponents, Republicans and Democrats alike, faulted him for not
taking the opportunity to speak out against the dating ban and the
statements on the Roman Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night after Jones' announcement, Bush said: ``I'm
heartened to hear that Bob Jones University has reversed its ban on
interracial dating. It was wrong to begin with and that's why I
spoke out against the ban when I was asked about it at a news
conference immediately after my visit there. Tonight, the school
has done the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the university's president amounted to a
remarkable turnaround for the 73-year-old institution that hews to
an unapologetic adherence to classic Protestant fundamentalism.
After a 13-year legal fight, the university lost its tax exemption
over the issue in 1983. As late as Wednesday, the university was
attempting to explain the ban on interracial dating according to
its belief that the Bible teaches that God does not want a unified
and undifferentiated world.

NEW STRATEGY AT PHILIP MORRIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, is battling
to rehabilitate its image as part of a pariah industry. After
decades of denials, Philip Morris publicly admitted last fall that
smoking is addictive and causes cancer and other fatal disease.
This week Steven Parrish, a senior vice president of Philip Morris,
said the company was willing to discuss some federal regulation of
tobacco. Parrish also expressed his belief, at a conference
sponsored by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse,
that nicotine is an addictive drug, although not a drug as defined
by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to be deeply skeptical of Philip Morris'
new stance. After all, the tobacco industry has long been
duplicitous while fighting to maintain its right to sell a
dangerous product. But that longstanding strategy may be crumbling
under the pressure of public denunciations and new legal threats
against the cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule this spring on whether the
Food and Drug Administration has regulatory authority over tobacco
under the existing federal act. Meanwhile, a Florida jury is
expected soon to decide punitive damages against the industry in a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of injured smokers.
Regardless of how either case is resolved, Philip Morris and other
tobacco companies will remain under intense political and
litigation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' shift may reflect a pragmatic judgment that it
will eventually have to accept some form of regulation and that
opening the door to negotiations now could produce a better outcome
for the company than total resistance. The company says it is
willing to work with federal regulators to define and develop a
``safer'' cigarette, remove harmful ingredients from cigarettes and
keep tobacco out of the hands of teen-agers, even if that means
fewer adults smoke in the future. But the company remains
deliberately vague about the kinds of regulations and enforcement
it will accept.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some things are changing. The company is no longer trying
to get immunity against civil lawsuits in exchange for regulation,
as was part of a 1997 proposed deal with the state attorneys
general. It is clearly worried that mounting public anger will lead
to tighter marketing restrictions, even for adults. Now that Philip
Morris is willing to talk, those concerned about the death toll
from smoking need to press Congress vigorously to give the FDA
unquestioned authority over tobacco.

RECORD-SIZED L.A. MARATHON MISSING BIG NAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the 15th running of the Los Angeles
Marathon, or as it's known in some parts, the Kenyan Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it might be if Kenya had actually sent its best
marathoners instead of its ``B'' team.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the depth of Kenya's long-distance runners - and the
continued overall weakness of the L.A. field - that its male
marathoners had 15 of the top 25 times in the world last year, not
one of them is here, and the first eight bib numbers in the Los
Angeles field still went to Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's Simon Bor is the returning champion, and probably the
favorite again in Sunday's race, but the defending women's
champion, Kirgistan's Irina Bogacheva, bowed out, as did most all
of the world's most accomplished marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   Not one person, male of female, who ran one of the top 25 times
in the world last year, will hit the L.A. streets at 8:40 a.m. on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon has been fading in international stature, but what
it is lacking in quality, it is trying to make up in numbers. L.A.
Marathon president William Burke may be unable to attract an
upper-echelon field, but he said he will have a record 22,500
attempting to complete the 26.2-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Marathon has always seemed more street-fest and an
avenue for local long-distance runners than a magnet for the
world's top runners, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Orr, the L.A. Marathon elite athlete coordinator, said
problems attracting the top runners this year has been compounded
by the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special year, being 2000 is an Olympic year,'' Orr
said. ``Some countries have trials, others a selection process, but
people are really focusing on Sydney (in August).
</P>
<P>
   ``It only comes along every four years and an athlete can only
be at optimum performance two or three times a year. They can't
just run an extra marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, world-record holder Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco will
highlight an impressive international field in London next month.
Moses Tanui, who ran the world's second-fastest time to Khannouchi
in Chicago last year, will run along with the other top Kenyans
next month at the Boston Marathon, which Kenya will use as its
Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to London and Boston, the L.A. Marathon also has to
compete at the international level against next month's marathons
in Paris and Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   And the prize money offered by L.A. has become dwarfed by some
of the larger events: L.A. offers $150,000; Chicago will offer
$450,000 this year. London has reportedly offered $2 million in
appearance fees alone this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be plenty of bodies cramming the closed downtown
streets, and marathon athlete commissioner and L.A. Roadrunners
coach Pat Connelly said it's not a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is special because it's the new millennium, and I
think that's a big reason we have so many people registered,''
Connelly said. ``People have said, `I'm starting a new century in
top shape.' What a great way to do it - run a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said of the 2,000 he has trained for Sunday's race, 995
will be running their first marathon.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be well back of Bor, who broke the 11-year-old course
record last year at 2:09:25. He figures to be challenged by fellow
Kenyans Peter Ndirangu, whose personal best of 2:08:46 matches
Bor's, and Elijah Korir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm familiar with the course this time, if the weather is
good, I can run a faster time,'' Bor said.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia's Jane Salumae, who has been training in San Diego the
past two months, has bib No.1 and is the only woman entered with a
time under 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is hoping for a break in the weather, but most runners
aren't concerned with a little moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it pours and you got a wind-chill factor, that's another
thing,'' Connelly said. ``But in L.A., that's rare. Really, a damp
day, overcast is complementary to runners. The first enemy for
running a marathon is sun.''

 BARON ENRICO di PORTANOVA, FLAMBOYANT MEMBER OF THE JET SET, DIES(ART ADV: A photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Baron Enrico di Portanova, one of the most flamboyant members of
the international jet set, who once listed the best things in life
as ``sun, sex and spaghetti,'' died on Monday at his home in
Houston. He also had homes in Rome and Acapulco, Mexico. The
baron's Italian passport gave his age as 66, although longtime
friends believed that he was perhaps older.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A grandson of Hugh Roy Cullen, the Texas oil magnate who was
known as the king of the wildcatters, di Portanova left Rome, where
he was in the jewelry business, in the early 1960s to claim his
inheritance in Houston. He originally received $5,000 a month from
the Cullen estate, but by the early 1980s the sum had increased to
$1.2 million a month, and his net worth was estimated at more than
$50 million.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest estate cases in U.S. history, the baron
and his younger brother, Ugo, filed suit against the Cullen family
in the early 1980s. The brothers claimed a bigger share of the
Cullen billions as well as damages for inadequate accounting. Roy
Cohn, the baron's lawyer, put the total figure at $2 billion. In
1984, a probate judge dismissed the suit as ``without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Portanova, who was born in Los Angeles and reared in Italy,
was known as Ricky to his thousands of friends in the world's
capitals and playgrounds. His mother, Lillie, was the daughter of
Hugh Roy Cullen, and his father was Baron Paolo di Portanova of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The baron's first marriage, to Ljuba Otanovic, a Yugoslav
basketball star, ended in divorce in 1972. The next year, in
London, he married Sandra Hovas of Houston. The baroness survives
him, as does his brother, Baron Ugo di Portanova of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A generous host who always reached for restaurant checks and
entertained lavishly, the baron once offered $13 million for a
share in the ``21'' Club, which he intended as a birthday present
for his wife. The deal was called off when it was announced that
the baroness planned to open a boutique on the second floor above
the dining room, a plan not in keeping with what the owners had in
mind for the club.
</P>
<P>
   When his plans for the birthday gift fell through, he had a
glass covering, with air-conditioning, erected over the garden of
the family residence in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The di Portanovas for years traveled on their own Lear jet,
which the baron referred to as his ``taxi.'' He told Charlotte
Curtis of The New York Times in 1984 that the couple had so much
luggage that it had to be sent on commercial airlines with the
servants.
</P>
<P>
   The di Portanova residence in Acapulco, a spectacular villa
named Arabesque, was at one time said to be the largest in
Acapulco. The house has 28 bedrooms, 26 baths, five kitchens (the
baron was proud of his culinary skills, specializing in caviar
tossed with tagliolini), four swimming pools, indoor waterfalls, a
nightclub, a tower manned by guards with machine-guns and a rooftop
helicopter landing pad.
</P>
<P>
   The villa became a vacation destination for many of the world's
leading entertainment and political figures. The first party at the
villa was for Henry and Nancy Kissinger. The house was also used as
a backdrop for the James Bond movie ``License to Kill.''

GREER, WETTELAND EXPECTED TO MISS 3-4 DAYS

 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ AND T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer and relief
pitcher John Wetteland are expected to be out for three or four
days because of lower leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Both players had magnetic resonance imaging exams Thursday night
that confirmed the original diagnosis. Greer has inflammation
around his right ankle, and Wetteland has a strained right calf
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI results will be evaluated by Dr. Charles Cook, a foot
specialist in Dallas, but the Rangers don't expect him to find
anything more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give Rusty three days off, and he should be
ready to go, and we'll give Wetteland three or four days off, and
he should be ready to go,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Wetteland had a sore right ankle that hindered him
from pushing off the pitching mound. That, coupled with off-season
elbow surgery, contributed to a slow start. He had a 4.35
earned-run average in the first month of the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect a similar setback this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by how it feels today,'' Wetteland said. ``It's
not stiff and sore. I'm still able to work out and do something.
Just not doing anything wouldn't have been good. There is stuff I
can do to work around it. I just won't be able to do the hurdles.''
MEETING CANCELED Las Vegas officials called off a meeting with the
Rangers and other clubs interested in moving there for spring
training, apparently because of excessive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lease at their Port Charlotte complex is up after
next year, and they are considering other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking to people in Las Vegas and Arizona,'' said
John McMichael, the Rangers executive vice president for finance
and operations. ``We're going to talk to the Port Charlotte people
too. Everything is in the preliminary stages right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Others teams reportedly interested in Las Vegas are the
Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals, Houston
Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays. NO SETBACK FOR
THOMPSON Left-hander Justin Thompson reported no problems with his
shoulder after his first throwing session off a mound since
undergoing surgery in August.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson threw 25 pitches from 50 feet Thursday, at about 60
percent velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable out there, considering it was the
first time I was on the mound since July,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is scheduled to repeat the throwing program today.
PALMEIRO WATCH The Rangers are taking it slow with first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, who was limited mostly to designated-hitter duty
last year because of a bad knee.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was 1-for-2 in yesterday's exhibition opener with a
fourth-inning single. He was immediately removed from the game for
a pinch runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers still expect Palmeiro to play first base, but
manager Johnny Oates said, ``We know he's not 100 percent. He had
fluid on the knee the other day. We're going bring him along
slowly.'' nn

ROGERS FINDS GROOVE WITH INSIDE PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers brought back his
four-seam inside fastball while pitching two scoreless innings
against the Minnesota Twins yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch, at one time the most important in his repertoire, was
missing last year. Getting it back could spare him the frustration
he felt in the painful final inning of last year's National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need that pitch,'' said Rogers, after his outing in the
Rangers' 10-9 loss to the Twins in an exhibition opener. ``I need
to establish my fastball inside. I didn't have a quality four-seam
pitch last year, and it probably hurt me some. You can only stay
away so much.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Game 6 of the NLCS last year, when
Rogers came in to pitch the 11th inning for the New York Mets in a
9-9 ballgame against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He threw two curveballs on the outside corner to Braves leadoff
hitter Gerald Williams and got ahead 0-2 in the count. But instead
of pounding the fastball inside, Rogers threw another curveball
outside, and Williams smacked a double to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a mistake over the plate, you can get away with it
a little more if you establish your fastball inside,'' Rogers said.
``I didn't do that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the four-seam fastball, a power pitch that comes in
straight and hard, Rogers relied on a cut fastball, which moves
inside on right-handed hitters. Rogers had trouble controlling that
pitch last year, especially in that fateful final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers tried to attack Andruw Jones with the cut fastball with
the bases loaded and one out but walked him on six pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was all last year. I'd throw the cut
fastball, and it kept running inside on hitters,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-seam fastball _ called that because the grip is across
four seams _ was Rogers' primary weapon in his early days as a
Rangers reliever. But the years and injuries have taken a toll.
Rogers has had to become a pitcher instead of a thrower, and his
fastball doesn't have the heat it once did.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers said the pitch still can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't make me a dominating pitcher, but I can set up my
other pitches by throwing the ball inside,'' Rogers said. ``Two
years ago, I did it very well and had a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said pitching coach Dick Bosman: ``He's able to do that, it's
just a matter of incorporating it into his thought process. We're
not giving away any secrets. You have to throw your fastball on
both sides of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing that effectively could mean less pitches and longer
outings. Rogers, 10-4 with a 4.19 earned-run average, had 17
no-decisions last year, the most by any pitcher in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more pitches you throw, the more pitches it costs you,''
Rogers said. ``It costs you more hitters, and hitters cost you
innings. If it costs you innings, it all costs you winning
ballgames.'' nn

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If Johnny Bredahl hopes to realize his world-title
dreams tonight, he will have to pack more wallop than reigning WBA
bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala's most recent opponent.
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded preparations for the second defense of his World
Boxing Association title, Ayala disclosed that he had suffered a
``blowout fracture of the cheekbone'' during his 12-round unanimous
decision victory against Saohin Srithai Condo of Thailand on Oct.
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with an uppercut in the second round, and it was
like, `Oh man, he messed up something,''' said Ayala, recounting
the right-handed shot that nearly ended his first title defense at
Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum in Fort Worth. Between rounds, Ayala
informed cornermen Henry Mendez and Paul Reyes that his left cheek
was on fire. But none realized the extent of the damage until after
a series of postfight X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condo fractured my cheekbone, and the fractured bone went into
my sinus cavity and caused my nose to bleed,'' Ayala said. ``It was
hard to breathe. I couldn't see out of my left eye, just for that
round. But through the whole fight, the nerves in my cheek were
throbbing _ burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to quit, but after the fight I told Henry and
Paul, `I felt like giving him my belt at that point.' Really, he
would have had to knock me out. It makes the victory more
meaningful, to know that I overcame that obstacle. And I did it
with the No. 1 contender, a guy that was extremely tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Denmark's Bredahl, the European champion at 118 pounds and
the WBA's No. 4-ranked contender who claims he packs the style and
the smarts capable of finishing Ayala off tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a boxer, with a big `B.' And I can hit,'' said Bredahl,
31, outlining a strategy for the scheduled 12-rounder at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center tonight. ``I will stand still and hit.
Not box-and-move. Stand still and hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Paulie has a good style, but he's not a hard hitter.
Look at his record _ 12 knockouts. Doesn't have the power, no. He
has good hands, but look at his nose. Takes too many punches, and
in the end it's going to be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bredahl, 45-1 with 23 knockouts, will be fighting in the United
States for the first time in his 12-year career. Bredahl said he
and trainer Kjeld Krough broke camp in Copenhagen after logging 150
rounds of sparring over 2 1/2 months. At 5-foot-8, Bredahl will
enjoy 3-inch height and 5-inch reach advantages against Ayala, 29-1
with 12 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's mending cheekbone prevented him from sparring until the
end of January. Ayala and Fort Worth junior welterweight Ruben
Nevarez went into sparring overdrive during February, logging 88
four-minute rounds at the Boxing Management Inc. gym.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said Team Ayala reviewed five Bredahl victories on
videotape provided by Top Rank Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we got another tape, when he fought Wayne McCullough,''
said Mendez, referring to Bredahl's eighth-round technical knockout
loss against the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion in
December 1995. ``That's where he \RBredahl\S ran. And McCullough
fights a style similar to what Paulie fights. They're both
aggressive. And Bredahl ran hard. We thought he was running the
Cowtown Marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's trainers have mapped strategies for either a
fight-on-the-run or one waged in traditional straight-up, European
style _ inside, and to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep hoping Johnny will stand up and fight Paulie, for
a while. Which I doubt,'' Reyes said. ``If he does, he won't do it
for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who will earn a career-best $150,000 and a percentage of
the TVKO pay-per-view gate, said he is prepared for all scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, he's going to do whatever I want him to do,'' said
Ayala, 29. ``If he tries to run, I'm going to cut him off and slow
him down, catch him in the corners and work him. And if he tries to
stay there, I'll be the boxer and do what I need to do. Like
counter. He has shown some head movement, but he doesn't have any
lateral movement or bobbing-and-weaving. So the type of looping
punches I've been practicing, they're going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, whose previous knockout was scored four fights ago in
November 1998, has grown accustomed to questions about his power.
And yet his grind-it-out style allowed him to upset Johnny Tapia
for the WBA title here in June and defend it _ fractured cheekbone
and all _ against Condo. Ayala vs. Tapia was named ``Fight of the
Year'' by ``The Ring'' magazine, and Ayala was voted ``Fighter of
the Year'' by the same publication.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala clutched a copy of the magazine, with his smiling likeness
on the cover, when he strode to the podium during the fight's final
news conference Thursday. Moments earlier, Bredahl had spoken about
making his boxing dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams can easily be turned into nightmares,'' Ayala said.
``And I'm glad he did come to fight, because so did I. I'm glad
Johnny showed up.'' nn

BAGWELL HAS WON RESPECT FROM PEERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ When Ken Griffey Jr. was traded to Cincinnati,
there immediately was talk about the three great sluggers in the
National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was joining the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire and
the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa in what could become baseball's
marquee division.
</P>
<P>
   That's true as far as it goes, but at least one member of the
Big Three knows it doesn't go far enough, that another NL Central
superstar is being overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter came to me and told me he was talking to McGwire
about Sosa and Griffey, and McGwire mentioned my name, too,''
Houston Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``That's all that
you want. I don't need respect from the newspapers or the fans. I
think I have that respect from my peers, and as a player that's all
you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's numbers suggest he deserves respect from newspapers
and fans as well as his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McGwire backed up his record-breaking 70-home-run
season by hitting .278 with 65 homers and 147 RBI. Sosa, who hit 66
homers in '99, batted .288 with 63 homers and 141 RBI. Griffey hit
.285 with 48 homers and 134 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys deserve all the accolades,'' Bagwell said.
``McGwire hit 70 and 65 home runs. That's ridiculous. Sammy hit 66
and 63. That's crazy stuff. They deserve all the praise they get.
Griffey's hit 50 home runs, he's one of the best players in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell was almost as good, hitting .304 with 42 homers and 126
RBI, while also stealing 30 bases and leading the league with 143
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many players give you the complete package that Bagwell
does offensively, average, power, on-base percentage,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``And what gets overlooked is
his defense. He's a Gold Glove first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell doesn't have the home-run numbers of the other sluggers,
but that largely is a function of his ballpark. He hit just 12
homers in the pitcher-friendly Astrodome last season, and a
league-leading 30 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about home run hitters you talk about 50 home
runs,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``The reason he
didn't hit 50 home runs is because of the Astrodome.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell could top 50 this season. Enron Field, the Astros' new
ballpark, should be a lot friendlier to right-handed pull hitters.
Even if he doesn't top 50, his teammates say he deserves to be
mentioned with the other superstars in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``No slight against the other guys, but I'll take my buddy any
day of the week,'' Biggio said. ``People might think of him as No.
4, but we consider him No. 1 in our clubhouse.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 6-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother
stumbled upon a trail of murder Thursday night that stretched
across their tidy Bronx neighborhood when an elevator door opened
to reveal the body of a woman, the first of five related slaying
victims discovered in a 10-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 a.m. Friday, detectives in the Bronx had found the
bodies of five members of the Santos family in three buildings. The
victims included a 14-year-old boy who was found on his bed, a
single gunshot behind his left ear, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said all of the killings were linked, but they were
unsure of the motive.
</P>
<P>
   After the children found the first victim, Evelyn Santos, 39,
who was shot and stabbed, in the elevator of their apartment house
at 2825 Olinville Ave. in the well-kept Parkside Houses at about
9:40 p.m. Thursday, the police went to notify her sister, who lived
about eight blocks away, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But when they got to her spacious two-story brick home, at 2934
Radcliff Ave., at about 5:15 a.m. Friday, they found that she, too,
had been murdered. The body of Denise Santos, 30, was lying face up
in her kitchen, a large carving knife still lodged in her neck, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence recovered there led the police to Apartment 4A at 2975
White Plains Rd., also in the Parkside Houses, where at about 7:30
a.m. detectives found the 14-year-old, Ishmael Santos, along with
Eduardo Santos, 34, and Ervin Aguilar, 33, the fiance of Denise
Santos.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was being raised by his aunts and uncle, Denise, Evelyn
and Eduardo Santos, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Santos and Aguilar were dead on the floor near the apartment's
entrance, suggesting to one official that they were killed just
after they answered the door. One of the men had been shot to
death, the other had been shot and stabbed and still had a knife
lodged in his neck, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe all of these homicides are related and would ask
the public for any assistance that they can provide us,'' Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said Friday at a news briefing to
announce that the city was offering a $10,000 reward for
information in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said his detectives were unsure of the order in which the
killings occurred and did not yet know whether there was more than
one killer. He would not discuss the possible motives. But senior
police officials indicated that one of the avenues being pursued
was that the killings were drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have indications that these people may have been involved
in drugs,'' said one of the officials, adding, ``It is one area we
are looking at; it is not the only area.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other possible motives was robbery, because Eduardo Santos
had received a $3.5 million settlement from a legal claim several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives found both the apartment on White Plains Road, where
Eduardo Santos once lived, and the house on Radcliff Avenue had
been ransacked, with furniture moved around, dresser drawers pulled
out and clothes and other items strewn around, a police official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said there were no signs of forced entry in either the
White Plains Road apartment or the Radcliff Avenue house, where a
new white GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle was parked in the
driveway and a new Mitsubishi Gallant, registered just days ago,
was parked in front. The commissioner visited two of the three
crime scenes, saying he did so because of the heinous nature of the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside 2975 White Plains Ave., the police found Eduardo Santos'
blue Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle, which had handicap
license plates and a small Puerto Rican flag hanging from the
rear-view mirror. Neighbors said he walked with a pronounced limp.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor of the Radcliff Avenue house said that she received
a telephone call Friday from a distraught, frightened relative of
the Santos family. ``She said, `They've just killed a lot of people
in my family and to be careful,''' said the neighbor, Thelma
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that there were six other members of the Santos
family who lived in other homes, and all had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose children found Evelyn Santos in the elevator
said they were returning home from their baby sitter and waiting
for the elevator to go upstairs when they saw the body. The woman,
Karen Mayo, 31, said the children ran up the steps terrified, to
her second-floor apartment, and her daughter told her what she had
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were banging on the door and she said, `Mommy! Mommy!
Somebody's dead!''' Mayo said.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Shenell Chandler, 39, said that Evelyn Santos had
gone out for beer. ``I gave her $10 and went back to my house,
Chandler said. ``I went and looked out the window, but she never
came out.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the police arrived.

PLAN TO REVIVE HARTFORD RIVERFRONT IS PRESENTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the state received $2.4 million from the National
Football League to settle a failed deal to build a Hartford stadium
for the New England Patriots, Gov. John G. Rowland made public a
detailed plan Friday for the huge redevelopment project that would
have included the stadium as its centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-page plan, which Rowland submitted Friday to the state
legislature, offers the most detailed picture to date of the $771.1
million redevelopment project known as Adriaen's Landing. But it is
scaled back from earlier plans that included a 68,000-seat stadium
for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the proposal calls for a complex of housing,
restaurants, nightclubs and stores to be anchored by a large
convention center and hotel along the Connecticut River. A more
modest college football stadium would be built across the river in
East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 215,000-square-foot, $165 million
glass-and-steel convention center and the 700-room, $110 million
hotel, the Hartford development would include 200 midrise housing
units, 265,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space, and
parking for at least 5,200 cars. They also suggest the development
of a Connecticut ``Celebrity Walk of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the project could draw as many as 4.2
million visitors to Hartford each year.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland presented the plan to reporters at a news conference
Friday afternoon at the Arch Street Tavern, a saloon and restaurant
within the 33-acre redevelopment zone and one of a handful of
existing businesses that would remain as part of the new
entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the legislature, officials hope the hotel,
convention center and retail entertainment components will be
completed by September 2003. The stadium is expected to be
completed by August 2003.
</P>
<P>
   About $529 million of the project would be financed by the state
of Connecticut, mostly through bond issues. The remaining $242
million would be paid for by private developers, including the
Waterford Group, a local development company.
</P>
<P>
   Adriaen's Landing _ named for the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block,
who in 1614 was the first European to reach Hartford _ was first
proposed in May 1998, six months before Rowland began negotiating
with the Patriots, as an ambitious $1 billion refurbishment of the
downtown Hartford riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan called for a stadium for University of
Connecticut football games and other sports events. But that plan
was changed to include a $375 million stadium that the state would
have built for the Patriots in exchange for a 30-year lease with
the football team. Now, the plan provides for a $91 million,
40,000-seat stadium to be built on a former United Technologies
airfield across the river in East Hartford and to be used primarily
for college football and college soccer.

 &HT;    Bush denies ad attacking McCain on environment
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ads in New York and elsewhere sponsored by the
campaign of George W. Bush and his supporters are ``the worst kind
of American politics,'' John McCain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before the Republican primary in New York, McCain
faced a barrage of attack ads in a key state that polls show is up
for grabs. Republicans also will vote Tuesday in contests in
California, Georgia, Ohio and nine other states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain objected to one television ad in particular that is being
aired by a previously unknown group called Republicans for Clean
Air. The organization is spending $2 million _ according to records
compiled by the McCain campaign _ in New York, Ohio and California
to criticize McCain's record on the environment and praise Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have undisclosed a couple of million dollars coming into a
campaign that's very close without knowing who's behind it and what
it's all about is the worst kind of American politics. It just
reinforces my zeal for campaign finance reform,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign tried to rebut the ad by bringing to New York the
leader of a 5-year-old Republican group that has endorsed McCain.
Martha Marks, a Lake County, Ill., commissioner and president of
Republicans for Environmental Protection, said McCain's
environmental record is far from sterling, but it is better than
Bush's. ``His environmental record in Texas is flat out lousy,''
Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization running the anti-McCain ad is headed by Sam
Wyly, a wealthy Dallas investor who with his brother, Charles Wyly,
has given Bush more than $200,000 for his campaigns for governor in
1994 and 1998. Sam Wyly runs Maverick Capital Fund, an investment
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied any involvement with the ads Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who funded those ads,'' he said prior to being
told that Wyly acknowledged heading Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no connection between my campaign and this ad,'' he
repeated. ``We had no knowledge whatsoever that Sam Wyly was going
to run this ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is attacking McCain on the health care front, mounting
a radio ad in New York that criticizes the Arizona senator for
failing to support federal funding that includes breast cancer
research. In the ad, breast cancer survivor and activist Geri
Barish noted that McCain opposes local cancer research programs as
``garden-variety pork.'' The projects were contained in a military
spending bill, which McCain said he opposed because it contained
insufficient salary increases for U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's shocking,'' Barish says on the ad. ``America deserves
better. Next Tuesday, John McCain won't have my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose sister, Sandy McCain Morgan, was diagnosed with
breast cancer two years ago, said he has many times voted to fund
cancer research projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way that I would campaign and it's not true and
everybody knows it's not true,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he sees nothing wrong with the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the senator should be squealing about pork and
then squealing when somebody disagrees with one of the cuts he
wants to make. That's what the ad says,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the illness suffered by McCain's sister, Bush said:
``All the more reason to remind him of what he said about the
research that goes on here. I'm sorry if that's the case; that
obviously is very difficult for her and her family.''

EDITORIAL: A SKEWED TUITION TAX BREAK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved an unfair education bill this week that
would give tax breaks mostly to upper-income families with children
in private schools. President Clinton vetoed a similar proposal in
1998, and he should veto this legislation when it reaches his desk.
The centerpiece of the bill, introduced by Sens. Paul Coverdell,
R-Georgia, and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., would allow families with
annual incomes of up to $150,000 to deposit up to $2,000 a year per
child in after-tax dollars into education savings accounts. The
interest earned on the accounts would be tax-free, and the money
could be used to pay for private school tuition and other
educational expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The current law allows families to set aside up to $500 a year
per child, but limits the use of the money to college costs. An
expansion to $2,000 that would include elementary and secondary
school costs would largely give affluent families a federal subsidy
for tuition they already currently pay.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is estimated to cost the federal government $1.2
billion over five years, yet little of that would benefit
low-income families that are not likely to have the money to set
aside and that would receive a minimal tax break even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   This measure would siphon off federal revenue that could be
better spent improving public schools that educate 90 percent of
American students. It does not reduce class sizes or improve
teacher quality. Nor would it offer meaningful aid to low-income
students who might want to attend private schools, since the
subsidy is too small to cover full tuition expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders, who contend that education is one of
their top priorities, pushed hard for this idea because it is
relatively inexpensive. But it is still a wasteful tax giveaway
that offers no educational benefits and should be rejected.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   The text of Proposition 22, which appears on the ballot of
California's primary on Tuesday, contains only 14 words. But it is
one of the more mean-spirited measures to come along in any
election in quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as the Knight Initiative for its staunchly anti-gay
Republican author, state Sen. William Knight, Proposition 22 would
revise the California Family Code to say that ``Only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.''
Although billed as a necessary step to protect the institution of
marriage and ``traditional'' families, it is in fact a divisive
exercise in wedge politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriages are currently barred in California, and defeating
the Knight Initiative will not change that. Moreover, in the two
states where the issue of gay marriages has percolated in the
courts, Hawaii and Vermont, lawmakers are choosing instead to
create stronger same-sex partnership protections rather than
legalizing same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, approval of Proposition 22 would send an ugly
message of disrespect and exclusion that would reverberate
nationwide. More tangibly, it would hand anti-gay bigots a legal
club they could use to challenge the state's domestic partnership
benefits _ much as has happened in other states where legislatures
have passed similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 is opposed by an intriguing cross-section of
political leaders that includes the state's Democratic governor,
Gray Davis, its two Democratic U.S. senators, Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein, and Republicans like the San Diego mayor, Susan
Golding, and Ward Connerly, the architect of California's 1996
anti-affirmative-action referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, are also urging voters to reject the
initiative's appeal to prejudice. By contrast, both Republican
contenders, Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, have refused
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight amendment is not about protecting families or even
about stopping same-sex marriages, should some state approve them
in the future. This is a referendum on tolerance. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Essie Green Edmiston, an art dealer who represented
many 20th-century African-American artists through her Harlem
gallery, died on Feb. 26. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bladder cancer, said Sylvia Hueston, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston began showing art in her Brooklyn apartment in the
1970s while running a full-time psychiatric social work practice.
After meeting the painter Romare Bearden, she turned her attention
toward art as a career. With a credit union loan she established
the Park Plaza Gallery in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in 1979. This was
followed by the Essie Green Galleries in Harlem in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There she showed work by Bearden, Lois Mailou Jones and Jacob
Lawrence, all of whom she knew as friends. She also showed the work
of Allen Stringfellow, Norman Lewis, William S. Carter, William
Ossawa Tanner, Charles Ethan Porter, Edwin Bannister and Charles
Alston. At the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture she
organized a Bearden show in 1991 and a Stringfellow show in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston was born in Miami in 1938 and grew up in Springfield,
Mass. She received a master's degree in social work from New York
University and was preparing a dissertation in social policy at
Columbia University at the time of her death. She continued to
practice as a psychiatric social worker until the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   She was a founding stockholder of Innercity Broadcasting Corp.,
which is the owner of the radio stations WBLS-FM and WLIB-AM in New
York City. She was also on its board. She was also a board member
of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater. Since 1973 she
had been a member of the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Sherman K. Edmiston Jr.; two
stepchildren, Sherman K. III and Lisa A. of New York City; three
grandchildren; her mother, Mary L. Green; two brothers, Reuben Jr.
and Eli Green, all of Springfield, Mass.; and five sisters, Betty
Davis of Oakdale, Conn., Katherine Mutcherson of Silver Springs,
Md., Iraline G. Barnes of Washington, Phyllis Green of Atlanta, and
Lorraine Green of Chicago.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CHALLENGES LOYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTCHESTER, N.Y. _ The Odyssey Diner here is one of those
old-fashioned political hangouts, where establishment pols, mostly
Republicans, gather at the counter or in a side room to hash things
out over the famous cheesecake and coffee courtesy of the affable
Doukases, who have run the place for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the stiff competition among the Republican candidates and
the approach of the New York primary on Tuesday have enlivened the
discourse here, even among the Doukas family. They unwittingly
served up an example of the split among Republican voters in this
336-year-old town of mansions and Cape Cod-style homes when it
comes to Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   George Doukas, the proprietor, scoffed at the televised face of
McCain as he spoke in a television news report while Doukas played
backgammon. Doukas firmly declared his commitment to Bush, aligning
himself with the county Republican establishment, including this
Westchester County town's supervisor, James Cavanaugh, who is the
newly anointed county party leader and a firm Bush man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush has the better chance of winning,'' said Doukas,
65, who owns the diner with his family. ``He seems to have done a
good job in Texas and has a good record there.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Republican Party as a whole has not united
behind Bush, neither have the Doukases. Standing a few feet away at
the register, Doukas's wife, Angela, 61, just as firmly declared
her commitment to McCain, of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lost in South Carolina he made that speech and what he
said stuck in my heart,'' she said. ``He said we will go forth, but
he congratulated Bush even though they fought so much. It just
showed what a strong gentleman he is.''
</P>
<P>
   While far from being a scientific sounding, 28 interviews with
registered Republicans over two days here and in the two
self-governing villages this town encompasses _ Tuckahoe and
Bronxville _ suggested an electorate tuned to the primary campaign
but sometimes ambivalent about the choices a few days before the
Tuesday primary.
</P>
<P>
   There was hope for McCain in people willing to buck the
conventional wisdom and even to risk domestic bliss for their man.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can take comfort, too, in the likes of Mr. Doukas and
William Carlson, a 69-year-old semiretired sales representative who
said he was turned off by reports of McCain's negative campaigning
by telephone. Besides, Carlson said, Bush stands firm on
conservative principles and served as governor of a large, ``tough
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a lot of good things in Texas,'' Carlson said.
``He has used the death penalty a lot, and I think we need more of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people could articulate policy positions of the
candidate they favored. The more common requests of any candidate
were lower taxes, keep the economy cruising, do something to
improve access to health care, but few could explain what their
candidate might do to achieve such goals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's post-New Hampshire primary surge entranced some who
otherwise would have supported Bush because he was so far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is still an open race,'' said Kevin Scully, an
Internet entrepreneur from Bronxville. ``I didn't think of McCain
before, when Bush was the primary candidate, but now I'm starting
to get serious about thinking of McCain. I'm still not able to
clearly get his message, but I will be paying more attention now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin L. Cooperman, 53, a physiotherapist, said he thought Bush
was ``spending too much time attacking, and I don't like those
tactics.'' This comment came a day before the Bush campaign began
broadcasting radio advertisements and disseminating fliers
questioning McCain's record on financing for breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   While favoring McCain, he said both candidates had disappointed
him by not fully explaining how they would improve the delivery of
health insurance, particularly for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman also said he would be tempted to vote Democratic in a
contest between Gore and Bush. He voted for President Clinton in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   How such sentiments will translate in the voting booth remains
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh, the party leader, acknowledged McCain's draw. ``I am
not the least bit dismissive of McCain's challenge,'' he said. ``He
is making a strong challenge, and there are people who are enamored
of him. I am not saying Bush has it in the bag. We all have to work
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the undecided and even those with a bent, the race could
hardly be described as the same-old, same-old. ``With all these
choices, it's hard to keep up,'' said Robert Frederick, a
38-year-old computer scientist who said he planned to spend the
next few days reading about the candidates before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a fiscal conservative but sort of moderate on social
issues,'' Frederick said. ``Bush and McCain both say they are
fiscal conservatives, and it's hard to keep up on where they stand
on things like abortion, which I think they both oppose, but then
they may have said things like it's OK in certain cases, or
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pro-choice and think the Democrats have done good with the
economy,'' he said. ``Where does that leave me?''

CITY PRESSURES LAUSD TO RECONSIDER BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under an intense lobbying effort to bring the
abandoned Belmont Learning Center back from the dead, the Los
Angeles City Council on Friday called on the school district to
take a new look at the public works fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   By a 12-1 vote, the council passed a motion that asks the Los
Angeles Unified School District to explore alternative uses for the
environmentally troubled Belmont site and work with the city to
find alternative school sites nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was a timid version of the original proposal floated
by Councilman Mike Hernandez. If the city is unsatisfied with the
district's cooperation, the approved motion calls for the council
to withhold building permits and funding for public spaces for
schools in the Belmont attendance area. Hernandez originally sought
to deny the district permits and public space funding for all new
campuses across the city.
</P>
<P>
   As a handful of audience members wearing green sweat shirts
reading ``Parents of Belmont'' looked on, Hernandez complained the
school board decision to kill Belmont was rooted in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are against opening Belmont have been only reading
the headlines and not studying the issue,'' Hernandez said. ``No
one supports sending kids to a dangerous site. But this represents
a broken promise to the people of the community. I want to make
sure there is not another broken promise.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what, if any, meaningful effect the council's
action will have on the school district's efforts to build
desperately needed campuses for predominantly low-income, Latino
students in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   The city has no jurisdiction over Los Angeles Unified's school
construction program, and the motion's threatened repercussions
probably would be more of a nuisance to the building program,
rather than an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Genethia Hayes said Friday the council's
action will not prompt the board majority to give Belmont a new
lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Belmont Learning Center site has been abandoned. We aren't
building a school on that site. We've abandoned it by board action.
The project has stopped and will not be restarted,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the school board voted Jan. 25 to abandon Belmont,
even though the district had sunk $175 million into the nation's
costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   The board cited concerns about potentially serious health risks
created at the 35-acre parcel by a shallow oil field beneath the
complex. The oil formation seeps a nearly endless supply of
explosive methane gas and hydrogen sulfide. An adequate safety
system was never designed for the partially completed school.
</P>
<P>
   Upon abandoning Belmont, the board majority vowed to return by
March 28 with new sites for downtown campuses. To date, LAUSD
administrators have identified five possible locations, including
LAUSD administrative headquarters and the back portion of the
vacant Ambassador Hotel lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open dialogue on finding new, safe schools is terrific. But if
the City Council is trying to strong-arm us into reopening the
Belmont issue, I would find that very regrettable,'' said school
board member Valerie Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda is about children, not about adults. We have done
what we thought is in the best interest of children. It would be
very regrettable if the City Council's action stood in our way of
building new schools. If it's about working together, I'm very
happy to keep them informed,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Joel Wachs, a mayoral candidate, cast the lone
dissenting vote against Hernandez's motion, after warning his
colleagues they were treading on a dangerous political land mine.
Wachs argued there is more at stake than the construction of one
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the last thing we should be doing is getting
involved in the Belmont fiasco,'' Wachs said. ``If we are going to
do this, we also should call for a grand jury investigation into
what's really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt Mr. Hernandez's sincerity or passion, but this
is about money. It is about corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs referred to a Los Angeles Daily News story published
Friday detailing the well-financed lobbying effort by O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers, the blue-chip law firm being sued by the school district for
its handling of key matters related to the construction of Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, which could be liable for millions of dollars
in damages if Belmont isn't built, has hired two influential
lobbying firms _ Rose &AMP; Kindel and Cerrell &AMP; Associates _ to help
resuscitate the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get bombarded by calls from one of the highest-paid
lobbyists and they refuse to tell me who is paying them, that sends
up flags,'' Wachs said. ``And when we find out who is behind it, it
begins to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows we have enough to deal with with Rampart; why does
this City Council have to get involved in an unholy alliance with
the school district?''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who has been active in school affairs and
financed the campaigns of the new board majority, said through a
spokeswoman that he does not support the council action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor doesn't support anything that hurts children, and he
believes this creates more problems than it will solve,''
spokeswoman Jessica Copen said. ``The mayor supports the school
board on what it has done with Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a resolution, however, Riordan cannot do anything
to block it, Copen said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to save Belmont has gained momentum in recent weeks.
Several Latino politicians, including Hernandez and county
Supervisor Gloria Molina, have been mounting a furious backroom and
public campaign to influence key city and state leaders. Among
those publicly questioning the school board's decision to dump the
tainted school are mayoral candidates Steve Soboroff, Xavier
Becerra and Antonio Villaraigosa.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wachs, City Attorney James Hahn, a mayoral candidate, has
supported the school board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Adding intrigue, several City Council members have a lengthy and
varied history with the Belmont scandal. Most notably, Councilwoman
Jackie Goldberg was a school board member when the first plans for
Belmont were being hatched despite explicit warnings about the
site's environmental problems. Hernandez first opposed the
construction of Belmont but then switched sides.
</P>
<P>
   The political jockeying continued during Friday's debate over
Hernandez's motion. Councilman Nate Holden and Councilwoman Rita
Walters got into a sharp exchange over the history of the project
and problems facing LAUSD's building program.
</P>
<P>
   After Holden complained about the district's failure to find a
new campus for Belmont students and charged that the school board's
decision to abandon Belmont was racially motivated, Walters
countered that Holden's opposition to new school construction in
the past contributed to today's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Walters served on the school board in the late 1980s, when the
district wanted to purchase the Ambassador Hotel site. Holden
fought those plans at the time, and his opposition contributed to
the district's questionable decision to walk away from the
Ambassador site in favor of the Belmont property.
</P>
<P>
   With Belmont dead, the school district is now close to cinching
a deal to build a school behind the Ambassador. Again, Holden is
against the project. Officials fear his opposition could hinder, if
not kill, the ongoing negotiations for the Wilshire Boulevard real
estate.

STRETCH WILL BE KEY, MURRAY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Nashville Predators might be 14 games under
.500, but Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray is hoping his
faltering team knows there are no more patsies during the final
five weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense around Friday's Kings practice that the recent
letdown to weaker opponents might be a result of seeing the finish
line before actually getting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of our guys, these 18 games will be a measuring
stick,'' Murray said. ``Most of them have not been to the
playoffs,haven't been in those battles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last trip, the Kings played well and took over the sixth
spot in the eight-team Western Conference playoff race. They still
are sixth, but after losses to San Jose and Carolina and a tie with
Vancouver, the Kings can see the Sharks and Colorado Avalanche
creeping up from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year we need to stay focused and play with
more discipline,'' said Luc Robitaille, who takes a 15-game scoring
streak into tonight's game with the Predators at Staples Center.
``Technically, it's not the playoffs, but emotionally it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been to the playoffs just once in the past six
years and their only trip to the postseason (1998) should be a
vivid reminder just how fragile this all can be.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Kings finished second in the Pacific Division
with a 38-33-11 record. But after it became clear they would reach
the postseason, the team played poorly down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   They lost eight of the last 13 games, including a 7-3 rout by
St. Louis at the Forum on the final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings then faced the Blues in the first round and were swept
in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep things from getting blown out of
proportion,'' captain Rob Blake said. ``We have made some mistakes
the past few games, but I would not say the Vancouver game was bad.
We've definitely taken too many penalties, but this is not a free
fall by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake acknowledged the three penalties he took Thursday -
including a four-minute double minor in the third period - cannot
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not only puts us at a disadvantage, it messes up the
(defensive) combinations we work with every day in practice,'' he
said. ``We have to be smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray will stick with goaltender Stephane Fiset for the fifth
consecutive game. He has not forgotten Jamie Storr, but says it
looks like Fiset will see most of the action the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Neither goaltender has taken over games the way Vancouver's
Felix Potvin and Carolina's Arturs Irbe did against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Both made outstanding saves early and allowed their teams to
build confidence.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hurricanes' first goal, Fiset tried to clear the puck
behind his own net and gave it up to a Carolina player.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Steph has been solid,'' Murray said. ``Maybe if we
had won last night, we might have gone a different way against
Nashville. We're going to need both to reach the playoffs.''

 &HT;    Gore drums up votes in Georgia
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Al Gore's last visit to Atlanta before Tuesday's
Georgia presidential primary seemed more like a victory swing for
the front-runner Democratic candidate than a last-minute drumbeat
for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president holds about a four-fold lead over former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in Georgia, according to state Democratic
Party polls. But during a speech at the Atlanta Hyatt Regency on
Friday night, Gore never mentioned his current opponent by name.
Instead, he zeroed in on Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who are running for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both wrong,'' Gore roared after recounting GOP plans
that he said would jeopardize the budget, weaken Social Security
and hurt public schools. Gore said Bush and McCain have spent so
much time attacking each other that ''if it was a basketball game,
you'd call it trash talk.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,600 Democratic supporters roared with him. Each paid
$200 or more to see the vice president at the Georgia Democratic
Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner. Much of the $1 million
or so raised will be used to help the party try to retain its
control of the Georgia Legislature this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a standing ovation as he entered to strains of
Bachman Turner Overdrive's ``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet.'' And if
he didn't have Georgia Democrats' support sewn up yet, he spent the
first half of his 30-minute speech adding the last stitches. Before
asking for votes, he compared himself to popular Georgia Gov. Roy
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, also doing a little campaigning, evoked fleeting
images of the fight for integration as he described the GOP's
opposition to his education reform package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans can stand in the schoolhouse door only so long
before we'll bring about this change in education, this reform in
education,'' Barnes thundered.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the evening was all Gore's. Not that support for
him in Georgia was ever in doubt. Bradley hasn't campaigned in the
state since November and never managed to mount a full-scale
campaign here. The candidate left Atlanta Friday night en route to
Boston.

<P>
   PARIS _ An international tribunal in The Hague sentenced a
Croatian general, the highest-ranking military commander yet
brought to trial, to 45 years in prison Friday for war crimes
committed during the Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
sentenced Gen. Tihomir Blaskic for ordering a series of attacks on
Muslim villagers in Bosnia between 1992 and 1994 while his forces
were trying to secure the area for Croatia. It was the harshest
sentence handed down by the tribunal since the United Nations
created it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, the court also indirectly indicted the government
of former President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, openly stating that
Zagreb had overall control of the Bosnian Croat authorities and
Blaskic's militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic of Croatia did not content itself with merely
remaining a spectator on the sidelines or even seek simply to
protect its borders,'' the ruling read. ``It intervened in the
conflict, pitting Muslims and Croats of central Bosnia against each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic, 39, was convicted for crimes against humanity, war
crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, which deals
with the protection of civilians during war. Although he was not
charged with ``killing a Muslim by his own hand,'' the judges said
that as commander of the militia, the so-called Croatian Defense
Council, he was responsible for personally ordering attacks and for
failing to prevent or punish crimes committed by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   In Zagreb, officials of the new government immediately
criticized the verdict, saying that Blaskic had been far more
moderate than many Croatian nationalists. ``There is no doubt that
the sentence is very harsh and I believe it will have to be
re-examined in the appeals process,'' Prime Minister Ivica Racan
said on Croatian radio.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the ruling of the three-judge panel, Judge Claude
Jorda cited a long list of atrocities by the Croatian militia
against terror-stricken Muslims in the villages of Bosnia's Lasva
Valley, where hundreds were killed and many were beaten, raped or
burned alive in their homes. One of the worst examples was the
rampage in the village of Ahmici, which led to the death of more
than 100 men, women and children.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The crimes you committed, General Blaskic, are extremely
serious,'' Jorda said. ``The acts of war carried out with disregard
for international humanitarian law and in hatred of another people,
the villages reduced to rubble, the houses and stables set on fire
and destroyed, the people forced to abandon their homes, the lost
and broken lives, are unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that as the sentence was read out in the
courtroom, Ratka Blaskic, the defendant's wife, broke down and
sobbed while he remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Croatian nationalist extremists threatened
Ante Nobilo, one of Blaskic's lawyers, who then moved his family
temporarily to The Netherlands from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The general's defense lawyers had argued that the commander was
powerless to stop the Croatian militiamen because they were
``poorly trained recruits'' in a new and ill-organized command. But
the judges ruled that the court had more ``evidence than it needs
to note that the chain of command was operating satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expressed satisfaction with the verdict and said the
sentence had helped achieve their goal of judging the most senior
commanders of the war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a turning point,'' said Paul Risley, spokesman for
the prosecutor's office. ``In previous sentences, we've been forced
to deal with the foot soldiers and camp guards and the like who
carried out crimes. Now we are moving to the more senior
commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Three senior Bosnian Serb commanders are now in custody in The
Hague, and their trials are expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic's trial took 25 months and involved testimony from 158
witnesses and some 30,000 pages of evidence. It has been held up,
both inside and outside the tribunal, as an example of how the
court should not function, paving the way for reforms meant to
speed up the proceedings.

DOMINIC BRUCE, 84, BRITON WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE NAZIS 17 TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change headline for accuracy.)  
(js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominic Bruce, a British bomber pilot who made no fewer than 17
attempts in four years to escape from his German captors at the
famous Colditz prison, died on Feb. 12 in England. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his determination and ingenuity, Bruce was recaptured
every time he broke free from Colditz Castle, near Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest he ever made it was to Danzig, 400 miles away. He
had jumped aboard trains and had stolen bicycles left outside
churches while their owners were at worship. That time he was
finally caught while trying to stow away on a Swedish freighter.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next eight months in solitary confinement, but the
experience did little to curb his audacity.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his several escapes, he left a smirking note on the
windowsill over which he departed spelling out in German the
message: ``The air in Colditz no longer pleases me. Auf
wiedersehen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying because it was fun,'' he said after the war.
``It gave you a feeling like hitting the jackpot. And, most
importantly of all, I knew it got up the Germans' noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was repatriated in 1945 when Colditz was liberated. He was
awarded the British Military Cross for his escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce then studied history at Oxford and eventually became
principal of Kingston upon Thames College of Further Education in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 7, 1915, Bruce joined the Royal Air Force in 1935
and became a pilot. In 1941 his Wellington bomber was shot down
over Zeebrugge, the North Sea port, by German fighters. He bailed
out and was picked up by a German vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in the German POW camp at Spangenberg, he wrote to his
wife asking for an unusual and carefully specified piece of
clothing. She followed his instructions minutely, and when the
garment arrived it turned out to be a blazer that could be adapted
to look like a German uniform. He used it in an unsuccessful
attempt to hijack a German aircraft and was sent to Colditz.
</P>
<P>
   That was only the first of his many attempts. On other
occasions, he climbed down a 40-foot wall with knotted bedsheets,
crawled through a sewer, hid in a tea chest and tried to walk out
of a POW camp dressed as a Swiss doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce is survived by his wife, six sons and three daughters.

STREAKS MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's more than just history being made by the
Los Angeles Lakers with a pair of double-digit winning streaks this
season. There is necessary progress toward retaining the league's
best record, homecourt advantage in the playoffs and building
momentum for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Friday night's game against Indiana, the Lakers
already had the two longest double-digit winning streaks (16 and 13
games) in franchise history for a single season. In their
record-setting 33-game streak season of 1971-72, they didn't come
back with another double-digit string.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get it done is to have winning streaks,''
coach Phil Jackson said. ``If you can string two together or three
together in the course of a season that are double-digit winning
streaks, you're on the way ... You've got to be able to do that.
Make your three-game winning streaks six-game winning streaks, etc.
We've been fortunate this year to have this happen for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about the team because it means they can play
consistently and for whatever reasons they can put together a
string,'' he said. ``Now when you go in the playoffs, you only hope
you can get a winning streak going, because of home-and-home
(alternating of games) and the intensity of the games. But it's
almost imperative that you be able to win on the road in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unplugged: The NBA is again making a push to place microphones
on coaches during nationally televised games, and Jackson is again
resisting the concept, which the league is touting as a way to
bring fans closer to the game.
</P>
<P>
   TNT, which broadcast Friday's game, did not ask to put a mike on
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely I will have a problem wearing a microphone in a
competitive game,'' said Jackson, who did consent to be miked in
NBC's coverage of the All-Star Game last month. ``I'm going to
withhold any statements on that until it gets to be more defined,
and then say what I feel has to be said about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been approached, and if I was going to be
approached, I imagine there would be some lead time for it,'' he
said, ``because it changes how you can coach. It just changes how
you do your job.... I think that's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA began putting microphones on referees for some national
TV games earlier this season, a practice Jackson called
``ridiculous.''

CRASH UNITS, OTHERS TO BE SCRAPPED IN WAKE OF RAMPART CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the first major shake-up stemming from the
Rampart scandal, LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks on Friday ordered
anti-gang CRASH and other special units disbanded citywide and
reorganized into a new, more tightly controlled unit.
</P>
<P>
   Parks never referred directly to the Rampart scandal in his
19-page order to the LAPD's 10,000 officers. However, it clearly
reflects the problems detailed in the Board of Inquiry report
released this week and testimony from former Rampart CRASH Officer
Rafael Perez on how the anti-gang unit lied, stole evidence, and
beat, shot and framed suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to maintain the high standard ingrained in the Los
Angeles Police Department, it is important to continually assess
and fine-tune existing systems and create new methods of improving
the enforcement capabilities of the department,'' Parks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing this, the department displays its accountability to
the community it serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks' action was expected, as outlined in a Jan. 19 Los Angeles
Daily News story. It takes effect March 12, when about 300
officers, including 60 in the Valley now working in Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums units, will be returned to
uniformed patrol duties.
</P>
<P>
   Also affected are officers who work in the special problems,
career criminals and other specialized units.
</P>
<P>
   In their place will be a new Special Enforcement Unit with
different officers assigned to take over gang work and other
investigations. Officers currently assigned to CRASH will have the
opportunity to reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Officers assigned to bicycle and juvenile details, school cars
and prostitution enforcement will not be included in the
specialized unit.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said over the next month the teams will be analyzed and
officers assigned to staff new specialized details working on gangs
and career criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing the names and the functions, but it is more
than just a reassignment of personnel,'' said Cmdr. David Kalish, a
spokesman for the department. ``We are looking at everything these
units did, will audit all the gang intelligence files and have
tighter controls on their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, who led the Board of Inquiry team,
said the action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us the ability to start with a clean slate,''
Bostic said. ``We can do an audit and re-evaluate people and have
some standards on who will go there and give them a very defined
mission of what we want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan embraced the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department has a mission to fight crime in Los
Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``What happened at Rampart was totally
unacceptable. There has to be effective gang prevention without the
same type of illegal activities that occurred at Rampart. We have
to make sure that Rampart doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
said the union sided with the chief in making the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a structural reorganization and we are supporting
that,'' Hunt said. ``But I also want the people of Los Angeles to
be assured that the uniformed officers are the best officers in the
world and they will continue to go out in the field and actively
enforce the law. If there is a problem of mediocrity in this
department, it's with management.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry involved 300 command officers and
investigators who found a culture of ``mediocrity'' poisoned all
levels of the department, allowing the Rampart scandal to occur. It
recommended 108 changes to reform the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the City Council's
Public Safety Committee, also supports the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially an interim step to make the changes that
are needed,'' Miscikowski said. ``This is clearly appropriate so we
can achieve our long-term goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the major changes Parks is making is a three-year limit on
officers being assigned to the gang detail or other specialized
details. They will have to be out of the units for at least a year
before returning. This is similar to the requirements of officers
assigned to vice details.
</P>
<P>
   One CRASH officer in the Valley who declined to give her name
said the three-year term limit will adversely affect the
department's expertise with gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a good two years to get to know the gangs and to be
able to go to court and testify and give opinions as a gang expert.
It's not something that just comes overnight,'' the officer said.
``I don't think the term is the problem. I think it's the
supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks also will require the officers to wear uniforms on duty
and patrol in black-and-white vehicles, to try to get away from the
problems that occurred at Rampart, where officers were able to wear
plainclothes and mingle with gang members. There also is a ban on
wearing raid jackets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new minimum standards are being imposed on officers
assigned to the units. They must have a minimum of three years on
the force, with two of those in patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Woodrow Parks, who works for the Valley Bureau's CRASH
and had input on the Board of Inquiry, said he anticipates the
changes will result in more time spent gathering information on
gangs to assist detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``CRASH is supposed to be more of an intelligence-gathering
unit,'' said Parks, who worked CRASH when it began in 1976. ``We're
going to get them back into looking for where gangs hang out, who
they are, who's on probation and parole ... as opposed to being out
there monitoring gang activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a gang expert is very difficult. Just arresting people
on the street for doing minor violations or having narcotics in
their pocket is an easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the chief's order is to provide greater
control over the units by allowing commanding officers to determine
- sometimes daily - the activities of the units.
</P>
<P>
   It also attempts to address other supervisory problems that were
identified in the Board of Inquiry report.
</P>
<P>
   Among these is having supervisors on hand when search warrants
are served, as well as monitoring all reports, filing daily
activity reports and not allowing the units to work out of
locations separate from the main police station unless supervisors
are present.
</P>
<P>
   Parks also attempts to deal with problems Perez identified with
drugs, by prohibiting the units from becoming involved in any
investigation that involves primarily narcotics violations.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had detailed his own skimming of drugs from suspects as
well as his stealing it from evidence lockers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kalish said the department will continue its
various investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not giving a month off to gang members or career
criminals,'' Kalish said. ``We will continue to do the work we did.
All these officers will remain in the divisions they are now
assigned. It will be up to the watch commanders to assign the
officers to make sure there are no problems.''
