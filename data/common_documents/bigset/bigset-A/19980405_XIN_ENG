<HEADLINE> Largest Number of Adult Illiterates in India: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- India has the largest number of
adult illiterate population and maximum number of children are
deprived of their primary schooling, said a report here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report on South Asia human development for 1998, released
here by former Indian prime minister Inder Kumar Gujral, however,
sounded optimistic, saying that this state of educational
deprivation could be reversed if a fresh approach was taken to
educational priorities and policies.
</P>
<P>
The report said that one in three children in India drops out
before completing the primary cycle and one in two children does
not have access to clean drinking water at school.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the whole area in the subcontinent, the report said
that South Asia will face a catastrophe if drastic actions are not
taken to achieve universalisation of basic education in the next
five years. The region has slipped behind all other regions of the
world including sub Sahara in human development levels.

<HEADLINE> Pak Wheat Production to Exceed Target: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Food,
Agriculture and Livestock Abdul Sattar Laleka said Saturday the
wheat production this year is expected to exceed the target of 18
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is expecting a bumper wheat crop owing to better
weather conditions, enhanced agriculture credit and balanced use
of fertilizers, said the minister in an interview with PTV
(Pakistan TV).
</P>
<P>
Laleka said that small farmers, who constitute 81 per cent of
the agricultural community, took advantage of the facilities
provided by the government and cultivated a record area of 20.7
million acres this year.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had
announced an agriculture package for the farmers on April 3,
giving incentives to the small farmers having less than 12.5 acres
of land in a bid to enhance the production of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also increased the allocation of
agriculture loans from 12 billion rupees (273 million U.S. dollars
) to 30 billion rupees (682 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Owing to the government's policy to enhance wheat production,
the use of urea fertilizer was increased from 1.6 million tons to
two million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Laleka said the recent country-wide rains also helped to grow a
better wheat crop and he hoped it would enhance wheat production.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that an action is being chalked out to
produce quality seeds in a bid to boost agriculture production.
The plan will be presented for final approval shortly, said
Laleka.

<HEADLINE> Former UNITA Representative to Portugal Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Portugal has ordered former
Representative of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) Issac Wambembe to leave the country, the Angolan
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Portuguese visa office on March
30 notified Wambembe that his residence visa which expired on
March 31 would not be extended.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the resolution on sanctions against
UNITA passed in October 1997 by the United Nations Security
Council, UNITA's representing office in Portugal was renamed as
Angola Democracy Development Center, and Wambembe was the head of
the organ.
</P>
<P>
UNITA spokesman in Portugal said Saturday in Lisbon that
Wambembe is still in the capital and he has brought a suit to
court.
</P>
<P>
The notification signed by State Secretary of Interior Affairs
Armando Vara explained that Wambembe was denied residence visa
because UNITA did not complete its tasks stipulated in the 1994
Lusaka Peace Accord. And in line with the Security Council's
Resolution 1127/97, U.N. member states should restrict activities
of UNITA in their territories.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N. resolution is still in force, sanctions against
UNITA include shut-down of the overseas delegation offices of the
opposition movement and restriction on visits by its leaders and
their families.
</P>
<P>
After the sanction resolution was adopted, UNITA has renamed
many of its offices in the western states as the so-called Angola
Democracy Development Centers to continue their political
activities.
</P>
<P>
The visa office of Portugal disclosed that the decision to
order Wambembe to leave the country was made by "higher-level
leaders".

<HEADLINE> Hamas Calls for Revenge Attacks Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The militant Palestinian group
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), held a big rally in Gaza
Saturday calling for revenge attacks against Israel over the
death of Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 pro-Hamas Palestinian students held an anti-Israeli
demonstration at the campus of Gaza's Islamic University and
later marched through central streets in central city.
Protesters, waving the green Hamas flags, chanted anti-Israeli
slogans and burned Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Hamas military wing Izzedin Kassim to
launch attacks against Israeli targets inside and outside Israel
to avenge the death of Sharif, who was killed in a controversial
car bombing in Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's strong denial, Hamas has been accusing Israel
of murdering Sharif, whose burned body was found inside a bombed
car. Some reports said he was killed hours before the car bomb
was set off to cover his assassination.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned
the killing of Sharif in a statement issued by the PNA Cabinet
which met Friday night in Ramallah. The statement denounced
Sharif' killing as a "terrible crime," but it did not name who was
responsible for his death. Earlier, the Palestinian Legislative
Council issued a statement, blaming Israel for murdering Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet called on Hamas leaders to cooperate with
Palestinian security forces in continuing the investigation into
Sharif's death. It also promised to publish the investigation
results once they are achieved.
</P>
<P>
Following Sharif's death, Palestinian security heads have met
with Hamas political leaders in Gaza in an attempt to prevent
Hamas attacks against Israel. Israeli government has warned that
the PNA would be held responsible for any such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert
throughout the country to guard against possible terror attacks
by Hamas, which has not launched any attacks in Israel since
last September's bombing of the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk said the current
security alert would continue throughout the upcoming one-week
Passover holiday beginning on Monday and the Independence Day
celebrations early next month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-French Relations On Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is
visiting France on April 5-7 to give a boost to bilateral
relations which have seen a steady growth for recent years.
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, is another high-level exchange of the two sides designed
to build a long term and stable relationship, following Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to Paris in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sino-French friendship boasts a long history. In 1964, French
President Charles de Gaulle recognized the People's Republic of
China, making France the first major Western power to establish
formal ties with China. Chairman Mao Zedong and General de Gaulle
agreed to develop and strengthen bilateral relations in view of
safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
It is proved by historical facts that healthy and steady
relations between China and the Western countries not only conform
to the wish and interests of their peoples, but also are conducive
to world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Sino-French relations experienced zigzags in the early 1990s
and bilateral exchanges in some fields suffered a setback.
</P>
<P>
With renewed efforts of both governments, Sino-French relations
were normalized when President Jiang paid a state visit to
France. The visit again set into motion the engine of friendly
Sino-French cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1995, when Chirac became president of France, there
has been a new elan for the development of Sino-French
relations. High level exchanges increased. Improved political
relationship promoted bilateral cooperation in economy, trade,
science and technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
The most powerful driving force behind the steady growth of
Sino-French relations is their sharing of a similar or identical
view on the post-Cold War world situation.
</P>
<P>
The two, opposing any attempt to build a mono-polar world,
believe that the world's move toward a multi-polar structure is
accelerating. As a multi-polar world is taking shape, a reinforced
relationship between China and France, as well as between Asia and
Europe, is important in safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
That's why the leaders of the two countries attach strategic
importance to developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China and France, both permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, have major impact on world politics. They are
expected to make important contribution to the world peace through
closer consultation and stable and lasting bilateral relations of
friendly cooperation for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Iraqi crisis, China insisted on its solution
through peaceful means while France opposed the use of force
against Iraq. Both contributed to a peaceful settlement of the
crisis and won praise from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Another driving force behind Sino-French relations is the
tremendous potential for mutually beneficial cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
France believes that China's rapid economic and social
development over the past two decades is changing and will decide
the balance of the world.
</P>
<P>
But as the world's fourth largest economic power, France
currently has taken up only two percent of the Chinese market, not
in proportion with its economic might.
</P>
<P>
In the triangular economic relationships among Asia, North
America and Europe, the one between Europe and Asia is not as
strong as that between Europe and North America or between Asia
and North America.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Asia and Europe in the fields of
politics, economy and culture must be strengthened, in which the
reinforced economic and trade ties between China and France will
surely have its place.
</P>
<P>
The economic development in China not only improves the living
standards of the Chinese people but also provides new impetus for
the growth of the world economy as well as more commercial
opportunities for the developed countries. China, an emerging
market with great potentials, shares a complementary economy with
France.
</P>
<P>
Last May, President Jiang Zemin and President Jacques Chirac
signed the Sino-French Joint Declaration in Beijing, expressing
their willingness to join hands in building a multi-polar,
harmonious, more stable and peaceful world. China and France also
inked over 10 other documents to bring bilateral cooperation
into a new phase of steady development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu's visit to France will surely push further
forward the all-round development of Sino-French relations.

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Optimistic on N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Both UK Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, expressed confidence
Friday in the Northern Ireland peace process, saying an agreement
is within sight.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers made the statement after holding talks
on the intensifying Northern Irish peace process in London Friday
and pledged "intense contact" over the weekend with all the
participants of the peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, meeting on the fringes of an Asia-Europe
summit, said that a deal could be reached with "realistic
negotiation."
</P>
<P>
The deadline for a peace agreement was set for April 9, but
deep divisions still exist between Catholic and Protestant
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the peace talks, former U.S. senator
George Mitchell, said Friday evening that a political settlement
is in sight, but he had failed to complete an agenda for a
settlement as he had planned.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was originally planned to be put to the parties
involved in the peace talks Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The document was supposed to pave the way for a final
settlement early next week and to list areas of agreement and
other issues he wants to try to resolve in meetings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, UK Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and
Gerry Adams, the leader of the Irish Republican Army's political
wing Sinn Fein, also expressed optimism that a peace deal could be
reached within the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Normal Weather for Farming Expected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A near-normal agricultural season
is now being predicted by many weather watchers, helping to
slightly uplift sentiment in the farming sector and the economy
at large, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said in a
newsletter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture will be reportedly doing well while tobacco,
cotton and maize should witness increased output.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the good news on the rainfall front, overall
economic prospects still remained gloomy, the Zimbabwe News
Agency quoted the newletter as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy was officially projected to have
registered a growth rate of 3.7 percent in 1997 compared to 7.2
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe figures,
growth in 1997 was underpinned by manufacturing which grew by
18.7 percent as a percentage of GDP, up from 17.9 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is estimated to have grown by 16.5 percent down
from 17.5, mining by 3.9 percent down from 4.3 percent and
tourism by 19.1 up from 18.4 percent in 1996.

WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Searchers are still looking for
debris from a small plane that crashed in Lake Pontchartrain in
New Orleans of the United States late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lieutenant Matthew McGlynn said Saturday that two

The aircraft was flying from Denton, Texas, to New Orleans when
it vanished from radar about 16 kilometers north of New Orleans
Lakefront Airport.

<P>
One woman was recovered Friday, but three people are still

Carmen Rivera-Worley, 44, of Denton survived by clinging to

<HEADLINE> UK PM Remains Hopeful of Agreement on N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Saturday that he "remains very much full of hope" that the
parties in the Northern Ireland peace talks will be able to reach
a settlement in time for an April 9 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a television interview, Blair said the peace
process had now reached a critical stage and there was a "one-off
chance" to bring the trouble to an end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he acknowledged that there are difficulties to be
overcome as deep divisions still exist between Catholic and
Protestant leaders.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline for an agreement approaches, Northern Ireland's
main political parties involved in the peace talks are working
through the weekend in Belfast to try to hammer out a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly making progress and I remain very much full of
hope but obviously these things are difficult, they are
painstaking," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a peaceful and successful future for the province
was in reach "if we have the courage to take it," and "it's
important that we make sure the agreement we can get to is the
best."
</P>
<P>
However, the chairman of the peace talks, former U.S. senator
George Mitchell, failed to complete a draft settlement Friday as
planned.
</P>
<P>
But according to Paul Murphy, a junior minister for Northern
Ireland, the document will be produced over the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Said to Be in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Youth League of the
ruling ZANU (PF) of Zimbabwe Saturday warned that there is "open
hostility" towards the ruling party and appealed to President
Robert Mugabe to provide guidance on how best to surmount the
numerous problems bedeviling the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going session of the ZANU Youth League
National Assembly, Secretary for Youth Affairs of the Natinal
Youth League Josiah Tungamirai said: "the party is in crisis and
only a fool can claim otherwise," reported the Zimbabwe News
Agnecy.
</P>
<P>
The youth league natinal assembly session, held at Kushinga
Phikelela College in east Zimbabwe, was attended by President
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Josiah Tungamirai said that for the past three to four years
apathy had enveloped political activity throughout the country so
much that the 1995 general elections and the 1996 presidential
elections were marked by very low turnouts.
</P>
<P>
He said in the rural areas, former liberation war
collaborators were now working to discredit ZANU, leaving party
youths quite uneasy.
</P>
<P>
"As the youth of the party and as future leaders, we find it
quite difficult to fulfil our vanguard role as defenders and
protagonists of ZANU not because of lack of trying but for lack
of any clear vision on where ZANU wants to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that factionalism had grown "deep roots" in the party
politburo and had gone down to the cell.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need for soul-searching and self-examination
by the party leadership if they were to understand the magnitude
of the problem.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Syria to Hold Summit on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese and Syrian presidents are
expected to hold talks on Monday in Damascus to discuss Israel's
lastest withdrawal offer from south Lebanon, the official National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The summit, between Lebanon's Elias Hrawi and Syria's Hafez
al-Assad, will draft a joint counter offensive to confront Israel's
withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries believe the offer is an
"diplomatic campaign" through which Israel attempted to give the
world an impression that Israel offers to withdraw its troops from
Lebanon while the Beirut government refuses the peace move, the
news agency added.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel inner cabinet formally approved for the
first time in the past 20 years the U.N. Resolution 425, which
calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But it linked the implementation of the resolution with
negotiated security arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have firmly rejected the offer, denouncing
it as a "maneuver" aimed at drawing Lebanon into separate
negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria, which deploys 40,000 troops in
Lebanon, have always insisted that Lebanese and Syrian tracks are
inseparable in peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa have reportedly flew to Paris and are expected to
meet with French President Jacques Chirac on Sunday for talks on
the Israeli offer. An imminent French initiative on the issue of
south Lebanon will be on the top of the discussions between the
leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that France has proposed a plan for a
deployment in south Lebanon of 15,000 peace-keeping troops drawn
from France and its former colonies in Africa in the event of the
Israel withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But there has been no confirmation of the report from any
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon with the aim of protecting its northern villages and
towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also occupying Syria's Golan Heights, which was
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

</P>
<P>
Zhu made this remark in meeting with the U.N. chief, adding
China attaches great importance to the world body's role in
safeguarding world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the United Nations and China have enjoyed very
good cooperation in the past and expressed the hope that this
sound cooperation will continue.
</P>
<P>

several of his counterparts of the ASEM countries: Rumano Prodi of
Italy, Bertie Ahern of Ireland, Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, Pavvo
Lipponen of Finland, Phan Van Khai of Vietnam and Chuan Leekpai of
Thailand, separately at the sidelines of the ASEM meeting on
Saturday.
</P>

with their countries and is ready to further develop such
relations with them on the basis of the five principles of
peaceful coexistence.

between China and the six countries will reach a new level of
development.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Iran to Join Efforts on Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov and Iranian Petroleum Minister Bijan
Namdar-Zanganeh held talks here Saturday on a joint oil policy to
cope with the price crisis, according to the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said during the meeting that Tehran
sharply cut its oil production to prevent the prices from further
falling. He called on major oil producers and exporters to follow
its example.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said, "Russia is interested in improving the state of
the world market but is simultaneously pursuing a consistent
policy of supporting its own oil producers."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Russian government is drawing up measures
to dampen the effects of low oil prices on bigger Russian oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
Russia intends to hold talks with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Moscow this month to hammer out a
coordinated policy on the international oil market, Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Namdar-Zanganeh said that Russian fuel and energy companies
will be granted priority in implementing joint projects on Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Russia has suffered heavy losses of about
5 trillion U.S. dollars due to the lower oil price in the
international market, so Russian acting Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on March 25 firmly refused the requirement from OPEC to
reduce its oil production.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Optimistic About S. Leone's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth said Saturday that
it is optimistic about the future of Sierra Leone after an
assessment tour by a team of the 50-strong organization earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
The first proof for it is the quick constitution of a cabinet
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah following his restoration on
March 10, said a deputy secretary-general of Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the cabinet is trying to reconciliate the various
opinions in the country with opposition leaders, a move which
will help create favorable environment for re-building the
war-ravaged country, the official said, quoted by a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
To assist Sierra Leone's reconstruction, the official said,
the Commonwealth will firstly help the country develop a policy
for the mining sector, especially the diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
Other things need to be done will include the construction of
a sound judicial system, the re-organization of the police force
and the generation of small businesses for profit making.
</P>
<P>
Despite the help of the international community, observers
noted, it is still a daunting job for Kabbah's government to
re-build the country, one of the world's poorest and member of
the Commonwealth, whose development has been stalled by the civil
war since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The coup, which ousted Kabbah and his government last May, and
the ensuing fightings to overthrow the coupists even led to the
destruction of almost all infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still going on in the eastern part of the country
between the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG and the
remnants of the military junta and allied rebel forces.

<HEADLINE> Three Palestinian Protesters Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinians
were wounded in East Jerusalem Saturday by Israeli soldiers as
the Palestinians continued protesting the murder of Hamas bomb
maker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian youths held rally in the Abu Dis Arab
village in East Jerusalem to protest against the killing of
Sharif. The protesters later rioted by throwing stones at Israeli
soldiers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse them,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's strong denial, Hamas has been accusing Israel
of murdering Sharif, whose burned body was found inside a bombed
car. Some reports said he was killed hours before the car bomb
was set off to cover his assassination.
</P>
<P>
At least three protesters were wounded by rubber bullets, but
some reports put the number of injured at six.
</P>
<P>
Protests were also held in Gaza and several towns in the West
Bank. In Halhul between Jerusalem and Hebron, Israeli armed
patrol vehicles came under stone attacks by Palestinians. The
Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas in response.
No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
In Qalqilyah, Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli
soldiers by throwing stones. The rioting was brought control by
Palestinian police, who arrived to separate the protesters from
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the biggest rally held in Gaza, over 1,000 pro-Hamas
Palestinian students gathered at the campus of the Islamic
University and later marched through downtown streets of the
city. Protesters, waving the green Hamas flags, chanted
anti-Israeli slogans and burned Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Hamas military wing Izzedin Kassim to
launch attacks against Israeli targets inside and outside Israel
to avenge the death of Sharif, who was killed in a controversial
car bombing in Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert across the
country to prevent possible Hamas revenge attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
has held talks with visiting Iranian Interior Minister Abdullah
Nouri on further promoting bilateral relations, Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on Saturday night, Nouri expressed
satisfaction with the "excellent level of the Saudi-Iranian
relations which have been improving steadily," the KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister arrived in Saudi Arabia on March 25 to
perform the hajj and has held talks with Saudi Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
other officials.
</P>
<P>
Nouri conveyed to the Saudi monarch gratitude of Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami for inviting him to visit the
kingdom. He told the king that Khatami will respond to the
invitation "in the nearest possible opportunity," the KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, who made a short visit to the kingdom last month, King
Fahd delivered an invitation to Khatami to visit the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammed Reza
Nouri was quoted by the KUNA as saying that the Iranian president
is keen on improving relations with Saudi Arabia for serving
interests of the two Islamic countries and of the region and
Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian president Ali Akbar Rafsanjani paid a two-week
visit to the kingdom starting from February 21, during which he
held wide-scale talks with King Fahd on boosting bilateral ties
and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During Rafsanjani's visit, the two countries agreed to set up a
joint committee aimed at looking into means to upgrade bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two largest oil producers in the Gulf,
strained following Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, have been
warming up since last year when Iran started to make initiatives
to reconciliate with the Gulf Arab neighbors.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
told the upcoming issue of Time magazine that he would have mixed
feelings about the dismissal of Paula Jones's sexual harassment
suit against him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "If I were just a private citizen, Joe Six-Pack,
I would have mixed feelings about not getting a chance to disprove
these allegations in court. But I don't have mixed feelings as
president, because having the case dismissed and putting this
behind us is plainly in the best interest of the country."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the charges against him in the suit are not true,
adding, "The judge ruled as a matter of law the case had no merit.
And that exposed the raw political nature of this whole
situation."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Supreme Court case that allowed the Jones
case to proceed while he serves as president, Clinton said, "I
tried as hard as I could to put this and Whitewater in the
smallest possible box and let it be handled by others and to
respond only when required. But now we see why for over 200 years
no one had any idea the president should be subject to a civil
suit and believed that the chances were that if one were filed, it
would have an overwhelming political aspect to it."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Security Service Accused of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the radical Islamic
group Hamas Sunday accused the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service (PSS) of killing Hamas' leading activist Muhi Sharif,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hamas leader in Gaza Abdel Aziz Rantisi was quoted by the radio
as saying that the PSS has arrested Sharif, tortured him to death
and dumped his body in a booby-trapped car before detonating it in
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi said that during the questioning, Sharif may have
confessed or given the names of contacts to Palestinian security
officials, who he said started rounding up Hamas activists after
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The body of Sharif, who was suspected of being Hamas' main
bombmaker and masterminding several suicide bombing attacks in
Israel, was found last Sunday in an explosive-rigged car detonated
by a remote control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials have hinted that Israel was
involved in the killing. But Israel has categorically denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi said that Hamas is investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Izzadin Kassam, Hamas' military wing, to
continue its struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials were quoted by Israel Radio as saying
that Hamas has rejected a request by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) that the group refrain from carrying out attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ami Ayalon, head of Israeli General Security
Service, Sunday briefed the Israeli cabinet on the situation in
the Palestinian self-rule areas after the death of Sharif and the
steps which have been taken by the Israeli security forces to
prevent terror attacks.

<P>
Kampala, April 5 (Xinhua) -- One woman was killed and 10
others were wounded Saturday night in Kampala in two separate
blasts, witnesses and police sources told Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victim was a waitress, and the injured, including three
Burundi nationals, three Ugandans and a Kenyan have been sent to
local Mulago Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were caused by hand grenades thrown into a hotel at
09:30 p.m. and into Nile Grill near Uganda House two hours later
in central Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks for the time
being but some local people said they might be terrorist
activities of anti-government rebels.
</P>
<P>
There are two main rebel groups in the country: the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) acting in the north and the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) operating in the west.
</P>
<P>
Everything is going normally in the city Sunday. But local
business community said the blasts may have serious influence on
the business confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
John Kisembo, the police deputy inspector general, was robbed
of a cellular phone, a watch and other things including a pistol
in Hotel Africana in the city Tuesday, the official New Vision

<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunication lines
between Uganda and its neighbors including Burundi, Rwanda and
Tanzania have been cut off by rat gnawing, "The New Vision" paper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cables at Nkasi telecommunication repeater station
amplifying signals in Central Mpigi District have been nibbled by
the rodents, experts determined Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The station was established in the eighties. Most of its six
kilometers-long lines is very bushy and need constant
maintenance. But the last inspection was held 18 months ago. Such
equipment in the station needs routine check, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication link between the center and the west of
the country has also been damaged, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Telecommunication limited has sent its specialists to
repair the cables and equipment in the station.

WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Though it has declined from its peak in the early 1990s,
violent crime has become a far more common threat in most of the
Washington suburbs than it was 20 years ago, a Washington Post
analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- American businesses are furiously lobbying U.S. Congress to
approve 18 billion U.S. dollars for the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) so the Asian bailout can continue.
</P>
<P>
-- As the world's second largest economy, Japan lurches to a
standstill, possibly threatening to cause a global slowdown.
Paradoxically, the fundamental reasons are not economic.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ban Gift-giving to Superiors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet is considering a
ban on gift-giving to superiors or their families in a bid to wipe
out corruption and favoritism, a government source said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expected to approve the ban at its meeting next
Tuesday, the source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The ban will require government officials as well as state
enterprise employees to strictly follow the regulations or face
disciplinary action, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The rules, however, do not apply to the social etiquette of
gift-giving or donations. In such a situation, the maximum value
of a gift must not exceed 500 baht (12.5 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The regulation proposed by the Office of the Prime Minister has
been considered by the Civil Service Commission, the Counter
Corruption Commission and the National Culture Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is a follow-up of a cabinet resolution adopted
last year by the previous government.

<HEADLINE> PNA Asks U.S. to Be Serious With Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Trade and
Economy Maher Masri Sunday called on the U.S. to "deal seriously
with" the Oslo accords provisions it brokered between the
Palestinians and Israelis in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs Radio
from Nablus in West Bank, Masri criticized a U.S. decision to
postpone revealing a new initiative to break the year-long
deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, brought by U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross
to Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his recent
shuttling tour of the region, has never been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Masri held Israeli leaders responsible for the fact. "The
Palestinian side has positively dealt with the American
suggestion. The postponement is due to Israel's rejection of the
proposal," Masri told the Cairo-based radio.
</P>
<P>
The proposals have dealt with the transitional stage talks,
implementation of the Israeli troops redeployment along with
avoiding unilateral actions, Israeli settlement expansion in
particular, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Masri urged the Clinton administration to officially declare
the initiative which reportedly stipulates that Israel withdraws
from 13.1 percent of West Bank, accompanied by security
cooperation of the Palestinians. But the proposal was snubbed by
both Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Washington has reportedly backtracked
in the face of pressure of the Jewish lobby in the U.S. Congress
and postponed declaring its Mideast peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was quoted as saying
that Washington would not now declare its idea for reactivating
the peace process and would be content with sustaining its
endeavors without declaring it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled for more
than a year over Israeli settlement activities in Arab East
Jerusalem and the long overdue Israeli pullback in West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands went right back
to lead their Davis Cup world group tie with Belgium after winning
the doubles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jan Siemerink and Jacco Eltingh defeated hosts Filip Dewulf and
Libor Pimek 6-1, 6-4 and 6-4 in one hour 45 minutes to put the
Dutch team 2-1 up.
</P>
<P>
Though rooted for by a weekend home crowd, Dewulf and Pimek
still could not live up to the expectation of the Belgians, in
that they turned out no match to their Dutch pairing.
</P>
<P>
Siemerink, ranked 29th on the ATP tour, next plays Dewulf in
the first of the reverse singles and this year's Rotterdam
finalist could well seal off the Dutch-Belgian world group first
rounder on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Dutch played better than most thought he would
on clay court though he was believed to be stronger on faster
courts. He also finished semi-finalist at this year's London and
Copenhagen open tourneys.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Dutch-Belgian tie will next meet in the world
group quarter-finals the winner of the United States-Russia tie.
</P>
<P>
The Americans and Russians now shared a one-all draw in
Atlanta, United States.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs to Protest Police Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Following the Saturday clashes
between Israeli Arabs and police in a northern Israeli Bedouin
village, Israeli Arabs are to hold a general strike Monday to
protest police violence.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by the Israeli Arabs Supreme Council,
the highest organization of the Israeli Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
The violent clashes erupted Saturday night in the Sued village
near the northern city of Shfaram when Arab residents threw stones
at police, who tried to demolish three buildings rebuilt without
licenses from Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Police fired live ammunition and used tear gas and batons to
disperse the rioters. At least a dozen of protesters and 22
policemen were injured in the clashes. About 15 protesters were
detained for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The clashes triggered strong reaction from Israeli leftist
politicians, as both factions of the Communist Hadash Party and
Meretz party in the Knesset (Parliament) accused the government of
using unnecessary forces in quelling the rioting.
</P>
<P>
The Hadash blasted the police for using "brutal forces"
against Arabs, including live fire and tear gas. It said the
Bedouin residents were only protesting against the demolition of
their houses and their protests had no political or nationalistic
motives.
</P>
<P>
Meretz said the police action on the eve of Muslim feast of the
sacrifice showed the government's insensitivity towards the
sentiments among Israeli Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
Knesset's Interior Committee announced that it would hold a
special session to discuss the Shfaram clashes. Committee Chairman
Salah Tarif of the leading opposition Labor party said the police
and Interior Ministry's actions on the eve of Muslim holiday were
unnecessary. He warned against sparking a new wave of violence in
the Galilee region, where most of the country's 1 million Israeli
Arabs are living.
</P>
<P>
The clash was one of the worst confrontations between Israeli
troops and Arab Israelis in 20 years, who have been protesting
discrimination and confiscation of properties by Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Arabs closely associate with the Palestinians in
the territories and support their struggle against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, Arabs across Israel observed a general strike and
held protests to mark the Land Day dedicated to six Arabs killed
in a protest against Israel's confiscation of land in 1976.

YINCHUAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- "Overseas-funded enterprises have
the right to refuse any unlawful levies," Ma Qizhi, acting
chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's government,
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the announcement at a working conference on opening
the region's economy wider to the outside world. He also said that
government departments and individuals may not check on the
work in overseas-funded enterprises without the appropriate
permission.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked region in northwest China has made remarkable
progress in improving its investment environment during the past
few years, he said. However, problems remain that need to be
addressed, including illicit levies and interference with the
decision-making power of overseas-funded businesses under the
pretext of enhancing management.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, Ma said the items and the prices of the
lawful levies will be announced to the public in accordance with
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a leading group for further opening-up headed by
senior local officials will soon be set up to discuss and solve
problems. Service and complaint centers should be established by
governments at the regional, city and prefectural levels as soon
as possible to safeguard the legal rights of overseas-funded
enterprises, Ma said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A new batch of 1,500 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) released by Iran have returned to their
homeland, the Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Iraq, in a reciprocal measure, released 89
Iranian detainees captured during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88) in the latest POW exchange.
</P>
<P>
A swap ceremony, the third in four days, was held Saturday
evening and supervised by the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) at the border city of al-Mundhariya.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, Iran set free two batches of about
1,800 Iraqi POWs, and Iraq released 112 Iranians under scheduled
program agreed on by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that in this biggest release of POWs
since 1991, Iran will release nearly 5,600 Iraqis in exchange
for 380 Iranian prisoners held by Iraq. In 1990, the two
countries exchanged 39,000 POWs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been accusing each other of holding
POWs, which had remained a major obstacle to the resumption of
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
During the bloody war in the 1980s, an estimated 1 million
Iranians and Iraqis were killed or wounded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Global Bonds Over-subscribed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The floating of 500 million dollars

</P>

The Philippine bonds issue is expected to be better priced than
a forthcoming issue by South Korea, which is anticipated to be
priced within the range of 350 and 400 basis points, Enriquez
said.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the Philippine bonds issue is significant because
"it made the Philippines the first Asian country to access the
voluntary capital markets after the eruption of the currency
turmoil."
</P>
<P>
The floating of the bonds raised a significant amount of
resources from institutional investors (not banks), many of whom
are investing in the Philippines for the first time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will open up access by Philippine infrastructure projects
to new sources of financing in the future," said the secretary.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said that the bonds will relieve pressure on domestic
interest rates and boost international reserves, which will
enhance financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the favorable pricing and long maturity manifest
investors' strong confidence in the continuity of economic reforms
and recognition of the resilience of the Philippine economy amid
the on-going currency turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan to Joint Hands in Water Conservancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- In a joint venture designed to
strengthen its ties with Jordan, Israel has agreed in principle to
allow Lack Galilee to act as a reservoir for water from a river in
Jordan, local daily Haaretz reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Jordan will then be able to use more
effectively the water from the Yarmouk River, which lies near the
Israeli-Jordanian border.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan will not be able to draw out more water than
it diverted from the Yarmouk in any one year. As a result, the
project will not lead to any net change in Israel's water supply.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the project without overflowing the lake,
Israel will divert water from the upper Jordan River, which is
currently the main source of the lake, to a pipeline that will
carry it to the National Water Carrier.
</P>
<P>
The report said that negotiations on the project were
conducted in secret over the past months, with the initiative
coming from both Jordan and Israel's water commissions.
</P>
<P>
The final understanding between the two countries was reached
during the visit of Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan to Israel on
March 10. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave his
consent to the project even though initially he had doubts about
its diplomatic ramification. Planning and engineering work will
begin soon.
</P>
<P>
Israelis' reactions to the understanding have been mixed,
especially in the defense establishment and among water experts.
</P>
<P>
Opponents charged that Israel has inappropriately given a third
party direct access to Lake Galilee, a crucial strategic reservoir.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that Jordan will increasingly request more
water to help alleviate its chronic shortages. According to this
view, a dangerous mutual dependence is liable to develop,
ultimately giving rise to conflicts despite the original good
intentions.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, advocates of the plan said that the project
will draw Israel and Jordan closer together. Assistance to Jordan
will facilitate cooperation in other spheres as well, and the
water pact will be presented as one of the fruits of the peace
treaty signed in 1994 between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts said that diverting water from the upper
Jordan River into the National Water Carrier will reduce water
prices in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Instead of pumping the water up from Lake Galilee, which is 209
meters below sea level, water will be taken from the upper Jordan,
which is 150 meters above the sea level, thus enabling the water
to flow by force of gravity.

<HEADLINE> EU to Send Mission to Help Asian Economies Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
send a mission to Asian countries including Malaysia in an effort
to help Asian economies recover, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The EU mission, which will come at the earliest possible time,
would explore investment opportunities in Asia, among other
things, Mahathir told reporters at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport upon returning from the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM
2) in London.
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis of the mission is that it is a non fact-finding
one because if it is a fact-finding mission they may find facts
which could discourage them from investing here. Instead it is a
mission to help towards economic recovery through investment and
the like," Mahathir told an airport press conference.
</P>
<P>
The sending of the mission, mooted by South Korea, was one of
the decisions at the three-day ASEM 2, which was attended by the
leaders of the 15 EU members and 10 Asian countries, Mahathir
said, adding although the proposal for the mission came from South
Korea, the meeting agreed that it should cover all Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was convinced that the EU had not only
understood the current economic situation in Asia but were also
keen in cooperating with countries in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh observed the World Health
Day Sunday, underlining the importance of "safe motherhood."
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
issued separate messages on the eve of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
"It is of utmost importance to ensure service deliveries to
pregnant women to reduce the mortality rate," the president said
in his message.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister in her message underscored the need for
strengthening the health education campaign to reduce the mother
and child mortality rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Day falls on April 7, but it was observed in
Bangladesh on Sunday because of the three-day Eid-ul-Azha, the
second biggest festival for the Moslems, starting from next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, 92 percent of childbirth take place at home,
according to the WHO (the World Health Organization)
representative in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the technology for safe birth was available, but it was
not accessible due to ignorance and poverty. Therefore, child
mortality per 1,000 living is as high as 76.8, the official figure
shows.

TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's national champion Takao
Suzuki clinched the final match by beating New Zealand 3-2 in
Miyazaki, Japan, on Sunday to secure a place in the playoff for
joining the Davis Cup tennis World Group.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old, who pulled off a big upset win over ace Brett
Steven on Friday, beat Teo Susnjak 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1, to
win the Asia Oceania zone Group One second round tie.
</P>
<P>
The third set went with serves till Suzuki won a deuce to score
the only break of the set and he chalked up a 4-0 lead over a
disappointed Susnjak in the fourth set before closing the
183-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, New Zealand tied the contest when Steven, determined
to restore pride after a three-set loss on Friday, came back from
one set down twice to beat Toichi Motomura 3-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
in three hours two minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Japan has defeated New Zealand, thanks
largely to the specially-built slow clay court surface here. Japan
have lost the previous three encounters in 1979, 1993 and 1994.

XI'AN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people from all
walks of life in the city of Baoji today participated in
activities to commemorate Yan Di, one of two legendary ancestors
of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Baoji, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is believed to be
the native place of Yan Di, also known as Shennong, and April 5
each year is the Chinese Qingming Festival, an occasion for people
to visit ancestral graves.
</P>
<P>
Yan Di and Huang Di, who also was known as the Yellow Emperor,
are believed to be the ancestors of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, 10,000 Chinese from home and abroad
today gathered at the site of the tomb of Huang Di for a memorial
ceremony for their ancient ancestor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Mozambican Refugees Demand to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 Somali refugees
staying in northern Kenya, claiming that they were Mozambican
descendants, demand to return to their ancestral homeland in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The refugees said their forefathers had been taken to Somalia
from northern Mozambique as slaves.
</P>
<P>
But the Mozambican government find it hard to decide whether
to agree to allow them to go back to Mozambique, Domingo, the
Sunday paper published here said today.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early for the government to make any
prediction (for the refugees' fate)," Fernando Fazenda, director
at the Refugee Assistance Center, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fazenda, who had ever visited some refugee camps in Kenya with
a delegation, said that some of the refugees are characterized
with apparent Mozambican culture, with some of them able to speak
the dialect in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said the plight of the refugees, who are treated as cheap
labors, is very hard, but the Mozambican government has to
consider the issue very carefully before making any decision, as
they might be a heavy burden to the country.
</P>
<P>
Once Mozambique decided to receive these refugees, he said,
the international society should shoulder the responsibility of
assisting in their settlement to ease the pressure upon
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Fazenda noted that his country still faces the problem of
settling about two million dismobilized military personnel, war
refugees and dislodged people during the civil war.

<HEADLINE> China's Service Trade Developing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's international service
trade has grown at an average annual rate of 15.4 percent in the
last two decades, higher than the world's average.
</P>
<P>
China's service trade volume surged from 5.54 billion
U.S. dollars in 1982 to 43.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995,
according to the International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's service trade has kept pace with merchandise trade, the
paper reported, which has helped promote their mutual development.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's international service trade has been
based on the surging service sector since China initiated the
reform and opening-up policy two decades ago, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of China's service sector in its gross domestic
product (GDP) shot up from 20 percent in 1982 to 30.7 percent in
1995, and the service sector has grown by an average annual rate
of 11.2 percent in this period, 0.6 percent higher than that of
the GDP, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted 1996 statistics showing that China's
service exports were 19.62 billion U.S. dollars, mainly from
tourism, banking and cargo transportation services. The import
figure for 1996 was 21.36 billion U.S. dollars, mainly from cargo
transportation, banking and tourism services.
</P>
<P>
China's major service trade partners are Hong Kong, Japan and
the United States, the newspaper reported, adding that China's
service trade also shifted from a trade surplus to a deficit.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's has eight categories of international
service trade: cargo transportation, insurance, port supply and
labor services, tourism, banking, posts and telecommunications,
contracting for labor services and governmental exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Army Chief of Staff Has to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Georg Meiring, the chief of
staff of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), has
been given two choices: resign or be fired, the newspaper City
Press quoted unidentified sources as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meiring has been facing sharp criticism from the government
for days after he handed President Nelson Mandela a report
compiled by the Military Intelligence (MI), alleging senior
members of the African National Congress (ANC) were plotting a
coup against the government.
</P>
<P>
A top-level government team, consisting of several key
ministers, has met with Meiring to convey the govenrment's
decision that he should either step down himself or be fired.
</P>
<P>
The team consisted of Defense Minister Joe Modise, his deputy
Ronnie Kasril, Minister of Justice and Intelligence Dullah Omar
and Mandela's senior legal advisor Fink Haysom.
</P>
<P>
Meiring was authorized by the Government of National Unity
headed by Mandela to take up the job in 1994, when the first
non-racial general elections in South Africa took place.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources revealed at the weekend that a package has
already been worked out for Meiring. The government team was
scheduled to discuss with Meiring what he would receive if he
chose to voluntarily resign, and what he would receive if he was
fired.
</P>
<P>
An announcement is expected to be made before Wednesday next
week on the decision after Meiring has given the government team
a response.
</P>
<P>
The order calling for Meiring to resign or be fired came after
senior SANDF generals made a similar call to Mandela when they
met with him last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the generals, who had distinguished military
experience and are held in high esteem by their former liberation
armies, are said to have been identified in the Meiring report as
being part of the coup plotters.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that SANDF chief of staff Lieutenant
General Siphiwe Nyanda was among the coup plotters. Other
conspirator, whose names have not been made public, are said to
include all the ex-Umkonto we Sizwe (MK) cadres who now occupy
the most senior positions in the SANDF.
</P>
<P>
MK was the military wing of the ANC before it took over state
power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The generals who met Mandela are said to have expressed
misgivings about any future working relationship with Meiring in
the SANDF.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Mandela to get rid of the entire staff of
the MI, which made up largely of elements from the previous
regime. MI was still haunted by the past and is resisting and
even sabotaging change, the generals said.
</P>
<P>
One general described the MI as "rotten to the core" and
"unreformable."
</P>
<P>
In meeting with the generals, Mandela reportedly said that he
did not doubt the loyalty of any of the senior members of the
armed forces who had been implicated in the MI report which
claims there was a plot against the government.
</P>
<P>
Local press said the decision to dissolve the MI is a
political matter and can only be carried out by Mandela. It is
inconceivable that the president will ignore the calls of the
generals.

automatically, but one country or region can only have two at the
most for each event.
</P>
<P>

HONG KONG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A controversial second try in
the decisive penalty shoot-out brought South Korea's defending
champion Pohang Steelers to a 6-5 win over China's Dalian Wanda in
the final and the crown of the 17th Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) Club Championship here Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Zambian Copper Mines Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Economics Association of
Zambia (EAZ) has criticized the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) for its way of privatizing its mines, alleging that the
exercise lacks a clear vision.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted EAZ Chairman Moses Banda as
charging that the whole issue of privatization lacks a clear
concept of the objectives, methodology of disposal and a vision
of what privatization entails.
</P>
<P>
Banda said in statement released here that as far as ZCCM
privatization is concerned the bundling of assets in packages
leaves the government to the whims of the bidders who have formed
consortiums which in turn weaken Zambia's bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
Big packages only encourage large bidders to dictate the
terms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banda said since mid 1997 the government and a ZCCM
negotiating team have assured all interested parties that a
favorable agreement is in the offing. However, the association is
at the same time not surprised at the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the best option will be to put ZCCM under a
private management contract, a measure which will give confidence
to the lenders and even the share-holders.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the next wave of privatization, the
remaining companies and divisions should further be unbundled and
be given private management contracts.
</P>
<P>
Banda made the criticism and suggestion after negotiations on
sale of Zambia's two biggest copper mines collapsed recently.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines have
collapsed due to disagreements between the Kafue Consortium and
the ZCCM privatization team.
</P>
<P>
Last month Falconbridge, a leading Canadian mining company
pulled out of the Konkola deep project consortium, citing lower
copper price as the reason for the pull-out.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement, the
annual copper output of Zambia, one of the biggest
copper-producing countries in the world, has decreased gradually
to about 300,000 tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<HEADLINE> EU-Nigeria Relation Facing Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The unnoticed withdrawal of the
head of the European Union (EU) mission in Nigeria has indicated
that the cold relationship between Nigeria and members of the
Union is far from thawing.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there is no sign of a soon-to-arrive
replacement of Jeremy Tunnacliffe, the head of the mission, who
left Nigeria on March 16 without ceremonies for his new post in
Bosnia, mission sources here said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guardian paper Sunday, even top officials at
the EU mission here were taken by surprise as they got hint of
Tunnacliffe's recall by the headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"He worked normally the previous day but the next day we were
hurriedly called in for the hand-over," an official said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the EU might not send in a new envoy until
the Nigerian government makes real its pronounced commitment to
hand over to civil rule and uphold the tenets of human rights
initially by the release of political detainees.
</P>
<P>
EU aids to Nigeria were suspended in November 1995 shortly
after the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni minority
activists.
</P>
<P>
The execution also led to the suspension of Nigeria's
membership in the Commonwealth and sanctions against the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The European parliament is already pushing for stiffer
sanctions against Nigeria if a genuine transition to civil rule
does not occur by October this year.
</P>
<P>
The measures considered include a total arms embargo, a
provision forbidding the sponsorship of trade missions to Nigeria
by EU member states, maintaining current sanctions against and
freezing financial assets held in the EU by the Nigerian
government, top government officials and their families.
</P>
<P>
It might be a result of the frosty relations that
ambassadors-designate appointed by the Nigerian government to
some of these European countries were being delayed from
presenting their letters of credence on many occasions, according
to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rules out Imminent Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's presidential political
advisor Osama el-Baz has ruled out the convening of an Arab summit
in the near future, the Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the summit, not the summit per se, is what
counts," Baz said in an interview with a program of the local Nile
TV aired Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said that Arab leaders will not hesitate to call a
summit "if it might really serve the Arab cause in a specific
point or augment the Arab rights in a definite area."
</P>
<P>
His statement came amid ripe speculation that efforts were
underway for an Arab mini-summit before the end of this month to
take stock of the year-long deadlock in peace-making and chart the
future course of Arab solidarity. Cairo hosted the last Arab
summit in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The anticipation was fueled by a meeting in Riyadh last Monday
of foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia as well as
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, after American Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross once again failed to bridge the gap
between Israel and the Palestinian to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Arab capitals are looking forward to the revelation of the
U.S. apocalyptic proposal in order to thaw the frozen peace
process," el-Baz said, hoping that the U.S. administration will
disclose the initiative by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy-making team is giving finishing touches on the
initiative in light of Ross' latest tour in the region, according
to el-Baz, who is believed to be the brain behind Egypt's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz also tentatively set Thursday or Friday as when the
U.S. initiative might be unleashed. Washington reportedly wants
Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, in exchange
for security cooperation from the Palestinians. But both Israel
and the Palestinians were cool to the idea.
</P>
<P>
In favor of the fresh U.S. efforts to unblock the peace
deadlock, Egypt urged the U.S. to come up with a formal initiative
which it said must be "balanced and consistent with signed
agreements."
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said "neither (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin
Netanyahu nor any person of his like can threaten the
U.S. administration." He was referring to the Netanyahu's attempt
to lobby Jewish friends in the American Congress against the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official further called upon the U.S. to formulate
a mechanism that would put the initiative into action, saying that
application of any agreement or initiative is more important than
the initiative itself, whether it is "an American or a European
one."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for more
than a year over Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem and long-delayed military pullback in the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Suspension Bridge Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The 3,911-meter Akashi Kaikyo
Bridge, the world's longest suspension bridge, opened to traffic
Sunday afternoon in Western Japan, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the bridge, which connects Kobe and
Awaji Island, both in Hyogo Prefecture, Western Japan, ceremonies
were held at both ends of the bridge with about 1,300 guests
attending, including Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess
Masako.
</P>
<P>
The new bridge, which measures 1,991 meters between its two
towers, exceeds the previous record of 1,410 meters that the
Humber Estuary Bridge in Humberside, Britain, had held since
opening in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The motor-vehicles-only bridge completes the 89-kilometer
Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway connecting Kobe and Naruto in
Tokushima Prefecture on the western Japanese main island of
Shikoku.
</P>
<P>
It costs some 500 billion yen (about 3.8 billion dollars) to
build the bridge. Work started in May 1988.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles can now travel between Kobe and Tokushima in 100
minutes, compared with three hours by ferry.
</P>
<P>
Developers said they expect the bridge to lure tourists from
the Kinki region, which includes Japan's second largest city of
Osaka, to Shikoku and Awaji Island.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Killing Hamas Leader Hampers Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official has said
that the killing of the Islamic Resistance Movement's (Hamas)
leader Muhei Eddine Sharif in the West Bank city Ramallah would
hamper the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times newspaper Sunday quoted Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Information Abdullah Ensour as
saying that "the episode of assassination and counter
assassination irrespective of its source is a matter that
contributes to the stalemate in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We call upon all the parties to live up to their commitments
to reach a just solution that will guarantee peace for all,"
Ensour said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
implement the agreements signed with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to spare the region an escalation of tension.
</P>
<P>
"Partial solutions or any delay in implementing them,
especially those agreed upon publicly, will lead to nothing but
more violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan denounced "terrorism" no matter what its "sources or
excuses" were, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, a leader of the Izzaddin Kassam, the military wing of
Hamas, was shot dead before his body was dumped into a car that
exploded last Sunday in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Hamas blamed Israel for the assassination and vowed to avenge
the death of Sharif with blood-shed. But Israel denied the charge
against it.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Invest in Israeli Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The global software giant
Microsoft is being tempted into dabbling its virtual toes in
venture capital by an Israeli investment company, local daily
Haaretz reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Israeli company Aura Investments Research
and Development is negotiating to bring Microsoft and other
companies into a special venture capital fund as strategic and
financial investors.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which has already reached an advanced stage of
raising capital, is intended to manage a volume of between 60
million and 80 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the negotiations are successfully concluded, it will mark
the first time Microsoft has ever invested in any venture capital
endeavor. Until now, Microsoft has confined itself to direct
investments by taking over high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the scope of investment by Microsoft and the
other companies in the fund is not clear. However, local capital
market sources predict that the total volume of the fund will be
larger than originally anticipated if Microsoft joins in.
</P>
<P>
According to the definitions set by Aura, the new venture fund
will invest in Israeli companies engaged mainly in
Internet-related technology and multimedia companies.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's executive vice
president for sales and supports and one of the company's
dominant figures, is expected to visit Israel within a few weeks,
apparently to continue the talks with Aura.
</P>
<P>
Ballmer is supervising Microsoft's side for the negotiations
on investment in the Aura venture capital fund.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Pardon 1,200 Prisoners in Greater Bairam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- About 1,200 prisoners will be freed
on Tuesday as Egypt starts to celebrate the Greater Bairam, or the
feast of the sacrifice in the Islamic world, the Egyptian Gazette
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language newspaper, all those to be
released must have served at least half of their sentences and
have a record of good conduct during imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
But those convicts for crimes related to immorality, terrorism
and drugs are not eligible to the seasonal pardon.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Prisons Department told reporters
Saturday that on the first day of the four-day feast, prisoners
will be allowed to meet scholars and theologians from Al Azhar,
the most prestigious seat for Islamic learning, to discuss
religious and cultural matters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the exceptional visits allowed, a number of
entertainment programs will also be organized for the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
This will be Egypt's second amnesty in less than three months.
Altogether 1,600 prisoners were set free on January 29 under the
same conditions on the occasion of the Lesser Bairam following the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects PNA to Clear Its Name in Sharif's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel is expecting the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to clear its name in the
alleged assassination of Hamas bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif,
Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has promised to publish the results of its probe into
the mysterious death of Sharif, whose deformed body was found
inside a car that exploded last Sunday in the West Bank city
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes the PNA investigation would exonerate its alleged
involvement in Sharif's death so as to reduce the motivation of
Islamic Resistance Movement for launching terror attacks against
it.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has blamed Israeli agents for killing Sharif before
blowing up the car to cover up the murder. It vowed to avenge
Sharif's killing by carrying out suicide attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the militant group is also suspecting that Palestinian
police might have carried out the assassination in collaboration
with Israel. Hamas leader in Gaza Abdel Rantisi hinted Saturday
that Sharif was arrested and tortured to death by the Palestinian
security forces before they used the car bombing to cover up the
killing.
</P>
<P>
The PNA originally held Israel responsible for murdering
Sharif, but it later revised the position following Israel's
strong denial of any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service head Ami Ayalon and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney Yithzak Molcho have met
secretly with PNA President Yasser Arafat in Gaza Strip to drive
home that Israel had nothing to do with the killing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu warned Friday that Israel would hold the PNA
responsible for any Hamas attacks if it continued accusing Israel
of plotting the murder.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the PNA Cabinet said it is now
investigating the possibility that Sharif was killed by other
Hamas members due to inner split.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly been trying to placate Hamas to forestall
terror attacks against Israel, fearing Israel could find excuses
to torpedo the already stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has so far rejected the PNA's claim on Hamas' inner feud
and the demand for restraint, vowing to avenge the death of Sharif
with blood-shed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Hamas rally in Gaza Saturday, Rantisi called on
Hamas' military wing Izzedin Kassim, which is responsible for the
past suicide bombings in Israel, to continue its struggle against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been on high alert to guard
against possible terror attacks by Hamas, which has suspended
operations against Israel since its spiritual leader and founder
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was released from Israeli jail last October.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Detained for Corruption Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Iran's capital Tehran,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, has been detained for allegedly involving
in a corruption scandal, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was reportedly arrested after he attended a court
session investigating into charges brought against him of
embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds by city council
officials.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation said the mayor had ordered the
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Last November an Iranian court accused the 44-year-old mayor of
involving in a huge corruption scandal. Karbaschi has since been
prohibited from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a close ally of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
played a major role in Khatami's election victory last year. He
has said the allegations against him are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
The hardline faction that supported Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri in the presidential election spearheaded the
campaign against Karbaschi and the municipality.
</P>
<P>
Iran's cabinet is expected to discuss Karbaschi's detention on
Sunday.

LUSAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 villagers in Kafue
district near Lusaka risk developing urinary and liver
complications because bilharzia, Sunday Times of Zambia reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted Kafue district director of
health Dyness Kasungami who has conducted a health survey of the
Lishiko area of the district as saying the bilharzia in the area
is endemic.
</P>
<P>
She said villagers are drawing water for domestic use from
ponds in which they bathe, urinate and defecate, making it
difficult for the disease to be controlled.
</P>
<P>
People in the area have lived with bilharzia for a long time
but are not aware of the long term consequences, she said.
</P>
<P>
Kasungami said that the only way to eradicate the disease is
to ensure that villagers have proper toilets and safe water
supply because treating the disease alone is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from treatment, it is important to have good sanitation
and safe sources of water," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Treatment is very expensive and not the answer, so we need to
come up with prevention and control measures," she said.
</P>
<P>
At Lishiko primary school many pupils are reported to have
blood in their urine.
</P>
<P>
The pupils swim in snail infested ponds catching bilharzia.

<HEADLINE> New Step to Correct S. African Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- South African prisoners will
be put to work building houses and roads under armed guards in
poor areas, national newspaper Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners will be paid, but, in turn, will have to pay for
their food and prison accommodation. Some of their money will
also have to be donated to crime victims, Correctional Services
Minister Sipo Mzimela was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela launched the nationwide project Friday, with the
laying of the first bricks in a 22-house development south of
Durban, a port city in east of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said it was hoped that criminals would learn skills which
they could use after their release. "We are trying this
innovative program to reduce the high rate of prisoners turning
back to crime once they have been released."
</P>
<P>
The plan, which will begin in other provinces before the end
of the year, will eventually see thousands of supervised
volunteer artisan-convicts working.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said the public should not feel threatened because no
dangerous prisoners would be allowed out on the work gangs.
Instead, only prisoners who were not violent, who were sentenced
for petty offenses, who were model prisoners or who had served
most of their sentences would get the work opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a very powerful weapon to fight crime and it is
very important for society to accept these prisoners."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that working prisoners would fall under the
provisions of the Labor Relations Act and would be allowed to
organize themselves into unions.
</P>
<P>
"Their training will be done by correctional services staff
free of charge, but once they are engaged in real productive
work, they will be paid like regular workers," he said.

TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- About 60 people have been feared
dead as a landslide triggered by torrential rains razed a mountain
village in western Iran, according to local media Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said bad weather and mud on Saturday prevented rescue
workers from reaching the village in the province of
Charmahal-va-Bakhtiyari, about 400 kilometers south of the capital
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter was ordered to the area but was unable to find the
village, inhabited by tribe people, who tend cattle and sheep, and
several other choppers had to turn back because of the strong
winds.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in the province said the residents might have
been completely engulfed by the mud and were unlikely to survive
should rescue not arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains during the past week have cause floods in the area,
cut off roads and destroyed bridges.

<HEADLINE> New Committee Urged for Zimbabwe's Mine Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Associated Mine Workers' Union
of Zimbabwe is agitating for the formation of a high-powered gold
crisis committee to deal with the continued collapse of mines.
</P>
<P>
President of the union, Jefrey Mutnadare said at the weekend
that the envisaged committee should bring together the three
social partners -- employers, workers and the government, the
Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
It would have a mandate to deal with all mine retrenchments
and try to come up with alternatives before a mine is closed and
workers retrenched.
</P>
<P>
It was also being anticipated that this committee would be
able to come up with a social plan to help the retrenched
workers.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 workers had been laid off since world prices of
gold and other minerals began tumbling about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The suppressed prices were said to have been triggered by
European Reserve Banks that had stockpiled huge reserves of gold
in their bank vaults.
</P>
<P>
It is not known when the prices were likely to pick up again.
Until this happens, the wave of mine closures and retrenchments
was expected to continue, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Just this year alone, three major mines in Zimbabwe closed
while several others had either retrenched or announced they
would be doing so.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Bangladeshis Affected by Cancer Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 people are affected by
cancer every year in Bangladesh, and 150,000 of them die, press
reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of cancer patients in this South Asian nation
now exceeds 800,000, reports said, quoting World Health
Organization statistics.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the cancer cases in the country were due to
use of tobacco and tobacco products, so the extent of cancer could
be contained by about half through discarding tobacco, Bangladesh
Cancer Society (BCS) vice-president Prof. M.A. Hye said at a
conference in Dhaka Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis should be given on primary prevention as
diagnosis at the initial stage, he said, pointing out that
treatment facilities in the country "are inadequate."
</P>
<P>
BCS president Prof. Syed Fazlul Haq told the conference that
mass media, including radio, TV and newspapers, could play an
important role in raising awareness among people and educating
them on cancer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria
said the government would not allow revenue earning through the
use of tobacco at the cost of public health.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that revenue earning is very important for a
country like ours, but new sources can be dug out if one source is
closed," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister called for creating mass awareness against
smoking through social mobilization.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Union Threatens Continued Work Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Zimbabwean Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Morgan Tsvangirai said ZCTU will continue
to organize mass job stay-aways until the government relents to
calls for a reduction in prices of basic food commodities.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Tsvangirai said workers should heed
calls for work boycotts until the government scrapped the
development levy and pensions tax, reduced sales tax hiked to
17.5 percent last December to the original 15 percent, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing an estimated 3,000 people at a labor rally
at a stadium in the southern town of Masvingo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has since last December, organized job sltay-aways
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The umbrella labor union leader, whose organization has been
accused by President Robert Mugabe of being an opposition party,
said he supported any calls for amendment of the Zimbabwean
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"On politics, we as ZCTU support those who say the
constitution should be amended," he said.
</P>
<P>
While he did not specifically mention any names, observers
took these sentiments to be largely in support of calls for
constitutional amendments by Masvingo central MP Dzikamai
Mavhaire who was suspended by the ruling Zanu (PF) party for two
years after calling for Mugabe to resign.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Entrepreneur Brushes Up Toothpaste Success Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Private entrepreneur Hu Zegang has
become a dominant player in China's toothpaste sector, as his
factory provides more than half of the calcite powder for the
country's toothpaste producers.
</P>
<P>
His calcite powder-processing factory turned over 1.03 million
yuan in taxes to the state last year, and he was awarded a prize
by the National Council for Light Industry for his outstanding
contribution to China's toothpaste industrial and technological
progress.
</P>
<P>
Hu started his business in Lingchuan County of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in 1983. Leaving his post in a local mining
machinery plant, he raised 500 yuan to start processing calcite
powder, an important raw material for toothpaste industry.
</P>
<P>
He was sure that he would make a career in this field because
he found great potential in a 1.2-billion-people consumption
market.
</P>
<P>
Now his business, with more than 10 million yuan in fixed
assets, processes 55,000 tons of high-quality calcite powder
annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he presided over the drafting of the country's first
standards for toothpaste powder.

<HEADLINE> Trade With Myanmar at some Thai Checkpoints Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Exports of goods to Myanmar
through border checkpoints in four districts of Thailand's
northern province of Tak were temporarily suspended starting from
Sunday, news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is aimed at preventing security problems caused
by fighting in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Security forces were reportedly dispatched to border areas of
the four districts to ensure there would be no deliveries of goods
within three km of the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six border checkpoints in another district of the
province remained open to cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post quoted a military officer as saying that the
current border situation was not good for cross-border trade due
to fighting between Myanmar troops and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The officer said the measure would be enforced temporarily
until the situation improves and the safety of Thai exporters and
customs officials could be ensured.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has worked out a western seaboard development project
in an effort to boost border trade with Myanmar and other
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, there are concerns that the opening of checkpoints to
border trade would pose a threat to national security. Some state
agencies expressed fears that the opening of checkpoints would
encourage the influx of Myanmar immigrants into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They also said these immigrants might bring with them
contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, elephantiasis, syphilis,
malaria and leprosy.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's suspension of border trade through checkpoints
reflected these concerns.

JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Israeli Arabs and
Israeli police were injured in violent clashes that erupted
Saturday night in northern Arab village of Sued, Israel Radio

</P>
<P>
Beduin Arab residents, in their hundreds, threw stones at
Israeli police when they were prevented from demolishing three
settlement buildings built without licenses from Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas and batons to disperse the rioters, and a
police helicopter was called in to end the melee, which lasted
till the wee hours of Sunday. Order was restored in the morning
and roads to the village were reopened.
</P>
<P>
A number of ambulances rushed to the village to evacuate the
injured, which include at least a dozen protesters and 22
policemen. Fifteen protesters were detained for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the worst Arab rioting in the past years
between Israeli police and Arab citizens, who have been
protesting discrimination and confiscation of properties by
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
The 1 million Israeli Arabs closely associate themselves with
the Palestinians in the territories and support their struggle
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Arabs across Israel observed a general strike and
held protests to mark the Land Day, dedicated to six Arabs killed
in the 1976 suppression of an Arab rioting against Israel's
confiscation of land.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Experiencing "Cancerous Scourges": </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said the ruling Zanu (PF) is now experiencing"cancerous scourges"
of unguarded ambitions, deviationism, factionalism, regionalism
and tribalism.
</P>
<P>
As guest speaker at the Zanu Youth League National Assembly
meeting at Kushinga Phikelela Training College in east Zimbabwe
Saturday, Mugabe, who is also first secretary of the ruling
party, urged youths to shun divisive tendencies which he said
were being promoted by some senior members in the party
hierarchy, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he wondered where the youth of Zimbabwe, renowned
for their vigilance were while what he termed infiltrators and
divisive elements wreaked havoc on the unity and oneness of Zanu.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming remarks, Zanu Secretary for Youth Affairs,
retired Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai, told Mugabe that it
was now difficult for the party's youth league to mobilize the
people because all there was to offer was a "glorified past and
empty promises" for the future.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe urged the youth to continue to be loyal,
vigilant and energetic in their efforts to revitalize the party
and its organs.
</P>
<P>
The president also referred to the recent food riots which
turned violent and said that it was absolutely critical for the
youth to recognize that as a nation, Zimbabweans should strive to
resolve their problems and differences peacefully through dialog.
</P>
<P>
"The youth should shun destructive strikes and demonstrations
that often degenerate into lawlessness, looting and destruction
of property," he said.

A 10 percent surtax is for earnings between 1.27 million koruny
(38,500 dollars) and 4 million koruny (120,000 dollars), and a 20
percent rate is for those up to 9 million koruny (270,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
As called for by the legislation approved recently by the
parliament, the highest rate of 30 percent is reserved for annual
incomes even higher, the newspaper Economic News reported.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, as shown by 1997 official statistics, per capita
income of the country's active labor force was 9,226 koruny (280
dollars) a month, or 110,712 koruny (3,360 dollars) a year.

<P>
The new measure is expected to generate some 200 million koruny
(6 million dollars) additional tax revenues for the state
coffers.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Cause Alarm in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,488 forest fires occurred
in Costa Rica in the first quarter of this year and destroyed over
9,800 hectares of forests and ecological reserves.
</P>
<P>
The figure, as shown by statistics released by the Environment
and Energy Ministry, is alarming, since there were a total of only
3,773 fires of the kind across the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said there was a daily average of 39 emergency
calls in the first three months of the year reporting bush fires
caused by persons who burned grass in the very dry season.
</P>
<P>
The areas where more fires occurred are the country's northeast
and northwest. For example, fires destroyed 1,800 hectares of
conservation in Guanacaste, and 3,500 hectares in Filadelfia.
</P>
<P>
"We are about to enter a critical period for parks and
protected areas," said Environment and Energy Minister Rene Castro.
</P>
<P>
Castro said the government was developing a plan of action to
deal with the current drought caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's forest law calls for up to three years in
prison for those who purposely set fires to forest, and for fines
to be imposed on those who cause forest fires accidentally.
</P>
<P>
Another problem, he said, is there are people who take
advantage of the fires to illegally hunt animals fleeing from
forest.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Coffee Price Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombian coffee's
internal purchasing price will be down 1.85 percent Saturday to
start at 331,375 pesos (about 255 U.S. dollars) per 125-kilogram
bag.
</P>
<P>
The internal price is based on the lowest quote of last three
days, as an imminent downward trend is observed in the price
diminishing on daily basis in the first three days of the month.
</P>
<P>
Colombian coffee closed Friday at 1.59 dollars per pound (about
0.45 kilogram) at the international market.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish market development has caused big concerns among
Colombian coffee growers, who met last week at the Coffee Union to
analyze and formulate a strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, at the meeting, they signaled their disagreements with
the formula for the determination of prices, applied by the
Colombian Coffee Growers Federation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers Scholarship for Thai Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has offered scholarships
for Thai students currently studying or planning to go to the
United Kingdom, Sunday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to his
Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai during their meeting in London on
the sidelines of the second Asia-Europe summit.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Thailand and Britain signed a "Thailand-UK
Action Agenda" which pledges wide-ranging cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The size of the scholarships had not been decided and the
British government would discuss with universities and the private
sector regarding the pledge, the paper quoted Thai government
spokesman Akkapol Sorasuchart as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Thai students are studying in Britain, many of
them facing financial difficulty due to the baht's depreciation
against the pound, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
About 600-700 students had been selected to further their
studies in Britain under the Thai government scholarship but they
were unable to go due to the shortage of government funds, Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said.
</P>
<P>
The government would start selecting students to study under
Britain's offer after the Thai delegation returned to Bangkok, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Grant Trial Licenses To Foreign Insurance Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China is considering granting
operating licenses to one or two foreign insurance brokerage
companies, according to today's China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a senior official of the People's Bank of
China (PBOC) as saying that those licensed will be encouraged to
set up joint venture companies in China.
</P>
<P>
He said a detailed plan determining the business scale and
geographical restrictions is still in the process of elaboration.
</P>
<P>
As China is a latecomer to the insurance brokerage industry, it
is necessary to proceed gradually in choosing foreign insurance
brokers to introduce advanced management techniques, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the British Sedgwick Group entered China in the early
1980s, more than a dozen foreign insurance brokers have opened
representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Although representative offices are non-profit institutions
prohibited from undertaking broking business, some are engaged
covertly, according to industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
Such activities leave clients with their rights unprotected, and
they also create headaches for the insurance watchdog and are a
cause of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Selectively granting licenses to some brokers will be conducive
to standardizing the market and promoting the growth of the
domestic brokerage industry, according to expert opinion.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move to consider opening the insurance
brokerage market follows the promulgation of the experimental
regulation on insurance broker management in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Freeman Zhang, chief representative of the Beijing office of UK
firm Willis Corroon China Ltd, said his company is preparing its
application for the operating license.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Suspends, But Not Liquidates Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (central bank)
Governor Syahril Sabirin said the suspension of a number of banks
does not mean they had been liquidated.
</P>
<P>
"They were merely told to stop operating, not to close their
offices," Syahril said after joining a meeting with International
Monetary Fund (IMF) officials here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Afternoon, Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier announced
the suspension of seven private commercial banks and placing of
another seven under the management of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA). They include Bank Danamon, Bank
Dagang Nasional Indonesia and Bank Ekspor-Impor Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"These decisions are part of the ongoing national banking
reforms to restore its reputation and regain the confidence of
people at home and abroad," Fuad said.
</P>
<P>
"They are part of an overall strategy of restoring our economy,
and they are part of our efforts to strengthen the rupiah's
exchange rate," the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
Syahril also told depositors of the frozen banks not to worry
about the possibility of losing their savings. "The obligations of
the banks concerned to their customers will be taken over by Bank
Nasional Indonesia (BNI), he added.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the Indonesian government
closed down 16 troubled private banks in a bid to improve the
efficiency of the banking system.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A private jet and single-engine
plane collided on Saturday in Georgia of the United States,
killing at least five people.
</P>
<P>
Both pilots and three passengers on the jet were killed, said
Preston Hicks, a spokesman with the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
Although the jet's flight plan showed five people aboard, one
of the passengers never boarded the plane, The Associated Press
quoted Cobb County police spokesman Robert Quigley as saying.
</P>
<P>
The smaller plane did not file a flight plan.
</P>
<P>
Crews were searching for additional victims, but were hampered
by leaking jet fuel and twisted wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Quigley said the jet's pilot and three passengers were
co-workers from the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
The jet had just taken off from Peachtree-DeKalb County Airport
near Atlanta en route to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, when it
collided with the smaller plane.
</P>
<P>
The planes hit the ground about a kilometer apart in a
subdivision of single-family homes. No one on the ground was
injured.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board were on the scene investigating.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has intensified efforts to introduce a bottom line subsistence
system for urban and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government allocated 10 million yuan during 1997
to establish the system in both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 136 counties, nearly 99 percent of the province's total,
and all its 14 prefectural cities have introduced the
system along with related rules and regulations covering
establishment and implementation procedures. Most of the people
benefitted from the system are those in remote and mountainous
areas, laid-off workers or old people without children to support
them.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the system comes from central and local financial
departments at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have distributed 15.67 million yuan
to help over 168,900 poverty-stricken people.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Electromechanical Exports to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's 1997 export volume of
electromechanical products to Africa hit 1.24 billion US dollars,
a three-fold rise on the figure for five years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese exports of related products accounted for only
a small proportion of the African market, according to a recent
issue of the International Trade News. The issue also carried an
article reporting that 100-odd Chinese exporters attended a
recent forum on increasing electrochemical exports to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The publication noted that improvements are required for the
quality, reliability, technological content and after-sale
services for exported products, and concerned enterprises must
exhibit greater flexibility in face of the competitive African
market.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Chamber of Commerce stressed that
exploring the African market does not necessarily center solely on
selling products. He stressed that China should increase the
availability of electromechanical products and should at the same
explore the global market by combining African resources with
Chinese technology.

WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
marking the 30th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination Saturday, called him "one of America's greatest
heroes."
</P>
<P>
The late civil rights leader was shot and killed as he left his

"Let me just pause a moment to observe the 30th anniversary of
the death of one of America's greatest heroes, Dr. Martin Luther
King," Clinton said in his weekly radio address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"His dream, deeply rooted in the American dream, is a dream for
all Americans," said Clinton, who just completed a 12-day trip to
Africa. "It's a dream, as I recently saw, shared by millions and
millions of people around the world."
</P>
<P>
"Let us here at home always strive to heed Dr. King's words and
live up to his legacy," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> March Honors Martin Luther King Jr.'s Memory </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of marchers walked
the streets of Memphis, Tennessee, of the United States Saturday
on the 30th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King
Jr.
</P>
<P>
The marchers followed a route much like the one the then
39-year-old civil rights leader led in his last march in Memphis a
week before he was gun down on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago King was murdered when he came to help a
garbage workers strike.
</P>
<P>
"The bullet could not stop the dream. The bullet could not stop
a new generation from arising," news reports quoted the Rev. Jesse
Jackson as telling marchers before they departed from a church
near downtown Memphis where the garbage workers protest originated
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Jackson was below the motel balcony on which King was standing
when he was killed by a single rifle shot.
</P>
<P>
Marchers filled the streets eight and more abreast stretching
at one point for about nine blocks.
</P>
<P>
The participants sang some of the anthems of the civil rights
rallies of the 1960s -- "We Shall Overcome" and "Ain't Gonna Let
Nobody Turn Me Around," according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Among those with Jackson in the front of the march were
Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth,
a pioneer of the civil rights movement, and musician-actor Isaas
Hayes.
</P>
<P>
The three-day commemoration of King's death began with a
memorial service Friday night and includes seminars and other
events.
