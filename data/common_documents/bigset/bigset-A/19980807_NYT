SELES SHOWS COURAGE, GRACE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sheis not THAT Monica. Her story hasn't pushed
world news off the front pages of the daily papers. Unlike Monica
Lewinsky, she can look at newsstands without feeling as though
she's glancing in a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When Monica Seles lost in this year's French Open tennis final
in a stirring triumph of the human spirit, she was relegated to the
inside pages of a national sports weekly, which chose to run the
second of three consecutive Michael Jordan covers instead.
</P>
<P>
   No small irony, that, for Seles once ruled her sport as
absolutely as the Chicago Bulls' Jordan has his. Then she was
attacked by a knife-wielding stranger and her father was blindsided
by cancer and for the better part of five years her world spun out
of her control.
</P>
<P>
   Seles' recovery has been remarkable, her hard-fought battles
against fear and depression and sorrow awe-inspiring. There are
people who are cast as victims of powerful men or whatever, and
then there is Seles, who you'd genuinely feel sorry for if only
she'd let you. But alas, her dignity and grace get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, the sixth-ranked player in the world, will meet Ai
Sugiyama today in the quarterfinals of the Toshiba Tennis Classic.
From Carlsbad she will continue on to Manhattan Beach to defend her
title in the Acura Classic, which she recently called her ``very
favorite tournament'' on the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, any city that's not her adopted hometown of
Sarasota, Fla., qualifies as a haven these days. There's nowhere
Seles can turn in Sarasota without being reminded of Karolj, her
father and longtime coach who succumbed to stomach cancer after a
two-year fight on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Seles had devoted more of the past year to caring for her father
than fretting over her tennis. Games, sets and matches took a back
seat to paying the family bills and administering protein drinks
and morphine doses to her dad.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped off the tour for 10 weeks to be by her father's
side, forgoing the first of this year's Grand Slam events, the
Australian Open, which she has won four times. If Chris Spielman,
the Buffalo Bills linebacker who is taking the upcoming season off
to help his wife in her battle against breast cancer, ever needs
reassuring, he can always call Seles.
</P>
<P>
   She has been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after Karolj's death, Seles, 24, played her
opening match in the French Open. Jordan, the basketball star,
needed more than a year away from his sport to recover from the
murder of his father. But cancer is considerate that way; unlike a
fatal gunshot wound, it at least affords the next of kin the chance
to say a proper goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   During Karolj's final months, he and his daughter left no
sentiment unsaid. So when he passed, there was grief but no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever be fully over it,'' Seles said of her
father's death. ``I don't think that would be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   What is normal, anyway? Convention holds that 16-year-olds don't
win Grand Slam events, as Seles did at Roland Garros in 1990. Back
then she acted like Gidget and mowed down opponents like Rambo.
She'd unleash her two-fisted fury on some rival, then giggle her
way through the postmatch press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The extroverted Seles was milking the attentive press long
before the Swiss Miss, Martina Hingis, arrived on the pro scene.
Being the top dog among bloodhounds is never easy for a young pup _
just ask the 17-year-old Hingis _ but as she approached 20, Seles
felt like her life had slipped into a comfortable groove.
</P>
<P>
   Then her sense of security was stolen from her in a violent
attack. In April of 1993, a male fan of Steffi Graf stabbed Seles,
who had supplanted Graf at the top of the world rankings two years
earlier, at a tournament in Graf's native Germany.
</P>
<P>
   While Seles was in the hospital recovering from the wound in her
back, her father fell ill with what turned out to be prostate
cancer, starting his inexorable decline.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 27 months, Seles would be stabbed in the back
repeatedly, in her nightmares and in real life by her fellow pros
who voted almost unanimously not to protect Seles' No.1 ranking
until she was well enough to defend it and who generally offered
her little in the way of support or encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   One peer who went out of her way to wish Seles well during her
convalescence was Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. So guess who stood at
center court at Roland Garros after the French Open final in June
and told the vanquished Seles, ``I'm so sorry I beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario showed a sense of drama in outlasting Seles 7-6,
0-6, 6-2 and a greater sense of decency in her postmatch comments.
</P>
<P>
   While she was on the mend, one of Seles' sponsors sued her for
staying off the tour. That's not why she chose to return to the
sport three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Seles lured back to tennis for the money; with a net
worth of $40 million, her financial future is secure. She came back
because the sport is like an old friend. After watching her best
friend die, she sure needed one.
</P>
<P>
   She called the support she has received since her father's death
``amazing.'' If there are people reaching out to her now who before
kept their hands folded at their chests, there's a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The girl who won with preternatural ease was envied for being
inordinately blessed. The woman who fought off adversity in three
grueling sets is respected for being brave beyond belief.

GAUTHIER ASSUMES GM SPOT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The National Hockey League's most dsyfunctional front
office family aired its latest, and hopefully last, load of dirty
laundry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New Mighty Ducks president Pierre Gauthier announced he will
assume the duties of general manager, replacing his former boss
Jack Ferreira, who has been offered the position of vice-president
of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, since Ron (Wilson) left there has been a lot
of ups and downs, a lot of question marks ... I don't like to use
the word turmoil, but a lot of indecision,'' said Gauthier of a
period during which the Ducks have fired two coaches (Wilson,
Pierre Page), hired another (Craig Hartsburg) and brought aboard
the team's former assistant GM (Gauthier) as president, replacing
Tony Tavares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe this is the way to end all this,'' said
Gauthier. ``Now (we) make things very clear, within the
organization and for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a slow, painful restructuring of the Anaheim front
office this summer since the Ducks completed a very disappointing
26-43-13 season one year after the team went to the second round of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, who worked 2 1/2 years under Ferreira after the Ducks
were formed in 1993 said ``I won't say anything negative about Jack
Ferreira, I have too much respect for him,'' but he also made it
clear it was time for a change and the centralization of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in the league who are president and
(general) managers,'' he said. ``And in a way it says that there is
one philosophy, one direction, one person in charge. Things become
very clear for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get the right leadership and philosophy of what you
want to do, it filters down to the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira and Disney have been criticized for their lack of
action on the free agent front this summer, but Gauthier admitted
he's not likely to make any major roster changes either. Gauthier
wants to take a good look at the Ducks' young talent in training
camp. He doesn't feel free agency is a cure all, and said that
Disney is not a penny-pinching organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of different ways to improve a club
without spending a lot of stupid money on retirement contracts (to
free agents 32-35 years old),'' said Gauthier, who built the Ottawa
Senators into a playoff team via the draft. ``Money isn't issue,
it's how you spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira was fired by the expansion San Jose Sharks in 1992 was
not available for comment. But Gauthier said he will give the
former GM plenty of time to decide if he wants a position that will
involve player evaluation, and serving as a sounding board for
Gauthier on player personal decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, who said he ``did not plan to let go of one of my best
friends'' when he was hired on July 16, insisted it wasn't any real
sense of dissatisfaction with Ferreira that resulted in the
decision to take over the GM duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't because he didn't do this or should have done
this,'' Gauthier explained. ``It's more the total picture,
clarifying roles and in a way turning the page. Expansion teams are
tough, you build slowly, then expectations grow ... it's obvious
what everybody wants. We've got to take a step up, we've got to get
to the next level.''

 &HT;    Eugene Aserinsky, a pioneer in sleep studies, died July 22 when
his car hit a tree north of San Diego. He was 77 and lived in
Escondido, Calif.
 &HT;    In 1953, for his Ph.D. in physiology at the University of
Chicago, Aserinsky produced his ground-breaking thesis, ``Eye
Movements During Sleep.''
 &HT;    His discovery of rapid eye movement, or REM _ the periodic,
rapid, jerky movement of the eyeballs under the lids during stages
of sleep associated with dreaming _ showed that the brain was in a
state of some alertness for about 22 percent of total sleep time.
In a long career, he taught at Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia, Marshall University Medical School and West Virginia
University.
 &HT;    Aserinsky is survived by his wife, Angela; his son Armond, of
North Wales, Pa.; his two daughters, Jill Asher Buckley, of
Carlsbad, Calif., and Iris Carter, of Charlotte, N.C.; and three
grandchildren.

   Phyllis Deveneau Michelfelder, who devoted her life to the
rehabilitation of women with the alcohol and drug problems that she
had overcome, died July 18 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton
Beach, Fla. She was 76 and lived in nearby Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure after exploratory surgery, said her
executor, John Ross Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Michelfelder retired in April as executive director of
Wayside House in Delray Beach, which she co-founded in 1974.
Wayside House offers programs of intensive therapy and
rehabilitation for alcohol and drug abuse, along with family and
children's counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she was an administrator of fund raising and
development at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Michelfelder's husband, William, died in 1992. She is
survived by a brother, Nelson Deveneau of Salisbury, Mass., and a
sister, Marion Stevens of Lee, N.H.

EDITORIAL: SEX, HONOR AND GRADE-POINT AVERAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Somer Chipman and Chasity Glass have achieved the kind of
academic success in high school that is often a passport to
membership in the National Honor Society. Yet neither of these
17-year-olds made the cut at Grant County High in Williamstown, Ky.
Both are teen-age mothers, apparently a disqualifying factor for
the selection panel. Its decision was misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Grant County school system has been circumspect
about the precise reasons for the exclusion. But fragmentary
remarks on the public record suggest the admissions panel decided
that sexually active teen-agers cannot be role models. By that
standard one wonders what tests the committee would devise in the
future to verify which candidates for induction into the honor
society had perfect records of abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   What the panel and the school system should do is abide by the
requirements of Title IX, which bans schools that receive federal
funds from engaging in any form of sex discrimination. One of Title
IX's regulations specifically prohibits discrimination against a
student who is pregnant or a teen-age parent, married or not.
</P>
<P>
   Since its enactment in 1972, Title IX has been primarily used as
a wedge to address the imbalance in money and other resources for
high school and college athletics for women. With a lawsuit that
was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday, these
two young women seek to test the federal courts' willingness to
enforce a ban on discriminating against students who are pregnant
or mothers. To date, decisions by lower courts in similar cases
have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman's and Ms. Glass' achievements _ doing well in school
in spite of their parental responsibilities _ prove that an
unplanned pregnancy does not have to derail a student's academic
career and aspirations. Any honor society chapter should be proud
to count them as members.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has declared 1998 the International Year of
the Ocean. This has provided a pretext for lofty talk about
rescuing the oceans from pollution and overfishing, but not, as
yet, much useful action. Recent decisions by Canada and Greenland
to close down commercial fishing for Atlantic salmon originating in
North American rivers are thus cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Atlantic salmon _ as opposed to the farm-raised variety
most people find on their menus _ have been declining at an
alarming rate. Industrial wastes, polluted runoff from farms and
the construction of dams killed most of the salmon spawning in the
United States by the late 19th century, leaving only a handful of
precarious wild runs, all in Maine. Canadian salmon have also
dwindled. Scientists estimate that the number of large fish
returning to Canadian rivers, mostly spawning females, reached an
all-time low of 114,000 this year, one-sixth the number of 20 years
ago and barely half the number required to sustain the species over
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The decline continued despite Canada's decision to shut down a
large commercial fishing ground in Newfoundland in 1993, as well as
temporary measures to reduce the salmon catch near Greenland, where
the fish congregate in large numbers before returning to their
native rivers. In desperation, Canada closed its last remaining
commercial fishery, in Labrador, on June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, influenced by Canada's example and by
entreaties from Canada's Atlantic Salmon Federation and Britain's
Atlantic Salmon Trust, Greenland agreed to close its commercial
fishery. This was a courageous step because there are not many
other jobs for unemployed fishermen in Greenland. On the other
hand, the move could ultimately save Canada's recreational fishing
industry, valued at $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be reviewed in one year, and will presumably
be renewed if mortality rates do not improve. In the meantime,
Greenland will be allowed a subsistence catch for local
consumption, while thousands of wild Atlantic salmon receive a
badly needed reprieve from the gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve will also allow conservation groups, and Washington
and Ottawa, to turn their energies to other threats facing Atlantic
salmon. These include polluted watersheds and dams that have
outlived their usefulness as sources of power and serve only to
diminish the future of a once-flourishing species.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein has consistently misjudged America's willingness
to defend its interests in the Persian Gulf region, beginning with
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. He now does so again in breaking off
Iraqi cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections, perhaps believing
mistakenly that Washington is too distracted by the Monica Lewinsky
case to answer his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection system, imposed on Iraq after its defeat in the
Persian Gulf War, is the world's first line of defense against
Baghdad's efforts to produce biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Over the past seven
years, investigators have uncovered evidence of these prohibited
weapons despite Iraqi efforts to keep them secret. Prematurely
ending the inspections would make it easier for Hussein to rebuild
an arsenal of mass-destruction weapons, a prospect too dangerous to
his neighbors and U.S. interests to permit.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tiresome familiarity to Iraq's periodic repudiation
of its international obligations. But the timing of its latest
challenge was unexpected. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. inspector,
had just arrived in Baghdad to register some progress toward
resolving missile and chemical weapons issues. By abruptly ending
its cooperation, Iraq undermines the case for an early easing of
sanctions. Russia, a longtime friend of Iraq, and France, eager to
pursue commercial opportunities with Baghdad, have favored faster
movement toward that end.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bill Clinton is preparing for his grand jury testimony
later this month, he remains fully able to deliver a forceful
response to Hussein on a matter where there is already strong
bipartisan agreement. Clinton would no doubt relish the chance to
change the subject of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   He has already declared that Iraq's actions are unacceptable.
The Security Council did the same Thursday, despite differences
among its members over Iraq. A special responsibility falls on the
U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, whose agreement with Hussein
during the last inspection crisis in February averted U.S. military
action. Iraq's move this week clearly violates that agreement.
Annan must make clear that he will accept nothing less than full
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq does not reverse course, Clinton will have to begin a
new buildup of U.S. forces in the gulf region. History has taught
that Hussein responds only to the threat or use of force. He is
once again inviting use of those options.

   When the votes were in, the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform
bill sailed through the House with numbers so overwhelming as to
belie how hard the battle had been. In the end, 61 Republicans,
more than a quarter of the party's members in the House, joined
with most Democrats to pass the bill, 252-179. Yes, it now faces a
daunting challenge in the Senate. We will have more to say on that
in due course. Now, however, it seems appropriate to pay tribute to
the bill's supporters in the House, and to draw lessons from their
extraordinary perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public revulsion over the fund-raising abuses in the
1996 election, House leaders on both sides of the aisle were
anything but enthusiastic about cleaning up the campaign
fund-raising system last year. But two independent-minded New
Englanders demanded that their fellow lawmakers do more than
deplore the excesses for partisan advantage. Reps. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., challenged the
ingrained habits of colleagues and the conventional wisdom of
Washington's chattering class. Their task was generally deemed
hopeless when campaign reform was killed in the Senate in February.

<P>
   To their great credit, Dick Gephardt, David Bonior and other
Democratic leaders embraced campaign reform shortly thereafter. But
their endorsement made Shays' job more complicated as Newt Gingrich
and GOP leaders tried to portray it as a partisan issue. Shays was
courageous in facing parliamentary trickery and threats of revenge
from the leaders of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments, too, when Shays and Meehan wondered about
each other's motives and promises. They tried to forge a bipartisan
coalition in a Congress riven with the most bitter partisan
resentments. But they stuck together and rebutted the devious
argument that a ban on unlimited ``soft money'' donations and other
curbs on fund raising were a violation of free speech. They shamed
their colleagues into not letting their bill get strangled by
wealthy special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of campaign reform profited from the clumsiness of its
foes. Gingrich's broken promises, phony substitutes, killer
amendments and attempts to run out the clock all played into the
reformers' hands. But the most important lesson is an old one.
Standing up for principles can mobilize public opinion and change
the accepted rules of the game. We dwell on this not to gloat but
to point the way to the Senate, where Trent Lott and Mitch
McConnell have declared this legislation dead on arrival and where
Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold, sponsors of the Senate
version of Shays-Meehan, now face their time of testing. It has a
familiar ring, doesn't it?

KANELL EXPECTS HEFTY RAISE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Danny Kanell said he is confident as he prepares
for the New York Giants' preseason opener Saturday against the
Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants will make a statement about their
confidence in Kanell next week when they plan to begin serious
negotiations that should yield Kanell a new, and far more
lucrative, contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, who is in the last year of a three-year contract that
will pay him the league minimum of $216,000, has been expecting a
new deal since last season ended. Kanell was 7-2-1 as a starter,
helping the team to a division title and its first playoff
appearance since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been preliminary contract discussions, Giants
General Manager Ernie Accorsi will fly to California next week to
begin talks with Kanell's agent, Marvin Demoff. Accorsi will also
re-open talks next week with Ken Staninger, the agent for offensive
tackle Scott Gragg. Gragg can become an unrestricted free agent
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, like everybody else, I want to get a raise,''
Kanell, 24, said Thursday between practices at training camp. ``I'm
happy they're going to talk, but I just don't want it to become a
distraction to the team. I want to take care of it as soon as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi did not want to comment on the extent of the
negotiations or the contract terms that Kanell or Gragg are
seeking. But Kent Graham, who was signed this winter as Kanell's
backup, received a three-year deal worth $3.6 million. So Kanell
can expect a hefty raise, even if salary cap considerations require
that the contract be structured to deliver the bulk of Kanell's pay
in succeeding years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to be out on the field again,'' Kanell said of
Saturday night's game at Giants Stadium. ``The last time we were
out there, things didn't work out like we planned. Playing another
game, even a preseason game, will be a start to putting that
Minnesota game behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost a 9-point lead in the final 90 seconds of a
23-22 first-round playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings last Dec.
27. It was one of Kanell's more productive games of the season, as
he completed 16 of 32 passes for 199 yards, including a touchdown
pass to tight end Aaron Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel said Kanell would not play much more than one
quarter of Saturday's game, but Kanell said he would use the
playing time wisely. ``Right from the start, it's important for us
to establish our offense,'' Kanell said. ``We did have a good
running game last year but the passing struggled sometimes. People
are going to be watching us _ to see if we've improved there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kanell replaced the embattled Dave Brown last year, he was
a fan favorite, something that happens to most backup quarterbacks.
But now Kanell is the starter and he knows expectations will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were happy to see me play last year. I hope
they're still happy to see me. I know that people won't be
satisfied with us just winning some games. We have to defend our
division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're looking forward to that,'' he said. ``I'm even
looking forward to being back in the action. It might almost be
good to wake up the morning after the game a little sore.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel said he found a newspaper picture depicting the
discolored grass at Giants Stadium disquieting. ``I'm looking
forward to playing on the grass, I've liked the idea all along,''
Fassel said. ``But if it's not a good track I won't be too happy
with it.'' Portions of the Giants Stadium grass have turned yellow
and brown in the aftermath of a concert at the stadium last
weekend. ... Fassel said he will hold safety Sam Garnes (sore
shoulder) and tight end Al Pupunu (sprained knee) out of Saturday's
game rather than risk aggravating their injuries.

MORE PAYDAYS BEFORE SUN SETS ON HOLMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Larry Holmes has a saying that traces back
to growing up in poverty with 11 siblings in Cuthbert, Ga.: The
shade of a toothpick is better than the boiling hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   So, the 48-year-old Holmes is not bitter when people say the
only reason he continues to fight is the pursuit of money. He is
unconcerned about his place in boxing history, and he even puts a
positive spin on almost anything that happens to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm dead, I'm dead,'' he said Thursday, waving off talk
of his ranking among heavyweight champions. ``I ain't going to
remember nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes will be 49 on Nov. 3, yet he is still in training. He has
a fight scheduled for Jan. 23 at an undetermined site against
George Foreman, who will turn 50 that day.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes' wife, Diane, is not fond of her husband's accepting
second billing to Foreman for the fight, even if Holmes is to get
$4 million. She complained that Foreman would get $10 million and
that the fight was being promoted as his birthday bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on me pretty good,'' Holmes said Thursday, as he
waited to participate in a cigar company's promotion. ``She said:
`How come he's getting more than you? You were the champ longer
than he was the champ. And you're just as important.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Honey, that's not the point.'''
</P>
<P>
   The point, Holmes said, is he will pick up $4 million and, in
the process, hand Foreman a whipping.
</P>
<P>
   To those who regard this fight as farcical, Holmes says he does
not see anyone in the heavyweight division who impresses him much.
He was reminded that less than six years ago, he was able to go the
distance against Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of shape, and I lost a contact lens in the fight,''
he said. ``I had gone in with a detached retina and the contact
lens allowed me to see. Even with all that, I was able to go the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes (66-6) held the heavyweight title from 1978 until
September 1985. His victims included Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks,
and he made 20 straight title defenses, which is second to Joe
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes once cared that he was underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get very angry,'' he said. ``I used to say things
like Marciano couldn't carry my jockstrap, when they were comparing
me with him, saying I couldn't break his record. But I was young. I
didn't understand what I understand now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I am the greatest fighter of all time. To me. To
somebody else, Joe Louis was. To someone else, it was Jack Dempsey.
To someone else, it was Marciano or Ali. It goes on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes won his first 48 fights _ one short of Rocky Marciano's
record _ before losing a controversial decision to Michael Spinks
in 1985.

TNT PREPARES A SMASHING DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the top three fighters on the six-bout card do
what they are supposed to do, then TNT's inaugural boxing show on
Sept. 22 at the Theater in Madison Square Garden will be dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   The card will feature three world-title bouts, headlined by
Shane Mosley, the International Boxing Federation lightweight
champion and arguably one of the top five fighters in the game.
Mosley (28-0), making his Madison Square Garden debut, faces
Eduardo Morales (26-0) of Argentina. Angel Manfredy (24-2-1) meets
John Brown (18-4) for the World Boxing Union superfeatherweight
title. And Shannon Briggs (30-2), the heavyweight from Brooklyn,
fights an opponent to be named later. Briggs gets a chance to
display what he has learned since he started working with the
trainer Emanuel Steward, who has worked with Evander Holyfield and
who is also training Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden is offering about 800 $18 tickets in the
5,200-seat arena. Ringside seats will cost $100.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Malley, senior vice president of Turner Sports, said TNT
was not looking to step into the void that will be left after the
USA Network abandons its ``Tuesday Night Fights'' series. O'Malley
said the network is treating this as a special sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all indications are that Evander Holyfield's next
bout will be against Vaughn Bean, the IBF's No. 1 contender, on
Sept. 19 in Atlanta at the Georgia Dome. A deal was imminent as of
Thursday. Bean stepped into the picture because Henry Akinwande,
the World Boxing Association's No. 1 contender, still had not
sufficiently recovered from hepatitis last June.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Holyfield backed off his asking price of $10 million
so that the fight could take place in Atlanta. There is talk that
the Georgia Dome is coming up with a $3 million site fee for the
bout.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Don King walked into U.S. District Court in
Manhattan for the hearing on the lawsuit against him filed by the
welterweight Felix Trinidad and saw a familiar face on the bench.
Judge Lawrence McKenna presided over King's recent trial on wire
fraud charges. The promoter was acquitted on nine counts of wire
fraud in that case, and the jury deadlocked on acquitting King's
company.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna was also the judge in the first trial on the same
charges in 1995. That trial ended in a mistrial. After hearing
arguments over whether King's contract with Trinidad is valid,
McKenna said he would make a ruling next week.

KIMMEL IS HOPING PATIENCE PAYS OFF WITH SCATMANDU
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A year ago at Saratoga, John Kimmel
tied with the soon-to-be-Hall of Famer Bill Mott for the most
victories by a trainer at the six-week meeting. But this year, with
many of his top fillies retired, Kimmel will apparently be counting
on allowance horses and untested 2-year-olds to stay at the top of
the trainer standing.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   The colt's name is Scatmandu, he is 3 years old, he cost a
record $1.1 million, and for a solid year, everyone, including
Kimmel, has been waiting for him to do something special, besides
act stupidly before each of his races.
</P>
<P>
   Scatmandu will get his first chance here Sunday in the $250,000
Jim Dandy, and his second, perhaps, in the $750,000 Travers on Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's as good as the best 3-year-olds out there, but
I think he did everything he could to comprise his chances in the
Dwyer,'' Kimmel said of the colt's performance July 12 at Belmont.
In that race, Scatmandu smashed his head against the starting gate
with such force that he wound up leaving a trail of blood around
the track as he finished third to Coronado's Quest. ``That beat him
more than anything,'' Kimmel said.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case all along with the Storm Cat-Princess
Alydar colt, a $275,000 yearling purchase who was then bought by
Robert Waxman, who paid a record price for a 2-year-old in
training.
</P>
<P>
   Amid high hopes in his first start at Saratoga last year _ he
was sent off at odds of 4-5 _ he acted up the second he stepped on
the track, forcing Richard Migliore, his regular jockey, to
dismount in the gate. He finished second, but was disqualified to
sixth for interference. He won his first race on Aug. 24 and then
was third to the streaking Coronado's Quest last October in the
Cowdin, his last start of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, treated with Lasix, he has won three in a row,
including the Leonard Richard at Delaware. His performance in the
Dwyer notwithstanding, Kimmel hopes Scatmandu will rebound in the
Jim Dandy on the way to the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been our goal all along,'' said the 44-year-old Kimmel,
who has trained stars like last year's Eclipse Award-winning filly
Hidden Lake, Flat Fleet Feet, Twist Afleet and Golden Bri.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, a onetime veterinarian, has been patiently working with
Scatmandu in his secluded corner of Saratoga's backstretch. This
week, Kimmel planned to school the eye-catching chestnut in the
paddock, and, depending on the results, will consider sending him
by van to the stakes barn and saddle him there instead of having
him make the long walk through the crowd on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked beautifully Sunday morning,'' said Kimmel, who
finished two races behind Mott at Saratoga in 1996 after a
controversial disqualification. ``I caught him going five furlongs
in :59 and change. A horse broke off 15 lengths in front of him and
he caught him at the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of horses, among them Wajima, Kelso and
Buckpasser, have won the 3-year-old championship without having run
in a Triple Crown race. And while the highly regarded Coronado's
Quest has a huge jump on Scatmandu when it comes to catching Real
Quiet or Victory Gallop in the race for end-of-the-year honors,
Kimmel is hoping his patience will pay off with the colt as it has
in his rise in the trainer standing.

MGM'S ONCE-MIGHTY LEO MAY BE PROWLING FOR MATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which has gone from
Hollywood's most powerful player to its most consistent
money-loser, announced that its days as a stand-alone studio may be
over.
</P>
<P>
   The once-majestic operation, symbolized by its Leo the lion logo
and its links to ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of Oz,''
continues to bleed so much red ink that it may be forced to
surrender its independence after more than seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate MGM could be bought for around $2 billion, but
believe a more likely scenario is a merger with a larger studio or
a TV network.
</P>
<P>
   MGM, controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian for most of the
past three decades, disclosed Thursday that it has been discussing
``business combinations with complementary strengths'' and
acquisitions of smaller niche companies as part of its goal of
becoming an ``integrated global entertainment company.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM gave no further details. The Hollywood Reporter, citing
unnamed sources, said preliminary talks had been held with News
Corp. and Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The move may mean Kerkorian, regarded as a savvy businessman
with a fortune estimated at $3.7 billion, has decided MGM can no
longer afford to compete head-on with the Big Six studios: Disney,
Paramount, Sony, 20th Century Fox, Universal and Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian owns 65 percent of MGM, which has movie, TV and home
video operations but no actual production facilities. It has one
valuable franchise -- James Bond -- and has suffered the indignity
of seeing one-time chief John Calley try to start a rival Bond
series at Sony, leading to lawsuits from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been bleeding red ink. MGM has not turned a profit
for a decade, losing $128 million last year and another $73.6
million in the first six months of this year, despite a certifiable
hit in ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' and a solid performance by ``The Man
in the Iron Mask,'' released at the height of public fascination
with Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Its three most recent films -- ``Species II,'' ``Dirty Work''
and ``Disturbing Behavior'' -- have been duds. Its coming slate,
including ``The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave'' and Robert De
Niro's political thriller ``Ronin,'' contains no obvious hit
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in financial difficulty like this and a film
performs poorly, you can't shrug it off the way they do at the
other studios,'' said Drake &AMP; Co. entertainment analyst Arthur
Rockwell, a former MGM executive.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the studio's problems was underscored in a report
filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part
of MGM's description of its recently announced plans to raise $250
million, possibly through a rights offering to current
shareholders. It indicated that only $132 million remains in a $1.3
billion revolving credit account opened in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   MGM also announced this week it will halt development of new TV
programs, cut two films from the dozen it planned to make next
year, and seek partners to co-produce some movies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pull the plug on new TV underscores the rough
financial conditions faced by MGM, which re-entered the business 18
months ago after a six-year absence. It has 10 series ordered for
next season, including ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Outer
Limits'' and ``Stargate SG-1,'' but it will be several years before
it can recoup costs due to the intricacies of TV revenue flows.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old Kerkorian, who made his fortune in the airline
and casino businesses, has bought the studio on three occasions --
1969, 1986 and 1996 -- and sold it twice. Thursday's announcement
is the fastest way to stop the red ink, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kirk has become a bit impatient at the progress so far
and it looks as if there may have been a miscalculation internally
on revenue flows,'' he said. He noted that the studio's results may
suffer as it boosted production earlier this year because officials
feared a strike by film industry unions. The strike never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the financial outlook should improve by 2000, when
MGM regains rights to parts of its film library and revenues from
increases in TV production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no predicting how this will turn out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian last sold MGM in 1990 for $1.4 billion to Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti, who defaulted on loans, leading to
French bank Credit Lyonnais owning the studio. Kerkorian and
Australian broadcasting group Seven Network Ltd. won an auction in
1996 with a $1.3 billion bid, then added the Goldwyn and Orion film
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   MGM sold 14 percent of itself to the public in November 1997
with a $180 million offering at $20 a share after warning investors
in a prospectus that the company did not expect to turn a profit
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares had fallen from a high of $26 in May and closed at a
post-offering low of $17.125 Wednesday before rising 69.75 cents to
$17.9375 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MGM has a library of 4,000 films and owns the legendary United
Artists Pictures studio, which Kerkorian bought in the early 1980s
from Transamerica after UA's huge losses on ``Heaven's Gate.''

   Johnson aside, staff &QL; 
needs to step it up
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BASED on the questions I'm getting, there are three things people
in Houston must know about Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Thing No. 1: Can he pitch the Astros to the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   Thing No. 2: Can the Astros retain his services beyond what
remains of this season?
</P>
<P>
   Thing No. 3: Why is he called the Big Unit?
</P>
<P>
   Credit Tim Raines, the former Expo and current Yankee, with
hanging that odd nickname on Johnson. When they were Montreal
teammates, Raines accidentally collided with the young Johnson as
he was leaving the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up, way up, at the beanpole kid, Raines said: ``Man, you
are a big unit.''
</P>
<P>
   There. Now on to the important stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson can help pitch the Astros to the World Series. But he,
in turn, must get lots of help from his new friends. If Mike
Hampton doesn't turn his season around in a hurry, acquiring
Johnson will be little more than a wash, except on the excitement
meter.
</P>
<P>
   They probably can win the division without Hampy shaping up, but
the postseason figures to be more problematic. And it's the
postseason for which Johnson was acquired. Fact: The Astros never
have gotten a playoff victory from a lefty starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's superb finish a year ago _ he went 12-3 with a 2.75
ERA after July 1 _ was a most essential component of the Astros'
first division title in 11 years. For the Astros to get full value
from Johnson, Shane Reynolds and Hampton must pitch as well as they
are capable.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton must regain form
</P>
<P>
   Either that or Jose Lima and Sean Bergman must pitch better than
they have, and they have topped our expectations by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds appears to be bouncing back from a brief slump.
Hampton, unfortunately, has gone from bad to worse since a strained
left groin landed him on the DL. After a 7-2 start (2.52 ERA), he
has reverted to his dreadful form of early last season, when he was
3-7 with a 5.29 ERA through 17 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   With Hampton, it's feast or famine, a pattern he must break if
he is to become anything more than a journeyman. It's almost to the
point where Lima and Bergman, who wasn't a lock to make the team in
spring training, deserve consideration as the third and fourth
starters, respectively, with Hampy being dropped into the five
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Astros don't have another day off until Aug. 27,
juggling the pitching order is easier contemplated than
accomplished. From a competitive and financial standpoint, though,
it's something Larry Dierker is being forced to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's entry into the rotation broke badly. Assuming he
pitches every fifth day through the end of the season, a safe
assumption unless he gets hurt, he'll go against the Cubs only
once, and his presence figures to significantly impact Astrodome
attendance no more than twice after his Houston debut tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Because Drayton McLane Jr. is on the hook for an additional $2
million-plus for his ``rental,'' that's an issue. Why do you think
the Astros took their sweet time in ``deciding'' whether to unveil
him tonight or Saturday night? Because they wanted to sell tickets
for both games.
</P>
<P>
   After the Phillies, Johnson has nine starts left _ but only four
of them at home: Milwaukee on Wednesday, Pittsburgh to open a
Domestand on Aug. 28, Cincinnati to launch another Sept. 7, and
then St. Louis on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty will have limited impact
</P>
<P>
   The last is a Saturday night, and because of Mark McGwire's huge
Roger Maris-chasing presence, that game had an excellent chance of
selling out anyway, Unit or no Unit. Also, his Pittsburgh start
hits on a Friday night, usually a good gate night regardless of the
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's presence should significantly pad the turnstile count
for the Brewers and Reds. The Cincinnati game falls on Labor Day
afternoon, so his impact will be diminished there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern, baseball-wise, anyway, is his limited
exposure to the Cubs, whom he'll face only Aug. 22 in Chicago. As
the rotation stands, he wouldn't pitch against them in the
season-ending three-game series that could decide the division. But
Johnson, coming off a five-day break, would then be as fresh as a
daisy for the playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
   Which is terrific, as long as the Astros are in it.
</P>
<P>
   For McLane to make a serious pitch to keep Johnson, he'll have
to have seen concrete, crunched-number evidence that he can to a
large extent pay for himself. The only way for that to happen is
for the Astros to go deep into the postseason, deeper than they
have gone in 36 previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order, even for a Big Unit, if the Astros' other
pitchers don't cooperate.

TRAINER'S DREAM: SWEEP IN HAMBLETONIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chuck Sylvester, a horseman for 30 years, has been living in a
dream world since last Saturday, when all four horses he entered in
the eliminations qualified for Saturday's $1 million Hambletonian,
the first leg of trotting's triple crown.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester, who was inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame
this year, has a chance to sweep the most prestigious event in
harness racing. His threesome of Muscles Yankee, Silver Pine and
David Raymond finished one-two-three in the $400,000 Beacon, the
final prep heading into the Hambletonian.
</P>
<P>
   Proving he can do little wrong, the 48-year-old Sylvester put
Armbro Rotary into the Hambletonian eliminations last Saturday and
the horse finished second in his heat behind Muscles Yankee, who
has been made the even-money favorite to capture Saturday's event
at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew last fall that I had a chance with three or four of
them if they stayed healthy and sound,'' said Sylvester, a native
of Toledo, Ohio, who has been training horses full-time for 31
years. ``To have four in a race like this is something you rarely
dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   With four horses in the field of 10, Sylvester has a chance to
become the first trainer of trotters to bankroll $1 million in day.
He also has a chance to duplicate the record of Walter Cox, who
trained the first four finishers in the 1929 Hambletonian. ``I just
hope they don't run each other down, or have a speed duel down the
backstretch,'' Sylvester said. ``I hope we don't run into any bad
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   His choice for the Hambletonian is Muscles Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger and has made no mistakes this year, but in a
race like this everything has to go right on the day,'' Sylvester
said. ``It's a total package of luck and ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee certainly has the ability, having won four of his
last five starts, including his last three, and finishing second in
the other. Another advantage Muscles Yankee has is that he will be
driven by John Campbell, seeking a record fifth Hambletonian title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's faster than last year,'' Campbell said about Muscles
Yankee, who won six of nine starts in 1997. ``He's very versatile,
more mature and lighter on his feet. I also like our starting
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee will leave from the sixth hole, while Sylvester's
other three horses _ Armbro Rotary, Silver Pine and David Raymond _
will leave from the first three inside posts, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester's first Hambletonian winner came in 1987 with Mack
Lobell, a horse he purchased for $17,000 that earned nearly $4
million. His other title came in 1989 with Park Avenue Joe in a
dead-heat finish with Probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some good ones,'' Sylvester said, ``but this is the
first time I've had a good all-around bunch like this.''

ALICEA RESCUES RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers learned Thursday that reserve
Luis Alicea will become more significant in the season's seven
remaining weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the organization, though, will question the
significance of the 5-foot-9 infielder thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea replaced sore-kneed second baseman Mark McLemore in the
starting lineup Thursday night and was 2-for-3 with two runs batted
in as the Rangers defeated the Boston Red Sox, 7-4, last night at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lead the American League West by two games against
Anaheim, which did not play last night.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett (7-11) gave the Rangers a quality
start, allowing three runs in a 6 1/3-inning appearance, and right
fielder Juan Gonzalez produced the most awe-inspiring event of the
evening with a seventh-inning, solo home run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Alicea emerged as the most significant figure with two-out,
run-scoring base hits in the second and fourth innings and a
seventh-inning sacrifice bunt that led to the Rangers' sixth run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way our bench has played all year. We've talked all
year about `The Fab Five II,' '' Oates said of infielders Alicea
and Domingo Cedeno, outfielders Roberto Kelly and Mike Simms, and
catcher Bill Haselman. ``I've got to where I expect it from them.
Where would we be without our bench?''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in
September, continues to be hampered by soreness. McLemore will be
monitored closely the rest of the season and will play as pain
allows.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Alicea, who made his 23rd start at second base
and 44th this season, will likely spell McLemore on a more regular
basis the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to play every day, whether it's off the bench or
starting,'' Alicea said. ``I knew the infield was set when I came
here, so I prepared myself for any role.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea starred in his role as a two-out delivery man against Red
Sox right-hander Bret Saberhagen (11-6).
</P>
<P>
   His two-out, second-inning single, which scored designated
hitter Lee Stevens, gave the Rangers a 3-1 advantage, and his
two-out, fourth-inning triple again scored Stevens and gave Burkett
a three-run lead to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being in pressure situations and having a chance to be
the hero,'' Alicea said. ``You're going to be the goat most of the
time because that's the way baseball is, but I like being in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea's seventh-inning sacrifice bunt led to another run, and
Gonzalez later deposited a 3-2 pitch from left-hander Greg Swindell
into the club-level seats in left field for a 429-foot home run
that gave the Rangers a 7-3 lead. It was the fifth home run and
third by Gonzalez to be hit into the club-level seats in The
Ballpark's five-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the eighth inning with that lead intact, but
slumping left-hander Eric Gunderson jeopardized that lead by
failing to retire any of the three batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn, who earlier hit his 28th home
run this season against Burkett, greeted Gunderson with a leadoff
home run. Oates replaced Gunderson with right-hander Xavier
Hernandez after consecutive singles by shortstop Nomar Garciaparra
and left fielder Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez induced two ground balls, and the Rangers escaped the
jam with a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers closer John Wetteland, who surrendered a walk and a
single in the ninth inning, retired Vaughn for the game's final
out. Vaughn, the potential tying run, swung at and missed
Wetteland's 3-2 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The save was the 30th for Wetteland, who pitched for the third
consecutive night and fourth time in five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a guy like Wetteland sitting around for a
guy like Vaughn,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Burkett said of the diminutive infielder.
``He's been a real key for us. I think our bench has been
unbelievable. Those guys have won a lot of ballgames for us this
year.''

FORMER BAT EXEC BUSTED IN ALLEGED PROSTITUTION RACKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A former executive at BAT International Inc. has
been arrested at a hotel near the company's suburban headquarters
for allegedly running a prostitution ring out of the front office,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Salutare, a former lingerie shop owner who has worked at
BAT since January, was arrested July 30 while eating lunch at the
Burbank Airport Hilton hotel, across the street from BAT
headquarters. Salutare, 40, was arrested by detectives from the Los
Angeles Police Department's organized crime and vice division on
suspicion of pandering and was later released on $25,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   According to company officials, police also entered BAT offices
after the arrest and removed a file from Salutare's desk but did
not search the premises.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Thursday, Salutare said only that the
charges are groundless. ``Nothing happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salutare is the girlfriend of BAT founder and Chief Executive
Joseph LaStella and most recently served as the company's
controller. Though she left her full-time position with BAT in
July, Salutare still works one day a week keeping the company's
books, said LaStella, who posted her bail.
</P>
<P>
   Salutare acknowledged running a lingerie business at least in
part out of BAT's office. She advertised in area newspapers for
models to wear lingerie samples at parties she organized to sell
the clothing. But police allege Salutare also arranged work for
some of the women as prostitutes, LaStella said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond confirming Salutare's arrest, police would not comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Bill Wason said no other employees at BAT were
aware of any of the alleged activities.
</P>
<P>
   LaStella said he blames disgruntled former employees for leading
police on a wild goose chase. ``But I guess we'll find out in
court,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pandering carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based BAT made headlines earlier this year when the
engineering firm announced it had developed an internal-combustion
automobile engine capable of achieving more than 100 miles per
gallon. The announcement sent the company's stock skyrocketing in a
matter of weeks from 6 cents a share to a peak of more than $3
before falling again. That meteoric rise led to a continuing
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to automotive engineering, BAT announced plans this
year to enter the electricity market and has also begun marketing
an automotive lubricant called SuperBAT.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, the company plans to hold a competition between a
car outfitted with its BAT technology, which spawned the intense
investor interest, against a hybrid electric vehicle made by Toyota
but operated by BAT to compare fuel efficiency and performance.
</P>
<P>
   BAT shares closed Thursday unchanged at 50 cents.

`CONSERVATIVE' COWBOYS DON'T PLAY MCIVER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Guard Everett McIver, who sustained a deep cut
on his neck in a training-camp dormitory incident July 29, was with
the Cowboys on Thursday night but did not play in the scrimmage
against the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team decided it was not worth
the risk to have McIver play in the scrimmage. Jones said McIver
will practice with the team today at training camp in Wichita
Falls, but added that his status for tomorrow's preseason game
against the Raiders at Texas Stadium is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll practice him the next couple of days and take a look,''
Jones said. ``We are just being very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said, ``I think we've got a shot at . I'm
anxious to see him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver, who returned to training camp Wednesday, was in street
clothes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McIver missed Friday's preseason game with the Seattle Seahawks
and did not return to training camp at Midwestern State University
for three days.
</P>
<P>
   McIver entered the Sun Bowl yesterday surrounded by security
personnel and did not talk to reporters. However, he did talk to
Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin. The two shook hands and chatted
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   A source said last week that Irvin was involved in the dorm
incident and that the wound was inflicted by scissors.

COWBOYS' TOP OFFENSE MARCHES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The Cowboys' first-team offense and ``backup''
running back Chris Warren picked up in Thursday night's Sun Bowl
scrimmage against the Oakland Raiders where they left off in last
week's preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   On their first drive against the Raiders, the Cowboys marched 65
yards in eight plays for a touchdown. Highlights of the drive were
two pass completions from Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman to
Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was for 15 yards, as Irvin toasted Raiders defensive
back and 1997 Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, setting up a
first down at the Raiders' 14-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Warren took it the rest of the way with a powerful touchdown run
behind the right side of the Cowboys' offense line. Warren scored
in the first quarter against Seattle on the same play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the same thing the fans saw,'' Gailey said. ``The ball
went down the field and into the end zone. But until I watch the
tape, I really can't evaluate how we played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made two third-down conversions on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm looking for from our offense is consistency and the
ability to convert third downs,'' Aikman said. ``I thought we had a
little bit of both of those tonight.''
Lett sparks defense
Defensive tackle Leon Lett had a strong game. Lett had a tackle for
a loss and a sack on the Raiders' first 20-play offensive
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not letting the Raiders score, the Cowboys might have
growing concerns on defense because of the lack of a consistent
pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis didn't get close to
the Raiders quarterbacks during the scrimmage. The only pressure
came from Lett or from blitzes from the secondary.

RANGERS' ZEILE HAS MADE LOTS OF STOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Todd Zeile seemed destined to play for the
Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Newhall on Sept. 9,
1965, the same day Sandy Koufax threw his perfect game against the
Chicago Cubs. He grew up a Dodgers fan and was a big star at UCLA.
He married UCLA classmate Julianne McNamara, a gold medal gymnast
at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a charity golf tournament benefiting a local junior
college and raised funds for the Special Olympics. He has those
Southern California surfer-boy good looks that went over well
during his appearances on ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Zeile signed a three-year, $9.6 million contract with
the Dodgers on Dec. 8, 1996, his destiny seemed to be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the grand design, but it also might not
have been realistic,'' Zeile said. ``I know that nothing is certain
in this game, unless you have a no-trade clause in your contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile did not and never has. Instead, he has been stamped with a
``Have Bat, Will Travel'' label, a vagabond now with his seventh
team in four seasons. That would seem an inexplicable number for a
player who may not be the superstar the St. Louis Cardinals once
expected but still has the 28th most runs batted in by any
major-leaguer since the start of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   So the obvious question ... clubhouse lawyer? Malcontent?
Doesn't hustle? Beanie Baby thief?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with him,'' said Rangers coach Bucky
Dent, who was Zeile's infield coach for four years with the
Cardinals. ``He's a great guy, a super guy. He's what I call a true
professional, a quiet guy who plays hard and does his job. He's
been perfect every time I've been around him. It's just that
different teams have different needs and go after different guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers needed a third baseman, so Texas has become the
third stop for Zeile in a season that began with World Series
aspirations in Los Angeles, followed by 10 weeks of uncertainty
with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an unusual season, even by his wandering standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously been unique,'' Zeile said. ``With the Dodgers,
I finally had a feeling like I had the opportunity to be in one
place for a period of time and maybe even be on a winner there. We
had more talent there than our record showed, but it's hard to put
a finger on what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to correct the problem on May 16, when they
traded Zeile and catcher Mike Piazza to the Marlins for Gary
Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich. The
history-making trade brought Zeile's heartwarming homecoming to a
sudden end. He also knew the Marlins would dump his salary at the
first opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to react to that,'' Zeile said. ``I was
thrown into a situation that had never been seen before in baseball
and probably will never be duplicated again. It was a big shock but
I had to adjust to it. It would have been self-defeating to let
circumstances affect my performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Symmetry brought Zeile to Texas. The Rangers needed a third
baseman because the Cardinals wanted Fernando Tatis included in the
Todd Stottlemyre-Royce Clayton deal. Tatis is the Cardinals' third
baseman of the future. Zeile was once that with the Cardinals and a
whole lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took him as a catcher in the second round of the
1986 draft and three years later, he was named 1989 Minor League
Player of the Year by ``USA Today.'' The Cardinals, who went to
three World Series in the 1980s, expected much from him.
</P>
<P>
   But 1990 was a bad year for everybody in St. Louis. The
Cardinals went 70-92, their second-worst record since World War I.
Manager Whitey Herzog bailed out halfway through the season, Willie
McGee was traded, Pedro Guerrero slumped and Terry Pendleton left.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile hit .244 with 15 homers and 57 RBI. He was only a rookie
but still labeled a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were such high expectations and when the team really
struggled, a lot of that was reflected on me,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre asked Zeile to move to third base the next
year to make room for Tom Pagnozzi. Torre had once made the same
move as a player, but Zeile had misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was against it at first,'' Zeile said. ``But they said it
was good for the team and, at that point, I wasn't in a position to
question what was good for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been the superstar the Cardinals expected, but
the bat did come around. He hit .277 with 17 homers and 103 RBI in
1993 and had 19 homers and 75 RBI the following strike-shortened
season.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile thought he was going to be with the Cardinals for a long
time, a belief seemingly confirmed on the eve of the 1995 season
when he agreed to a three-year, $12 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, that turned out to be the event that began his nomadic
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals reneged on the deal,'' Zeile said, still visibly
irritated four years later. ``I was going to miss the first five
games of the season \Rbecause of a thumb injury\S and they wanted
to wait. Then \Rowner\S August Busch was out of town. Then the club
president was out of town. They kept making excuses. The bottom
line was three weeks later they came and said I needed to take a
one-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile refused and went to arbitration, which was being done
during the season because of the strike. He also filed a grievance
with the Players Association. He asked for $4.1 million in
arbitration and was so annoyed with the Cardinals he refused to
settle at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They traded me to the \RChicago\S Cubs on two conditions,''
Zeile said. ``No. 1, I had to settle for $3.6 million, the midpoint
in the arbitration case, and I had to drop my grievance. It took me
10 seconds to say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the rest of that season with the Cubs, then signed a
one-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1996. He was traded
to the Baltimore Orioles on Aug. 29, 1996, hit .364 with three home
runs in the League Championship Series, then got the call from the
Dodgers to come home.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out, with another year left on his contract, he
could be with the Rangers longer than he was with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the possibility of coming here \Rarose\S, I thought it
was everything I wanted,'' Zeile said. ``It's a great lineup, a
great ballpark and a chance to win. That's what I'm looking for.''

REVISITING ALVAREZ-SOSA CATASTROPHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Minnesota manager Tom Kelly was generous in
his praise of the Rangers' trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas did a pretty good job,'' Kelly said. ``\RRafael\S
Palmeiro, \RJulio\S Franco, \RRuben\S Sierra and Harold Baines
batting together sounds pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wasn't alone in that thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lineup with Baines in the middle is awfully
attractive,'' Milwaukee manager Tom Trebelhorn said. `They're going
to be a tough team to contain offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   And Oakland manager Tony La Russa said, ``Any time you get
Harold Baines, it's a good trade. No matter who else is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sammy Sosa and Wilson Alvarez were involved, and opinions
changed. Tom Grieve did not receive the Executive of the Year
award, as Skip Bayless suggested he should have been in the
``Dallas Times-Herald.'' Instead, Grieve was later crucified. Nine
years later, the worst trade in franchise history has not been
forgotten, not when Sosa is among those threatening to break Roger
Maris' single-season home-run record.
</P>
<P>
   However, just as Doug Melvin was lauded last week when he
acquired Todd Stottlemyre, Todd Zeile and Royce Clayton, Grieve
initially was widely praised in 1989 when he traded Sosa, Alvarez
and infielder Scott Fletcher to the Chicago White Sox for Baines
and infielder Fred Manrique.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the 1989 trade was announced, Jim Reeves wrote in
the ``Star-Telegram'': ``By making the trade, the Rangers showed
their fans, and more importantly, their players that they're
willing to do what it takes to keep the team in the pennant race
down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star-Telegram'' also ran a ``You Make the Call'' in the
paper the next day, inviting fans to phone in their opinion.
Eighteen responses were published with a variety of opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Six people praised the trade and two said the Rangers made a
mistake in trading Sosa and Alvarez. Four were upset that Fletcher
was traded. Three said the Rangers should have traded Pete
Incaviglia instead of Sosa. Two said the Rangers needed to trade
for pitching. One person said, ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Baines welcomed the trade, saying, ``I'm not happy getting out
of a place I've been for ten years. But I was tired of losing. Now
I'm with a team going in the right direction. I'm glad to be a part
of it. My goal all along has been to get a World Series ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Baines didn't get one and was never happy in Texas. He was
supposed to be the Rangers' designated hitter for many years but
was traded the next season.
</P>
<P>
   It turned ugly in 1991 when Alvarez threw a no-hitter for the
White Sox and people started wondering what Grieve was thinking
when he made the trade. The furor will never subside. A disgruntled
limited partner made a point of asking Grieve about it every year
at ownership meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Most people forget that the Rangers traded Sosa because they
thought they had Juan Gonzalez and Donald Harris coming soon.
Alvarez was forgotten because the team had Brian Bohanon, John
Barfield and Darren Oliver in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who the White Sox also wanted, was considered
untouchable. And manager Bobby Valentine, a few weeks before the
trade was made, projected Sosa as a player who would hit .280 with
20 homers and 80 runs batted in. There was no talk about Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The trade actually would never have been made if White Sox
general manager Larry Himes had been able to trade Dave Gallagher
to Detroit for center fielder Gary Pettis. But Pettis was eligible
for free agency and the trade was held up because he wouldn't agree
to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   So Grieve pulled the trigger. He also signed Pettis as a free
agent in the off-season, another move that was praised at first but
questioned two years later when Pettis was released in spring
training. An outfield of Sosa, Gonzalez and Ruben Sierra would have
looked much better.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball trades receive spur-of-the-moment praise. It's
only later, after reality sets in, that gains and losses can truly
be assessed.  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817) 390-7760

MCLEMORE MISSES GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' lineup Thursday night did not
include second baseman Mark McLemore. That will not be uncommon
during the season's remaining seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in
September, will be monitored closely and play as pain allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``His knees are not 100 percent,'' said manager Johnny Oates,
who indicated that McLemore likely will miss a second consecutive
start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Luis Alicea, who started Thursday night's
game, likely will spell McLemore on a more regular basis the
remainder of the season. Oates consulted Wednesday with Dr. John
Conway, who recommended rest for McLemore's knees. McLemore, who
entered last night's game hitting .178 (19-for-107) in his past 30
games, has seen his average fall from .312 to .268 and his range
decrease during that span.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore started only three of the six games at the Metrodome
and SkyDome during the Rangers' most recent road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the turf did him any good,'' Oates said. His
knees ``just haven't bounced back.''
Search for a lefty
The acquisition of a left-handed reliever ranks among the top
priorities for Rangers general manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bailes (bursitis, left shoulder) remains on the 15-day
disabled list, and Eric Gunderson continues to struggle. The
Rangers, though, likely will not turn to left-hander Tony Fossas,
whom the Chicago Cubs released recently. Jim Bronner, who
represents Fossas, called Melvin yesterday and left a message in an
attempt to gauge the Rangers' interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to our people about him,'' Melvin said. ``My
gut feeling, though, is he's not somebody we'll be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to meet during the next couple of weeks and see if
there's anybody in the system that can help us,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers Jeff Granger (3-6, 4.37) and Mike Venafro of
Triple-A Oklahoma likely would be the top candidates. Venafro, whom
the Rangers promoted this week from Double-A Tulsa, recorded three
strikeouts and allowed only one hit during three innings Wednesday
in his first appearance at the Triple-A level.
</P>
<P>
   However, Melvin said any minor-league pitcher likely would not
be promoted until September.
Searching for Angels
Angels right-hander Ken Hill, who went on the 15-day disabled list
June 11, reported no discomfort after pitching three innings during
a simulated game Wednesday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Hill underwent arthroscopic surgery June 15 to remove bone spurs
from his right elbow. The Angels scheduled a bullpen session today
in Chicago for Hill (8-5, 5.15), and the right-hander likley will
begin a medical rehabilitation assignment Sunday with Class-A Cedar
Rapids of the Midwest League.
Briefly
The Red Sox yesterday acquired left-hander Pete Schourek from the
Astros for cash considerations and reinstated right-hander Jim
Corsi from the 15-day disabled list. The Red Sox also placed
right-hander Rich Garces (bone chips, right elbow) on the 15-day
disabled list (retroactive to Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre is scheduled to participate in the
Texas Rangers' ``Star-Telegram'' Chat Room from 3:30-3:50 p.m.
Friday on the Rangers' official site (www.texasrangers.com).
Farm report
Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): Shortstop Scott Sheldon
went 2-for-4 with two runs scored, a double and his 28th home run,
but the RedHawks (59-53) lost to Vancouver, 7-4, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): Right-hander Rodney Pedraza
recorded eight strikeouts and surrendered only two runs during his
seven-inning appearance, but the Drillers (62-55) lost to Arkansas,
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): Right-hander Chris
Tynan (4-6, 4.52) recorded a season-high 10 strikeouts and pitched
seven scoreless innings as the Sand Gnats (57-61) defeated
Columbus, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski (Appalachian League, rookie): Left fielder Kevin Harris
hit his seventh home run of the season during the top of the ninth
inning to propel the Rangers (18-28) to a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Coast (Gulf Coast League, rookie): The Rangers (22-19)
split a double-header of seven-inning games with the Royals, who
won the first game, 1-0. Second baseman Pedro Guerrero went 2-for-4
and drove in three runs during the Rangers' 6-2 victory in the
second game.

MAN USES BACKHOE TO CHASE TEEN WHO FIRED GUN IN HIS DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. -- A man accused of driving a backhoe through
a neighbor's fence after an argument, injuring the woman and her
son, was released from custody pending further investigation,
sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clutter, 38, was arrested shortly after the 10:30 p.m.
Wednesday incident, in suburban Antelope Acres, which injured
neighbor Cassandra Davenport, 32, and her 14-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need for more investigation,'' said Lt. Tom Pigott,
in charge of the Lancaster sheriff's station detective bureau. ``We
need to talk to witnesses and determine what took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutter told officials that he became angered with the
14-year-old after the teen-ager began firing an unknown type of
weapon, possibly a BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbor indicated the rounds were coming in his
direction,'' Pigott said. ``He confronted the juvenile and a verbal
argument ensued.''
</P>
<P>
   During the argument, Clutter climbed on his backhoe and drove it
through a chain-link fence that separates the two properties,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clutter drove the machine, the youth allegedly pointed a
.38-caliber handgun in his direction. The gun went off, wounding
the teen in his leg, when Davenport forced her son's hand down to
try to prevent a shooting, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Clutter drove his backhoe into a car behind which
Davenport and her son were standing, pinning them between the car
and their mobile home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was airlifted to Providence Holy Cross Hospital in
Mission Hills, a Los Angeles suburb, for his gunshot wound and a
dislocated hip.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster,
where she was treated for a broken right leg and cuts to her lower
abdomen and upper body.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are investigating to see if the incident is
part of a continuing neighborhood dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if this is an isolated incident,'' Pigott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is about 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending months of anticipation with a resigned
shrug, Monica Lewinsky walked into a federal courthouse here
Thursday, and, a lawyer familiar with her account said, testified
that she and President Clinton had carried on a sexual affair
inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony before a federal grand jury, which contradicted a
previous sworn statement, tightened the legal and political vise
around Clinton. The president denied under oath in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit that he had had a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, and he has denied it as well to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified to having had several sexual encounters
with Clinton in his small, private study down a short hallway from
the Oval Office, the lawyer said. As expected, she also testified
that she and the president had talked about ways to conceal their
relationship, the lawyer said, but she also said he never directly
told her to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, is investigating
accusations that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice by
trying to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months of waiting for Ms. Lewinsky to tell her
story ended just before 8:30 a.m., when she stepped from a dark
green Toyota Land Cruiser, embraced a lawyer, shrugged and vanished
inside. As portable generators rumbled in the background and one
cameraman swept the scene from a cherrypicker 50 feet over Third
Street, about 20 satellite trucks beamed images of Ms. Lewinsky _
once an unpaid, anonymous sorter of White House mail _ around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, answered questions in exchange for immunity
from prosecution for any wrongdoing she describes. She is
vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies in her testimony, in a
deal worked out with prosecutors nine days ago. In an affidavit on
Jan. 7 in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky swore that she had not had a
sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's described her six and a half
hours before the grand jury as grueling. ``She was asked very
specific questions about very private matters which are very hard
to discuss in public,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky has agonized for months over the prospect
of damaging Clinton's presidency, friends have said. One of her
friends described Ms. Lewinsky as saying Wednesday night, as she
prepared for her testimony: ``What I'm doing tomorrow is something
I never ever wanted to do. It breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 27, the 23 grand jurors have listened to the
testimony of more than 70 witnesses and hours of surreptitiously
taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and her former friend
Linda Tripp. Thursday was the grand jurors' first opportunity to
look Starr's prized witness in the eyes, question her and judge her
credibility for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Before another media scrum after Ms. Lewinsky completed her
testimony, her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said she had answered
questions from prosecutors and urors ``truthfully, completely and
honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal finally
appears to be coming to an end,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never publicly described his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky in any detail, beyond defiantly declaring that it was not
sexual.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a capital whipsawed between disclosure and denial, starkly
different days unspooled at the federal courthouse and the White
House. Summoning the authority and trappings of his office, as well
as his own storied political resilience, President Clinton went
about his official duties Thursday without betraying a hint of
interest in the former intern's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this day for quite a long time,''
Clinton said in one speech at a Washington hotel, referring to his
opportunity to address a White House conference on building
economic self-improvement in Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president appeared before a row of
uniformed police officers in the sun-gilded Rose Garden to call for
a permanent five-day waiting period for people seeking to buy
handguns. With a quick left-handed salute after the official
remarks, the president cued a brassy Marine band to strike up
``Stars and Stripes Forever.'' Reporters waiting to shout questions
about Ms. Lewinsky were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Some White House advisers gave vent to frustration over the
spectacle at the courthouse and the unremitting pressure of the
Lewinsky investigation. ``I hate the whole thing,'' said one. ``I
hate you, I hate us.'' Then, in his disgust, words failed him.
``Ugh,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, provided the official
reaction to the testimony. ``The president has not expressed any
views to us on this,'' he said in a contentious and sometimes
raucous briefing Thursday, ``except we know that he does agree with
us _ and probably all Americans _ that if this means that we're
coming to the end of this four-year, over $40 million
investigation, then that would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said the White House had no interest in drawing
attention Thursday. ``We're showing wise restraint,'' he said.
``Nobody's going to criticize Ms. Lewinsky, and we're not going to
get in the story. It's a big enough story without us.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their restraint, White House advisers telephoned
reporters late Thursday evening to ask what they had learned about
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Ms. Lewinsky's version of her relationship with
the president was still in doubt. But Starr's investigation has
rushed forward since then, with her immunity agreement and
Clinton's own promise to testify at the White House on Aug. 17. In
striking the deal with Starr, Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a navy
blue dress that prosecutors have sent to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation crime laboratory. Technicians there are trying to
determine if the dress contained physical evidence of a sexual
encounter with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was asked a series of questions about the dress
Thursday. Prosecutors have left open the possibility of recalling
Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury, perhaps after the president
testifies.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from across the country and around the world converged
on the courthouse Thursday, clucking over the spectacle and
contributing to it at the same time. Some reporters began claiming
choice spots as early as Wednesday evening for a glimpse of Ms.
Lewinsky _ only to be flummoxed Thursday morning as she took an
unexpected route through the courthouse, up to the third floor in
an elevator reserved for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as passers-by stopped to take in the scene, scores of
photographers lined up for a shot of her. When George Hancock, a
supporter of Ms. Lewinsky's from Bowling Green, Ky., tried to raise
his yellow hand-lettered sign wishing her luck, he cut off their
line of sight. ``You wave that sign again,'' screamed one
cameraman, ``I'll kill you!''
</P>
<P>
   Ducking out of view, Hancock was surrounded moments later by
reporters and photographers, some of whom berated him while others
tried to interview him. ``How's it make you feel, buddy?'' Dominic
Mumeka, 33, murmured as if to himself as he stood off to one side.
``This is your 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumeka, who cleans a taxi depot, said he had dropped by to watch
history be made. ``There hasn't been anything like this since
Watergate, and before that since Andrew Johnson, 1869,'' he said.
But, he asked, ``Can a guy really get impeached for going to bed
with someone?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has resolutely refused to question Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility publicly. But fragmentary accounts have
emerged that White House officials were concerned that she had a
crush on the president.
</P>
<P>
   An Indianapolis lawyer who has worked as a Democratic operative
said in an interview Thursday that he had been asked to keep an eye
on Ms. Lewinsky at an Oct. 23, 1996 fund-raiser here to ensure that
she did not ``embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sullivan, a lobbyist and lawyer from Indianapolis, said
that he had been asked by a friend in the administration to watch
Ms. Lewinsky because she had recently left the White House and
there were concerns she was ``disgruntled.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan recalled his friend as saying about Ms. Lewinsky: ```We
don't know if she has fantasized a relationship with the president.
But she keeps showing up at these events.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he had watched Ms. Lewinsky reach out with both
hands to hug the president. ``And he hugged her back,'' he said.
``Then he said to her, `How are you doing?' She said, `Fine.' He
said, `How's your new job?' And she said, `Great.' He said, `I wish
you the best of luck,' and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he spoke on Monday with a television station in
Indianapolis. In a sign that the White House is following up any
lead to bolster Clinton's story, Sullivan said that on Wednesday
David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, called him to ask a
number of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he felt no pressure to tell his story publicly.

FAIR PLAY HAS SUDDEN LACK OF SUBSTANCE

<P>
   A landmark passing took place in the world of sports two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest U.S. women's athlete of all time,
heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee, quietly competed in her final
track-and-field meet.
</P>
<P>
   Tears flowed. Spontaneous ovations were the order of the day.
But large headlines were hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Bolder, sexier news items keep barging onto the sports pages. In
Joyner-Kersee's own sport, she was upstaged by news last week that
Texas A&AMP;M gold-medal Olympic shot putter Randy Barnes had tested
positive for a banned substance and faces a lifetime suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, yesterday in Switzerland, the International Swimming
Federation (FINA) announced that three-time Olympic gold-medal
swimmer Michelle Smith of Ireland _ and the University of Houston _
has been banned for tampering with her urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   At the 95-year-old Tour de France, one team was kicked out,
others withdrew, and at least six more teams were under suspicion
for using banned substances as the venerable bike race chugged into
its final leg along the Champs-Elysee.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there is Joyner-Kersee, who leaves her sport
untainted by innuendo or a checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, alas, is a sporting world that can't seem to
play fair or pass a urine test.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's case, suspicions lapped at her heels as far back as
the Atlanta Olympics. She was 26 and had surfaced from a career of
consolation heats to suddenly win gold medals in the 400-meter
freestyle and the 200- and 400-meter individual medleys.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical swimming world peered at her performances and her
choice of husbands _ Dutch discus thrower and shot putter Erik de
Bruin _ and assumed the worst. de Bruin himself had been banned
from track and field for four years for testing positive for high
levels of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's haughty stance amid the rumors didn't win her many
disciples. The world swimming body surprised her with a random test
in her hometown of Dublin in January. And when the results showed
she had spiked the sample with something that smelled like Irish
whiskey _ it could have disguised banned substances in the sample _
FINA moved to suspend Smith for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Spare the Irish jokes, please.
</P>
<P>
   The greater thought here is, doesn't anybody want to play fair
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   In Barnes' case, this would be his second suspension and,
therefore, prompt a lifetime suspension. It also would taint one of
the fond memories of the 1996 Olympics, when Barnes threw to the
gold medal on his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The word is ``would,'' because Barnes says he's innocent.
(Insert sighs here.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he took the stuff, Barnes says. But the substance,
androstenedione, is an over-the-counter dietary supplement Barnes
claims he wasn't informed was banned.
</P>
<P>
   His claim isn't likely to be upheld, history tells us. But it
unsnaps the lid on a fermenting problem in 1990s sports _ athletes,
looking for an edge, taking over-the-counter supplements.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is a high school football player and he is taking
creatine, you might want to read the label. They all have labels.
They all promise increased strength or energy. They're all legal.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has a clue what the long-term effects really will be.
Since 1994, the U.S. government does not regulate the dietary
supplement industry.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want a scare, log on to the Internet and find
something called The Grey Market Underground Web-Mall
(www.Samson-1.com). Behind the gray curtain, the site sells
Renewtrient, which is supposed to be a legal, ``safe'' alternative
to GHB (Gamma Hydroxy Butyric Acid).
</P>
<P>
   In its normal form, GHB can be used as a surgical anesthetic. It
has been found to cause comas, seizures and respiratory arrest. The
makers of Renewtrient claim its product promotes increased
strength, bedroom vigor and ``reversal of male pattern baldness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site does add one disclaimer: ``This product ... is so
powerful you might acquire mild acne from its use.'' It also warns
against driving or operating machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the market abounds for products like Renewtrient.
Creatine is not a GHB alternative, but its claim to help tired
muscles recover more quickly and to help build strength has made it
the supplement of choice among college and professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire has praised creatine. Dave Ellis,
whose title at the University of Nebraska is ``Coordinator of
Performance Nutrition,'' dispenses creatine and other legal dietary
supplements to the school's football players.
</P>
<P>
   The market is there. But so are the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to be bigger, stronger, faster has never been more
gray.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic heroine Jackie Joyner-Kersee deserved bigger headlines
as she retired two weeks ago. We'd offer a toast, instead, but
somebody took the Irish whiskey.

THREE STOOGES, SONNY AND CHER LOOK-ALIKES TRY TO MAKE THEIR MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The casting call for ``And the Beat Goes On: The
Sonny and Cher Story'' brought wanna-bes from as far away as
British Columbia, wearing black wigs and bell-bottoms, carrying
very big dreams but chasing very little hope.
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming was the idea, after all, said Larry Thompson. The
producer of the ABC-TV movie about the lives of the once-married
television icons had announced the nationwide call for unknowns to
cast in the leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   And so there was Anna Lashmet, 46, an interior designer from
suburban North Hills and a dead ringer for Cher who sang ``I Got
You Babe'' with suburban Tujunga resident Bret Davidson, a stuntman
she met standing in the long line of hopefuls that formed at 6 a.m.
Thursday outside the ABC Entertainment Center in downtown Century
City.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed pair were among the undisputed best, even
getting to read a scene for Thompson and his team. But really, they
didn't stand much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Lashmet admitted to Thompson that her singing career was
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do karaoke,'' she said, laughing. ``I do Cher, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in Hollywood, a similar story was playing out in front of a
restaurant staging a promotional stunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Planet Hollywood contest was looking to find the best Three
Stooges shtick. The winners won't garner roles as Larry, Curly or
Moe -- just dinner and a special screening of a coming ``Three
Stooges'' film during the restaurant's Stooges festival.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than many of the tall, lanky women and goofy little
guys walked away with after auditioning for Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   History and industry insiders say the chances of any of
Thursday's auditioners actually landing lead roles in the show are
slimmer than Cher's waist.
</P>
<P>
   The roles of Sonny and Cher probably already have been filled by
experienced performers -- and Thursday's casting call was likely no
more than a publicity stunt, show-biz insiders say.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson insists he would prefer unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``With icons as big as Sonny and Cher, it's important not to
cast celebrities and stars because it's hard for the audience to
get past their faces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he spoke, impersonators, look-alikes and aspiring
actresses belted out renditions of ``I Got You Babe'' with varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have fresh, unknown faces with charisma and chemistry,
the audience tends to embrace them earlier,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   With Thompson's gentle manner and sweet Southern drawl, it was
easy to believe him. But rarely do such casting calls yield more
than a few great stories for the realists and some serious
heartache for the dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson did a similar casting call in the 1980s for ``Lucy and
Desi: The Laughter Goes On.'' The actors who eventually played Lucy
and Desi were not among those who answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same for ``Selena,'' the movie about the slain Latina
pop star. Those auditions drew thousands of young Latinas for a
part that eventually went to Jennifer Lopez, though the young
Selena was portrayed by someone ``discovered'' at the auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson insisted he would like nothing better than to find
unknowns to play the roles of Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is about dreams,'' he said. ``If two unknowns can
suddenly rise to fame and success, that's great. It can happen for
two people out there looking to play Sonny and Cher.''

SECURITY COUNCIL CLOSES RANKS AGAINST BAGHDAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for inserts and reorganization)  
(lh) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council closed ranks Thursday to
berate Iraq for ending cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, but
took no action other than to demand that Baghdad reverse its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Iraq was isolated in the Security Council, the
government got mixed signals from Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
suggested that the Iraqis, ``desperate'' for some movement toward
ending sanctions, needed to be brought more closely into
deliberations here.
</P>
<P>
   But in a written statement in Washington, President Clinton
said, ``Far from hastening the day the international community
lifts sanctions,'' Iraq's failure to permit inspections ``will
perpetuate those sanctions and keep the Iraqi economy under tight
international control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council members, united in shock and a touch of
weariness at having to work their way through another unexpected
crisis created by Baghdad, called Iraq's decision to freeze
cooperation with inspectors ``totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Moscow and Paris, the capitals most sympathetic to
the Iraqis, governments distanced themselves from Baghdad in
statements. In Russia and China, there were expressions of concern
about the consequences of continued Iraqi defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now extremely important not to stoke tensions over
Iraq,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin,
told a news briefing in Moscow. A Chinese spokesman, Tang Guoqiang,
said his government would do what it could ``to avoid a worsening
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton said the Iraqi move ``once again will
backfire,'' his statement emphasized sanctions as the wedge to
force Iraq to comply with inspections. Administration officials
said there was no immediate consideration of military force, saying
that the situation so far seemed to be less serious than last
October, when the Iraqis expelled U.S. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that the administration would consider the use of
force if the situation deteriorated. ``We'll take our time _ we're
not going to let Saddam call the shots,'' one administration
official said Thursday night, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance went on as usual in Baghdad Thursday, though no
actual site inspections were attempted because Iraq barred them on
Wednesday, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq decided this week that it would end cooperation with
arms inspections and allow only passive monitoring by surveillance
cameras, the Iraqis were aware that they were actually close to
meeting disarmament requirements in some areas, Richard Butler, the
chief arms inspector told the Security Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
said Thursday that the Iraqis also knew that problems in accounting
for biological and some chemical compounds were serious and
growing. Right up to the present, Iraq has continued to change
figures and alter other information earlier presented as ``full,
final and complete'' declarations.
</P>
<P>
   At times the Iraqis have been forced to revise a story when
confronted with evidence by inspectors _ as in the recent case of
the discovery of traces of VX nerve gas on shell casings after
Iraqis denied that they had used it. At other times, they volunteer
new information _ but that only raises more troubling questions
about why an account has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent examinations of old warhead remnants, for example,
weapons experts found more traces of anthrax than they could
explain, UNSCOM officials said Thursday. When the Iraqis were
pressed, they revised earlier ``final figures'' to say that they
had actually filled three times as many warheads with anthrax _ 16
_ as with botulism _ 5. Until then, Iraq said it had filled weapons
with more than three times more botulism than anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   This admission has revived speculation among inspectors that
Iraq produced not only more anthrax, but also two kinds of it, one
in a dry form that is easier to spray and has a longer shelf life.
Officials insisted Thursday, however, that this is only speculation
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Iraq changes the figures, it has a ripple effect
throughout their entire declaration,'' said Charles Duelfer, deputy
chairman of UNSCOM. ``That is a very complicated procedure because
a declaration is built and substantiated to support one set of
numbers and to change that becomes very difficult.''

 UNITED NATIONS: very difficult.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and chief
negotiator on weapons issues, gave a new explanation of how VX
nerve gas could have been found on the shells. In a letter to the
Security Council on Wednesday, he said the traces could have been
created from the ``decomposition of other chemical substances or
from the use of equipment which had already been used to produce
the VX agent.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's lengthy Council meeting, a Western diplomat
said that nobody relished having to take strong action to make Iraq
conform to its agreements. Until the arms inspectors are satisfied
that Iraq has provided answers to outstanding questions about
biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs, Saddam cannot
hope to see the end of sanctions, which were imposed in 1990 after
the invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was weary, everyone was annoyed and everyone was
concerned that this not turn into a crisis that would force the
United States to act as it had to act last year,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   The council action came after Butler briefed members on his
aborted trip to Iraq, which ended when talks broke down earlier
this week. He also spoke on the Iraqi leadership's refusal to turn
over documents, including one discovered in July that shed light on
the amount of ``nonconventional munitions'' used during the 1980-87
war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that the document could prove that there are
larger quantities of chemical _ and possibly biological _ agents
unaccounted for in Iraq than inspectors were told about last year.
Iraqis said that they had filled 101,080 warheads with chemical
weapons in the 1980s, but the new document reveals that fewer than
that were actually deployed. The inspectors want to know what
happened to the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also spoke to the council about his assessment of Iraq's
position after talking Thursday morning with Aziz. Annan told the
council that Iraq was ``clearly in violation of the resolutions of
the Security Council and the memorandum of understanding I
concluded in Baghdad in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is well understood by the government of Iraq,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan added that he thought Iraq's position was ``not a
closed one,'' that Baghdad had acted out of frustration and even
desperation, and that it might be the right time ``to stand back
and make a comprehensive reassessment of where we are, where we are
going and how to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In undertaking this comprehensive review,'' he said, ``it
might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely than we
have hitherto.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Iraq has persistently and successfully
managed to broaden its diplomatic contacts with United Nations
officials, skirting the Security Council when it could. Iraqi has
complained repeatedly that the Council and the disarmament
commission are dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Arab League Thursday, Aziz appealed for
support against what he called the ``injustice'' of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Arms inspectors see this as an Iraqi tactic to bring
international politics into what is essentially a technical
operation to disarm Iraq and destroy its capacity to make new
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Butler also provided the Security Council Thursday with results
of a technical evaluation in July of Iraq's ``full, final and
complete disclosure'' on biological weapons, a document the Iraqis
say closes the file on that issue. This was the third such
technical evaluation demanded by Iraq over the last year, and its
findings were no different from earlier ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new material was presented by Iraq at this meeting,''
Butler wrote in his report of the July technical evaluation. The
international experts again concluded that Iraq's latest disclosure
``was not adequate to allow for credible verification.''
</P>
<P>
   The biological experts found problems with Iraqi accounts of
what they had done with bombs, warheads, spraying devices or
quantities of the agents themselves, including botulinum toxin,
anthrax bacillus and aflatoxin.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative to the
United Nations called the Iraqi demand ``disarmament by
ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: A SHUDDER OF DISGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert missing word in graf 12)  
 (JT)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a picture of the White House lawyer Lanny Breuer leaving
the courthouse Tuesday with his lawyer Mark Lynch. But where is
Lynch's lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   The editor must have cropped him out of the picture. It's hard
to conceive that a lawyer for a White House lawyer would show up at
a courthouse these days without a lawyer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Law is on a hair-raising tear this summer. Make a move without a
lawyer, and you can end up on TV looking guiltier than Count
Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   The law is now engaged in a prodigious power grab. Unless it is
stopped people without lawyers may soon find themselves under
subpoena to explain why they refuse to salute the billable hour.
</P>
<P>
   A coup by the law itself? Quite possibly. It started at the
White House when everybody not anointed by Blackstone was put out
of the scandal loop, including the press secretary, whose task is
to keep the seething masses up to date on the democratic saga.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers _ advised no doubt by their own lawyers _
have raised the infamous old White House stone wall against
universal public enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   This naturally maddens the federal judiciary. Off and on through
history, federal judges have assumed they are better qualified than
presidents and Congress to steer the Republic. We are apparently in
such an era right now.
</P>
<P>
   When the courts finish authorizing Kenneth Starr to strip
Clinton down to his bones and then to his DNA, the supremacy of the
courts will be so well established that none but saints and fools
will want to be president again.
</P>
<P>
   And who will ever again want to become a journalist? Imagine,
mother: Do you want that lovely little child of yours to grow up
and spend a long malodorous life writing stories that make you
shudder with disgust?
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate journalists Woodward and Bernstein inspired a
whole generation of young people to think of journalism as an
honorable way to spend a life. That is the generation that's now
trying to look solemn instead of leering and winking as it issues
the daily bulletins on ladies' dirty linen.
</P>
<P>
   These wretched media people know it's filthy work, but somebody,
they say, has to do it, just as somebody has to clean septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   What pious baloney. Sanitary engineering is a noble career
because it's vital to world health; taste-free journalism makes you
wince with shame for what ought to be an honorable calling. If
you'd be embarrassed to have your children read what you write or
watch you say it on the tube, you'd urge them not to follow in the
parental footsteps, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about this endless business is that there is
absolutely nobody to root for. Polls show the public is sympathetic
to the president, but thinks him a liar.
</P>
<P>
   The softest judgment about him might be that he is a foolish
philanderer and incurable finagler who needs counseling rather than
impeaching.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd conduct of Monica Lewinsky can be put down to the
callowness of youth and a hopeless ignorance of the hazards of
Washington, but her famous photo with Old Glory disclosed a
stunning insensitivity to life's exigencies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp. It's tempting to call her ``poor Linda Tripp.''
Poor because her betrayal of Lewinsky's trust was despicable, and
because she wants to believe it wasn't, and because satirists make
fun of her physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The old folks used to explain why such people deserved no tears
by saying, ``She made her bed, let her lie in it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kenneth Starr, even those who root for him wish he were
more like Spencer Tracy than Charles Laughton. The White House
counterattack has damaged him by comparing him to Inspector Javert
(played by Charles Laughton) in ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   I once heard a woman sum up the plot of this immense novel in 14
words: ``A man steals a loaf of bread and never hears the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With slight changes the line could be applied to the Starr
attempt to get something on the president that will justify his
years of investigation. You'd have to hate Clinton with a fury to
root for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Some people probably do. Sensitive people will be content to
loathe them all quietly for what they have done to the country, for
how they have debased our culture.

   Keeping the peace is essentially what the United Nations was set
up to do. Since then, it has accrued countless other activities,
though this multifariousness does not spell efficiency: other
bodies can do much of the U.N.'s economic work and do it better.
</P>
<P>
   But for the job of international peacekeeper there is often no
alternative _ and it is something a turbulent world still all too
evidently needs.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the world cannot make up its mind how the U.N.
should go about the job, it too is often done inadequately.
</P>
<P>
   The setbacks and frustrations make uncomfortable reading. Many
of the more impenetrable problems _ Cyprus, India and Pakistan,
Western Sahara _ are hardy perennials, resisting change.
</P>
<P>
   But more recent crises demonstrate how ready recalcitrant
governments are to defy the U.N., and how halfheartedly a sloppily
supported U.N. sets about its work.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few recent examples. U.N. investigators were roughly told
by Congo's government that they would not be allowed to unearth the
truth about Rwandan refugees massacred during Laurent Kabila's
march to power.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. has watched, seemingly paralyzed, as Angola slides back
to its awful war: the U.N.'s representative in Angola, who was
killed six weeks ago, has not yet been replaced and the U.N.'s
unarmed monitors have been withdrawn from the murderous Angolan
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And now Iraq, where earlier this year U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan used his personal prestige to avert a military strike by
America and Britain, seems prepared, once again, to challenge the
authority of the U.N. Security Council and its weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   There are many tasks that the U.N., as peacekeeper, cannot
accomplish and therefore should not undertake. The Security
Council's gross mistake, at the heady end of the Cold War, was to
order the peacekeepers on missions impossible, telling them to sort
out wars and atrocities but giving them few means to do so. The
resultant humiliation was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States in the lead, the council then swung in
the opposite direction. The U.N.'s soldiers, it was decreed, were
no longer to try to make peace between adversaries, only to help
keep a peace that had already been agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But war, particularly civil war, is seldom tidy. A huge grey
area lies between peacemaking and peacekeeping. Should the U.N.
intervene, for compelling humanitarian reasons, when civilians are
savagely trapped? Or should it stand by, waiting until the fighting
stops?
</P>
<P>
   What should the U.N. do when, as in Angola, old adversaries
agree on a peace but then turn out not to have meant what they once
agreed?
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy solutions. It would be madness, for instance,
to suggest that U.N. soldiers place their bodies between the evenly
balanced Angolan sides. But what does need bolstering, and soon, is
the authority that the U.N.'s name carries, and its own confidence
in that authority.
</P>
<P>
   When the world body joins together to tell a government to do
something, or not to do something, it should not need to go to war
to make its point. Its voice alone should count.
</P>
<P>
   But this respect cannot be commanded until the U.N.'s senior
members _ the Security Council _ themselves show respect for their
club by working out what peacekeeping entails.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a first mark of respect, America could pay its dues, a
debt that cripples many current attempts to keep the peace. &QL;

   Keeping the peace is essentially what the United Nations was set
up to do. Since then, it has accrued countless other activities,
though this multifariousness does not spell efficiency: other
bodies can do much of the U.N.'s economic work and do it better.
</P>
<P>
   But for the job of international peacekeeper there is often no
alternative _ and it is something a turbulent world still all too
evidently needs.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the world cannot make up its mind how the U.N.
should go about the job, it too is often done inadequately.

of the more impenetrable problems _ Cyprus, India and Pakistan,
Western Sahara _ are hardy perennials, resisting change.
</P>
<P>
   But more recent crises demonstrate how ready recalcitrant
governments are to defy the U.N., and how halfheartedly a sloppily
supported U.N. sets about its work.
</P>
<P>

by Congo's government that they would not be allowed to unearth the
truth about Rwandan refugees massacred during Laurent Kabila's

   The U.N. has watched, seemingly paralyzed, as Angola slides back
to its awful war: the U.N.'s representative in Angola, who was
killed six weeks ago, has not yet been replaced and the U.N.'s
unarmed monitors have been withdrawn from the murderous Angolan
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And now Iraq, where earlier this year U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan used his personal prestige to avert a military strike by
America and Britain, seems prepared, once again, to challenge the
authority of the U.N. Security Council and its weapons inspectors.

   WASHINGTON _ Legend has it that Cornelius Vanderbilt began
building his fortune at the age of 16 with a $100 loan from his
mother. Starting up a shipping company, and putting the profits
into the New York Central Railroad, he turned $100 into $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The tycoon must revolve in his grave every year when the
president of Amtrak, America's ailing government-owned railway
company, goes hat in hand to Capitol Hill for money to prop up a
network many think should go the way of the stagecoach.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Vanderbilt's venture, Amtrak has been awash in red ink
since its creation in 1970. Its days may now be numbered. This
time, mother probably can't help.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about the future of Amtrak, like the suffocating
humidity, are summertime constants in Washington. Begun as a means
of promoting private rail travel, Amtrak was granted monopoly
status and annual infusions of money by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In its 28-year history, it has received more than $20 billion
from the government to continue a service that runs through 45
states.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has never been profitable, many commuters rely on
it, particularly in the Northeast and in the Los Angeles-San Diego
corridor. This fact, combined with a virulent strain of romanticism
among Americans who enjoy train travel, has so far enabled Amtrak
to escape the congressional axe.
</P>
<P>
   If a group of Republicans in Congress get their way, however,
Amtrak may not be far from the block. Senator John McCain, chairman
of the committee overseeing Amtrak, wants it killed off.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Amtrak's finances, it is not difficult to see why.
According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO), it
spends on average almost $2 for every dollar of revenue it earns,
and on some routes the ratio is as high as three to one.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, it has lost more than $3.1 billion _ $47 per
passenger last year. Although it claims that it can wean itself off
operating subsidies by 2002, the GAO finds this hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   In a rescue attempt, Congress last year approved a $2.3 billion
tax refund for Amtrak (despite the fact that it has never paid
taxes) to help improvements such as a high-speed route between
Boston and Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning was that, if Amtrak could update its aging fleet
and track, it could move into the black in a few years' time.
Unfortunately, it now says it will be using a large part of the
$2.3 billion just to cover operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amtrak's advocates on Capitol Hill seem shaken. Although
its foes there will probably keep the company alive until 2002,
their wrath may explode if Amtrak's pledge of self-sufficiency by
that year proves hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Given this bleak picture, should the government give up its
charade and admit that rail travel in the United States is a
vacationer's luxury that ought not to get federal dollars?
</P>
<P>
   McCain may think so, but he is from Arizona, where a passenger
train is as rare as a blue-spotted lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from train-loving states _ such as Frank Lautenberg, a
Democrat from New Jersey, and William Roth, a Republican from
Delaware _ understand that subsidizing Amtrak is hard to justify
economically but makes eminent political sense, because it has
their constituents' support.
</P>
<P>
   They add piously that it reduces highway congestion and air
pollution, and helps poor riders who cannot afford air travel.
</P>
<P>
   This last argument is spurious, since the vast majority of
Amtrak's riders are not poor people; these prefer the cheaper
(privately owned) national bus service.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, only about
20 percent of America's rail passengers have a household income
below $25,000, but over 50 percent of bus passengers do.
</P>
<P>
   As for the congestion and pollution arguments, a study released
by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, reports that,
though Amtrak does cut highway congestion in the Northeast and the
California corridor, its impact elsewhere is negligible because so
few people use it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only way to save American train travel is by
dismantling the Amtrak leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The first step would be to separate the valuable short-distance
routes in the densely populated corridors from the long-haul
services like those between Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter routes could either be financed by the interested
states (which have already shown a willingness to pay their own
way) or, preferably, auctioned off to private bidders who recognize
their potential profitability.
</P>
<P>
   If the government completes proposed improvements such as the
Boston-Washington line, these routes would become more attractive
to prospective suitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the longer routes, though there is little justification
for these ``land cruises'' getting taxpayers' dollars, the demand
for train travel through breathtaking scenery will always exist.
</P>
<P>
   The government could privatize these routes, creating a market
for rail travel similar to the ocean-cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling the plug on years of state life-support will not be
easy, given the clout of Amtrak's defenders and the unpopularity of
cutting the number of American cities served by trains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unsavory alternative _ continuing to prop up a system
that provides little social benefit and leaks money faster than it
can be poured in _ makes the fight worthwhile. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Legend has it that Cornelius Vanderbilt began
building his fortune at the age of 16 with a $100 loan from his
mother. Starting up a shipping company, and putting the profits
into the New York Central Railroad, he turned $100 into $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The tycoon must revolve in his grave every year when the
president of Amtrak, America's ailing government-owned railway
company, goes hat in hand to Capitol Hill for money to prop up a
network many think should go the way of the stagecoach.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Vanderbilt's venture, Amtrak has been awash in red ink
since its creation in 1970. Its days may now be numbered. This
time, mother probably can't help.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about the future of Amtrak, like the suffocating
humidity, are summertime constants in Washington. Begun as a means
of promoting private rail travel, Amtrak was granted monopoly
status and annual infusions of money by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In its 28-year history, it has received more than $20 billion
from the government to continue a service that runs through 45
states.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has never been profitable, many commuters rely on
it, particularly in the Northeast and in the Los Angeles-San Diego
corridor. This fact, combined with a virulent strain of romanticism
among Americans who enjoy train travel, has so far enabled Amtrak
to escape the congressional axe.
</P>
<P>
   If a group of Republicans in Congress get their way, however,
Amtrak may not be far from the block. Senator John McCain, chairman
of the committee overseeing Amtrak, wants it killed off.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Amtrak's finances, it is not difficult to see why.
According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO), it
spends on average almost $2 for every dollar of revenue it earns,
and on some routes the ratio is as high as three to one.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, it has lost more than $3.1 billion _ $47 per
passenger last year. Although it claims that it can wean itself off
operating subsidies by 2002, the GAO finds this hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   In a rescue attempt, Congress last year approved a $2.3 billion
tax refund for Amtrak (despite the fact that it has never paid
taxes) to help improvements such as a high-speed route between
Boston and Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning was that, if Amtrak could update its aging fleet
and track, it could move into the black in a few years' time.
Unfortunately, it now says it will be using a large part of the
$2.3 billion just to cover operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amtrak's advocates on Capitol Hill seem shaken. Although
its foes there will probably keep the company alive until 2002,
their wrath may explode if Amtrak's pledge of self-sufficiency by
that year proves hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Given this bleak picture, should the government give up its
charade and admit that rail travel in the United States is a
vacationer's luxury that ought not to get federal dollars?
</P>
<P>
   McCain may think so, but he is from Arizona, where a passenger
train is as rare as a blue-spotted lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from train-loving states _ such as Frank Lautenberg, a
Democrat from New Jersey, and William Roth, a Republican from
Delaware _ understand that subsidizing Amtrak is hard to justify
economically but makes eminent political sense, because it has
their constituents' support.
</P>
<P>
   They add piously that it reduces highway congestion and air
pollution, and helps poor riders who cannot afford air travel.
</P>
<P>
   This last argument is spurious, since the vast majority of
Amtrak's riders are not poor people; these prefer the cheaper
(privately owned) national bus service.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, only about
20 percent of America's rail passengers have a household income
below $25,000, but over 50 percent of bus passengers do.
</P>
<P>
   As for the congestion and pollution arguments, a study released
by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, reports that,
though Amtrak does cut highway congestion in the Northeast and the
California corridor, its impact elsewhere is negligible because so
few people use it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only way to save American train travel is by
dismantling the Amtrak leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The first step would be to separate the valuable short-distance
routes in the densely populated corridors from the long-haul
services like those between Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter routes could either be financed by the interested
states (which have already shown a willingness to pay their own
way) or, preferably, auctioned off to private bidders who recognize
their potential profitability.
</P>
<P>
   If the government completes proposed improvements such as the
Boston-Washington line, these routes would become more attractive
to prospective suitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the longer routes, though there is little justification
for these ``land cruises'' getting taxpayers' dollars, the demand
for train travel through breathtaking scenery will always exist.
</P>
<P>
   The government could privatize these routes, creating a market

</P>

easy, given the clout of Amtrak's defenders and the unpopularity of

   SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS _ The border between the United States and
Mexico is booming. The number of people living along its 2,100
miles has risen from 3.5 million in 1980 to well over 12 million
now.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican towns like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez have become
industrial hubs of continental consequence.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a predictable bleak side to it all. More than
a third of Mexican households in border towns lack access to
sewerage systems, and those that do exist often send the muck
untreated into the nearest river.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the frontier nearly 500,000 people still
live in colonias, unincorporated slums, many of which lack running
water and sewerage.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done _ not just for the people, but to
conserve what little water the region possesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the two governments decided to create a bank for
underwriting public-infrastructure projects along the border. The
grandly named North American Development Bank (NADB) opened for
business in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Its task was to identify, and provide money for, workable
projects that would improve the water supply, and the handling of
solid and liquid waste, in communities within about 60 miles of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, along with its sister organization, the Border
Environment Cooperation Commission, was greeted as a savior. Rumors
spread that it was sitting on $8 billion; mayors on both sides of
the border proclaimed that great improvements were on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the anticlimax. Once it became clear that the bank was
not going to open its purse strings as soon as you smiled at it,
the complaints began.
</P>
<P>
   Some claim it is little more than a dump for ``effete World Bank
types'' who shuffle paper and fatten themselves on platinum expense
accounts. ``They've done nothing in three years,'' says one furious
politician. ``They're supposed to lend. I'd like to ask what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is that the bank has a miserable job. Dealing
with sewage and water is, after all, neither a lucrative nor an
inspiring business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board, led by American and Mexican treasury
officials, has complicated things by giving it apparently
contradictory orders: it must lend quickly, but preserve the value
of its capital.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the bank can either rush to meet its applicants'
needs, or take a more measured and therefore frustrating approach.
Either way, the politicians' knives will be out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Rodriguez, its chief manager, is clear which course he
prefers: ``I think that in the long run everyone would prefer these
projects to be sensibly financed and professionally managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, an affable, Harvard-educated Mexican, argues that the
NADB is less a bank than an instrument for getting unwieldy
projects off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The border towns, he explains, are littered with elefantes
blancos, badly thought out bits of central planning that now lie
abandoned or underused. To avoid white elephants of its own, the
bank has to get down to the nuts and bolts of utility management.
</P>
<P>
   And that $8 billion the politicians carelessly said it had to
spend? A fiction. When the NADB was created, border towns were
asked what projects they needed money for. The resulting wish-list
added up to about $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bank's current capital is $450 million, with
another $2.55 billion in callable funds. It is dished out
sparingly. This year's operating budget is a modest $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small portion of any project is financed directly by the
NADB. The rest comes in the form of commercial bank loans, bond
issues, grants from the Border Environment Infrastructure Fund, and
equity the bank bullies out of the companies that build the
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's people do not live flashily. It has a staff of 32,
housed in unpretentious offices provided rent-free by the city of
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   And it does make a difference. Ciudad Juarez, a city of 2
million people, has no waste-water treatment plant; it pumps the
sewage straight into the Rio Grande. Now the NADB has put together
a $31 million package for two such plants, and work is due to start
next month.
</P>
<P>
   It took the bank three years to put the deal together; but, as
Rodriguez says, the point is that nobody had managed it before.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in Ciudad Juarez, and have a sensitive nose, the
bank is doing a sterling job. The question is whether, given the
rate of growth along the border and the pressure on its fragile
desert ecosystem, it can do enough sterling jobs quickly enough. &QL;

<P>
   In the previous aviation slump, caused by the Gulf war and
economic recession in 1990, unwanted aircraft were parked in the
dry, corrosion-free Mojave Desert. When business picked up most of
them were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now another fleet is landing in the desert, led by new and used
wide-body freighters. The tarmac in Seattle and Toulouse has also
been filling with big, wide-bodied jets straight from the Boeing
and Airbus production lines.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June Boeing had 19 aircraft stuck on the ground
because Asian airlines such as Asiana and Garuda could not pay for
them. Airbus had seven jets grounded for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the paradox. Aircraft sales are still rising
slightly, with firm new orders for 638 aircraft in the first six
months of this year. That is more than half the total sales of
1997, itself a record year.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation of the paradox is that the jet-aircraft market
has broken in two: dismal Asia and buoyant America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because Asia was responsible for much of the growth in the
market for big jumbos and wide-bodied Airbuses, there threatens to
be a glut of nearly new wide-body jets. Asian airlines are both
deferring delivery of new aircraft and putting some of their
existing fleet on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines, for instance, is scaling back its fleet
from 54 aircraft to 14, amid fears that it may go out of business
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia Airlines is postponing delivery of nine big Boeings,
and Thai Airways has trouble financing orders for wide-bodies from
both makers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile smaller, narrow-body jets are selling well, as
American and European carriers upgrade their short-haul fleets on
the back of improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   The top seven American carriers enjoyed a net income of $3.6
billion in the second quarter, up 13.3 percent on a year earlier.
All reported rising load factors. American Airlines had its ``best
quarter ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, even some of the old basket cases such as Alitalia
and Iberia have turned themselves into proper airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the most successful European airline, British Airways, is
reining back its planned increase in capacity because it sees
difficult times ahead. Although it is still about to order 20 or so
narrow-bodies from Boeing or Airbus, it is shaving growth in
capacity from about 9 percent to under 3 percent over the next few
years, partly by switching orders for 747s to smaller 777s.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief executive, Bob Ayling, foresees a bloodbath across the
Atlantic as liberalized markets attract new entrants and as
international carriers switch empty airplanes from the Pacific to
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Older industry observers remember that BA was first to see the
last slump coming and take evasive action. As a result, it emerged
in better shape than any other airline.
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, would want to be in the very large shoes of Ron
Woodard, the man who runs Boeing's Commercial Airplane Group? Right
now, his business troubles seem never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needs a success later this month when BA, a huge Boeing
customer and the only big European airline never to have bought an
Airbus, is due to decide whether to buy his short-haul 737s or
Airbus's A320s.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts such as Chris Partridge of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an
investment bank, think that Airbus is likely to win this one.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Boeing wins an order from BA, it will not begin to make
up for a miserable 12 months. First, its efforts to double output
to cope with booming demand ended in chaos, and it had to shut down
production for a month to catch up with unfinished work. This
resulted in delays and expensive overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then it had to rebuild about 50 of the new version of its 737 in
order to satisfy safety rules that it had failed to foresee.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, it turns out that the first 400 of these airplanes
are being sold at a loss, because the company's four-year program
to cut costs by 25 percent has stalled. Add the costs of the merger
with McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing has had to make provisions
approaching $4 billion since last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it made its first loss in 50 years, and in the first
half of this year it has fared little better, with its net profits
down by about two-thirds to $308 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing blames low margins, despite the boom in sales of
commercial jets. Its shares fell 14 percent on the news, compounded
by gloomy forecasts about a slow recovery in margins and profits
this year and next. The worry is that, by the time Boeing has
sorted itself out, orders will be falling fast.
</P>
<P>
   The market is already sending some gloomy signals to Boeing.
Two-thirds of the jets in the sky are made by Boeing, and that has
usually been its share of new orders. But for the first half of
this year its main competitor, the European Airbus Industrie
consortium, has won 52 percent of orders.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing still enjoys its monopoly at the 400-seat jumbo
end of the business, Airbus's A320s have caught up with Boeing's
revamped 737s in the narrow-body class of aircraft which accounts
for about three-quarters of all sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boeing's pride and joy _ its wide-bodied 777 (which
is slightly smaller than a jumbo) _ has run into some difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus claims to have sold 468 of its big A330s and A340s,
compared with only 392 Boeing 777s. Yet the Boeing aircraft,
launched three years ago, should have quickly outpaced the older
Airbus machines.
</P>
<P>
   It has been held back partly by the fact that the very
long-range version has yet to be launched, because the three
largest aero-engine makers have been reluctant to produce engines
big enough to get it off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   So Boeing is considering various compromises, such as a small
extra engine in the tail, to give the aircraft more thrust.
Meanwhile Airbus is triumphing: it is winning enough customers in
advance to justify the launch of its own very long-range version of
the A340.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's genius has always been to design products that evolve
into a family of aircraft, which then develop to meet changes in
the market; often, it is later derivatives that earn the most
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has always believed that the market (especially in Asia)
will want big long-range aircraft to fly point-to-point rather than
super-jumbos using hub airports. So the development problems of the
777, which is designed to meet market demand of this sort, could
ultimately prove the most serious of its recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   If only the project were far enough ahead to have a few models
of the very long-range version parked _ ordered-but-not-paid-for _
in the Mojave Desert, Woodard might be happier. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the previous aviation slump, caused by the Gulf war and
economic recession in 1990, unwanted aircraft were parked in the
dry, corrosion-free Mojave Desert. When business picked up most of
them were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now another fleet is landing in the desert, led by new and used
wide-body freighters. The tarmac in Seattle and Toulouse has also
been filling with big, wide-bodied jets straight from the Boeing
and Airbus production lines.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June Boeing had 19 aircraft stuck on the ground
because Asian airlines such as Asiana and Garuda could not pay for
them. Airbus had seven jets grounded for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the paradox. Aircraft sales are still rising
slightly, with firm new orders for 638 aircraft in the first six
months of this year. That is more than half the total sales of
1997, itself a record year.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation of the paradox is that the jet-aircraft market
has broken in two: dismal Asia and buoyant America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because Asia was responsible for much of the growth in the
market for big jumbos and wide-bodied Airbuses, there threatens to
be a glut of nearly new wide-body jets. Asian airlines are both
deferring delivery of new aircraft and putting some of their
existing fleet on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines, for instance, is scaling back its fleet
from 54 aircraft to 14, amid fears that it may go out of business
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia Airlines is postponing delivery of nine big Boeings,
and Thai Airways has trouble financing orders for wide-bodies from
both makers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile smaller, narrow-body jets are selling well, as
American and European carriers upgrade their short-haul fleets on
the back of improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   The top seven American carriers enjoyed a net income of $3.6
billion in the second quarter, up 13.3 percent on a year earlier.
All reported rising load factors. American Airlines had its ``best
quarter ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, even some of the old basket cases such as Alitalia
and Iberia have turned themselves into proper airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the most successful European airline, British Airways, is
reining back its planned increase in capacity because it sees
difficult times ahead. Although it is still about to order 20 or so
narrow-bodies from Boeing or Airbus, it is shaving growth in
capacity from about 9 percent to under 3 percent over the next few
years, partly by switching orders for 747s to smaller 777s.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief executive, Bob Ayling, foresees a bloodbath across the
Atlantic as liberalized markets attract new entrants and as
international carriers switch empty airplanes from the Pacific to
the Atlantic.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commentary on Fox Sports Net has a distinctive tone,
dominated by images of war; it irritates some viewers, but reflects
the spirit of the company. Fox Sports Net is the latest weapon in
the battle of the American media titans.
</P>
<P>
   This two-year-old joint venture between Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. and John Malone's Liberty Media is beginning to inflict some
nasty wounds on Disney's ESPN, which has dominated American sports
programming for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, ESPN announced that it was abandoning a long-planned
counterattack, and now seems to have no clear idea of how to resist
Fox Sports Net's advance.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN invented sports television in America. Before it was
founded in 1979 by an unemployed former public-relations officer
from the Hartford Whalers hockey team, the most the sports junkie
could watch each day on all the broadcast networks combined was
around 18 hours of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN now has four 24-hour sports networks and reaches just about
all the 73 million cable homes in America.
</P>
<P>
   It is also highly profitable. Paul Kagan Associates, a media
consultancy, estimates that ESPN's cash flow this year will be $356
million on revenues of $1.16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the move, in 1996, by Murdoch and Malone to set up a
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had an additional interest in seeing competition to ESPN,
because ESPN's popularity gives it power over the cable systems
operators, and TCI, Liberty's parent, is one of America's two
biggest cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Sport has been Murdoch's weapon of choice in television. In
Britain, his BSkyB satellite-television company dominates the
pay-television business because he cornered the football rights
before other broadcasters saw their value.
</P>
<P>
   In America, he established his Fox broadcast network as a power
in the land by outbidding the rest for the National Football League
rights; and then he moved on to cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sports Net approach is clever. Rather than attack ESPN's
national network head on, Murdoch and Malone have put together a
lot of little regional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea was that people want to watch their local team more
than they want to watch one of the big national games, but that you
need a national brand to sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, whereas ESPN offers national programming with national

<P>
   The commentary on Fox Sports Net has a distinctive tone,
dominated by images of war; it irritates some viewers, but reflects
the spirit of the company. Fox Sports Net is the latest weapon in
the battle of the American media titans.
</P>
<P>
   This two-year-old joint venture between Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. and John Malone's Liberty Media is beginning to inflict some
nasty wounds on Disney's ESPN, which has dominated American sports
programming for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, ESPN announced that it was abandoning a long-planned
counterattack, and now seems to have no clear idea of how to resist
Fox Sports Net's advance.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN invented sports television in America. Before it was
founded in 1979 by an unemployed former public-relations officer
from the Hartford Whalers hockey team, the most the sports junkie
could watch each day on all the broadcast networks combined was
around 18 hours of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN now has four 24-hour sports networks and reaches just about
all the 73 million cable homes in America.
</P>
<P>
   It is also highly profitable. Paul Kagan Associates, a media
consultancy, estimates that ESPN's cash flow this year will be $356
million on revenues of $1.16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the move, in 1996, by Murdoch and Malone to set up a
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had an additional interest in seeing competition to ESPN,
because ESPN's popularity gives it power over the cable systems
operators, and TCI, Liberty's parent, is one of America's two
biggest cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Sport has been Murdoch's weapon of choice in television. In
Britain, his BSkyB satellite-television company dominates the
pay-television business because he cornered the football rights
before other broadcasters saw their value.
</P>
<P>
   In America, he established his Fox broadcast network as a power
in the land by outbidding the rest for the National Football League
rights; and then he moved on to cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sports Net approach is clever. Rather than attack ESPN's
national network head on, Murdoch and Malone have put together a
lot of little regional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea was that people want to watch their local team more
than they want to watch one of the big national games, but that you
need a national brand to sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, whereas ESPN offers national programming with national
advertising, Fox Sports Net offers local programming with national
advertising. As a result, although Fox Sports Net's reach, at 65
million households, is still smaller than ESPN's, its ratings are
often double.
</P>
<P>
   And ESPN had a shock when the first-quarter ratings for
SportsCenter, its nightly news program, came out in June: they

Fox Sports Net.

ROMANCE ENDS AS MARINER FANS WAKE TO REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since September 1995, the Mariner fan base has been an
almost complete contradiction to the rest of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else, many fans, vibrating with contempt for owners
and players who ushered in the 1994 strike that cost the World
Series and bled into 1995, abandoned the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. After the Mariners pulled off a preposterous
regular-season comeback loaded with late-inning dramatics to make
their first postseason, they played what was arguably the most
electric series ever. The engaging players and their
success-starved fans fell into an affectionate clinch rare in pro
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fans didn't have to be told to love these guys. They beat the
marketers to the slogan.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. The point now, driven home in the week since the
trade of Randy Johnson: The affair is over.
</P>
<P>
   The rage provoked by the deal has gone beyond any event in
Mariner history, and rivals the Sonics' 1972 trade of Lenny Wilkens
for the capacity to sour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there was no virtue to the trade; the early
reports from Tacoma on the youngsters acquired have been promising.
Nor is it likely that many fans here are going to quit cold turkey
on the Mariners. Ken Griffey Jr. still has 21 homers to hit.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed is the feeling. The way Johnson's Seattle career
devolved and collapsed made liars, fools and hypocrites of almost
everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need Dear Abby to deduce that such results are deadly
for romance.
</P>
<P>
   The shy tycoons who own the club _ call them the ShyTys _ looked
bad for bailing on Johnson in November, then bailing on his trade
to the Dodgers in May, then lying about the fact he would be in
Seattle for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball boss Woody Woodward looked foolish, for the second
trading deadline in a row, for appearing fleeced, especially after
it became clear the Yankees had strung him along to keep Johnson
from going to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella, unable to effect change in a highly
underachieving team, looked foolish for toeing the party line when
he knows well the deal all but abandons the chance for a run in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looked bad because his selfish behavior contradicted his
words enough times that he lost clubhouse and management support
and inevitably diminished his market value.
</P>
<P>
   The players looked like hypocrites for criticizing a deal that
probably wouldn't have happened if they had done their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The media looked bad because none of the spray of rumors _ not
only this time around, but in May when the Dodgers' attempt to
acquire Johnson came to naught _ ended up forecasting what
happened, and added to the heightened expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a number of GMs are looking foolish, because they have to
explain to their bosses and fans why they couldn't have topped the
deal by Houston that tonight, for Johnson's home debut, is giving
the Astros their first sellout in history.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that shocked all of baseball savaged the Mariners
because its appearance is a blatant step backward in the middle of
a season. It shoots to hell the credibility that was built in the
1995 run and led to the creation of a $500 million stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable, there is little reason for the average fan
to believe the ShyTys, Woodward or Piniella, which would seem to be
a dangerous development considering the club is desperate to sell
out all of its expensive perches in the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But the park masterminds are convinced that green grass and blue
sky will overcome any damage. Knowing the naive forgiveness of most
fans, they are probably right, which makes the seasonal write-off
easier to rationalize for them.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to rationalize for the newer, more casual fans to
baseball is the loss of a figure who literally and figuratively
towered over the local sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His negatives, more apparent to bosses and teammates, were not
meaningful to the average fan, who paid to see an event every time
Johnson pitched. Until this season, he delivered nearly all the
time. While no one expected Johnson to last forever, there was no
evidence to suggest he was beyond his prime except for his
regrettable season-long pout over money.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, along with Griffey, Edgar Martinez and Jay Buhner, have
been here nearly a decade together through bad times and good,
making a rare bond with the community. Joey Cora, though with fewer
seasons, struck a similar chord. It's hardly coincidence that Cora
and Martinez _ who, like Griffey and Johnson, married Seattle-area
women _ have said they would rather retire than move to another
team.
</P>
<P>
   That may be an emotional reaction to an impending dislocation,
which can change when they realize in the offseason they may be
walking away from millions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they and their families never will be more
graciously received anywhere than the place where they made sports
magic.
</P>
<P>
   As the fans were bid to do, and did like nowhere else in
baseball, they hadda love these guys. So when these guys are ripped
away under dubious circumstances, the ShyTys, Woodward and Piniella
become the callous adulterers ending the romance.
</P>
<P>
   Stay low, gentlemen. Stay low.
</P>

   Things move more easily through cyberspace. Information on
prescription drugs is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising and selling of such medicines occurs more freely
over the Internet than in the real world, where patients have to
trudge to the doctor if they want a prescription and, in many
countries, advertising drugs directly to consumers is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, access to more drug information and the
convenience of ordering a wide range of prescription products
online is welcome. For national drug regulators, however, it is a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998 the World Health Organization passed a resolution
calling on governments to tighten controls on the quality of
information provided about drugs on the Internet and to clamp down
on cross-border trading of drugs through the Net where such trade
is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But how? Policing the Internet is notoriously difficult. There
are quite a few dishonest dealers on the Web, whose goods are
unapproved, ineffective or downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, disappointed that their online order of shark-fin
cartilage failed to cure their cancer, can report the offending
site to a regulatory agency such as America's Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA can try and track down the hucksters, issuing them with
warnings or in extreme cases, confiscating their goods.
</P>
<P>
   But pinning a website to a point in the real world is difficult,
and drug regulators find it hard to discipline offshore operators.
</P>
<P>
   More practical, perhaps, is the online punishment meted out by
Health on the Net (HON) Foundation, a consortium of 25,000 web
pages whose authors are bound by a good-practice code.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Selby, HON's director, members who are
electronically linked to disreputable sites cut their ties. Without
these ways to feed in customers, some sites wither on the Web. But
many others still thrive undetected.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, though, are the issues raised by different
national rules on advertising and selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational drug companies spend increasing sums promoting
themselves and their products on the Internet. This is permitted in
America, but banned in many other countries. Yet governments cannot
easily prevent their citizens from having free access to such
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A few legitimate Internet pharmacies, such as the Pill Box in
Texas or the Procare Clinic, sell prescription drugs such as the
anti-impotence medicine Viagra over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some even go through the formality of an online prescription.
Just a few easy questions to answer on the electronic form (Do you
take nitrates? Do you suffer sexual dysfunction?), a credit card
number and Viagra or some similar potion is yours.
</P>
<P>
   That you may live, as this correspondent does, in a country
where Viagra has yet to be approved by the regulatory authorities,
and where even its direct promotion to patients is banned, is no
impediment _ though courier companies are increasingly nervous
about their role in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   As Selby observes, these country-to-country differences in what
can be sold and what can be advertised make little sense in the age
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can create confusion, the Internet may actually
bring about greater harmonization of international drug standards. &QL;

<P>
   Things move more easily through cyberspace. Information on
prescription drugs is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising and selling of such medicines occurs more freely
over the Internet than in the real world, where patients have to
trudge to the doctor if they want a prescription and, in many
countries, advertising drugs directly to consumers is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, access to more drug information and the
convenience of ordering a wide range of prescription products
online is welcome. For national drug regulators, however, it is a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998 the World Health Organization passed a resolution
calling on governments to tighten controls on the quality of
information provided about drugs on the Internet and to clamp down
on cross-border trading of drugs through the Net where such trade
is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But how? Policing the Internet is notoriously difficult. There
are quite a few dishonest dealers on the Web, whose goods are
unapproved, ineffective or downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, disappointed that their online order of shark-fin
cartilage failed to cure their cancer, can report the offending
site to a regulatory agency such as America's Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA can try and track down the hucksters, issuing them with
warnings or in extreme cases, confiscating their goods.
</P>
<P>
   But pinning a website to a point in the real world is difficult,
and drug regulators find it hard to discipline offshore operators.
</P>
<P>
   More practical, perhaps, is the online punishment meted out by
Health on the Net (HON) Foundation, a consortium of 25,000 web
pages whose authors are bound by a good-practice code.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Selby, HON's director, members who are
electronically linked to disreputable sites cut their ties. Without
these ways to feed in customers, some sites wither on the Web. But
many others still thrive undetected.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, though, are the issues raised by different
national rules on advertising and selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational drug companies spend increasing sums promoting
themselves and their products on the Internet. This is permitted in
America, but banned in many other countries. Yet governments cannot
easily prevent their citizens from having free access to such
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A few legitimate Internet pharmacies, such as the Pill Box in
Texas or the Procare Clinic, sell prescription drugs such as the
anti-impotence medicine Viagra over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some even go through the formality of an online prescription.
Just a few easy questions to answer on the electronic form (Do you
take nitrates? Do you suffer sexual dysfunction?), a credit card
number and Viagra or some similar potion is yours.
</P>
<P>
   That you may live, as this correspondent does, in a country
where Viagra has yet to be approved by the regulatory authorities,
and where even its direct promotion to patients is banned, is no
impediment _ though courier companies are increasingly nervous
about their role in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   As Selby observes, these country-to-country differences in what
can be sold and what can be advertised make little sense in the age
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can create confusion, the Internet may actually
bring about greater harmonization of international drug standards. &QL;

M'S SUFFER A LOSS IN MIDST OF RAINOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Mariner first baseman David Segui, having the best
season of his career, suffered a bizarre knee injury Thursday night
about 15 minutes before the series opener against the Detroit
Tigers was supposed to start.
</P>
<P>
   The game eventually was rained out and rescheduled for 4 p.m.
EDT Friday as part of a doubleheader. Segui probably won't play
either game and could be sidelined for many more.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said Segui's right knee locked as he rose
from a chair in the visiting clubhouse at Tiger Stadium. Segui was
taken to a local hospital for a magnetic resonance imaging test to
determine the damage and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Results are expected Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just stood up and the knee locked,'' trainer Rick Griffin
said. ``Usually when that happens, you suspect torn cartilage. But
we won't know until we get the MRI results.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin wouldn't project how much time Segui could miss if the
cartilage is damaged. Segui missed 16 games after cartilage surgery
on his left knee last season while playing for Montreal. The
Mariners will promote a player, possibly first baseman/designated
hitter Dan Rohrmeier, from the Class AAA Tacoma Rainiers. The
player is expected to be in uniform for Friday's twinbill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Griffin said of Segui's injury. ``I can't think
of a weirder one this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui, signed as a free agent during the offseason, has been one
of the most productive all-around players for the M's this season.
He is batting .333 with 16 homers and 71 RBIs and has been
especially hot since the All-Star break, batting .368.
</P>
<P>
   He also is having a Gold Glove-caliber season, leading all major
league first basemen with a .999 (one error in 897 total chances)
fielding percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible to lose him,'' third baseman Russ Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he juggled his lineup for Thursday night's game,
which was called after a 1{-hour rain delay. ``I put Edgar
(Martinez) at first, (Rob) Ducey in center and Junior (Ken Griffey
Jr.) at DH.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the same lineup in the first game Friday against
Tigers right-hander Seth Greisinger.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero, scheduled to start Thursday night, will pitch
Friday's opener with left-hander Jamie Moyer starting the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the inclement weather is supposed to stick around
at least through Friday night. A postponement Friday likely would
force doubleheaders Saturday and Sunday.

   CLINTON-LEWINSKY (Washington) _ The American public has not yet
heard the voice of the young woman whose appearance at a federal
courthouse Thursday morning drew a dozen satellite trucks and
scores of reporters who mostly wound up interviewing each other
about their brief glimpse of her. But Monica Lewinsky has plenty to
say, according to several people she has spent time with since the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, began investigating her
relationship with the president more than six months ago. By
Melinda Henneberger. (With photo.)

investigate and prosecute campaign finance abuses. By David E.
Rosenbaum. (With photo.)

   HISPANICS-CENSUS (Washington) _ The nation's burgeoning Hispanic

   VACCINE-TERROR (Undated) _ Last May, President Clinton unveiled
an ambitious plan to counter germ attacks by stockpiling vaccines
at strategic sites around the country so communities could fight
epidemics. While such major initiatives usually result from many
months and sometimes years of fierce debate, this one, federal and
private experts said in interviews, was developed in record time.
But today the multi-million-dollar plan is in jeopardy, the fragile
consensus having collapsed. By William J. Broad and Judith Miller.

   DETECTIVE-PROFILE (New York) _ There are a handful of private
detectives whom the city's top crime lawyers turn to in a
high-profile case. Les Levine _ who refuses to reveal his age (he
looks as if he's in his late 50s) or his fee ($150 or $175 an hour,

trail of evidence and the recollections of an eyewitness, the
dogged detectives on the case of the purloined Peter Pan Thursday
found the missing statue 50 feet below the surface of the East
River near Gracie Mansion. Investigators said the disappearance of
the beloved statue from Carl Schurz Park appeared, appropriately

   PHILADELPHIA _ The New York Jets began the 30th anniversary of
their Super Bowl year Thursday night with the first string
dominating the Philadelphia Eagles. Then the backups got sloppy in
the second half as the Eagles made comeback noises.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Lucas, playing quarterback, led a 66-yard drive in the
second half that restored a double-digit lead for the Jets as they
went on to a 29-15 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For Jets watchers, the attention was on quarterback Glenn Foley
and his role as starter. It began badly but picked up dramatically.
He was a mere 1-7 in his first eight attempts. He overthrew Kyle
Brady, he underthrew Dedric Ward and he was wide on a pass to Wayne
Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   But he warmed up in the second quarter to lead the Jets on an
81-yard drive that ended with a Richie Anderson 1-yard run and a
10-3 lead. Foley then rested with a little more than six minutes
remaining until the half.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde replaced him and drilled a 39-yard completion
to Alex Van Dyke in his first pass as a Jet. It helped produce John
Hall's second field goal of the game as the Jets took a 13-3
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Testaverde's night was over, he had smartly
completed 7-of-11 passes for 94 yards, including a touchdown to the
rookie tight end Blake Spence.
</P>
<P>
   For Foley's one and a half periods of play, he had helped the
Jets produce a field goal and a touchdown, and had connected on
6-of-13 passes for 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   They were a key factor as Coach Bill Parcells increased his
record in preseason play to 40-14, amassed with the Jets, New York
Giants and New England Patriots. Last year the Jets were 4-0 in the
summer games, when Foley came off the bench twice in relief of Neil
O'Donnell to lead the Jets to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Donnell is a Cincinnati Bengal and a visitor to New York,
facing the Giants on Saturday night. Foley? He talks and acts like
the Jets' new leader.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Foley's protection was fairly stable throughout his time on the
field, although he was sacked once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be patient,'' Foley said of his slow start. ``And
when you run like we did, it makes it easier. I thought we did
pretty well. We didn't turn the ball over. I had time. I was just
sitting back there all alone.''
</P>
<P>
   His touchdown drive saw him hit four of five passes, including a
clutch 15-yarder to Ward on third-and-14. Finally, Anderson, who
was starting for Curtis Martin and was battling Robert Farmer for a
tailback spot, went over. Martin was kept out with a hamstring
injury, although he did dress.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Jets' most noted offensive weapon was
absent, the Jets' first team still had command of the Eagles. The
surge by blocking up the middle, led by their new center Kevin
Mawae, was significant in giving Anderson 66 yards in 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' early lead was preserved at the halftime whistle when
Ray Mickens blocked Chris Boniol's field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ward continued his fine summer as he duels with Van
Dyke to become the club's No. 3 receiver behind Keyshawn Johnson
and Chrebet. In last year's exhibition opener against the Eagles,
Ward, a rookie, produced 79 yards on three kickoff returns, 22 more
on a punt return, and scored the crushing touchdown on a 33-yard
pass from Foley.
</P>
<P>
   But he had rookie problems, such as not knowing which lanes to
run in, and he was used sparingly during the season. Thursday
night, though, his 37-yard kickoff return to start the second half
positioned a touchdown drive that culminated with Testaverde's
12-yard pass to Spence.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two drives leading the Jets, Testaverde helped
produce 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   On his touchdown drive, Fred Baxter was leveled by a
helmet-to-helmet hit by Matt Stevens near the goal line. Baxter
held on to the ball, and Stevens was handed an unnecessary
roughness penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles cut the Jets' lead to 20-9 in the third quarter with
a solid drive as Koy Detmer hit Kaseem Sinceno for a 19-yard score.
But Boniol's extra-point attempt was no good. Then Stevens picked
up a Farmer fumble and returned it for a touchdown, and the Jets'
lead dwindled to 20-15.
</P>
<P>
   As for Parcells, his reaction was mixed. ``It was a typical
first game,'' he said, feigning unhappiness. ``Some rookies were
looking around as if they belonged, but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells did, however, single out the special teams for several
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   The Jets often showed a 3-4 defense and also blitzed off a 4-3,
confusing the Eagles and forcing quarterback Bobby Hoying into
repeated uncomfortable situations. The Jets' middle linebacker
Dwayne Gordon was active in the role he inherited from the injured
Marvin Jones. He led all tacklers in the half with a total of six
tackles, including five unassisted. ... Nick Gallery, competing
with Brian Hansen, handled all the punts. Gallery's first went 49
yards and his second 55. ... Scott Frost, the quarterback for
Nebraska, last year's co-national champion, returned his first
kickoff in a game and gained 19 yards. ... There will be only an
afternoon practice on Saturday and Sunday at the Jets' training
camp in Hempstead, N.Y., starting at 2 p.m.

 &HT;    Bright teeth take bite out of film realism
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1944 in the acclaimed film Saving Private Ryan, and Tom
Hanks and his Army squad have risked their lives trudging across
Europe in search of one woebegone GI. When they meet Pvt. James
Ryan, he flashes such a gleaming, toothy grin that the audience
starts reaching for its sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the moment is about actor Matt Damon and his Hollywood
cosmetic dentist, not the story Steven Spielberg wants to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It happens time and again in the movies. Think of Anthony
Hopkins in The Mask of Zorro, released from a squalid prison after
two decades but sporting perfect white choppers. Think of Leonardo
DiCaprio, with anachronistically bleached teeth as the man behind
that Iron Mask. And didn't anyone in Les Miserables' revolutionary
France have miserable molars?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly when dentists go to the movies they notice these
things. West Palm Beach, Florida, cosmetic and general dentist
Vincent Dolce says World War II soldiers would never have sparkling
teeth, ``even though they're young. But obviously when you're on
the screen, they make them whiter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you can see when they're a little too phony,'' agrees Dr.
Peter Ciporkin of West Palm Beach, a member of the American Academy
of Cosmetic Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is a mistake, Ciporkin sees it as a plus for
dentists. ``It does make people much more aware. It's almost as if
the smile is a stage, where the lips are the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   It has only been about a decade since such blinding white teeth
have been readily available, notes Palm Beach Gardens dental
hygienist Beverly Meares, so those are probably cinema boo-boos
borne of actor vanity. There is actually a tooth color known in the
trade as Hollywood White, but Meares adds, ``We discourage that,
because we don't think it looks natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone in Los Angeles, Saving Private Ryan make-up
artist Lois Burwell, an Academy Award winner, was a little startled
by the subject, but she nevertheless defends Damon's dental look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he should be the archetypal home-spun boy,'' she
says. ``I think people would notice more if he didn't have bright
white teeth. And after all, he is the youngest brother, only 19, so
he could well have such good teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Diaz, who designed the make-up for The Mask of Zorro, says
that teeth color is just one consideration. ``It depends on what
kind of character it is. When we shot the prison scene, all the
slaves and all the prisoners we tried to put coloring on their
teeth to make them gray and yellow and brown.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about Hopkins' teeth? ``Oh, he had his own make-up
artist,'' answers Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there aren't ways to dull and discolor teeth for
dramatic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically drinking coffee and Coke will darken them,'' says
West Palm dentist Dolce. ``And there are stains you could put on if
you were doing a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could create a customized look over someone's natural
teeth,'' adds Ciporkin. ``They could have the simulation of
discoloration, broken down teeth, cavities, gum disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Meares has a less expensive suggestion. ``They could suck on a
tea bag,'' she says.

   FLAMURDER-TALE _ HOBE SOUND, Fla. _ Thirty years have now passed

was a suicide. Some still swear it was murder. (Houck, Palm Beach

</P>
<P>
   NET-COPS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The next arrest of a family violence
suspect may be just a mouse click away. The Austin, Texas, Police
Department is posting the names and descriptions of hundreds of
suspects charged with family violence on its Web page, hoping that
neighbors, friends or co-workers of victims of abuse may turn in a
suspect who has eluded the police. (Copelin, Austin

Denis Samson, 69, is getting a hip replacement. (Fuchs, Palm Beach

   KID-SLEEP _ Let's face it. Bedtime is relaxed during summer
vacation. Kids stay up late; kids sleep late. Parents of teen-agers
know this better than anyone. To avoid the knock-down, drag-out
fights, start today to get children back into a routine that will
head off the early morning struggles to get them out of bed and to
school on time. (Gandara, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ When it was first announced we would
be getting HOV lanes on the freeways in metro Atlanta, I was less

stress-reducing. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f. MOVED.

   TEST-DRIVE _ ATLANTA -- Less than 10 years after it was
introduced as a 1990 model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is
one of the vehicles reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors
carries out the talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are
four reasons it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best

unexceptionally.'' (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f.

   YES _ While Jon Anderson said he doesn't look for pop hits, Yes

   SWAMP-FIRES _ The wildfires that roared through Georgia's famed
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge a few weeks ago scorched 5,100
acres of swampland. What a shame, some people said. But fire is one
of Mother Nature's major tools for maintaining the health of many
ecosystems such as the Okefenokee, which needr an occasional burn.
``If fires burned every inch of the Okefenokee, it would be good
for it,'' says Ron Phernetton, a fire management officer there.

   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   VACATION-CHURCH _ While churches cut back services for summer,
combine Sunday School classes and take a break from mid-week
activities, at the resorts and lakes from the mountains to the
coast, people are finding ways to worship. An example: a boat
church with a pulpit on a pier so that people can come in their
boats. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FOXWORTHY-FAITH _ We all know comedian Jeff Foxworthy is funny
and a redneck. But now he wants people to also know he's a son of
the South coming back to his roots and a child of God coming back
to his faith. (Hannigan, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DCTALK _ Most music fans know DC Talk through their music. Their
last album, ``Jesus Freak,'' went platinum and netted the trio a
Grammy Award for best rock gospel album. Yet few people know about
the group's public campaign to promote racial unity. This
interracial trio created the ERACE (Eliminating Racism and Creating
Equality) Foundation last year to promote what they call ``living
integration.'' I talk to DC Talk member Toby McKeehan about their
campaign. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS: A host of folks helps man who needs
hip replacement
 &HT;    By Dale Fuchs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This story is rated G.
</P>
<P>
   It contains no violence or sex scandals or gut-wrenching
tragedy. It is just the tale of a good deed, one of many that
usually go unnoticed _ and certainly don't make headlines _ while
we go about our busy, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Samson, 69, is getting a hip replacement.
</P>
<P>
   This might not sound like a big deal, but to Samson, a man from
Haiti who has spent the past 35 years working odd jobs in the
Bahamas so he could send money home to his family, it is a small
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Samson is in pain. The bone in his left hip is covered with
cysts, and the joint isn't doing its job. He walks slowly, jerking
his left leg into step with his right. He is too poor to pay for
surgery, and he doesn't have insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Andrew Seltzer, one of many local doctors and surgeons
who routinely donate their services, is going to operate on his hip
for free. The hip replacement usually costs $3,500 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   With a word from Seltzer, Palms West Hospital in Loxahatchee is
also going to waive the $8,770 cost of his stay. And the families
Samson worked for in the Bahamas are taking up a collection to pay
for his prosthesis, which will cost another $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how did this Haitian man living on the island of Eleuthera
come to meet the American surgeon?
</P>
<P>
   Ask 85-year-old Jim Griffin of West Palm Beach. He's the one who
brought the two together; he's fond of doing good deeds of the
international variety.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Griffin embarked on a two-year letter-writing campaign
to help a former South Vietnamese army colonel emigrate to America.
The colonel had spent the previous 12 years as a political prisoner
in a hard-labor camp after the North Vietnamese took over his
country.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin sponsored the colonel's whole family and helped them
settle in Florida. He is, after all, a retired car salesman and
retired U.S. Army major: When it comes to helping a friend, he can
be very resourceful _ and he usually gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   One of Griffin's best friends was a British businessman named
George Elcock, who lived with his beautiful wife in a big,
five-bedroom house in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Elcock was a tall, elegant man. He always wore an ascot around
his neck, and he partied with the few socialites who lived on rural
Eleuthera until he died _ land rich but cash poor _ at the age of
94.
</P>
<P>
   He was a character. Legend has it that he once owned a castle
and lived next-door to the British queen. He pinched his pennies
but somehow lived ``royally,'' says Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   And he thought Denis Samson ``was God's gift to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Haitian man with the shy smile worked for Elcock
for 36 years. Samson had come to the Bahamas at age 33 to earn
enough money to feed his family _ a wife and four children _ when
the rope factory he worked for in Haiti closed.
</P>
<P>
   Find work he did. He was so handy, recalls Griffin, that the
landowners in the Bahamas were ``always fussing over him, trying to
get him to work for them.'' He could build things, tend the garden,
fix the plumbing and electricity _ always with a twinkling eye and
that modest smile.
</P>
<P>
   But Samson was most loyal to Elcock. He followed the British
businessman from Nassau to Eleuthera in '63. And three decades
later, when a car accident had crippled Samson, leaving him unfit
for vigorous manual labor, Elcock invited him to move in. Elcock's
wife had died, and the elderly man needed companionship and help
around the house. He was nearly 90 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Samson was grateful. In exchange for room and board, he did
chores, cooked and drove Elcock to the parties he loved so much. He
was also known for fixing a good, stiff gin and tonic, Elcock's
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, George Elcock died. He left his many
properties to his wife's nephews (the couple had no children) and
$2,000 to Samson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I miss him plenty,'' Samson says. ``He was very nice to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Elcock's death, the executor of his estate sent a
letter to Elcock's friends. ``At this point in time,'' the letter
read, ``Denis (Samson) is employed as a caretaker of George's
house. ... However, when the house is sold, it will be difficult to
find employment for him. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Please join me in making a donation to Denis as a memorial to
George. I am sure George would approve. Who knows _ we may get a
good start toward that operation!''
</P>
<P>
   So the old Eleuthera social circle sent some food and money to
Denis Samson. A friend with a plane even flew him to Nassau to see
a doctor. But after almost two years, the estate's executor, David
Salter, managed to collect only $1,000. Salter tried to find a
doctor who would do the surgery for free or at a reduced price but
had no luck.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few months ago, he got a call from old can-do Jim
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of his longtime friend, Griffin asked the surgeon who
replaced his own ailing hips to help. He came to the right place.
The surgeon, Dr. Andrew Seltzer, says he takes care of an indigent
patient without insurance every day. Two years ago, Seltzer and his
partners won a Legal Aid Society award for their charity work.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent examination, Seltzer determined that Denis Samson
indeed needed a new hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all abnormal, it's just bone on bone here,'' Seltzer
explains, pointing to Samson's x-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Samson has a slight build and appears frail next to the burly
doctor. He listens quietly and doesn't ask any questions. No, he
isn't afraid of the operation _ he's been through enough already:
two months in traction after the car accident, his leg broken in
three places.
</P>
<P>
   He grins at the mention of no more pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you sit up, sir,'' says the doctor, ``and let me
show you what we're going to do ...''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all there is to this good-deed story, for now. Samson
still awaits a happy ending: a new hip and a new life, with a grown
daughter and three grandchildren, who now live in Boca Raton. (That
is, if his application ever winds through immigration.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, when this lifelong worker gets his strength back, he'll
look for a new job.

 &HT;    `Theoretically it shouldn't be that hard to carve out a
half-hour to take a walk or go to the gym. '
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breaking free from the chains . . . for at least a half-hour
</P>
<P>
   My friend Janet doesn't ask for much in life. No Club Med
vacations, no diamond tiaras. On this particular morning, all she
wants is a little time for herself. Maybe a morning exercise class.
``That wouldn't make me a bad mom, would it?''
</P>
<P>
   She works part time and knows she's lucky to spend as much time
as she does with her boys, ages almost 3 and 11 months, but still
she worries. ``This is one more place I'm going to leave them, if I
take them to the nursery.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically it shouldn't be that hard to carve out a half-hour
to take a walk or go to the gym. Yet despite countless resolutions,
my son was 6 before I started exercising regularly again.
</P>
<P>
   You can find me among the non-spandex crowd at a morning
aerobics class at the downtown YMCA. You can see it in our faces,
in the guilty glee with which we grab weights and mats. This is
more than a workout. It's an oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the sweat equity, we need an hour in which we can
say, ``This is for me. My health, my well-being matter, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says that, of course. We keep up with each others' kids,
jobs, sprained ankles. We trust our instructor, Kathleen Aughe,
never to ask, ``Can you feel that burn?'' Like all good social
clubs, our class has a secret language, in which phrases like ``bow
pulls'' and ``farmers'' and ``monkeys'' have a precise and logical
meaning. We even have what I've decided is our theme song. We
perform a fast-moving routine that feels like flying as Trisha
Yearwood croons:
</P>
<P>
   I'm the one they all depend on, Sensible, predictable, and
strong But every now and then, I feel like I've played that role
too long.
</P>
<P>
   You sing it, sister!
</P>
<P>
   I need to rock the boat,
</P>
<P>
   I need to speak my mind
</P>
<P>
   Just this once let it all unwind.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, I'm so revved up I turn the wrong way and almost
bump into the woman next to me.
</P>
<P>
   I wanna go too far, I wanna go too fast
</P>
<P>
   Somebody draw the line so I can blow right past
</P>
<P>
   I wanna spend too much, I wanna stay too late
</P>
<P>
   I'm gonna roar too loud, I'm gonna be that way
</P>
<P>
   I wanna play too hard, I wanna go too far.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the song ends, I'm ready to save the world or go on
a shopping spree, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, reality intrudes. When we start our floor exercises, our
kids creep out from the nursery, making tents out of mats, showing
off with dumbbells like undernourished Popeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to work, or back home with the kids, back to the
world where everybody's timetable is more important than our own.
We're grownups, after all, and that's the way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Janet hasn't started working out yet, but she has bought her
running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   They're a symbol, and a promise. One day, she'll take the time
to exercise, to go inside herself and think. ``It's putting
priority on yourself. I'm always taking care of the kids, taking
care of the house, spending time with my husband _ which is a
delight, of course _ but time for yourself always comes last. Even
the 15 minutes at night when I read a book are so precious.''
</P>
<P>
   The more stressed out you are, the more you need the outlet, the
harder it is to find the time. But just you wait. One of these
days, we'll break free. We wanna spend too much, we wanna stay too
late, we wanna roar too loud, we wanna go too far.
</P>
<P>
   At least for that one hour in aerobics class.

 &HT;    Walk to school? No way, not nowadays!
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I did not have to walk to school barefoot six miles in the snow,
uphill both ways but during the first few years of my education,
unless it was raining, I hoofed it about six blocks to Marlin
Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   School starts for two of my children this week, and I regret
that they and their older sister have not had that same experience
and the camaraderie that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the neighborhood I grew up in was alive with youngsters, I
always had lots of company going to and from school. Big sisters in
junior high, older cousins in high school and bratty younger
neighbor kids. We'd all tromp off down Earl Street, through the
parking lot of the Safeway and then across Live Oak Street. Live
Oak was part of Texas 7, the highway that separated Marlin into the
predominantly white northern half and the rest of us on the south
side.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'd cross a vacant lot by the lumber yard, go down the
sidewalk (remember sidewalks?) by the First Methodist Church, past
the office of the doctor who delivered me (good guy!), then a
couple more blocks and we were in the school yard.
</P>
<P>
   We were a lively bunch: the Pecina kids, sprinkled with the
Duartes, Palacios, Melendez and Garcias. Our overprotective mothers
felt quite comfortable letting their chicks out of their sight as
long as we stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   My older sister abandoned us when she got to high school to ride
with our older cousins in their souped-up cars. However, she was
forgiven when she turned 16 and began hauling us in our family's
station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Then she graduated, and we were afoot again. Sometime during my
seventh grade year, the school district decided to stop fighting
full integration so the next year the younger kids and I attended
what had been the Booker T. Washington campus. It was a couple of
miles from our house and too long a walk, our parents determined.
</P>
<P>
   My aunt took on driving duties. I remember sitting in the back
seat giggling with my cousins because Aunt Elvira didn't take too
well to backing up. Her method was to place one foot firmly on the
gas pedal and the other just as firmly on the brake, put the car in
reverse and maintain the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the gas pedal would win and _ with a jolt _ we would
be on our way.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the mode of transportation, the company was good and
loud and the bonds formed in the barrio still hold. In fact,
there's talk of a reunion of the neighbor kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that my own children have had such boring trips to
and from school, parents hauling them in a car one way and then
back again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's something I miss doing for them.
</P>
<P>
   I also miss the days when I was allowed, on the first day of
school, to actually accompany them to their classrooms. Last year,
my then sixth grade son directed my husband and me to ``just drop
me off at the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Than last week, I was politely told by my 16-year-old daughter
that I didn't have to go to registration with her. ``Can you just
write the checks?'' And our college student will fly solo back to
Massachusetts for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Do I feel rejected? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good mother, I'm plotting revenge but I may have to
wait a few years. The only thing I can come up with is making them
drop me off a block away from the nursing home.

 &HT;    Yes still saying no to being pigeonholed after 30 years
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Anderson, whose lyrics for the rock group Yes offer up
dreamy love scenes full of fantasy, has a feisty side.
</P>
<P>
   At least when the record company demands more commercial hits
from the band known for intricate, drawn-out works.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to call me Napoleon,'' Anderson said last week from
an Austin, Texas, hotel room. ``They still do sometimes. I get
feisty about being penned in. I'm into more things than trying to
become a commercial star.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, with lead singer Anderson and mainstays Chris Squire on
bass and Steve Howe on lead guitar, plays Saturday at the Coral Sky
Amphitheater, the final stop on the group's U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson said he doesn't look for pop hits, Yes is no
stranger to them. The group estimates its sales at 30 million
albums in 30 years, a figure Anderson finds staggering.
</P>
<P>
   At its most mainstream, the group's 1983 album 90125 sold more
than 3 million copies, spurred by the hit Owner of a Lonely Heart.
But the group has mostly thrived on a hard-driving, artistic sound
that grew out of the electric rock of the 1960s. From 1971 to 1974,
Yes made four 1-million selling albums, with Fragile, featuring the
group's trademark hit Roundabout, selling 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to become more than just a popular band,'' Anderson
said. ``When you get a success, you start thinking, `I don't want
to waste this. I want to invest in it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since 90125, the group has shifted personnel often,
as it continued to cut albums, none reaching the audience of its
earlier days. The group's current makeup includes 1970s drummer
Alan White; new member Billy Sherwood, doing vocals, guitar and
keyboards; and Moscow's Igor Khoroshev on keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   While the group prides itself on musicianship, always at its
center is Anderson's voice, a hypnotic blend of soothing pitch and
revealing clarity.
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson, 53, music comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never remember a day going by when I wasn't singing when
I was a little nipper,'' he said. Growing up in the English
countryside he mimicked the Everly Brothers and Bobby Vee. He
remembers first holding a microphone at age 11, and liking it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't turn back. At 16, he played in a band, the Warriors.
In 1963, as the Beatles made it big in London, the Warriors
followed their path, hitting the hard-edged German club circuit.
Anderson returned to London in 1967 and a year later met Squire.
They formed Yes with Peter Banks, Tony Kaye and Bill Bruford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get past 1974,'' Anderson said.
``People would say Close to the Edge (a million-selling 1972
release) will be remembered in 10 years' time. I would say, `I
don't think so.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and the album's 18-minute title song still remains on
the group's play list, featuring Anderson's favorite lyric.
</P>
<P>
   ``And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reference, he said, to the spaces between things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we don't see anything as we should. What we see
are the spaces between, which is the most wonderful thing.''

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ In theory, the Internet can offer users more
convenient and flexible ways of exchanging data or buying and
selling goods than traditional forms of trade or communication. But
broadly felt distrust hampers electronic commerce from reaching its
full potential. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED 8/6.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ I wish Clinton would call up Kenneth Starr and
say: You've been saying the president is just like any other Joe.
He gets no legal slack. Well, if I'm just Joe Citizen with a swank
address, I've been thinking and I've decided not to testify to your
grand jury after all. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED 8/6.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Why did it not surprise me late last month to
read that files documenting gold stolen from Jews by the Nazis
mysteriously disappeared from German archives well after the
conclusion of World War II _ and that U.S. negligence played a
role? (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED 8/6.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ A series of stories on my trip to the Baltics
will be forthcoming over the next couple of weeks. Meantime, there
are just two things I've learned from my travels. The second is how
to pack. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED 8/6.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ The more stressed out you are, the more you
need the outlet, the harder it is to find the time. But just you
wait. One of these days, we'll break free. We wanna spend too much,
we wanna stay too late, we wanna roar too loud, we wanna go too

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ My mother's lifelong friend and neighbor, Sally

Alford, Fla., home this week. For my family, it was more than
losing a good friend, the mother of my children's best Alford
playmates. It was the end of a way of life. (Sibley, Atlanta

   FLAMURDER-TALE _ HOBE SOUND, Fla. _ Thirty years have now passed
and officials have long since concluded ``Trapper'' Nelson's death
was a suicide. Some still swear it was murder. (Houck, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NET-COPS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The next arrest of a family violence
suspect may be just a mouse click away. The Austin, Texas, Police
Department is posting the names and descriptions of hundreds of
suspects charged with family violence on its Web page, hoping that
neighbors, friends or co-workers of victims of abuse may turn in a
suspect who has eluded the police. (Copelin, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD-DEED-DR _ This story is rated G. It contains no violence or
sex scandals or gut-wrenching tragedy. It is just the tale of a
good deed, one of many that usually go unnoticed _ and certainly
don't make headlines _ while we go about our busy, private lives.
Denis Samson, 69, is getting a hip replacement. (Fuchs, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KID-SLEEP _ Let's face it. Bedtime is relaxed during summer
vacation. Kids stay up late; kids sleep late. Parents of teen-agers
know this better than anyone. To avoid the knock-down, drag-out
fights, start today to get children back into a routine that will
head off the early morning struggles to get them out of bed and to
school on time. (Gandara, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ When it was first announced we would
be getting HOV lanes on the freeways in metro Atlanta, I was less
than impressed. I have since changed my opinion. When I have had
the opportunity, I have found them to be not only efficient, but
stress-reducing. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-DRIVE _ ATLANTA -- Less than 10 years after it was
introduced as a 1990 model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is
one of the vehicles reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors
carries out the talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are
four reasons it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best
buy'' and a car that ``does most things adequately, but
unexceptionally.'' (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA -- For the past couple of weeks I have been
addressing the issue of fuel octane as it relates to engine
requirements. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LEEMAY-COLUMN _ Lee May gardening column. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e category)

   YES _ While Jon Anderson said he doesn't look for pop hits, Yes

   2GOOD-TEETH _ When dentists go to the movies they notice these
things. West Palm Beach, Florida, cosmetic and general dentist
Vincent Dolce says World War II soldiers would never have sparkling
teeth, ``even though they're young. But obviously when you're on
the screen, they make them whiter.'' (Erstein, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   SWAMP-FIRES _ The wildfires that roared through Georgia's famed
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge a few weeks ago scorched 5,100
acres of swampland. What a shame, some people said. But fire is one
of Mother Nature's major tools for maintaining the health of many
ecosystems such as the Okefenokee, which needs an occasional burn.
``If fires burned every inch of the Okefenokee, it would be good
for it,'' says Ron Phernetton, a fire management officer there.
(Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   VACATION-CHURCH _ While churches cut back services for summer,
combine Sunday School classes and take a break from mid-week
activities, at the resorts and lakes from the mountains to the
coast, people are finding ways to worship. An example: a boat
church with a pulpit on a pier so that people can come in their
boats. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FOXWORTHY-FAITH _ We all know comedian Jeff Foxworthy is funny
and a redneck. But now he wants people to also know he's a son of
the South coming back to his roots and a child of God coming back
to his faith. (Hannigan, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DCTALK _ Most music fans know DC Talk through their music. Their
last album, ``Jesus Freak,'' went platinum and netted the trio a
Grammy Award for best rock gospel album. Yet few people know about
the group's public campaign to promote racial unity. This
interracial trio created the ERACE (Eliminating Racism and Creating
Equality) Foundation last year to promote what they call ``living
integration.'' I talk to DC Talk member Toby McKeehan about their
campaign. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Trapper Nelson: Wild man of Loxahatchee
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBE SOUND, Fla. _ The scene was gruesome by the time John
DuBois found his friend's body on July 30, 1968. Adjacent to the
serene Loxahatchee River and under a hammock that swung in the
shade of a Seminole-style chickee hut, DuBois arrived to see Victor
Nelson face down on the sandy ground.
</P>
<P>
   His ribcage was torn open by a shotgun blast at close range, and
raccoons, insects and guinea hens had picked at Nelson's corpse for
about a week. The stench was so fierce, his autopsy was conducted
outdoors instead of at Martin Memorial Hospital. His ashes were
later scattered on the river.
</P>
<P>
   Dying at the end of a loaded gun, his remains devoured by
animals, was an ironic end for a man who made his living harvesting
the thousands of pelts and hides of the rabbits, raccoons, possums
and alligators he shot and trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years have now passed and officials have long since
concluded ``Trapper'' Nelson's death was a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some still swear it was murder.
</P>
<P>
   His mysterious death at age 59 only added to the intrigue of
Trapper Nelson. This, according to historians, newspaper accounts,
friends and family, is his story:
</P>
<P>
   Born Victor Nostokovich in Trenton, N.J., in 1908, Nelson was
the son of Polish immigrants. He left home after his mother died
and his father remarried. The boy hopped a freight train heading
west, taking with him money he had earned trapping muskrats in the
New Jersey marshes.
</P>
<P>
   Nostokovich went to Colorado first, then to Mexico, where he was
arrested for gunrunning. Released from jail, he caught a freight
train east and eventually wound up in the Jupiter area in the late
1920s. Along the way, he adopted the name Nelson as a way of
building a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   The legend holds that from the train, he saw schools of mullet
jumping in the Jupiter Inlet and decided to stay because he'd never
go hungry with all that food in the water, said Robert Schuh,
ranger at Jonathan Dickinson State Park, which now encompasses
Nelson's homestead.
</P>
<P>
   With his stepbrother, Charles, and a friend named James Dykas,
Nelson set up a camp near Jupiter Inlet and began trapping. But the
three partners didn't get along. One morning in December 1931,
Charles shot Dykas in the head as the man made breakfast while
Nelson _ who had now acquired the nickname ``Trapper'' _ was away
from camp tending to a trap line.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Victor were jailed, but Victor chose to testify
against his stepbrother. The testimony helped convict Charles and
send him away for a life term at Raiford prison in North Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned with partnerships, people and civilization in
general, Nelson set up a camp deep in a wooded area along the
Loxahatchee River, about 5 miles west of U.S. 1. in what is now
Jonathan Dickinson State Park. _ _ The place was a paradise for
him. Mostly he lived off the land, skinning raccoons and cooking
the carcasses. Gopher tortoises were chopped into stew, Schuch
said.
</P>
<P>
   A strapping man at 6-feet-2-inches and about 240 pounds, he
thrived on hard work, planting fruit trees and pineapples and
chopping cords of wood routinely for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson would get up at about 6:30 each morning to check the trap
lines behind his house and farther north in Kitchen Creek. He'd
spend the morning hunting and working and then take it easy in the
early afternoon before resuming work again later. Trips to town in
his trucks were infrequent, but he'd use the occasion to stock up
on supplies and pick up copies of The Wall Street Journal, which
he'd devour, line by line.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Celmer III, Nelson's great-nephew, thinks of him as a
``gentle giant'' who worked hard and liked to have his own space.
Celmer, 53, now lives in Waretown, N.J., but spent summers as a
teen working at Nelson's homestead. He remembers ``Uncle Nelson''
as someone who was as content to sit and listen to the sounds of
nature as he was to tell stories of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a hermit; he liked people,'' Celmer said. ``But he
liked them to go, too, when it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work was a given, but discipline was at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For big thrills, we'd take his Jeep into town and go get a
pint of ice cream _ a pint for each of us,'' he said. ``When you're
13, and you get to eat a whole pint of ice cream, you're a pretty
happy kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The normal diet around camp consisted of gruel _ usually, a
combination of oatmeal and turtle, with rice and pepper. Sometimes
there would be fried fish. Pancakes were a mixed blessing, since
weevils infested the flour, making for some crunchy flapjacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he'd bring back a burlap bag filled with doughnuts
that were covered with ants,'' he said. ``He'd tell us to just
shake them off. He wasn't too fussy about what he ate.'' _ _ Nelson
spent money made from his skins and pelts buying more land,
according to the book ``The Life of the Loxahatchee River'' by
Bessie Wilson DuBois, wife of John DuBois, a longtime friend of
Nelson's who owned a fish camp near Jupiter Inlet. After the
Depression, many land owners were unable to pay their taxes, and
Nelson was eager to scoop their properties up for a song at the tax
sales. By buying land _ sometimes for only a few dollars an acre _
Nelson built his property into an 858-acre oasis.
</P>
<P>
   To support himself and pay the taxes on his land holdings,
Nelson set up a zoo in the early 1950s near the river, with
handmade buildings hewn from the hard core of the slash pine. He
arranged for boat captains from West Palm Beach to bring tourists 7
miles up river to have lunch in the wild and view the bobcats,
raccoons, possums, alligators and snakes. On some days, hundreds
would tour the property and buy a souvenir orchid or handmade
trinket.
</P>
<P>
   Always the survivor, Nelson knew how to con his way into a free
lunch. Occasionally, he'd scout out the ritziest picnic table and
go hang a harmless indigo snake around the necks of a diner or two.
Appetites ruined, he'd help himself to their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also liked to go scoop up a tortoise, cut off its head,
pour the blood into a cup and drink it,'' Schuh said. ``He made out
real good foodwise that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Socialites from Palm Beach _ the Kennedys included, Celmer said
_ would visit by boat for a taste of wild Florida. Heavyweight
boxing champion Gene Tunney once remarked that Nelson's burly hands
made his own look feminine by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Army took a huge hunk of his land to
create Camp Murphy. Nelson was drafted into service, first
stationed in Texas and then at Camp Murphy. He married briefly as a
ploy to avoid service but later divorced. He never had children.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the war, his zoo was in shambles. He tried to
rebuild, but by the late '50s, life began to unravel. He spent much
of his time fending off property taxes and worrying about lawsuits
from the visitors who would take a plunge into the river from his
rope swing or try to walk across the top of the alligator cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one drunk every year would fall into the gator cage,''
Celmer said.
</P>
<P>
   After a state health agency closed his zoo _ citing unsanitary
conditions and safety hazards from the snakes _ Nelson's demeanor
changed. He locked the gate on the dirt road that led to his
compound. He posted signs that read, ``Danger. Land mines. No
trespassing.'' He felled trees across the river to block pleasure
boaters from reaching his docks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he closed the zoo permanently. Visitors first had to
write for permission to enter his property, and not all were
allowed. His mood soured further as he saw friends become ill with
cancer. He obsessed that he, too, would be riddled with the
disease, since he had a touchy stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Debilitating sickness was the last thing on Earth he would
endure, he told his friends and relatives in a matter-of-fact tone.
``He told people that if he couldn't take care of himself, he'd do
himself in,'' Schuh said. _ _ In August 1968, it took an hour of
deliberation for a six-man Martin County coroner's jury to declare
Nelson's death a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The jury listened as John DuBois testified that Nelson
complained of ill health prior to his death. Others said he
suffered from stomach pains and expressed distrust of doctors,
telling friends that he would never be operated on. Problems with
his prostate gland forced him to use a catheter.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County Deputy Sheriff Slater Grose, who investigated the
death, told the jury Nelson apparently put the butt of the shotgun
in the sand, placed the gun barrel to his chest and pulled the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   But some things didn't make sense. Nelson had always said that
if he decided to kill himself, he'd pull in his lines so no animals
would die in unattended traps. The day he was found, his traps were
still set. Also, most people who use guns to commit suicide shoot
themselves in the head or mouth with a handgun, not in the torso
with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fact he was due to arrive at DuBois' fish
camp near the inlet to meet a friend he hadn't seen in 30 years.
When his body was found, Nelson was dressed as if he was going to a
social occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Could it have been accidental? Possibly. Nelson kept a gun at
his side at all times, even hiding it in a rack behind the
headboard of a bed in a guest cabin he built. Maybe, Schuh
surmises, Nelson stumbled out of his hammock at the chickee hut and
fell awkwardly on the trigger. It would explain those reports that
said the gun was found dozens of feet away, not next to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had just shot yourself and knew how far away help was,
wouldn't you be frustrated enough to take the gun and just fling it
in anger?'' Schuh said. ``Maybe so.''
</P>
<P>
   But some suspected murder, Schuh said. Trapper Nelson made a lot
of people angry.
</P>
<P>
   There was the neighbor whose goats Nelson was accused of killing
with explosives in a fit of revenge. There were the many land
owners who forfeited their property, only to see Nelson buy it for
a pittance. There were the people he chased off his land in later
years with gunshots fired into the air. There were the husbands of
the Palm Beach socialites who sometimes took refuge at his property
for days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was his stepbrother, Charles. His life sentence
was believed to be a 35-year term, but no records have been found
indicating whether he died in prison or was paroled. Thirty-five
years, Schuh said. If he was paroled, it would have put it right at
about the year 1968. Interesting coincidence, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   But Celmer says he has no doubts that his Uncle Nelson took his
own life. It's just what he would have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really miss the guy,'' he said. ``To this day, I still get
emotional about him . . . He was sort of a hero to me . . . very
intelligent . . . He just made a lot of sense about everything.''

 &HT;    Get kids on schedule before school starts
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Let the battles begin.
</P>
<P>
   The start of school is a few days away and parental dread is
setting in. Hint: It's not the part about shooing children out the
door; it's getting them up on time so they leave the house fed,
clothed, materials in hand and with a smile. Actually, maybe the
smiling part is pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Bedtime is relaxed during summer vacation. Kids
stay up late; kids sleep late. Parents of teen-agers know this
better than anyone. When school rolls around and routines are out
of whack, parents get impatient and kids become irritable. It's
fertile ground for disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown knows what's at stake. The Leander woman says she
has a ``hellacious'' time with her children, 6, 9 and 11. ``I
reeeeally don't look forward to getting them back on schedule,''
she says. ``It's always such a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the knock-down, drag-out fights, start today to get
children back into a routine that will head off the early morning
struggles to get them out of bed and to school on time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's family is the sign of the times. The kids have a
different bedtime at her ex-husband's house where they stay every
other weekend. She works late and the sitter can't always get her
children to bed on time. There is a lot of inconsistency. ``That's
what I'm up against and every year it takes us at least a month to
settle in. I reeeeally dread it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not always external forces that disrupt kids' sleeping
patterns during the summer. Parents are to blame, too. Go to a
restaurant, bowling alley, movie theater or mall, and you see kids
staying up late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that all the time,'' says Brown. ``But you know what? If
I'm seeing it, I'm doing it, too. I guess with busy schedules we
try to fit so much stuff in.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Morton, who teaches first grade at Anderson Mill
Elementary School, says she can count on some children coming to
school sleepy at the start of the school year. What's worse,
parents don't fully understand what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of sleep and lack of a routine affects their behavior
and concentration,'' she says. ``They daydream, get cranky and
don't perform. Their tempers flare.''
</P>
<P>
   When children doze off in her class, she says, she allows them
to sleep. `To wake them wouldn't accomplish much. Sleepy kids
complain about tummy and headaches. When I send them to the nurse's
office I get a note back that they slept for 30 minutes. They are
just exhausted,'' Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes one or two kids to affect the entire classroom.
She ends up going over lessons more than once, which slows down the
other children.
</P>
<P>
   So what can be done about it? Start establishing a routine today
so everyone is ready for Day One.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Kvols, author of ``Redirecting Children's Behavior,''
suggests reeling in children, teens included, at least a week
before school starts. ``With little ones, wake them up 5 to 10
minutes earlier each day. You should reach your target time at
least two days before school starts. This means that on the other
end, the kids need to go to bed a little earlier each night,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests giving teen-agers more say. ``You need to ask them
what they need to get ready for school. The answers will come from
them. They will be less rebellious and more cooperative if they
have a say,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kvols tells parents to approach a bedtime routine by looking at
it from a child's point of view. ``Imagine if you were in the
middle of a good book and your spouse says that it's time for bed.
In spite of your response that you're not ready, you are helped
unwillingly up the stairs, your clothes are removed and you are
forced into taking a bath. Consider how you are feeling. Are you
feeling disrespected, violated, angry or controlled?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's her advice for parents of young children. Some aspects
can be applied to older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Respect your own needs. ``Take care of yourself during the day
so you are not feeling hassled or frazzled at your child's
bedtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Start one hour before the child's actual bedtime to avoid
unnecessary stress and struggle. ``This is winding-down time.
Eliminate roughhousing, tickling or stimulating TV programs. This
just gets them more excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Offer choices instead of orders. ``Your child will have a
feeling of control over what happens to him when given choices. For
example, 'Do you want your Dad to help you with your bath or me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Create a bedtime ritual with your child's help. ``Read a story,
snuggle and give them stuffed animals to kiss. Then, give them a
hug and two kisses and leave the room singing a song.''
</P>
<P>
   Create closeness. ``Say three things that you love about each
other. Start each statement with 'What I love about you is...'
Listen to your child's feelings about the day. Ask questions which
allow your child to share more about himself, such as, 'What was
the best happy thing that happened to you today?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Kvols says bedtime needs to be a time of nurturing, closeness,
shared communication and fun. ``By involving your children in the
decision-making process and spending this special time with them,
they will feel valued and respected,'' she says.

 &HT;    Heed owner's manual suggestion on gas
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For the past couple of weeks I have been addressing
the issue of fuel octane as it relates to engine requirements. This
discussion was prompted by Dave Grosmann's question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I purchased a 1998 Buick Regal GS, which has a GM 3800 series
II, supercharged V-6 engine. The manual calls for premium gas. The
same engine without a supercharger uses regular. The salesperson
told me that I could use regular if I didn't have any pinging or
run-on, which I don't. Am I doing the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, no, not if you want the maximum performance from
that engine. If you're not concerned about the power this engine
configuration was designed to deliver, why in the world did you
fork out the extra cash for a supercharger?
</P>
<P>
   The reason your owner's manual specifies high-octane fuel is
because the supercharger raises the compression pressure, which
results in more power from the engine. The higher the compression
pressure, the more heat produced and the greater the octane needed.
Premium fuel is formulated to meet this demand. Regular fuel is
not. You might not hear your engine pinging when you mash the
accelerator, but your engine's knock sensor does.
</P>
<P>
   Engine knock (ping) occurs when the air/fuel mixture ignites
prematurely in the combustion chamber. This condition occurs when
the heat of compression starts the combustion process before the
timed ignition of the spark plug. What follows is a collision of
the two flame fronts inside the combustion chamber, resulting in an
uncontrolled ``explosion.'' Performance diminishes, emissions
increase and piston damage begins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, automobile manufacturers have incorporated
a device into their computer-controlled engine management systems
to alleviate pinging. The ``knock sensor'' senses the sound
frequency produced by this engine condition before it is audible to
the driver. The computer cannot control the spontaneous ignition
caused by the compression heat, but it can eliminate the colliding
flame front produced by the spark plug. It accomplishes this by
delaying the spark, referred to as retarding the spark timing.
Although power is sacrificed, emissions and engine damage are
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The knock sensor normally functions during the onset of
acceleration when ping would be most prevalent; however, I suspect
in your case, it is working overtime. To complicate the situation,
many late-model computers use an adaptive learning strategy
technology that actually ``adapts'' the computer's engine commands
to a driver's individual driving technique. Your use of regular
fuel could have caused your car's computer to permanently
compensate for the continual power loss, and it may need to be
evaluated and possibly reset by your dealer's service department.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is start running a good quality premium fuel.
Don't cheap out and buy the bargain gasoline, or you'll end up with
a whole load of other problems. Read and believe your owner's
manual. If you're not prepared to follow the manufacturer's
prescription for fuel and maintenance for that vehicle, trade it
for a more conservative model. Both you and the car will be
happier.

 &HT;    Austin police enlist
 &HT;    Web to snag suspects
 &HT;    of domestic violence
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The next arrest of a family violence suspect may
be just a mouse click away.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas, Police Department is posting the names and
descriptions of hundreds of suspects charged with family violence
on its Web page, hoping that neighbors, friends or co-workers of
victims of abuse may turn in a suspect who has eluded the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every police department has a Web page with a Ten Most
Wanted List,'' Sgt. John Jones said. ``We're expanding that
theory.'' The police warn that people should not try to apprehend a
suspect. Instead, phone 356-4249 to report the suspect's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Family violence accounted for nine of Austin's 40 homicides in
1997. While the police arrest many people at the scene of a family
disturbance, many times the suspect has fled before police arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high profile of family violence, the Austin Police
Department has struggled to serve arrest warrants quickly. Felony
crimes, Assistant Chief Michael McDonald said, always have taken
priority over misdemeanors. Many charges from a family disturbance
are misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sylvia Hernandez, an Austin American-Statesman
employee, was killed. An arrest warrant was outstanding for her
estranged boyfriend, Leonard Saldana, on a previous family
disturbance charge. The misdemeanor warrant had been outstanding
for 11 days before police phoned him at home and asked him to turn
himself in. Three days later, on the day Saldana was supposed to
surrender at police headquarters, he was arrested and charged in
the stabbing death of Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   While many police departments use Web sites for lists of
high-profile criminals, Jones said he only knows of San Diego using
it to fight family violence. The Austin experiment is patterned
after San Diego's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive listing includes the suspect's name, race, sex,
height, weight and the criminal charge. The entire list, however,
cannot be viewed at one time. A visitor to the Web site must either
enter a name or the first two letters of a name.
</P>
<P>
   That design was intentional, though it discourages searching the
entire list.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the police expect that neighbors, friends or
co-workers who believe that a friend or neighbor is being abused
will know the name of the suspect. Plus, police did not want
out-of-date lists to be printed and circulated. The electronic
version will be updated every other day.
</P>
<P>
   When the police get a tip, an officer will be dispatched. But,
just as in other arrests, Jones said no arrest will be made until
the warrant is confirmed as still valid.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of suspects will be listed on the Police Department's
Web site. Law enforcement officials this week tried to clear some
of the backlog _ 450 warrants, some dating back to 1992. The Austin
police, Travis County's constables and sheriff's deputies made 117
arrests. Still, more than 300 are unaccounted-for. Police said 60
are believed to have moved out of state, and there is no local
address for another 150.
</P>
<P>
   Serving old arrest warrants can be tricky, especially in family
violence cases. Many times, the couple may have reconciled, and the
arrest may prompt more violence. To guard against that, the local
battered victims' shelter, legal aid lawyers and members of the
Women's Advocacy Project helped police.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations either provided counseling or shelter to crime
victims, answered legal questions and even processed emergency
protective orders if the arrested suspect threatened anyone. The
orders keep the suspect away from the victim for 31 days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the fugitives' listing is a 90-day experiment. If it
works, he said, other crimes may be added to the Web site.

 &HT;    Enforce rules for HOV lanes or take them away
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When it was first announced we would be getting HOV
lanes on the freeways in metro Atlanta, I was less than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   My immediate response was it was a waste of time and taxpayers'
money. I have since changed my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am traveling alone most of the trips I make through
downtown, I rarely get to use them. However, when I have had the
opportunity, I have found them to be not only efficient, but stress
reducing.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit when I am sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic in
one of the non-HOV lanes, I long for the luxury of cruising
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I have noticed an increasing percentage of solo
drivers who are doing more than just lusting. They are hopping in
the HOV lanes in an obvious disregard for the posted rules and
regulations. I don't know about you, but this really gets my goat.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be one particular stereotype or vehicle
type, but they all seem to be well-schooled in knowing how to beat
the system. I see a lot of high-end luxury vehicles -- sedans to
full-size sport-utility vehicles -- who are offenders. But on the
other hand, there are just as many economy cars using the HOV as a
passing lane. The one thing they all have in common is a total
disregard for the law.
</P>
<P>
   In long, straight stretches, you'll see these offenders darting
in and out of the HOV lane to advance their position. They always
drop back in their proper lane just prior to a curve. Obviously,
they expect the law to be laying in wait just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if there is an accident, these drivers seem to take it as
their license to steal.
</P>
<P>
   While I would agree it is probably acceptable to pass the
accident scene, I don't think it permits it two or three miles
after that accident. It also seems a lot of out-of-state drivers
cruise in the HOV lanes. There are adequate signs and no excuse for
this.
</P>
<P>
   I do have some questions.
</P>
<P>
   While buses and motorcycles are allowed in HOV lanes, were they
really intended for motor homes pulling boats at 45 mph? Or, if you
aren't going to keep up with the flow of traffic in the adjoining
lanes, should you be allowed to create a roadblock in the HOV lane?
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I observed an officer ticketing a young woman for
traveling illegally in the HOV lane. As he wrote, she was putting
on her mascara. Sadly, it is a commentary on how a lot of drivers
perceive the HOV lanes and their regulations. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, they ask other motorists to report offenders. I'm
not yet ready for the HOV militia. Rather, I would welcome a
substantial fine for violators and make it progressive. Each repeat
offense doubles the fine. Sooner or later, you will either get
these drivers' attention or they won't have any money left for gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, if we are going to have HOV lanes, then they need
to be enforced. Or we should do away with them and have an extra
lane for the rest of us.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Lumina a bright workhorse
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Less than 10 years after it was introduced as a 1990
model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is one of the vehicles
reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors carries out the
talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are four reasons
it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best buy'' and a car
that ``does most things adequately, but unexceptionally.''
</P>
<P>
   -- It has base prices of $17,795 for the unadorned sedan,
$19,395 for the sensibly equipped LS version and $20,295 for the
sporty, spoilered LTZ four-door. The ``light driftwood metallic''
-- brown, if you will -- test vehicle totaled $21,454 with its only
missing optional features of any significance being a sunroof
($700) and leather seats ($695).
</P>
<P>
   -- Although classified a midsize sedan, the Lumina is the
largest four-door in the Chevy fleet. It weighs a trim 3,300
pounds, is 200.9 inches long with a 107.5-inch wheelbase and can
seat six persons, although the middle passengers are likely to
squawk. Headroom and legroom are decent both front and rear, and
the trunk has a fully usable 15.5 cubic feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   -- Its 16.6-gallon fuel tank gives the Lumina a cruising range
of more than 300 miles, and its EPA figures are realistic: 20 mpg
in the city and 29 on the highway. That's predicated on
non-jack-rabbit starts in stop-and-go traffic and a willingness to
let the Lumina proceed at its own pace instead of forcing a
downshift up hills and long interstate inclines. Regular fuel is
recommended, and the tester's performance wasn't notably enhanced
by premium.
</P>
<P>
   -- In LS trim, the Lumina has the basics of air conditioning,
tilt wheel, full instrumentation and a stereo with cassette player
and four average speakers. Its options were reasonably priced, with
an in-dash CD player costing $93 and steering-wheel-mounted stereo
controls adding $171.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior can hardly be tagged exciting, but it's pleasing
with a moderate use of brightwork and blackout. The interior
deserves better marks, because it's got an easily read
instrumentation pod, big and/or convenient controls and good
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The seating, at best, is fair. The optional power driver's seat
($305) adjusted nicely to drivers of different sizes, but the lower
portion of the seatback proved uncomfortable to some. The rear
seating is, um, firm and sized more for children than full-size
adults.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Lumina is one of those cars that falls into the
easy-driver category, meaning little physical effort is required,
and it has a stable feel, as long as brisk cornering isn't asked of
it. The ride's comfortable, but not quiet -- the 160-horsepower V-6
goes willingly, but it does some serious wailing en route to its
6,000 rpm redline. Peak power comes at 5,200 rpm, while maximum
torque is developed at a comparatively hushed 4,000 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Given some styling perks, a refined drivetrain and better
seating, the Lumina could be more than the utilitarian
family/commuter sedan that it is. For now, however, it's a
workhorse that seems to be running out of time.

 &HT;    Heed owner's manual suggestion on gas
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For the past couple of weeks I have been addressing
the issue of fuel octane as it relates to engine requirements. This
discussion was prompted by Dave Grosmann's question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I purchased a 1998 Buick Regal GS, which has a GM 3800 series
II, supercharged V-6 engine. The manual calls for premium gas. The
same engine without a supercharger uses regular. The salesperson
told me that I could use regular if I didn't have any pinging or
run-on, which I don't. Am I doing the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, no, not if you want the maximum performance from
that engine. If you're not concerned about the power this engine
configuration was designed to deliver, why in the world did you
fork out the extra cash for a supercharger?
</P>
<P>
   The reason your owner's manual specifies high-octane fuel is
because the supercharger raises the compression pressure, which
results in more power from the engine. The higher the compression
pressure, the more heat produced and the greater the octane needed.
Premium fuel is formulated to meet this demand. Regular fuel is
not. You might not hear your engine pinging when you mash the
accelerator, but your engine's knock sensor does.
</P>
<P>
   Engine knock (ping) occurs when the air/fuel mixture ignites
prematurely in the combustion chamber. This condition occurs when
the heat of compression starts the combustion process before the
timed ignition of the spark plug. What follows is a collision of
the two flame fronts inside the combustion chamber, resulting in an
uncontrolled ``explosion.'' Performance diminishes, emissions
increase and piston damage begins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, automobile manufacturers have incorporated
a device into their computer-controlled engine management systems
to alleviate pinging. The ``knock sensor'' senses the sound
frequency produced by this engine condition before it is audible to
the driver. The computer cannot control the spontaneous ignition
caused by the compression heat, but it can eliminate the colliding
flame front produced by the spark plug. It accomplishes this by
delaying the spark, referred to as retarding the spark timing.
Although power is sacrificed, emissions and engine damage are
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The knock sensor normally functions during the onset of
acceleration when ping would be most prevalent; however, I suspect
in your case, it is working overtime. To complicate the situation,
many late-model computers use an adaptive learning strategy
technology that actually ``adapts'' the computer's engine commands
to a driver's individual driving technique. Your use of regular
fuel could have caused your car's computer to permanently
compensate for the continual power loss, and it may need to be
evaluated and possibly reset by your dealer's service department.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is start running a good quality premium fuel.
Don't cheap out and buy the bargain gasoline, or you'll end up with
a whole load of other problems. Read and believe your owner's
manual. If you're not prepared to follow the manufacturer's
prescription for fuel and maintenance for that vehicle, trade it
for a more conservative model. Both you and the car will be
happier.

   FILM-SNAKE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Snake Eyes,'' a Brian De Palma
film (``The Untouchables,'' ``Scarface''), is a fast-paced, flashy
crime thriller starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise. In an
Atlantic City casino, a murder takes place ringside at a boxing
match. By LOUIS B. PARKS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BILLY-REVIEW (Undated) _ There are no big issues to tackle
here, and there's no self-loathing, either. Rather, ``Billy's
Hollywood Screen Kiss'' is about a regular guy who's looking for
love. Modeled after the love stories of the 1950s _ the Sandra Dee
and Doris Day vehicles come to mind _ the film features a gay lead
in an Everyman role. The movie stars Sean P. Hayes and Brad Rowe.

<P>
   FILM-PROFILE-DEPALMA (Undated) _ Brian de Palma is a big
blustery filmmaker who likes to take his audience by the lapels and
shake it. Certainly he wants to be viewed as an artist of the
cinema, but the truth is that De Palma is less a persuasive artist
than he is a simple and vulgar bully. Based on ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' ``Carlito's Way'' and now ``Snake Eyes,'' I am willing
to never see another Brian De Palma movie. Uncle! By BARBARA

THE `LAST TIME' FOR JERRY SEINFELD (WE HOPE) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jerry, thanks for the laughs, the memories and
all the goodbyes. Now, go away.
</P>
<P>
   Missing Jerry Seinfeld is hard, and not because ``Seinfeld'' has
left the air after nine glorious seasons (well, seven glorious, one
all right and one pretty average seasons). It's difficult to have
withdrawal when he is still around so much. Jerry is becoming like
your favorite uncle who came to visit for a week and has been
living on the couch since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it's Jerry on a commercial! Wow, Jerry is on a magazine
cover! Jerry is guest-announcing a Mets game! And, hey, Jerry is on
world tour and giving tickets away!
</P>
<P>
   Now he's returning to his roots: New York and stand-up comedy.
His 10-show run at Broadway's Broadhurst Theater mercifully titled
``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' is highlighted by a live
telecast airing Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of his previous shows have been positive, even though
Seinfeld is a decade removed from his stand-up career. So touring
in Australia and Europe and across the United States is what one
would consider retirement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up for me is not like work,'' Seinfeld said this week at
a New York City news conference. ``It is a very liberating type of
performance. Putting on a weekly TV show is very complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up was the best way for me to feel free and feel
relaxed. To be in front of the audience is the most fun I can
have.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seinfeld (who first appeared on HBO 17 years ago as part of
a series of young comedians, and last was seen on there in 1987 in
a stand-up show) says ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,'' he
means it. The material he will use _ observations of the arcane and
sublime borne from his original stand-up act and perfected on his
NBC show _ will be retired after the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never do any of these jokes ever again,'' he vows.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God. In many ways, Jerry Seinfeld's last season on NBC was
like the last season for Hall of Famer Willie Mays: both stayed
around one year too long, and were shadows of their former selves.
Unlike Mays, Seinfeld can retool and recast himself.
</P>
<P>
   After the Broadway show, Seinfeld will look to develop fresh
material. ``Did you ever notice ...'' could be replaced by
something else. What, even he doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably take eight months to a year, I would say,
before I'm ready to do another concert ... depending how hard I
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange: I liked ``Seinfeld'' when a lot of people weren't
watching, and grew to detest it proportionally to its popularity.
The hype had a lot to do with it. And while many considered the
last episode (watched by more than 76 million on May 14) lame by
``Seinfeld'' standards, you had to respect him for avoiding the
cliched hankies-and-hugs route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticism is always fair,'' he said. ``What people forget is,
it's unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks. And ouch. After this concert series, Seinfeld plans to
kick back, work on the new routine, maybe even go into the creative
side of the advertising business. He definitely has the schtick to
sell. What he won't be doing is doing movies or another series.
Jerry is nothing if not smart: He knows he could never be that
lucky twice.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who would replace him on the cultural radar screen,
Seinfeld paused, then deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have bad news for you,'' he said. ``There will be no next
Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was only one Jerry. Now get out of here for a while
so we can miss you.

A HOLLOW PRESIDENT FOR HOLLOW TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A bronze angel towered over Chester Alan Arthur's
grave in Albany Rural Cemetery when I went to visit the other day.
Flags fluttered at the foot of the stone monument proclaiming this
the final resting place of a president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chester A. Arthur was a New York lawyer who served briefly in
the White House during the 1880s. His great misfortune was to
preside over the nation during good times.
</P>
<P>
   History gave him no wars to wage, no depressions to dispell. He
created Civil Service, but he authored no great documents on
democracy, freed no slaves, uttered no immortal words. He was just
there, at the helm, in calm seas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, you probably couldn't find one American in five who
knows his name today. Until just recently, that seemed Bill
Clinton's fate as well. Clinton is president at a time when
Americans are more concerned with their retirement accounts than
with governing themselves, when national civic life is weaker than
ever before in the century, when politicians seem less and less
relevant to more and more people.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed that Clinton would end up sharing the relative
obscurity of Arthur, Millard Fillmore, Benjamin Harrison, James
Buchanan and all those other presidents who left only faint
footprints on the path of history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we have this Zippergate thing. We have a president who's
likely, before he testifies before Ken Starr's grand jury, to go on
television and tell the American people that he lied to us about a
fling with a 21-year-old White House intern. And that he committed
perjury when asked about it under oath in a civil court case.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, that's probably what this extraordinarily gifted
man will be best remembered for _ the first line in his obituary
and in his encyclopedia entry.
</P>
<P>
   Is it reasonable at this point _ is it fair _ to conclude that
Clinton was fooling around with this woman? Oh, grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Is he likely to be driven from office because of that? Probably
not _ unless, that is, the lying and the perjury prove to be part
of a vastly larger pattern of criminal deceit and obstruction of
justice that has permeated his presidency. We can't judge that
until we see Starr's grand jury report.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, not even Clinton's most bitter enemies
really want impeachment. They would prefer him powerless and a
figure of raw ridicule during his last years in office _ and during
the elections of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The president probably won't lie again under oath _ not in a
criminal investigation and with the whole country watching closely.
The risks are too great. A deft, abject apology is much more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   What's most disturbing, though, is not that he gazed into the
cameras, wagged his finger at us and lied through his teeth. It's
that so many people figure that's OK. Completely decent, honest
people have known from the start that he was lying. But they've
been bribed by his generally moderate policies and by those lovely,
ever-fattening 401 (k) nest eggs. They've been played for suckers
and don't mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Chester A. Arthur was largely forgotten because history demanded
little of him. All it has demanded of Bill Clinton has been the
truth. He hasn't yet been able to manage that. He hasn't cared that
truthful leadership is vital in a democracy. And neither,
unfortunately, have most citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his talents, the first baby-boomer president _ a man of
my generation _ has proven to be a hollow, cynical leader for a
hollow, cynical time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why history probably won't be any kinder to us than it
will be to him.

ECONOMICS 101: THE LESSON BEGINS WITH BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY GALLES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Parenthood brings with it some inevitable
conflicts with children, a fact now particularly vivid to those
whose kids have been home from school for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you think nothing could get worse than your
end-of-the-summer cabin fever, things get worse. Yes, that's right.
It's time for back to school shopping, that annual pinnacle of
parent-child conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope that understanding will keep some stressed parents
from being pushed ``over the edge'' by the back to school shopping
crisis, consider its economics.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, economics reduces to the proposition that incentives
matter. Either larger benefits or lower costs associated with a
good causes decision-makers to want more of it, even when those
decision-makers are your children whose rationality you currently
question.
</P>
<P>
   This also means that whenever there are large differences in the
costs and/or benefits facing different parties who must jointly
decide on a purchase, disagreements will arise. But that is exactly
the situation in back-to-school shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Consider first who will pick up the tab. A parent paying the
bill for back-to-school clothes, supplies, etc., will weigh the
value they perceive in a good against its entire dollar cost. But
the children are paying none of the bill, so they will be weighing
the value they place on the good against the zero dollar price they
will pay (the relevant price they pay is the cost to them of
wheedling, whining, complaining, blackmailing or arguing their
parents into it, which raises the costs to the parents even more).
</P>
<P>
   Because there are lots of back-to-school things worth less than
their cost to parents but worth more than zero to children,
children want to spend more than their parents do. They want more,
higher quality, and ``cooler'' things, not to mention replacements
sooner. And parents trying to teach their child ``the value of a
dollar'' will have little luck convincing them otherwise, because
it is the parent's, not the child's, money on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a big difference between parents and children on
the benefit side. Parents regard clothing, shoes, backpacks, etc.,
largely for their utilitarian value. But children see those same
things through the lens of where they think those items will put
them in the school pecking order. The result is that parents, who
see many good alternatives to a particular purchase, often end up
fighting with children who, under the enhanced peer pressure of
returning to classes, insist there is no substitute for it, in a
conversation frequently punctuated with, ``You don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-school shopping crisis is often one of the year's
most strident confrontations because of the large gaps between the
values parents and children place on the items in question and the
larger-than-usual amount of money involved. But it does not signify
that your children have suddenly become more ``evil,'' on a
slippery slope to a horrendous future. Rather, it is different in
scale, but not in kind, from many other conflicts that arise out of
the different incentives facing parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   Why are young children more likely to misbehave in a grocery
store checkout line than at home? Because the benefits (candy, gum,
etc.) are higher and the costs are lower (They are less likely to
be punished in public). Why are older children so eager to find an
excuse to borrow Dad's car? Because they get the benefits of
mobility without the costs of paying for it (Do your kids ever put
gas in?).
</P>
<P>
   Why do kids always want to go out to eat, despite the fact that
it costs more? Because it's not their money. Why do they want you
to wash their favorite clothes almost daily? Because it's not their
time and effort. In contrast, why are they so resistant to doing
chores or cleaning their rooms or dishes after dinner? And why do
their parents want them to study more than they want to study?
Because it's their time and effort.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding that the back-to-school shopping crisis is just a
temporary, annual peak in parent-child conflicts will not make them
go away. But it can help parents think about ways to minimize such
conflicts (such as giving children a fixed budget for new clothes
in the fall, which means they are spending their own money, rather
than nagging you to spend yours). And it can help maintain parental
sanity and reduce their despair about what has happened to their
formerly ``good'' children.

`SAFE MEN' IS FULL OF GEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the many great things that the amusing ``Safe Men'' has
going for it is that it prominently features my new favorite young
actor, Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   He played the unpalatable network executive who harassed Howard
Stern in ``Private Parts,'' and he's been terrific in ``The
Negotiator'' and ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In ``Safe Men,'' he
plays Veal Chop, the hilarious chief henchperson of Big Fat Bernie
Gayle (Michael Lerner), a well known Jewish gangster in Providence,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Big Fat (whose son is known as Little Big Fat)
sends his less-than-completely competent sub-thug, Veal Chop (it
will give you a hint of this movie's humor to know that Veal Chop
is referred to as Big Fat's ``intern''), to find the best safe
crackers in Providence. But Chop blows the job and brings him what
turn out to be Providence's two worst, and possibly stupidest,
musicians, Eddie (Steve Zahn of ``That Thing You Do'' and
``Suburbia'') and Sam (Sam Rockwell of ``Lawn Dogs'' and ``Box of
Moonlight'').
</P>
<P>
   It's an honest mistake if you're incredibly dumb, which Veal
Chop defiantly is. The real safe crackers are no more impressive
than the dopey musicians. So, dragged to the home of Big Fat, when
Sam and Eddie realize that trying to explain they aren't safe men
will do no good, they give up. Big Fat has a job for them they
can't refuse. Either they become safe men or they die.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment is to crack three safes for Big Fat. The comedy
of errors continues as Sam and Eddie go after the first safe,
belonging to Leo (Harvey Fierstein), a well-to-do fence with a
daughter named Hannah (Christina Kirk) who goes for shady fellows.
When she happens on Sam and Eddie fooling with dad's safe, she
falls immediately for Sam, and politely escorts the burglars out
the door. Soon Hannah and Sam are dating.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is just about perfect. In addition to an inspired
performance by Giamatti, there are gems by Rockwell, Zahn and
Fierstein, and by Lerner, who was so memorable as the studio
executive in ``Barton Fink.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director John Hamburg has a gift for comedy. He also has
a gift for making even the goofiest people seem dignified. Unlike
so many movies that derive their humor from taking a superior
attitude to the characters and their stupidity, Hamburg is a
sympathizer. He never places himself above the people in his movie.
He seems to be right alongside them, rooting for them to triumph.

DESPITE THE CAST, `SNAKE EYES' IS A SLEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian De Palma is a big blustery filmmaker who likes to take his
audience by the lapels and shake it. That can be a good thing, as
when he sends us, via jazzy camera work, on a giddy, 360-degree
park ride.
</P>
<P>
   But it can also be a bad thing, as when he clunkily points the
camera up for unnecessary low angle shots and hangs it from the
ceiling for superfluous high angles, then moves it side to side too
quickly to focus, for no particular reason at all.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he wants to be viewed as an artist of the cinema,
someone with Martin Scorsese's visual grace, but the truth is that
De Palma is less a persuasive artist than he is a simple and vulgar
bully. And as far as I'm concerned, he wins. Based on ``Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' ``Carlito's Way'' and now ``Snake Eyes,'' I am
willing to never see another Brian De Palma movie.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of wonderful actors, Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise,
and work by a young actress named Carla Gugino, makes ``Snake
Eyes'' watchable, but the movie fails in purely directorial terms.
De Palma ruins a terrific premise by making the kind of elementary
mistake students make in Film 101. He starts at high frenzy. After
a bravura opening 10 minutes, the movie has no place to go but
haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Those opening minutes give us Rick Santoro (Cage), a swaggering
Atlantic City cop with a loud mouth and an iridescent suit. He
wears too much jewelry, he clicks his cigarette lighter a little
too loudly, and he is prone to express himself at the top of his
adrenalin-fueled voice, mostly out of sheer exuberance, but with an
uncontrollable anger bubbling just beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Cage is performing at a ``Leaving Las Vegas'' energy level here,
but as good as he is, you sense a strain. I had a feeling that De
Palma pushed him further than good directing called for. What we
get is a manic portrait of a cop who could never sustain such
behavior in life, and a movie that can not sustain such energy for
98 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is an Atlantic City casino where a heavyweight bout
is scheduled to take place. Fourteen thousand people will cram the
arena to watch the famed Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) fight. In the
minutes before the first round, Rick is strutting through the
stadium screaming his good feelings for all to hear like someone
suffering spasms.
</P>
<P>
   It's all just a show of high spirits, we're supposed to believe.
But when Rick wants to place a bet and the bookmaker demands a cash
outlay, Rick beats up a local perp and relieves him of several
thousand. The money he takes actually has blood on it. Talk about
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the setup. Rick is your average, friendly, out-of-his
mind homicide detective with a wife, kid and expensive girlfriend
on the side, and political aspirations. He's on the take and, it
seems, doesn't care who knows it. It seems a bit unlikely, but
cramming this kind of unlikeliness down our throats is what a bully
like De Palma loves to do.
</P>
<P>
   Rick's best buddy is Navy Cmdr. Kevin Dunn, heading a security
detail to protect the secretary of Defense, who is attending the
fight. When the secretary is killed by a sniper, Rick and Kevin
seal off the arena and try to figure out who did it.
</P>
<P>
   Like De Palma's much better movie, ``Blow Out,'' ``Snake Eyes''
is about unraveling a mystery, with ``Blow Out'' using sound
technology as a detection tool and ``Snake Eyes'' using video. But
the truth is that ``Snake Eyes'' reveals its secret so early in the
movie that all tension is drained from the action long before the
supposedly climactic moment arrives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plot convolutions, perhaps a close reading of the
script would make everything clear, but the explanations sounded
like a lot of mumbo jumbo from where I sat.
</P>
<P>
   Cliches abound. Rick's corrupt nature is meant to determine the
outcome of events, but of course, they merely provide an
opportunity for him to reform. The movie's coda is completely
ridiculous and, worse yet, boring.

   The hotel chambermaid stood at my door, my size 10 black German
leather sandals in her dainty right hand. I'd left them in the
workout room under the Cybex leg-extension machine _ something I'd
never do in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you! Where would I be without my shoes?'' I gushed,
fishing five francs out of my coat pocket. Giggling, she took the
coin and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That night it was out with friends to their favorite pretty
little bistro. Till the wee hours, we feasted on rillettes de
sardines, Coquille St-Jacques in garlic and scallion sauce,
peppered pear dessert, sparkling wine and espresso _ and oui! _
massive quantities of billowing cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, my raw throat felt like a tractor had rolled
through it on caterpillar treads. My vision was blurred; I was
alternately sweating and freezing. Was I really going to be sick
all day? I glanced out the window. There was a huge poster for a
French opera company showing a sylph whirling in a pink tutu, and
someone had defaced it by spray-painting the giant words coming out
of her mouth: ``Bill Clinton, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for energy, I devoured the contents of my minibar: nuts,
chips, Toblerone, salami, cheese, yogurt (for the live cultures), a
banana. Then I fetched my PruCarePlus HMO Out-of-Network Service
Card. ``... Designated user must call provider immediately in case
of emergency ... if hospitalization or surgery is recommended,
please call 1-800- ...'' Another wave of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily my friends were home by the phone. They told me that in
France there is an ``S.O.S.-doctor'' program for emergencies, ``a
really nice service you can't have in America because the doctors
are too afraid of being sued for malpractice.'' The physicians make
old-fashioned house calls, even to your hotel room, they said.
''Just ask the reception desk. Tell them you need a doctor. They'll
call one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, okay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, Madame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick. I need a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooo ...''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, more torture. I imagined my mother's voice, saw her
forefinger waggling in my face: A strange man coming to my hotel
room? Why, he might be anyone! Maybe he was going to do terrible
things to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom. Right, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later I heard a knock, unbolted the door and
there, undoubtedly sent from heaven or Central Casting, was Doctor
Emile Mallereau, Medecine Generale: about 6 foot 3, firm square
jaw, wide shoulders, blue-green eyes, high forehead, ruddy skin,
wavy hair _ and yes, even a small black bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you zee patient?'' _ he entered with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, yes ... yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold?'' he winced. (Indeed, I had dialed the thermostat up as
far as possible and heaped three extra plaid blankets on the bed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Im afraid so,'' I said, tugging at my bathrobe. ``Is it
uncomfortable in here?'' _ trying to be the gracious hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what ez zee problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You speak English?'' I asked, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course.'' (Read: ``You dope, we all speak English; so
few of you speak French.'')
</P>
<P>
   I proceeded to tell him I was an American journalist on a
European tour interviewing world leaders about NATO expansion and
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah! A journalieeeste!'' he arched his noble eyebrows. ``But
NATO ... zee European Union'' _ shaking his head, the brow
furrowing _ ``Vee will hate zees single currency, zees Euro. Zees
eez bad for France. And why did not your Congress accept the bid
from Romania to join NATO? You take Poland but not Romania! Ah, it
makes me ill!''
</P>
<P>
   We adjourned to the mattress near the bedstand, which was
cluttered with my bottles of vitamins, antacids, melatonin,
chromium piccolate, calcium-magnesium tablets, aspirin and
sugar-free mints.
</P>
<P>
   Now Docteur Mallereau pointed to my robe and grey Hanes
sweatshirt. I took the hint. Over my head went the duds and there I
sat. Unphased, he began to poke and pummel my neck and arms _ as I
breathed deeply, inhaling, exhaling, sticking out my tongue,
coughing, turning, flexing my elbow, dilating my eyeballs _ as
doctors make you do the world over. ``Yes, ahem, oh my ....'' he
mumbled, wielding the cold stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him about my asthma, my chemical sensitivities,
how when the office cleaning lady uses polishes and sprays, I'm
always sure she's testing chemical weapons for a Third World army.
I wanted to tell him that perfume makes my face swell like a plum
and my mother chain-smoked and my brothers and I now can smell a
lit cigarette a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't say any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Madame Journaliste, what do you think of zees Monica
Lewinskee affair? You Americans are so ztrange, you want to
assassinate a good president. You do not want him to be human? Zees
ez very bad for the rest of zee world. Prime Minister Mitterrand
had a daughter and a wife and a mistress and we French were very
sophisticated about zat. But you are so funny about sex. I think we
French are with money as you are with sex!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, er ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus all zees noise about Saddam Hussein and zee weapons of
mass destruction. Zees winter Mees Madeleine Albright coming to
Paris for zee dialogue with Monsieur Vedrine _ no? Zey go to zee
Foreign Ministry with cupids on zee moldings and crystal
chandeliers and French flags. Very beautiful. But eet eez clear
this is but a distraction from zee president's problems!''
</P>
<P>
   I managed to splutter, ``We reelected him knowing he had, er,
fidelity issues. But he was supposed to BEHAVE. Not do it with an
INTERN, for Pete's sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah ... I see. Well, in any case, you have a bad bronchitis and
an influenza and a fever. You must stay in zees bed and watch your
TV,'' he motioned to the screen. Sound mute, it was on CNN
International.
</P>
<P>
   His prescriptions were for two bottles of effervescent aspirin,
a throat spray with a huge nozzle on top, cough syrup (the kind
that's so thick it warms your whole body after one swig) _ and 10
days' worth of 1,000mg packets of a strange orange-granulated brand
of erythromycin that looks like Tang. (You're supposed to mix it
with water and drink the fizz, but I found it tastier to eat dry
with a teaspoon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And so you live in Manhattan?'' he was asking, as I handed
back his emergency-call forms filled in with my vital data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you would know of a cheap apartment available for a
month in zee summer with a view of Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap? Across from Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here eez a business card'' _ he reached in his pocket. ``You

</P>
<P>
   ``Oui! Merci!''

IN EUROPE, CLINTON IS AN ICON _ BUT NOT IF STOCK MARKET CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Just as Ronald Reagan was a hero to conservatives
everywhere, Bill Clinton has become an icon for left-of-center
politicians in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's personal woes, political leaders over
here have not hesitated to attach themselves to his banner,
endorsing the Clinton administration's brand of market economics
and social enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   France's Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who heads Europe's most
dogmatic socialist party, came close to declaring himself a Clinton
disciple a few weeks ago. He acknowledged that the French could
learn a lot from Clinton's flexible policies which, he said, had
brought America unmatched prosperity. No French leader had ever
gone that far in praising any U.S. leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, the German Social Democrats' candidate to
replace conservative Helmut Kohl as chancellor in elections next
month, declared this week in Washington that he would copy many
Clintonian policies if elected in order to stimulate his country's
spotty economy and bring down high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   For a German politician to confess that in the realm of
economics Germany has much to learn from anyone else is something
of a first.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's left-of-center Prime Minister Romano Prodi is also a
frank admirer of Clinton's record. And British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who heads a Labor Party government, is a charter member of
the president's fan club abroad. His desire to emulate Clinton is
so open that it embarrasses some of his more left-leaning
government colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to some analysts, all this Clinton mania may not
be as much a tribute to his statesman-like qualities as it is
simply to the fact that, up to now, he has been a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Reagan, these analysts insist, Clinton doesn't arouse
respect for his political integrity or genuine personal affection.
He is applauded mainly for his political savvy and the good times
he has presided over.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politicians want to discover the secret of success of
other politicians,'' analyst Georges Suffert observed in the Paris
daily Le Figaro. ``Clinton has been the most successful politician
of our times. There is nothing surprising about the admiration he
has attracted from his peers. They have decided that if it works
for him, it will work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's foreign bandwagon could quickly detach itself from
him if he runs into serious difficulties at home, Suffert warned.
The danger isn't the Monica Lewinsky affair but a sudden reversal
of U.S. economic fortunes sparked by a severe fall on Wall Street,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (European) politicians who laud him are not concerned
about Clinton's personal problems, which they think he will survive
in any case,'' he added. ``But they will swiftly distance
themselves from him if America's economy turns sour. They won't
wish to be regarded as Clintonians then.''

   The following op-ed-length articles from the July/August '98

   &UR; ARE U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Morihiro Hosokawa &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.

   &UR; PREVENTING WAR in the TAIWAN STRAIT &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Taiwan seems convinced it can campaign for
independence with the military backing of the United States. If war
is to be prevented, Washington must convince Taipei as well as
Beijing that it is time for them to work out a mutually acceptable
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chas. W. Freeman, Jr., is co-chair of the United States-China
Policy Foundation. A former diplomat, he served as deputy chief of

</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less
acute than the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World
War II. Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million.
</P>

   &UR; WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S STAUNCH SUPPORTERS? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Ehud Sprinzak &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) Benjamin Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great
paradox of Israeli politics today. Despite diplomatic blunders and

   (1,450 words) As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism,
Yasir Arafat's personal influence and political wiles have let him

Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.

   (1500 words) Horrifying reports of violence in Algeria are
seldom fleshed out with any firm explanation of motives and

an international investigation to uncover the truth about the new

   (5,000 words) The Kyoto pact on global warming is neither a

<P>
   (5,000 words) The symbol of the Chinese Communist Party's
economic policies has been an unbreakable iron rice bowl, standing

workers _ afloat, China is teetering between economic reform and

   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.

   (1,400 words) Taiwan seems convinced it can campaign for

`BILLY' OFFERS QUIRKY SCREEN ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN TEST 
Written and directed by: Tommy O' Haver 
Starring: Sean P. Hayes, Brad Rowe, Richard Ganoung, Meredith Scott
Lynn, Paul Bartel 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated R (adult situations) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies always make love look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Two sets of eyes meet across a crowded room, and hearts forever
interlock. Couples meet cute in car accidents, exchanging insurance
information and telephone numbers. Between the opening and closing
credits, true romance, no matter how absurd and haphazard, always
finds a way to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who has ever been a soldier in the love wars
knows nothing about affairs of the heart is ever easy _ and that's
what makes Tommy O'Haver's ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' such a
refreshing and smart romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Billy of the title is a young photographer (an ingratiating
Sean P. Hayes) looking for personal and professional stability in
LA. Billy occasionally fools around with hunky Fernando (Armando
Valdes-Kennedy), but Fernando is in a relationship, and Billy's
looking for something _ and someone _ more meaningful. At a local
coffee shop, he first sees Gabriel (the impossibly handsome Brad
Rowe), who has both the name and the face of an angel.
</P>
<P>
   The two immediately click, and Billy invites Gabriel to become a
model for his pet project _ gay recreations of great Hollywood love
scenes such as the famous sand-and-crashing-waves kiss between Burt
Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in ``From Here to Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy is infatuated to the point of obsession with Gabriel, but
there's one small problem: He's not sure whether Gabriel is gay. He
claims to have a girlfriend back in San Francisco, but how then
does one explain Gabriel's love of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy hashes out his dilemma with his galpal, George, (Meredith
Scott Lynn), and Perry (Richard Ganoung), both of whom know that
Gabriel, with his easy but genuine charm and good looks, really
isn't good enough for Billy.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is perfect, from Hayes's sweet, lovelorn Billy, to Lynn
as his best girlfriend with more than a few of her own romantic
problems, such as the stoner (a hilarious Carmine Giovinazzo) who
tries to win her heart. Paul Bartel has a couple of slyly funny
scenes as a photographer as famous for his lasciviousness as his
artwork. Rowe makes for an ideal object of affection and creates a
real character from what could have been nothing more than a Colt
magazine pin-up. Rowe looks so much like Brad Pitt that Pitt
practically could sue for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' never compromises its gay
sensibility _ a trio of drag queens serve as a Greek chorus
throughout the film _ but its astute observations on the unruly
laws of love and attraction are questionably universal. At the
beginning of the film, a card flashes by with the words ``A Tommy
O'Haver Trifle,'' but his debut film is anything but. It's quirky
and funny, but also succeeds as a knowing take on modern romance.

LILITH'S FAIR LADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There is one constant to Lilith Fair _ and her name is Sarah
McLachlan. As the founder and queen of Lilith, she is the only
artist who will perform at all 57 shows this summer. The rest of
the women come and go in a rotating cast, but McLachlan stays and
sets the tone. She jams with many of the acts, she fends off any
media criticism, and she presents charity checks at the daily press
conference. She does everything, it seems, but fix the toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tour director that worries about that,'' she says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is more of a social one,'' adds McLachlan. ``I'm
singing with people, meeting with people, hanging out. It's a lot
of work, but I've got one of the easier jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lilith tour was hailed as last year's surprisingly hot event
_ and it's done even better this year, expanding to two dates in
many markets. ``The lineup is way stronger this year,'' McLachlan,
30, says with a mixture of pride and authority from a recent tour
stop in Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bill includes McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Emmylou
Harris, Lauryn Hill (of the Fugees), Luscious Jackson, Abra Moore,
Syd Straw, and Boston representatives Melissa Ferrick and Laurie
Geltman. (Other tour stops have featured Bonnie Raitt, Indigo
Girls, Erkykah Badu, and Paula Cole.)
</P>
<P>
   At every Lilith date, there are 11 acts in all, spread over
three stages. ``There's a village stage, a B stage, and a main
stage. The village stage is predominantly acoustic and local
performers,'' says McLachlan, a Canadian who now lives in Vancouver
.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, there's been more of an edge to the Lilith lineups
this year; witness a rise in progressive rock acts and rappers
(Queen Latifah and Missy Elliott have been on some bills). All of
which has made this a more expansive festival, versus the
singer-songwriter slant of last year's debut tour. But don't assume
the change comes from any radical philosophical shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to believe it, but we asked all the same people
last year, but many of them didn't know who we were. It's a lot
easier getting artists after we had a successful year,'' says
McLachlan. ``People are coming to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's tour also will double the proceeds to charity causes
_ many of them women's shelters and various outreach programs.
``We'll hopefully give away $1.4 million,'' says McLachlan. ``One
of the fun parts of my day is giving the local charities the check.
It might be like $17,000 from that day. It's a good chunk of money.
A woman Wednesday started bawling. She was saying, `This is my
salary for the year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Lilith grossed $16.4 million, according to Pollstar
magazine, making it more lucrative than the established H.O.R.D.E.
and Lollapalooza festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McLachlan found herself defending the all-female premise
of the tour _ something that she's had to do less of this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is a little easier to deal with, because Lilith is
not so new any more. I mean, I had to justify it every bloody step
of the way last time. I got beaten down by the `why isn't it more
like this?' and `why isn't it more like that?' questions. I just
felt like saying, `Why don't you (expletive) try and do it
yourself. Good luck, it's a lot of work. Hey, we did the best we
could. Like I said, we really tried to get tons of different kinds
of musicians, but we got who we could.''
</P>
<P>
   And forget about published reports that say Lilith may add male
acts to the mix. ``That was was one of those early moments of
weakness from being beaten down by the media,'' says McLachlan. ``I
thought, God, maybe I should make this more equal. ... But no,
definitely not. Lilith is what it is. It's a beautiful thing, so
why change it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're going to do it for three years and then we're
not going to do it anymore,'' she adds. ``We're going to stop and
we're going to reassess things. I don't know what we'll do. We
don't have anything planned at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   She has said that she doesn't want Lilith to be
institutionalized like other summer festivals. She's keeping that
promise so far, but isn't certain of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given it a thought yet,'' she says. ``I can't think
of what I'm doing next week, let alone two years from now. I know I
want to have kids _ and I'm not going to come out on the road when
I have kids.'' (McLachlan is married to her drummer, Ashwin Sood.)
</P>
<P>
   For next year, she plans to cut back from 57 shows to 37, same
as the inaugural summer. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``For sanity,'' she says. ``It's just too much. People last year
at 37 shows were almost at the end of their rope. We're there now
and have got a month left to go. We have 160 people out here who
are working 14-hour days in sometimes 100-plus- degree heat. You
can only push them so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is still high and everybody is having a good time,''
she says, ``but there's so much to deal with every day. And there's
a lot of people working seven months beforehand to organize the
whole thing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial reports that Lilith would also travel to Europe,
it now looks as if it will be a strictly American experience. ``We
don't have any expertise in Europe,'' says McLachlan. ``We couldn't
get any headliners. I'm not a headliner there. I don't have any
following whatsoever, so that's a very different world.''
</P>
<P>
   This season's Lilith will end Aug. 31. McLachan has plans this
fall to mix a live album of her own and to work on another Lilith
Fair compilation. (Last year's initial release grossed $4 million.)
</P>
<P>
   But first, McLachlan has other ideas. ``I'm going to go home and
fix our house and relax,'' she says.

`GOVERNESS' GIVES DRIVER A LOT OF LICENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GOVERNESS 
Written and directed by: Sandra Goldbacher 
Starring: Minnie Driver, Tom Wilkinson, Harriet Walter, Florence
Hoath, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Arlene Cockburn, Bruce Myers 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality and nudity) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra Goldbacher's ``The Governess'' plunges Minnie Driver into
a richly textured lode of Victoriana. But it's a vehicle that
doesn't quite drive her far enough. It's a bit too diffuse for that
as it develops promising avenues, then abandons them to keep
darting off in new directions. But if it has the messiness of a
Victorian novel hastily and episodically written in serial form to
appear in newspapers, it also taps a few sufficiently intriguing
veins of eccentricity and perversity while enabling Driver to keep
us watching a character who never is quite captured as completely
as we wish she had been.
</P>
<P>
   As Rosina Da Silva, Driver is a young Jewish woman who might as
well be living on a different planet than merely in London's East
End in her segregated community, rendered in warm, rich earth tones
that half suggest a subterranean life. Then, when her merchant
father dies, she finds herself all but living on another planet.
Realizing she can't get a job worth having in gentile London if
she's recognized as a Jew, and not wanting to marry from
expediency, she reinvents herself as a WASP. Assuming the name of
Mary Blackchurch, she takes a job as a governess for a rich family
on a misty Scottish island.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes bleak, sometimes hazy atmosphere of her new
location is a metaphor for that family's dysfunction and isolation.
Rosina/Mary, assigned to look after a brat bored into horrible
misbehavior, tames the little girl readily enough, then expands her
scope by developing an interest in the scientific research of the
lord of the manor, played by Tom Wilkinson. His wife, played with
wry bite by Harriet Walter, is corroding from within and Wilkinson
contributes to the overall dreariness by dropping out and holing up
in his lab, where he dabbles in the infant science of photography.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how to capture the image, but doesn't know how to keep
it from fading away almost instantly. Yielding to the cliche of the
exotic and intellectual Jewess, the film has Driver's governess
promptly show the befuddled aristocrat how to develop the pictures
and add salt to the emulsifying solution to make them last. From
there, it's a short step to her doubling as his lab assistant, and
an even shorter one to embarking on a love affair with him. In no
time, he's exchanging cliches furiously, moving from ``Jane Eyre''
to ``Salome,'' tormenting himself with guilt over the few moments
of sensual pleasure he shares with Rosina, needing psychologically
to cast her as the sex-crazed, hysterical Jewess he fears is about
to consume him.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina likes sex better than her employer and is more prepared
to accept its consequences. But the mix is complicated by the
expulsion from Oxford of the family's tubercular young opium-addict
son, who predictably falls for the governess, too. As she becomes
too much for the emotionally stormy but repressed family to handle,
things move toward a melodramatic climax. As a director, Goldbacher
drenches the film in lush, heavily symbolic imagery _ including the
ones involving the capturing and fixing of an image. As a writer,
she's scattershot, losing sight of the ethnic themes for a less
fully realized playing out of warped sexuality than ``Angels and
Insects'' gave us. The ending, while logically acceptable, is
anticlimactic. Still, the sheer intelligence and independence of
spirit in Driver's busy eyes almost carry ``The Governess'' past
its structural limitations.

AMOS HOSTETTER IS SET FOR HIS NEXT CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amos Hostetter is the man to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the end of a one-year noncompete agreement
Hostetter signed when he quit MediaOne Group in a furor over the
Colorado-based Baby Bell's decision to move Hostetter's Continental
Cablevision operation from Boston to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Hostetter is an icon in the cable television industry. He
was a pioneer in the business when he and a fraternity brother
fresh out of Amherst College took a chance on an upstart technology
and launched Continental with two Ohio cable systems in 1963. Over
the next 30 years, he built Continental into the third-largest
cable operator in the country, with more than 4 million
subscribers, before selling it to US West (now MediaOne) for $11.8
billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The question now: What's his next move?
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of potential deals crossing his desk
as he has worked this past year in his nearly deserted offices at
Pilot House on the Boston waterfront's Lewis Wharf. And the cable
industry has &UR;  &LR; been atwitter for months that Hostetter and his
former top lieutenants might avail themselves of that most Boston
of satisfactions _ revenge! _ by launching a hostile takeover bid
against the MediaOne executives who they say flat out lied to them.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little doubt that Hostetter would enjoy having
MediaOne chief executive Charles Lillis spend the next year
nervously looking over his shoulder, he is quick to throw cold
water on this kind of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said Hostetter, looking tanned and
relaxed after returning from Nantucket with two of his three young
children Thursday morning. ``Revenge is a pretty negative feeling,
and I don't want to be consumed by that for the next few years of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is just as quick to add: ``I really believe in business,
you get back a fair measure of what you give. I think the way the
current management is doing business will ultimately bring its own
demise without any help from me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between Hostetter and Lillis.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter sold his company because he thought US West had the
kind of deep pockets that it would take to make the company a
player in the consolidating world of cable. The deal created 80
millionaires at Continental Cablevision, but it also created a deep
well of bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   US West had said it was buying the business, in no small
measure, to get Continental's management, considered one of the
deepest in the industry. Lillis had made ``an unqualified
commitment'' to leave Hostetter and his operation in Boston. By
last summer he had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter went to Denver to argue his case to the board. He got
nowhere, and angrily quit. About 15 of 160 people in Boston went to
Denver, and less than 10 are left today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cross-eyed I was so angry,'' Hostetter said. ``I was
totally duped, used.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter says he felt so betrayed because he had recruited a
number of executives to Boston for the planned expansion under US
West, and these people had bought houses and put their children in
schools only to be told to uproot them and move to Denver on a few
week's notice. In addition, he says, he spent 2 1/2 years on the
permitting process with the city to more than double the size of
Pilot House, only to be told by US West ``to shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No chance,'' he told Lillis. Instead, he bought Pilot House
back from US West and finished it himself. It now stands nearly
completed and empty _ ready for whatever Hostetter has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter says he is looking across the communications field
into ``possibly cable but not necessarily.'' He ticks off
broadcast, Internet services, and telephony; he says he would not
rule out a start-up, but makes it clear he is more interested in
buying an established business he can grow rather than starting
from scratch again.
</P>
<P>
   If he has a timetable, he is not saying. But whatever way he
goes, he will have no shortage of resources and connections to make
it happen.
</P>
<P>
   He remains, after all, the largest single shareholder in
MediaOne, where his 8.5 percent stake is worth about $2.5 billion.
And there is little doubt that the financial backers who bankrolled
Continental will be ready to step up again when he is ready.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has a management-team-in-waiting that is
considered one of the savviest in the business. A dozen or so of
them continue to work out of Pilot House on various consulting
projects, including former president Tim Neher; Bill Schleyer,
another former president; general counsel Robert Sachs; and Rob
Stengel, former head of programming. Their own noncompete &UR;  &LR; deals
are scheduled to expire this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter does not mince words about what he thinks is going on
at MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has more than doubled since the acquisition of
Continental Cablevision was announced, but that rise has still
lagged its peers in a hot industry, he says. Lillis is running it
like a telephone company, not a media company, with too much
bureaucracy, too many people, and private jets for the bosses,
Hostetter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They replaced 160 people in Boston with 1,200 in Denver. It's
frightening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he wanted to do a major cable takeover, this would be the
company, he says. Management owns little stock, and MediaOne does
not have the kind of dual-class of stock that makes a takeover
difficult at other cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making a run at this company, but it would not
surprise me at all if someone does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We called Lillis for his side of the story; he did not call us
back.

<P>
   It's not so bad being an insurance executive.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Benson, now the chief executive of New England
Financial, made a whopping $11.6 million in 1997, his last year as
president of Equitable Life Assurance Society, according to the
annual compensation rankings by the Insurance Forum, a newsletter.
That huge payday includes Benson's deferred compensation package,
stock options, and severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien, chief executive of Allmerica Financial in
Worcester, Mass., made $3.6 million last year. Massachusetts
Mutual's boss, Thomas Wheeler, made $3.5 million; John Hancock CEO
Stephen Brown made $3 million; and Liberty Mutual's Gary Countryman
got $2 million.

TITANIC'S TULLOCH: HOW LOW WILL HE GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My old friend George (``I am not a huckster'') Tulloch _ old
friend meaning someone I've crossed swords with in the past _ is up
to his tricks again.
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch has taken on a patina of legitimacy of late, and hates
being reminded of previous goofball schemes, like his involvement
with the 1987 television show ``Titanic ... Live,'' hosted by Telly
Savalas. In that little episode, Savalas opened what was purported
to be the Titanic's purser's safe, which Tulloch's pals had hauled
up from the briny deep. Did you already guess that the safe
contained nothing of value?
</P>
<P>
   It was just two years ago that Tulloch was hawking lumps of
Titanic coal for $25 a shot, and then invited a boatful of suckers,
at a cost of up to $6,000 per person, to come watch him raise an
11-ton portion of the Titanic hull from the ocean bottom. That
effort crapped out, leaving Tulloch ``overcome with grief,''
according to a spokesman. Tulloch stopped grieving long enough to
open up yet another Titan-exploitation event, the artifact
exhibition under way at the World Trade Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But now George is preparing to cross an ethical line that no one
has breached. When Robert Ballard of the Wood's Hole Oceanographic
Institution discovered Titanic's hull in 1985, he observed the
maritime version of the famous Sierra Club vow: He took only
pictures, and he left only bow wakes. Ballard viewed the ship as a
graveyard, and promised not to disturb the site. Tulloch, who has
collected hundreds of artifacts from the debris field surrounding
the hull, has also vowed not to disturb the ship proper. ``He made
that promise to our faces,'' says James Delgado, director of
Vancouver's Maritime Musuem.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Tulloch promises _ that he would never break up the
exhibit, that he would build a Titanic museum _ this vow is soon to
be history. Tulloch is now in the North Atlantic, bobbing over the
Titanic site. His primary aim is to raise that chunk of the hull
that slipped his grasp two summers ago. But he has also promised
the Marconi family that he will bring back the famous radio that
broadcast the ship's ill-fated SOS. (If recovered, the radio would
be loaned to the Guglielmo Marconi Foundation and Museum of
Bedford, N.H.) ``It's hanging by a wire and the family has asked us
to recover it,'' Tulloch told me via radiophone, hinting darkly
that rival Russian divers also covet the transmitter. ``We're going
to attempt to get it because it's a pretty important piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch's numerous critics say his divers have already monkeyed
with the wreck. For instance, they pried the masthead light from
the exterior of the wreck. And it would appear that yet another
Tulloch promise is about to be deep-sixed. A promotional letter
from Titanic Exhibitions Pty Ltd. mailed to potential sponsors of
an artifacts exhibit in Australia mentions ``The Auction: At the
completion of the exhibitions, most artifacts will be auctioned in
either Los Angeles, Sydney, London, or New York, in what promises
to be one of the most exciting auctions of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that Tulloch also vowed never to sell off Titanic
curios? Tulloch said he has been contacted by promoters in
Australia, but knows nothing of any auction. ``You're the first
person to tell me about this,'' he said, adding,``You come up with
the darnedest things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Just Filler
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what a selling review is? It's a book or music
review that virtually forces you to go out and buy the work in
question. I once read a selling review of Alex Garland's novel,
``The Beach,'' in Salon magazine. I went out and bought the book.
It was good, but not $25 worth of good. I asked Salon's editors for
my money back. I received two politely worded e-mail kiss-offs, but
no money.
</P>
<P>
   More recently I read another selling review, this one by Nat
Hentoff in the Wall Street Journal. It was for a two-CD set, ``Live
at the Sticky Wicket'' a 1986 concert recording in Hopkinton, Mass.
by the great jazz pianist Dick Wellstood. These CDs are plumb
terrific, and available from Arbors Records (800-299-1930). If you
don't enjoy them you're a fool _ but I'm not giving you your money
back.

SKEWED, TWISTED ROOF MAY NEED REBUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am redoing my roof that is only 10 years old. A friend told
me the roof looks as if it is twisting and is skewed a little. It
is a raised ranch, and a quarter of the space below has a cathedral
ceiling. Can I straighten it out?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE O'DONNELL, Attleboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ranch houses usually have shallow roofs, which means that the
rafters are flatter than in a steeper roof, are taking more strain,
and could move under that strain. There might also not be collar
beams in the attic connecting the rafters (the rafters form an
upside down ``V'' and the collar beams turn that upside down ``V''
into a ``A.'' Collar beams are designed to keep the rafters from
spreading. Also, the cathedral ceiling section, without collar
beams, may be contributing to the movement of the rafters. The
movement of the rafters may be causing the ridge board to go out of
level.
</P>
<P>
   To correct it, I think the whole roof should be rebuilt. There
could be some adjustments to keep it from skewing any further.
</P>
<P>
   Your next step is to consult an architect or an engineer to tell
you what happened and what has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house was stained with a yellow stain that lasted 12
years. Recently I had a gray latex solid stain applied over the
yellow, and now I am getting cedar bleed, those brown stains on the
gray finish. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   BOB FITZGERALD, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Hmm, it seems strange that no cedar bleed showed through the
yellow but did through the gray. You should be able to wash off the
brown stains with detergent and water, and gentle pressure-washing,
but be careful that the pressure-washing doesn't knock off the
gray.
</P>
<P>
   A more permanent cure, and somwhat iffy, is to sand the finish
thoroughly, apply an oil-based primer that will stop the cedar
bleed, and apply two coats of the gray stain.
</P>
<P>
   I say iffy because while most paint companies make a primer
designed specifically to stop that cedar bleed, the primer is a
paint, and therefore can peel. That is a chance you have to take,
unless you strip to the bare wood and apply a semitransparent stain
of a color dark enough not to show cedar bleed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The cherry cabinets in my kitchen are 25 years old and they
look OK, but they are sticky. How can I get rid of that stickiness?
</P>
<P>
   CALLER, from Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Stickiness sometimes happens on old finishes, and no one that
I know of has a real answer. The handyman would like to know if
anyone has an answer, and how to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiness might be worse in humid weather, but it might not
go completely away in winter with the heat on. So, wash the
cabinets with paint thinner; put it on liberally, let it sit there
a few sconds, then wipe, and dry with a dry cloth. If that doesn't
work, try alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is to wipe the cabinets with talcum powder, as
little as possible so it won't show but enough to take the curse
off the stickiness.
</P>
<P>
   If any of those treatments fails, it means the cabinets might
require refinishing. Or, sand the cabinets lightly but not enough
to take off the stain, and apply one coat of an oil-based
polyurethane varnish. Before you refinish, wipe rubbing alcohol on
the finish; if it softens the finish, it is shellac, and sticky
shellac must be refinished. If the alcohol does not soften the
finish, it is varnish or lacquer, which can be sanded and varnished
as described above.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My nephew is shingling my walls with red cedar shingles. You
mentioned once not to use power nailing on a roof, but to hand
nail. Does this apply to wood siding shingles?
</P>
<P>
   MARY PEN, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. You can use power nailing on siding shingles, but make
sure the nailer is used correctly; that is, the nails are driven
straight, not at an angle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My boiler leaked rusty water on the concrete basement floor.
The leak has been fixed; how can I clean the rust spots on the
floor?
</P>
<P>
   BILL WEEMS, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Mix 4 ounces oxalic acid in a quart of hot water. Apply this
to the spots and let dry. Oxalic acid is a crystaline bleach sold
in hardware and building stores. When it dries, the crystals may
reappear; sweep them up and throw them away; the rust stains should
be gone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some power steering fluid spilled on my driveway, and not
only stained it, but softened it and deteriorated some of the
asphalt. How can I stop that deterioration? The fluid is oily.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY POWELL, Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the fluid is still liquidy, sprinkle an absorbant clay
such as Speedy Dry or cat litter, even baking soda on the spot,
letting it mound up an inch. Leave it for an hour, then sweep it up
and throw it away. If it is not liquidy, apply paint thinner and
then put on the absorbant material. Repeat as necessary. If the
deterioration is not too deep, you can then seal the surfce
(probably the whole driveway) with a driveway sealer. If that
doesn't work, you may have to cut out that section of asphalt and
put in a cold patch of new asphalt.

CANDIDATE MIKE DUFFY: YOUNG, AMBITIOUS, CATHOLIC, AND GAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Duffy is smart, articulate, ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   He has considerable political experience for a 34-year-old. He
has an Irish name in a state where that never hurts a candidate. He
is a practicing Catholic, which hasn't hurt a candidate hereabouts
since the first half of this century.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a Republican, which has not been an advantage in
Massachusetts since Jack Kennedy was a pup. Duffy has set himself
the sizeable challenge of toppling a popular, long-term, low-key
and affable constitutional officer, state auditor Joe DeNucci, the
Democrat in a bottom-of-the-statewide-ballot slot that has not gone
Republican in living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy is also gay, an upfront, noncloseted,
here-I-am-it's-no-big-deal homosexual, in a state which has in two
different instances re-elected congressmen initially elected by
voters unaware of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the first credible statewide candidate of a major
party to run as an acknowledged gay, Duffy thinks that will neither
help nor harm his candidacy, which is an interesting take on the
public mood hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there'll be as many people who'll vote for me because
I'm gay as will vote against me because I'm gay _ basically a
wash,'' Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bigger handicap is that I'm running as a Republican. When I
meet people, I say, ``I'm a Bill Weld Republican, and not a Jesse
Helms Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy's goal is to become ``the first openly gay elected
statewide official.'' He blithely puts his chances at 50-50, though
wise heads would give him the short end of odds in the 3-1, 4-1,
5-1 range. Off a recent conversation, I get the impression Duffy
has three reasons for running for auditor:
</P>
<P>
   _He thinks he can do a good job. Having been former Governor
Weld's choice for two terms as chairman of the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination, and then director of consumer
affairs, Duffy got experience, exposure, and enough media attention
to fuel his ambition. He knows which end of the microphone is
which, and he pulled off several minor publicity coups in his Weld
administration service.
</P>
<P>
   _He wants to break a trail for other gay candidates to run with
less attention paid to their sexuality. ``I think I'd be great at
the job, but that has nothing to do with sexual orientation. I have
the desire to achieve. I'm conscious of the extent to which I'm a
role model, because there are so few prominent outwardly gay
people.'' Which leads to reason No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   _``I'd like to reclaim the Republican Party nationally from the
extremists who have taken it over.'' In Masachusetts, during the
Weld era, gays were ushered into state appointive posts after
Weld's eyelash-thin first election was strongly supported by gay
activists and contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a striking difference between my experience at the
Republican state convention here, and some of the noises coming out
of Washington ... as the rhetoric gets increasingly intolerant, it
is important to give a human face to the debate, a real live
person, who can talk about what it is to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the recent 214-212 vote in the US House that
restricted the use of some federal housing money in San Francisco,
as an example of the way conservative elements in politics
counter-attack against gay-supported causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the extreme antigay rhetoric coming out of Washington
is a concerted effort by the extreme right within the Republican
Party to try to score some political points. As to the short term,
maybe that works. But long term, it's like George Wallace standing
in the schoolhouse door.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy is optimistic. ``The culture is moving to the point of
accepting gays and lesbians. I don't think extremists can hold back
that tide. It's like the South in the '60s. Opposing those kinds of
(civil rights) things, in the long term, leaves you nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy acknowledges that some gay activists can be their own
cause's worst enemy. He discussed the notorious episode in Boston
where some gay demonstrators tried to disrupt the ordination of
seven Cathloic priests at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a practicing Catholic. Some of the things done by extreme
elements in the gay community are deeply offensive to me, not only
the throwing of condoms at priests being ordained, but in upsetting
a sacred function. There is no political agenda that justifies
those kinds of political intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy grew up outside of Fort Lauderdale, and went to school at
Trinity College in Hartford and the Kennedy School at Harvard. He
has been a Republican since age 18, he said, and worked for US
Representative Chris Shays of Connecticut, who has spearheaded
campaign finance reform among House Republicans. Duffy joined the
Weld campaign in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's never even met DeNucci, but enjoys the campaign
grind. ``The reaction from folks has been terrific. People really
like it when you extend yourself. It's as basic as Tip O'Neill
said: `People like to be asked.'''

CHAPLIN'S TRAMP IS FIT FOR THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few decades of downslide, Charlie Chaplin's reputation
is on the upswing again. Chaplin's way of mixing pathos with his
comedy worked against him in a post-modern age more attuned to the
deadpan existentialism of Buster Keaton. But as the Museum of Fine
Arts' admirable Chaplin retro is reminding us, the world of
Chaplin's comedy found ample room for life's matter-of-fact
brutality, which the Little Tramp negotiated with delicacy and
unsinkable optimism. Chaplin wasn't the first bowler-hatted
baggy-pants tramp comedian. But he was the one who turned the
archetype into a scrappy yet balletic figure, at home in his own
solitariness, with whom millions identified.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA's Chaplin series concludes with a handful of
lesser-known Chaplin films that fascinatingly show the Chaplin
persona being formed and perfected. The weekend's most notable
offering is ``The Circus'' (1928), the final shot of which depicts
perhaps the most quintessential image in the entire Chaplin oeuvre,
the one that turned Chaplin into his own logo. It shows Chaplin
walking away from us, having just shrugged gamely at losing the
love of the circus owner's daughter to a high-wire walker. Chipper
as ever, he toddles off toward the horizon, ready for the next hand
life deals him, as the camera irises shut.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that by ``The Circus,'' Chaplin had added the
last piece of the tramp persona _ the little bamboo cane, a prop
the importance of which Chaplin never underestimated. Its
resilience symbolized his, it gave him something to do with his
hands, and it reinforced his gentlemanliness, suggesting as
strongly as the frequent tipping of the hat that he had known
better days. The film also contains some of the funniest business
Chaplin ever choreographed for himself. Chased into the big tent by
cops, he brings the house down with his desperate and unknowingly
funny attempts to elude them.
</P>
<P>
   He's hired as a prop man by the brutal circus owner, who
routinely beats his daughter and tells his employees to never let
the tramp know that he's the star of the show lest he demand more
money. The consternation that makes him a star peaks when he finds
himself subbing for the tightrope walker. Was there ever a more
perfect physical expression of the precariousness built into the
Little Tramp's life? Here Chaplin's painstaking way of building his
sight gags reaches its apotheosis when, barely convinced he's got
tightrope-walking mastered, monkeys scamper onto the rope to keep
him company _ to his terror and the audience's glee.
</P>
<P>
   There's more comedy than pathos in ``The Circus,'' which is what
keeps it delicious. It's preceded by ``A Day's Pleasure'' (1919),
the shortest film in the series at 20 minutes, in which a pre-tramp
Chaplin plays a paterfamilias who goes through a lot to take his
family on an outing. He has trouble cranking up the car, barely
makes the steamship excursion with family in tow, dodges a beating
by a bully, then turns on him and kicks him ferociously when the
bully gets seasick, and finally must cope with being mired in tar
with two irate traffic cops. Note that one of his sons is played by
Jackie Coogan, who was to become an international star when Chaplin
filmed ``The Kid'' a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin was fearless about acting with children and animals.
Unlike W.C. Fields, whose view of domesticity was genuinely
subversive, Chaplin regarded his film family as benign, finding all
the hostility he needed in the outside world. Similarly, in ``A
Dog's Life,'' he and the mongrel he meets as a homeless man trying
to catch a nap behind a far from sheltering fence are soulmates.
The dog he names Scraps is his alter ego, hanging in there, not to
be deterred by nightstick-wielding cops or other natural enemies.
The food vendor whose pushcart draws Chaplin's tramp like a magnet,
by the way, is played by his half-brother, Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The droopy Sydney is Charlie's foil as well in ``Shoulder Arms''
(1918), quite possibly the first service comedy. Rushed to
completion and distribution before the end of World War I, it stars
Charlie as a resourceful doughboy for whom all is not quiet on the
Western Front. First, he heroically captures a trenchful of
Germans. Then he tops himself by going after the Kaiser in order to
rescue his sad-eyed buddy (Sydney again) and a French damsel played
by Edna Purviance. She was his favorite silent leading lady,
through 1923 at least, but whom he kept on his payroll for years
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pilgrim'' (1923), rounding out tomorrow's triple bill,
stars Charlie as an escaped prisoner who steals a parson's clothes
and shows up in a Texas backwater town posing as the cleric. If he
was tempted to skewer religious hypocrisy, he held his fire, taking
it easy on the parched, pious congregation and limiting himself to
desperate fraudulence. In doing so, he allows ``The Pilgrim'' to be
stolen by big Mack Swain, the prospector with whom he shared the
old boot dinner in ``The Gold Rush.'' Swain, fingertips touching as
he seems to be plowing his way into heaven like an icebreaker, eyes
rolling skyward, suggests a bilious eggplant, even when his pint
bottle of Prohibition-era booze slips from his pocket and smashes
on the sidewalk. It's Chaplin's cleric who looks disconcerted while
the bloated sanctimoniousness of Swain's deacon remains intact.

A THOROUGH ZYDECO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE KINGDOM OF ZYDECO 
By Michael Tisserand 
Arcade, 382 pp., illustrated, $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame ``The Big Easy'' or Cambridge's own Rounder Records, but
zydeco is everywhere. The Louisiana music's wheezing accordion, the
syncopated rhythms scraped along a metal washboard, sell everything
from hot sauce to autos, relying on the lively music's connotations
of good times _ and simpler ones. The real story, as revealed by
Michael Tisserand in his enjoyable and authoritative ``The Kingdom
of Zydeco,'' is both darker and more complicated, much like the
history of the state that spawned it.
</P>
<P>
   Zydeco is the music of the black Creole population of rural
Louisiana, a French-speaking group that has shared much with, but
still holds itself distinct from, the better-known white Cajun
people. Like the Cajuns, descendents of French-Canadian emigres,
these Francophone African-Americans built their own society in the
state's southwestern bayous and plains. And their isolation and
poverty kept their culture more or less intact until the last few
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tisserand, who writes a column on zydeco for the magazine Living
Blues, explores the music through that culture, detailing the
Saturday-night house dances that let poor farmers and sharecroppers
cut loose. He traces this homemade entertainment from the first a
cappella jure (testifying) songs to the arrival of that Viennese
invention, the accordion, soon after it was patented in 1829. With
the help of Cajun music scholars such as Ann Allen Savoy (author of
the comprehensive ``Cajun Music''), he charts the frequent
cross-pollinations between the area's parallel populations. And
then, as country music and rhythm 'n' blues crept into the culture
and Louisiana musicians working in nearby Houston became more
cosmopolitan, he begins to pick up the stories of recorded
musicians, from Amede Ardoin and Canray Fontenot through Clifton
Chenier, who arguably invented contemporary zydeco. Ultimately, as
electric instruments, funk, and even hip-hop captured the
imagination of the younger generation, he follows the latest
incarnations of zydeco into recordings as recent as last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-based author loves zydeco with a passion that
becomes obvious as he traces trends _ such as the tradition of
barking like a dog in songs _ through time. He even spends pages on
the etymology of the music's name. Most critics accept the widely
disseminated story that traces the name to ``les haricots'' (snap
beans), which appear in a song made famous by Chenier, ``Les
Haricots Sont Pas Sale'' (``The Snap Beans Aren't Salty'') _ a
joyful number about times so hard that no salt meat can be afforded
to flavor the snap-bean pot. But Tisserand looks back further,
finding phrases in West African languages that suggest the music's
title, such as ``a zare'' (``I dance''), and tracing these older
sources in both lyrics and rhythms.

<P>
   While this may sound scholarly, Tisserand fleshes out the
theories with a folk-tale approach, weaving anecdotes together with
juicy quotes from elder musicians, such as Alphonse ``Bois Sec''
Ardoin and Boozoo Chavis. The results are colorful, and sometimes
the stories he uncovers are contradictory. Was the great
accordionist Ardoin beaten senseless because he accepted a
handkerchief from a white woman at one sweaty dance? Or was he
conducting an affair with such a woman, the handkerchief of legend
serving as modest metaphor? Even as various retellings deliver
alternate versions, they paint a vivid portrait of a harshly
segregated society, where black musicians could be admired for
their talent _ as long as they knew their place. Zydeco is
good-time music, he makes clear, but it grew out of very hard
lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Tisserand's own writing is clear and enjoyable, his
ability to translate the riding rhythms into prose agile, it is the
interviews he includes that make this book truly special. These
strings of quotes _ presented uncorrected and full of colorful
colloquialisms _ are treasures, bits of living history grabbed just
in time, in several cases, to preserve firsthand accounts of
customs and people now gone. The late Fontenot, for example, was
arguably the greatest fiddler of his day; to have his accounts of
Amede Ardoin or his own father, who never recorded because of his
religious beliefs, is priceless. Although the filmmaker Les Blank
has made documentaries about many of these musicians and magazines
have begun chronicling this musical subculture, there have been no
studies of zydeco as comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the dearth of historical material may account for
Tisserand's one slight failing. Roughly the last quarter of the
book is focused on contemporary musicians who have not yet proved
themselves as influential as their forebears. True, the author ties
such performers as Beau Jocque and Chris Ardoin and his band Double
Clutchin' in with their rich history: Ardoin, after all, is the
grandson of ``Bois Sec,'' and Beau Jocque's feud with Keith Frank
brings up the long-standing question of authorship in this
communally produced music. But do they merit a chapter apiece?
Perhaps Tisserand hears what the rest of us do not yet; the
knowledge and passion displayed here urge the reader to trust him.

A DEATH LEAVES A COLLEGE IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ The obituary did not say what killed him.
But friends of the Rev. Kenneth A. Childs, who collapsed in his
home here last week, believe he fell victim to an academic poison:
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 years as a campus minister at Springfield College,
Childs, 56, was fired on July 22 for his ``outspoken and caustic
criticism'' of the school administration and what he called its
increasingly corporate style. Despite his popularity among the
3,000 or so students, Childs was asked to pack his things and leave
by Aug. 1. Within a week, he was dead of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   But glimmers of his moral indignation seem to have survived.
Even as students wandered teary-eyed into his empty office, faculty
members began seeking answers about his dismissal _ and demanded
the resignation of the school president, Randoph Bromery, a former
chancellor of the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bromery did, announcing his imminent departure this week,
although he had planned to leave his post anyway and maintained
that the timing of his announcement was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole campus just went into shock at the horror of this,''
said Fernando Gonzalez de Leon, 38, an associate professor of
history and friend of Childs. ``The only thing Childs cared about
was academic freedom. He was in perfect health. Ten days ago, this
man was like you or me.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials refused to discuss the minister's firing.
William B. Marsh, the chairman of the board of trustees, said only
that the school is ``very saddened by his death.'' David Shrair, an
attorney for the college, said simply, ``I understand he had a
heart attack. There could be thousands of reasons why anybody could
die of a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrair said it is within school policy to ``terminate any
non-faculty employee at will for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   But the confidential dismissal letter that Bromery wrote to
Childs two weeks ago _ along with what some professors perceive as
a long-running plan to silence the outspoken minister _ has sent
rumors flying across this urban campus, and raised questions among
some faculty members about whether freedom of speech truly exists
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-paragraph termination notice, which was saved by
Childs and obtained by the Globe, Bromery accused Childs of a
``lack of support of administration,'' as well as the ``fostering
of dissention among College constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromery declined to reveal the nature of Childs's dissent, but
friends insisted it was hardly a revolutionary threat: The only
``evidence'' friends could imagine was Childs's occasional columns
in monthly campus newsletters, as well as his critiques of
administrative decisions at campus meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from his seat to address a faculty meeting, his large
frame towering over the rest of the faculty, Childs would often
direct barbed remarks at the administration, said Tom Shea, a
professor of economics who was Childs's friend for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would stand up and say, `Don't you think we've had enough
spenditure in this area, and not enough on the students?''' Shea
recalled. ``People always called him the `conscience of the
college.' And that's what he was.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a role Childs assumed three decades earlier. After
growing up in Ripon, Wisc., he moved east to study divinity and
theology at Yale University, graduating in 1968. He was ordained
the same year and moved to Wilbraham, then to Springfield in 1973,
according to his July 31 obituary in the Springfield Union-News.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the staff at Springfield College and over the course
of three administrations became a thorn in the side of each
successive president, writing columns and helping publish an
independent faculty newsletter, the Faculty Voice. He rarely feared
the reaction of top officials, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bromery became president in October 1993, his decisions,
too, came under criticism from Childs. After the name of the
college's sports teams was changed in 1993 from the Chiefs to the
Pride, in order not to insult American Indians, Childs attacked the
move as a simplistic concession toward the political correctness
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly trivial issues sparked equal outrage: After an
announcement earlier this year that Bromery hoped to close off
Alden Street, the main drag on the urban campus, Childs criticized
him in print, calling the proposal an ``arrogant initiative'' and a
``daily public embarrassment'' in a column in the Jan. 28, 1998
edition of the campus paper, the Student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt it was part of the role of the campus ministry
to speak out,'' said John J. Doyle, chair of the department of
Management and Economics, who knew Childs for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   As his criticism continued, Childs began to feel marginalized by
the administration in recent years, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Childs had his views, and those views were not necessarily
the views of the college,'' said Shrair. ``My understanding is that
his views became even more outspoken after his first wife passed
away,'' in 1986. ``But what he was all about, I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Childs was summoned to Bromery's office and informed of
his dismissal. He received the letter on July 22. He was
despondent, Doyle said. And within days, he began feeling chest
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tense. I think he felt discarded after a long period of
service to the college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs was told to remove his belongings from the first-floor
office of the Beveridge Student Center by Aug. 1. But when he
arrived at the campus ministry center on July 28, he found the
locks had already been changed to keep him out. ``He was very
flustered, very upset,'' Gonzalez de Leon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After a security guard opened the office door, Childs and his
wife, Donna, began filling boxes full of files, pulling down
posters, clearing shelves. When they went home, Childs was an
emotional wreck, his friends said. He collapsed that day with a
heart attack, and died.
</P>
<P>
   In the week after his death, appalled by what they perceived as
a ``chilling attack on freedom of speech,'' Childs's supporters met
to discuss their plans. On Monday, they drafted a letter requesting
Bromery resign, according to Gonzalez de Leon. On Tuesday, in a
meeting of the executive council, Bromery did.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, attention seemed to have turned toward the memorial
service, scheduled to take place at 1 p.m. today. Fliers were
tacked up around campus, featuring Childs's photo from the school
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on the door of the campus ministry office said: ``We Love
U Ken.''

MATCHBOX20: AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Normal guys. That's how a lot of musicians describe
themselves, but it really holds true for Matchbox 20. They're not
known visually and don't have any compelling idiosyncrasies that
land them in the gossip columns. All they do is sell records _ 7
million copies, in fact, of their debut album, ``Yourself or
Someone Like You,'' which has outsold the latest discs by Puff
Daddy, the Dave Matthews Band, and just about anyone else this side
of Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just normal guys playing normal music,'' says singer Rob
Thomas, whose Orlando-based band has risen quickly. ``We're
confident, but we never make any claims about how great we are.
There are a lot of bands that we like more than we like us,'' says
Thomas, 26.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Matchbox 20 will try to blow away Soul Asylum and
Semisonic, Thomas sticks to his populist mode by saying, ``It's not
about competition. A lot of people are just coming to see a show.
For them it's just a night away from everything, a night away from
work. It's going out and having some beers with friends. I think
that's how you have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox 20 has adroitly straddled the line between mainstream
rock and alternative rock. The band's lyrically driven guitar pop
has resulted in such smash hits as ``Real World'' (``I want the
real world to stop hassling me!'' Thomas sings), ``3 A.M.,'' ``Long
Day,'' and ``Push.'' All the while, the band has kept its humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's hip,'' says Thomas. ``So we're just going
to stick with what we do _ and hopefully we'll pull a Tom Petty and
manage to continuously make good records, fanfare or no fanfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas almost takes pride in declaring that he and his bandmates
are not known visually, despite extensive play on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we have these forgettable faces,'' he says. ``I
went to Universal Studios with my girlfriend recently and we went
through all these lines, and not once did we have any hassles. And
I think that's great. I don't think it's good when everywhere you
go, you have people who think they know you. I think we're better
off this way.''
</P>

   Van Halen returns: The new Van Halen, with Boston-bred Gary
Cherone on vocals, has taken some pummeling in the press but has
not been deterred. What does Cherone have to say? ``I'd rather be
quiet and let the music talk. I'm not much of a hype machine, but
really, I don't think the band has ever sounded better _ not
because of me, but because of the whole sound. And I think we can
still convert the old guard,'' says Cherone.
</P>
<P>
   Cherone made his point loud and clear last spring at the
FleetCenter in Boston, where Van Halen ruled once again. You might
cite previous VH singers David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar as still
being your choice, but if you caught the Fleet show you'd have to
admit that the band has never been more pumped in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie (Van Halen) was more nervous than I was for the Boston
show,'' says Cherone, who has lived in Malden and Melrose. ``It was
like this was Eddie's hometown gig in Boston. I said to him, `Hey,
I'm the one who's supposed to be nervous, not you.' But we had a
great week. We played Boston, New York, and Philadelphia _ and each
show got better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Fleet gig, Cherone was deluged with ticket requests. ``I
had a whole loge full of people _ everybody from the guys I play
basketball with to cousins I never knew I had. And my brothers
would keep calling me up, adding people to the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherone knows that he's been on the spot this tour, but it's
been a challenge he has relished. ``You've got to prove it every
night. You can't have a bad night,'' he says. ``But the general
consensus is that the fans are going home happy. There's a good
spirit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherone will look to rekindle that spirit at a Great Woods
appearance, where he hopes to sing a couple more VH chestnuts from
the Roth days _ namely, the newly added ``Hot for Teacher'' and
``Jamie's Crying.'' Where he once said he would avoid such
signature Roth tunes, Cherone now declares, ``I was just being
paranoid. I think I can handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Halen has kept on going despite an accident to drummer Alex
Van Halen while the band was in Hamburg, Ga., not long ago. A piece
of ceiling tile fell on him, bruising his arm to the point where
the band had to cancel eight shows. ``He's OK now,'' says Cherone.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the band is in it for the long haul, Cherone adds
that VH will finish its tour Nov. 2 in Japan, then knuckle down and
write more music. ``Ideally, we'll have a new record out next
summer,'' he says.

   Woodstock lives: The 29th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival
is next weekend, at which time the original site of the event will
come alive for the ``Day in the Garden'' series. Yes, Max Yasgur's
farm, which was purchased by cable entrepreneur Alan Gerry two
years ago, is being ``rededicated'' as a concert site, says
producer Danny Socolof. The lineup has star power. Next Friday: Don
Henley, Stevie Nicks, Ziggy Marley &AMP; the Melody Makers, and
original Woodstock act Ten Years After. For Saturday: Joni Mitchell
(who wrote the song ``Woodstock''), Pete Townshend, Lou Reed,
Richie Havens, Donovan, and Melanie. And for Sunday, there's a
younger, alt-rock-tilted show with Dishwalla, Joan Osborne, Goo Goo
Dolls, Marcy Playground, Third Eye Blind, and the Flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Woodstock '98,'' says Socolof. ``This is a
rededication of the site, though we respect what happened here 29
years ago.'' The site is now being transformed with tents for food,
crafts, and beer, plus a large sculpture garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you step on this property, there's a real good buzz,''
says Socolof, who produced the ``Surreal Field'' area at Woodstock
'94. He and his team are taking the 37 acres that comprise the
Woodstock site in Bethel, N.Y., and setting up the same stage that
Garth Brooks used in his Central Park show last year. And they're
selling a maximum of 30,000 tickets per day, in an attempt to
create a laid-back vibe. (If all goes well, they'll do more shows
there next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The music runs from 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. each day (no
late-night heroics this time) and will be broadcast live on the
festival's Web site at infoseek.com. Other information can be
procured there as well. And while there's no camping on site, there
are many campsites nearby.

DEPALMA'S STYLISH `SNAKE' ENTICES,THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SNAKE EYES 
Directed by: Brian De Palma 
Screenplay by: David Koepp 
Starring: Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, John Heard, Carla Gugino, Stan
Shaw, Kevin Dunn 
Running time: 99 minutes 
Rated: R (some violence) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's ``Snake Eyes'' is a throwback to his earlier
high-tension thrillers _ ``Blow Out,'' ``Dressed to Kill,''
``Obsession,'' and ``Body Double.'' It's stylish and entertainingly
feverish as it keeps shifting the point of view in a hothouse
atmosphere _ an indoor arena where an assassin guns down a Cabinet
member during a heavyweight championship fight. During the panic
that ensues, and while they've still got a chance to keep the exits
blocked, Atlantic City cop Nicholas Cage and his boyhood buddy,
naval commander and security expert Gary Sinise, join forces to try
and nail the killer.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma has fun throwing the loud, hectic boxing match scene at
us, then replaying it from different characters' points of view,
enticing us to examine the pieces of the labyrinthine puzzle in
each retelling so we can find the details that will tell us who set
up whom. The Atlantic City setting allows the arena stuff to spill
into the surrounding environment, a hideous money-extracting casino
and hotel run by John Heard's mogul and designed to give greed and
ugliness a bad name. A sort of cross between Howard Hughes and
Donald Trump, living off defense contracts and gambling glitz,
Heard's kingpin is a vulgarian. The question is whether he's a
lethal one.
</P>
<P>
   The film derives its energy from the way De Palma's camera
hurtles through the cavelike spaces of the arena and casino and
from the contrasting styles of Cage and Sinise. De Palma's
camerawork has always tended toward showing off, but here the speed
of it takes the sting out of its self-advertisement. The camera
never upstages Cage's over-the-top cop. With his shiny brown rayon
jacket and saffron-patterned Hawaiian sportshirt, he suggests an
oven-fresh cheese-filled glazed meatloaf as he careens around the
arena, strong-arming payoffs out of the petty crooks who hang
around the action like pilot fish.
</P>
<P>
   He both feeds off the crass action and contributes to it. While
the film stays on the surface of things and scarcely bothers to
convince us of any real tie between the cop and the career naval
officer, his spillover contrasts vividly with the air of steely
containment projected by Sinise's security chief worried about a
sudden end to his credibility and career. If Cage's cop lets it all
hang out, right down to his gold-plated cell phone, Sinise's
equally tense crimefighter keeps it all inside. If Cage's
flamboyance keeps you watching the cop, it's Sinise's fierce
concentration that glues you to his taut Defense Department
staffer.

   Carla Gugino's mystery woman is the figure who invokes the De
Palma of ``Body Double'' and ``Obsession'' in her platinum blond
wig that's knocked from her head in the stampede following the
gunshots as she flees the killer while blood from an arm wound
reddens her white silk suit. De Palma has a few piquant points to
make about the claustrophobic world of the gambler and uses its
darkness and feeling of the walls closing in to reinforce the
melodramatic pressure. ``Snake Eyes'' is claptrap, but De Palma's
slickness makes the Cage-Sinise duet fun to watch. It's probably
the kiss of death to call ``Snake Eyes'' the most intelligent dumb
thriller of the summer, but that's what it is as De Palma finally
stops trying to top Hitchcock and just rolls with the film's
connection to lurid '90s excess.

`SAFE MEN' WALKS ON THE MILD SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SAFE MEN 
Written and directed by: John Hamburg 
Starring: Sam Rockwell, Steve Zahn, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Pais, Paul
Giamatti, Christine Kirk, Harvey Fierstein, Michael Lerner, Michael
Schmidt 
Running time: 89 minutes 
Rated: R (language)

   John Hamburg's ``Safe Men'' plays like Coen Brothers Lite. Very
Lite. It wants to trade on quirky eccentricity, but it's neither
dark enough nor brilliant enough to conceal its overextended
softness. It's at best mildly agreeable as it takes a couple of
woebegone young musicians and throws them into a few forced
safecracking assignments for which they are, to put it gently,
ill-suited. The comedy comes in when they keep bumping up against a
pair of really good safecrackers. But the idea of setting their
botched capers in the circumscribed netherworld of the Jewish mafia
in Providence, R.I., is dulled when that criminal element consists
of two far-from-menacing guys.
</P>
<P>
   The shady rivals played by Michael Lerner and Harvey Fierstein
seem to have gained their criminal backgrounds solely by watching
movies, and the wrong ones at that. Still, their respective
tough-guy acts scare Sam Rockwell's aspiring musician and his
sidekick, Steve Zahn. So, having been set up by the henchman of the
schemer played by Lerner, they gulp, take a timeout from playing
the Polish social events that are the only gigs they can get, and
head into the night, driven by the memory of the shouted threats
from Lerner's workout-suited goniff, who suggests an angry knish,
waving a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the limited scope of what's going on, it takes an
awfully long time to get there. The only real diversion comes from
the half-calculating, half-impulsive gleam in the eye of Christina
Kirk, as the daughter of the larcenous retailer played by
Fierstein. She should know better than to get interested in
thieves, her eyes tell us, especially since she just dumped one of
the really talented safecrackers. Still, Rockwell's hangdog
sincerity gets to her, and besides, she can tell he's no thief at
heart. The problem with ``Safe Men'' is that it's all too obviously
safe, except when you're wondering which way Kirk's character is
going to go. Hamburg's next comedy, the press notes tell us, will
be for Disney. It seems a logical development.

 &HT;    A FIT FIDEL QUASHES RUMORS OF ILL HEALTH AS 72ND BIRTHDAY
APPROACHES
 &HT;    With CASTRO-BOX-$ADV09.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Aug. 8 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuba's septuagenarian leader Fidel Castro ``died'' four
years ago, supposedly from a stroke. It was lung cancer that killed
him two years ago. Most recently, he suffered from a potentially
fatal disorder that turns the brain to mush.
</P>
<P>
   But the irrepressible Castro, who turns 72 on Thursday(Aug. 13),
has more lives than a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, Castro's birthday unleashes a fresh round of
feverish speculation concerning the health of the Communist
dictator, much of it kindled by wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And this birthday's no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Miami newspaper quoted a Cuban defector claiming
to be a surgeon as saying Castro had received treatment in October
for a brain malady known as hypertensive encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the Castro regime's days were numbered spread like
wildfire through the exile community here.
</P>
<P>
   But the claims of the defector, Elizabeth Trujillo, collapsed
when the Vatican's chief spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Vals, reported
that he had met with Castro for six hours in October, on a day when
Castro was supposed to be seriously ill, to plan January's visit by
Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Castro ridiculed reports of his illness, saying he'd never even
heard of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, they kill me off,'' Castro said. ``The
day I die, no one will believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no different last summer, when all sorts of ill-health
stories made the rounds -- some even announcing his death -- after
Castro wasn't seen in public for several weeks. But Castro easily
quashed those rumors by delivering a rousing, marathon seven-hour
speech at the opening of the Fifth Communist Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a robust and seemingly healthy Castro basked in
warm receptions during a six-day swing through the Caribbean
following the reports of Trujillo's claims. He visited Jamaica,
Barbados and -- most significantly -- the only place where Cuban
and American troops ever did battle: Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   He will visit the Dominican Republic in late August -- his first
trip there since his 1959 Communist revolution -- and South Africa
and Portugal later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy reportedly dies every two years or so, but in reality
the man's 72 years old and still giving six-hour speeches, and he's
traveling all over the place, so he can't be doing all that bad,''
said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But, to many Castro foes, the dictator ``just doesn't look
well,'' although they admit their perceptions could be borne of
fertile imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look like a healthy 72-year-old man should look.
His color's not good. He's thin. Maybe it's just wishful
thinking,'' said Ninoska Perez, spokeswoman for the Cuban American
National Foundation, the most powerful anti-Castro exile group.
</P>
<P>
   One reason ill-health rumors swirl so freely around Castro is
the general secretiveness of Communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Brezhnev, for example, wasn't seen for weeks before
Soviet authorities acknowledged his death.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the government rarely publishes meeting agendas or
economic statistics, let alone details concerning Castro's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, where there's an open society, if the
president gets sick, everybody knows about it, but in Cuba this
kind of thing is treated like a state secret,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling a growing number of rumors has been the increased
visibility over the past year of Castro's brother, Raul, who is
five years Fidel's junior.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Raul Castro was formally designated his
brother's successor as Communist Party leader at the party congress
held in October.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Raul Castro, the head of the Armed Forces, has
enjoyed a more public role in running Cuba's government. Late last
year, he represented Cuba both in Beijing and at the Vatican in
advance of the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fidel is clearly worried about his health and is
clearly trying to pass on the mantle,'' said Jaime Suchliki, an
expert on Cuba at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voice is certainly not as clear as it once was and it's
obvious he's lost weight,'' he said. ``I've heard that he only
works four hours a day so it's clear that he has slowed down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that Fidel Castro
is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   And, if anything, Castro himself has made it abundantly clear in
recent months that he retains a firm grip on his country of 11
million people.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed at a Communist Party congress in March that he would
take no steps toward capitalism. He reaffirmed his belief that,
despite the trends toward worldwide capitalism, his socialist
vision of the world would eventually prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to perfect it, to become stronger, more cultured,
more prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's also scored a number of diplomatic victories over the
past year, particularly since the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien -- the dismay of the
United States -- traveled to Cuba in April to announce increased
bilateral cooperation. Earlier this year, Guatemala and the
Dominican Republic restored diplomatic relations with the island.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite decades of efforts by the U.S. government to
isolate Cuba, more than 2,000 U.S. executives are expected to visit
Havana this year, according to the New York-based U.S.-Cuba
Economic Trade Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Cuban government hailed Castro's whirlwind
Caribbean tour as a triumph of Third World solidarity and a
rejection of U.S. moves to force political changes on the communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro seems to be secure in his power and has become
something of an icon by standing up to the United States,'' said
Ernest Preeg, who follows Cuba at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a right-of-center think tank in Washington.
``This plays well throughout the Caribbean, so it's no wonder
relations are being strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also no indication that a popular uprising might remove
Fidel Castro any time soon, despite worsening economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A devastating low 1997-98 sugar harvest and reports of a severe
drought in eastern Cuba have raised serious doubts about the
island's economic recovery prospects this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few human rights groups in Cuba, but they are not
a powerful force, so there is no real organized resistance,'' Preeg
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be why Castro's critics are so eager to believe
stories of ill health: it could be the only way to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Castro, people are always grasping at
straws,'' said Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown
University in Washington. ``Speculation over Castro's poor health
is typically overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as Castro approaches the 40th anniversary of the revolution
he led, there's every reason to believe the leader will be around
for awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Balaguer, for example, ruled the Dominican Republic well
into his 80s, even when he was physically frail and blind. At age
92, he still has a hand in Dominican politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSTADT, N.J. _ For generations, people traveling up and down
the Eastern Seaboard have known where to expect the dirtiest,
ugliest, most stench-filled stretch of their trips _ here in the
Meadowlands of northern New Jersy.
</P>
<P>
   Since European settlement of this region three centuries ago,
New Yorkers and New Jerseyites have been dumping things they don't
want in these soft marshes, creating a mess of almost
incomprehensible proportions. For several decades, large swaths of
the area were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But largely unnoticed in recent years, the Meadowlands have
begun to come back, and, in a backhanded compliment to their
progress, they are now the focus of a fierce battle over whether to
bend federal wetlands policy to allow new development, including
construction of a huge new mall.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is becoming a flashpoint for one of the big
environmental questions of the era: Should the nation permit some
development of damaged natural areas, like many of those in the
Meadowlands, in return for agreements to save others, or should it
insist that all land covered by environmental laws be strictly
protected? The answer is of burning interest both to landowners and
to environmental activists, and could influence projects from
Massachusetts to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration touts the Meadowlands as a national
model for how to strike a balance between the environment and
property rights. But if the development plan that allows the mall
goes through, it would be a national disaster,'' said Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., the namesake son of the assassinated New York senator
and the chief attorney for the National Alliance of River, Sound
and Baykeepers, the group that is spearheading opposition to
further Meadowlands development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told we have all the makings of a tremendous lawsuit if
the decision is not in our favor,'' said Victoria L. Jenkins, an
executive with Mills Corp., an Arlington, Va.-based developer that
is awaiting federal permits to begin work on a $1 billion mall
called Meadowlands Mills. The company wants to build a similar mall
in South Weymouth on the South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't balance the envionment and development interests
in the Meadowlands...it will be a major setback for preservation
efforts across the country,'' warned Bradley M. Campbell, deputy
director of the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House
agency that entered the fight earlier this year to try to broker a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the idea that the Meadowlands is attracting so much
attention seems odd. After all, this is a place that was allowed to
collect more hazardous waste sites (three on the high-risk
Superfund list), more landfills (27, or about one every square
mile) and more serious pollution over the years than almost any
similar-sized tract in the nation. To others, the notion that all
the hubbub is over a shopping mall is downright laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we're not talking about virgin land in the
middle of Kansas,'' said Chip Hallock, president of the Commerce
and Industry Association of New Jersey, a business trade group.
``This is the shopping mall capital of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But at least a few people have begun to dream about a
very different future for the Meadowlands and have been encouraged
by recent changes in the land. For between the area's parking lots,
amid its spaghetti of highway interchanges, alongside its strangely
squared-off hills of garbage, herons and egrets have returned, the
spartina grass has started to grow again, and the marshes have
begun to mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, the Meadowlands is a testament to nature's
resilience against long odds,'' said John R. Quinn, a local
naturalist and author. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vantage points
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those driving south out of New England on I-95 across the
George Washington Bridge today, the Meadowlands still come as a
giant anticlimax, a flat industrial landscape that lets travelers
know they have made it past New York but gives them almost no clue
about where they have made it to. ``A place that people rush past
on their way to the rest of America,'' according to Robert
Sullivan, whose recent book ``The Meadowlands'' has attracted new
attention to the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists consider the area, together with Newark Bay, to be
one of the East Coast's great tidal estuaries, as important as the
Hudson River and New York harbor. But that's not how the
Meadowlands look from behind the wheel on the Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   From that vantage point, all that is apparent is a desolate
expanse, one that has often been home to strange and
not-always-pleasant occurences.
</P>
<P>
   Last month when New York heiress Irene Silverman disappeared
from her Manhattan townhouse, police were told the prime suspects
had been seen driving into the deep reeds of the Meadowlands in
Carlstadt. A search failed to produce a body, but did turn up a bag
full of fake Social Security cards. Three years ago, officials had
to evacuate hundreds of guests from a Meadowlands Days Inn when an
industrial yard next door blew up.
</P>
<P>
   But if events like these have convinced turnpike travelers that
the Meadowlands are an urban desert best left quickly, they have
not had a similar effect on the streets of Kearny, Secaucus and
Moonachie. Here, some residents behave as if they live at the very
edge of a wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the naturalist, has canoed the Meadowlands for decades
and has published a book about the area called ``Fields of Sun and
Grass.'' ``Not everybody has had the experience of camping in the
nocturnal glow of Giant Stadium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Just, the mayor of Secaucus, takes off occasional
afternoons to go out to Snake Hill, the blasted and
graffiti-covered outcropping that is the Meadowlands' tallest, and
just about its only, rise. ``It's a beautiful sight,'' he said of
the view. ``You can see the river bend around to Jersey City.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Smith, a naturalist with the state commission established in
the 1960s to clean up and develop the Meadowlands, and Bill
Sheehan, an environmental activist who works as a taxi dispatcher
in Union City, run rival boat tours along the Hackensack River,
which runs through the marshes. As school children gape at the
passing shoreline, they expound their drastically different views
of how to protect the area, views now on a collision course over
the Meadowlands Mills project.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Large scale
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of their history, the Meadowlands have had built-in
protection against overdevelopment. People couldn't figure out how
to build on the area's soggy soil. But with construction advances,
the land that once seemed useless has suddenly become attractive to
developers such as Mills Corp.

   TAKE-BOS  
 (f and a coding)  
 CARLSTADT, N.J.:... such as Mills Corp.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everything about Meadowlands Mills would be gigantic. It
would be the largest shopping mall in New Jersey. Together with an
adjacent office center and 1,000-room hotel, it would include more
than 5 million square feet of space, or the equivalent of two or
three pairs of Boston's Copley Place and Prudential Tower. It would
have parking for 17,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental aspects of the project are equally massive. It
would require filling 206 acres of the Meadowlands' already
diminished marshes, an amount federal officials say would be one of
the largest fills since the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act,
the law that protects wetlands from filling and dumping.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the proposed fill's size _ about one third of the
full 600 acres slated for the project _ is not the principal reason
it is controversial. The company and its experts argue that the
area was so mistreated in the past _ cut off from the Hackensack
River by the turnpike, filled up with trash and overrun by
phragmites, a sort of monster crabgrass that can grow to 15 feet _
that it barely functions as a wetlands anymore, and virtually
everybody involved in the mall battle agrees.
</P>
<P>
   But the company goes one step further. It says that the area can
never recover on its own, but can only come back with human help.
And it makes this offer: If Mills is allowed to fill and build its
mall, it will spend up to $25 million repairing an adjacent 300
acres of similarly damaged land.
</P>
<P>
   The offer has driven a huge wedge between environmental groups,
between federal agencies, and, as if they weren't already at odds,
between Smith and Sheehan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friction within
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with either man and it becomes clear they don't like
each other. But more is at work than a simple personality clash.
The pair represents the poles of compromise and confrontation that
are at center of the Mills controversy and have tugged at the
environmental movement from its very inception.
</P>
<P>
   At another time, Smith and Sheehan's disagreement might not have
attracted much attention. But not today. That's because wetlands
are a hot topic. In February, President Clinton made them the
centerpiece of his new environmental initiative with a promise to
add 100,000 acres a year to the nation's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the state agency for which he works, the Hackensack
Meadowsland Development Commission, believe the only way to protect
wetlands is to cut deals like the one Mills is offering. In fact,
they have spent more than a decade trying to sell
environmentalists, developers and government officials on a similar
development-for-environmental protection deal that would cover the
entire Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging across the marshes on a recent afternoon, the
commission's senior naturalist summed up his agency's view of the
region this way: ``We broke it; we've got to fix it. This is not a
pristine area. There are a lot of things that are not going to get
better and go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan concedes compromises may have been necessary when the
commission started its cleanup in the late 1960s. But he argues
that with development having claimed almost two-thirds of the
Meadowlands' 23,000 acres, the time for deal-making is done.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Kennedy's group, which recently named him a
kind of chief advocate for the Hackensack, Sheehan has lined up
impressive opposition to both the Mills project and the
Meadowlands-wide plan. In an unusual move, leaders of virtually
every major environmental group in the country wrote the White
House in February saying that in return for their politically
crucial support of the president's environmental initiative, they
want Clinton to fight the project and the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan's idea of how to resolve the dispute is simple: Mills
should build the project elsewhere, either on an irreparably
damaged tract in the Meadowlands or in a nearby city like Newark.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour of the Meadowlands that featured egrets lifting
off a marsh pond, but also garbage oozing from a riverbank and the
steady hiss of traffic on the New Jersy Turnpike, he was asked: Do
you really think this is beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a native of this area and being of limited means,'' he
explained, ``the Meadowlands are my Everglades, the Hackensack is
my Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbing in his boat along the banks of the flat, featureless
mall site one day recently, he expressed confidence that, with
time, the area will again become a rich green marsh. ``The river
will decide what it wants that area to be,'' he said. ``Whatever it
decides, whenever it decides it, that's good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But a new threat appears to be bearing down on Sheehan and on
the environmental movement generally, one that could make it much
harder to fight projects like the Mills proposal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New legal landscape
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The threat is a string of Supreme Court cases that have expanded
the notion of ``takings,'' the constitutional prohibition against
the government taking a person's property without ``just
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a government agency could generally limit an
owner's use of his land through zoning or other rules without
violating that prohibition. However, beginning in the late 1980s,
property owners and conservative legal groups succeeded in
convincing the high court that a broad array of government actions
that were not considered violations in the past are in fact
takings.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, officials worry that the government
could end up having to pay property owners to impose almost any
restriction, something that it is unlikely to do in
budget-balancing times such as these.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and regulators are scambling to avoid that
outcome by devising news ways to strike compromises with landowners
with property in environmentally sensitive areas like wetlands. And
they think that they have found the model for such deals in, of all
places, the Meadowlands commission's development-for-environment
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, some owners, such as those who own the Mills
site, would be allowed to develop part of their property in return
for pledging to keep the rest natural. Others would be prohibited
from developing at all, but would be compensated by payments from
those who could develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach a reasonable compromise (over the commission's
plan) we will have shown that this type of comprehensive planning
can be used to protect the environment across the country,'' said
Campbell, the White House environmental aide.
</P>
<P>
   Without a compromise, officials fear that Mills will file a
lawsuit that could result in the Supreme Court expanding its notion
of takings even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't reach an agreement here, you're going to end up
with a takings case the likes of which this country has never
seen,'' warned Robert W. Hargrove, a senior official with the New
York regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

UNLIKELY ROAD BUDDIES TAKE DELIGHTFUL DETOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WESTERN 
Directed by: Manuel Poirier 
Screenplay by: Poirier, Jean-Francois Goyet 
Starring: Sergi Lopez, Sacha Bourdo, Elisabeth Vitali, Marie
Matheron, Basile Siekoua 
Running time: 121 minutes  
Rated: No rating 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The west in Manuel Poirier's ``Western'' is Brittany, on
France's west coast. And there isn't a cowboy in it. Although it
takes its time and meanders toward its destination, it's well worth
staying with as it takes the buddies-on-the-road genre to a few new
places. In fact, it covers less than 10 miles as it sends a couple
of lonely outsiders on a journey of discovery. What the Catalan
Sergi Lopez and the Russian Sacha Bourdo discover is the difference
between being free and being lost in a landscape where happiness
consists of not being reminded that they're foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   They come together in promisingly original fashion. After
Bourdo's diminutive hitchhiker tricks Lopez's shoe salesman out of
his car and steals it, the salesman catches up with him in the next
seacoast town and beats him up badly enough to put him in the
hospital. The salesman's vengeance had been stoked by losing his
job because he lost his car. But the lack of a daily routine
suddenly seems a good thing when he's given a lift by an attractive
woman (Elisabeth Vitali) who runs a quayside shop and they find, to
their mutual delight, that they hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman suggests they part for three weeks to test their
feelings, the virile Catalan and the shy Russian, toward whom Lopez
has softened _ especially after Bourdo gravely assured him during a
hospital visit that car theft was ``not in my philosophy'' _ decide
to hit the road together. With a fine comic irony that's never
overdone, it's the smitten Catalan who attracts women on their
journey while the Russian, longing for a soulmate, keeps striking
out.
</P>
<P>
   That Poirier has more than a road comedy on his mind is
underscored when they meet an Ivory Coast transplant who blithely
calls himself a Breton and teaches them an outdoor cafe game,
``Bonjour la France.'' It involves greeting passersby. Positive
responses get points. When one disgruntled local shouts, ``Go back
where you came from,'' they laugh. They can afford to. Although
bigotry is addressed, it's addressed lightly and wryly. Both men
meet mostly kindly locals, although a farmer who burns their
luggage after a chainsaw accident, hoping to limit his liability,
is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Warmth, charm, and a humane waywardness are the lifeblood of
this film. It stays optimistic through the pair's gently comic
missteps. It believes that there's such a thing as being lucky in
love and plays the luck out in unexpected ways. The end seems a bit
forced, although it is disarming. There's never any doubt about
Poirier's affection for his two heart-on-sleeve bumblers, whose
appeal lies partly in the fact that they never attempt to force
themselves on anybody. Poirier likes his pilgrims and you will,
too, as they modestly work at shoring up their respective
identities in the new multicultural France.

CATALOGS HAVE FIRM GRIP ON BUYERS, JOIN FORCES WITH ONLINE
MERCHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who gets mail knows catalogs accumulate faster than dryer
lint, and they're a lot heavier. So it's no surprise to hear from
the Direct Marketing Association that there are at least 8,000
catalogs generating an expected $87 billion in business this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the statistics Amy Blankenship spews as
director of the DMA's shop-at-home information center.
</P>
<P>
   Today's catalogs may be less hefty and more specialized than
their weighty ancestors, but they're not being eclipsed by online
shopping services.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're joining up, making catalogs like JCPenney,
LLBean and Lands' End available in hand or on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship was in Seattle last week for a DMA-sponsored
marketing conference, telling anyone who would listen how to shop
the Net and/or catalogs successfully, while sharing online and
catalog shopping trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know you could have a complete clambake _ lobsters and
all _ sent by Clambakes to Go catalog via Federal Express? Or how
about a bright red British phone booth from Design Toscano _ a
catalog that also offers suits of armor.
</P>
<P>
   While food and gifts are popular with at-home shoppers, they
can't compare with clothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to DMA research, clothing accounts for about 33
percent of all catalog purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies even offer personal shoppers who can pull
together a wardrobe for a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers, on the other hand, focus on computers and
peripherals, as well as books and music.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping is a growing category _ especially now that some
catalogs allow shoppers to mix and match wares on screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Net-shopping is still way behind catalogs in dollar volume.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship says catalog shoppers will spend about $87 billion
this year, while online shoppers will spend about $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship has a knack for putting a positive spin on what some
consider the negative side of at-home shopping.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a congressman's press secretary in Washington,
D.C., before moving to New York and taking the DMA job a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's not aware that at-home shoppers sometimes find
that clothing that looks glamorous on the screen or page will be of
poor quality when it arrives, or that shipping costs can send the
price of an item into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the order form before placing an order,'' Blankenship
said. ``Companies use different services to get orders to
consumers. Ask about different shipping options.''
</P>
<P>
   Home shoppers don't have to pay local taxes if the catalog
doesn't have a physical presence or nexus in their state, according
to Blankenship.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States,''
she said. ``It would be extremely hard for companies to keep track
of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't a hot seller on the Net or in catalogs? Blankenship
hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, there haven't been a lot of cosmetics sold, but
the Body Shop is doing direct business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to DMA research, only about 5 percent of all shipments
are returned, and some companies make it easier than others to
return merchandise _ with an enclosed return label and free return
postage, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship encouraged shoppers to always read the customer
service section of a catalog or Web site for return/exchange
policies. Computer software and recorded music that can be
duplicated are sometimes not returnable, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for successful catalog shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Amy Blankenship, director of the shop-at-home information center
for the Direct Marketing Association has dozens of helpful hints to
make shopping at home successful. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   _When you find a catalog with good merchandise and service, tell
others.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask questions. Service representatives who answer phones are
usually trained to help with your purchasing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep records. Even when ordering by phone, fill in the order
blank, date it and file it away. Once merchandise arrives, save the
receipt, packaging and literature until you are certain you are
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   _Never give personal information such as bank account or Social
Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _If it's a ``special offer'' or involves a ``trial period,''
read the fine print and know your obligations before you join or
purchase. These offers are often linked to book, music and
collectibles ``clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   _Never send cash through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   _When shoping online, make sure you are on a secure site. If the
URL on the ``checkout'' page starts with https:// it means the
document is from a secure server.
</P>
<P>
   _When a shipping date cannot be met (30 days maximum unless
otherwise specified), the supplier must notify you of a new date.
</P>
<P>
   _Need more catalogs in your mailbox? The DMA publishes the Great
Catalog Guide featuring more than 270 different catalog companies
listed according to products and/or services. Send $3 check or
money order to: Consumer Services Department, Direct Marketing
Association, P.O. Box 33033, Washington, DC 20033-0033.
</P>
<P>
   _Problems? Home shoppers have options when a catalog company has
not resolved a complaint in an acceptable, timely manner. The DMA's
Mail Order Action Line is a free service, but requests for help
must be in writing, sent to: Mail Order Action Line, Direct
Marketing Association, 1111 19th St. N.W., Suite 1100, Washington,
DC 20036-3603. Include details about your order, the catalog
company, explanation of the problem, photocopies of documents,
copies of canceled checks and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   _If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.

ALL DOLLED-UP SPICE GIRLS SASHY INTO THE NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop-music history is littered with the memories of slickly
packaged, teen-oriented acts that sold millions of records before
disappearing into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to New Kids on the Block, anyway? And Menudo?
Vanilla Ice? Word has it he's still trying to make a comeback, if
only he would show up when he's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them, like the Monkees and Duran Duran, actually had
talent. Fewer still had true greatness. Take the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Spice (a k a Geri Halliwell) got out while the gettin'
was good. But she was a bit premature, quitting as she did just
before the start of the group's much-publicized U.S. tour. There
are still millions to be made pushing bubble-gum feminism and
peddling records, toys, dolls and all sorts of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Spice, who abruptly quit in May, missed her chance at
becoming a real doll.
</P>
<P>
   Her former Spicemates _ Scary (Melanie Brown), Sporty (Melanie
Chisholm), Posh (Victoria Adams) and Baby (Emma Bunton) _ are being
immortalized in a series of products manufactured by Toymax
International Inc., the company that brought you Creepy Crawlers.
</P>
<P>
   Though doomed to turn up on the swap-meet circuit, these dolls
and other toys will be treasured by young fans eager to cuddle with
something other than a poster, video or CD.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spice Girls' U.S. tour rolls into the Northwest for a
concert Saturday night, the big video screens will be pushin'
product _ from T-shirts and programs to cosmetics and soft drinks.
Hey, if The Artist (formerly known as Prince) can shamelessly fill
his concerts with product pitches, why not the Spice Girls?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from commercials, the show should be pretty soundly
entertaining for fans. The four Spice Girls perform with a live
backup band, six male dancers, prerecorded background vocals and
enough costumes to stock a fashion boutique.
</P>
<P>
   It's a flashy, giddy, high-flying show that attracts legions of
young, screaming girls. Parents who accompany their kids to the
Tacoma Dome will be absolutely dumbstruck by the sound of thousands
of high-pitched voices at full volume. It's enough to make you
queasy.
</P>
<P>
   The song list, which is heavily weighted with material from the
Spice Girls' two albums, ``Spice'' (1996) and ``Spiceworld''
(1997), encompasses various styles of pop music _ disco, reggae,
hip-hop, neo-swing and hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a slight feminist tone to the show are such songs as ``We
Are Family'' and ``Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Spice Girls' own songs, you can bet they'll perform such
tunes as ``The Lady Is a Vamp,'' ``Spice Up Your Life,'' ``Saturday
Night Divas,'' ``Move Over,'' ``Two Become One'' and ``Naked,''
which is done bare-shouldered with some teasing, suggestive props.
</P>
<P>
   Members also live up to their names with special costumes and
hair-dos. Baby sports ponytails and baby-doll dresses, Sporty wears
a soccer jersey and Scary favors a leopard-skin outfit. Posh simply
strives to look stylish and demure.
</P>
<P>
   When the show recently played in New York, many of the videos
hadn't yet been revamped to reflect Ginger's departure. Indeed,
life must be moving so fast for the group that precious little time
is available for a post-Ginger makeover. Even the the group's new
video, ``Spice World,'' which hit stores in June, features Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might have expected Ginger to come up with an interesting
solo gig. But thus far, only Scary has taken on an extracurricular
project, cutting a track with rapper Missy Elliot for the Frankie
Lymon biopic ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Spice Girls haven't been terribly forthright
regarding Ginger's hasty exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was a shock,'' Baby recently told Entertainment
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she just had different ideas about what she wanted to do.
And we've always been behind each other a hundred percent.
Fundamentally, the Spice Girls are about friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scary: ``She just wanted to move on and do her own thing.
... We support her and say good luck.''

ADJUSTING A 401(K) FOR RETIREMENT DRAWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 69 years old and will be retiring next January. I will
receive Social Security and a company pension, I would like to know
the approximate maximum that I could expect to receive from my
401(k) each month without drawing from the principal. I attach a
statement, and a breakdown of the investment alternatives that are
available.
</P>
<P>
   F.H., Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you wanted to get a strong income stream from your
401(k) with very little prospect of a reduction in principal, you'd
have to rearrange the portfolio fairly substantially. It s pretty
well positioned right now for a person in your situation -- just
approaching retirement. You have 59 percent of the money in stock
funds, with the largest stock position in Fidelity Equity Income
fund. On the fixed-income side, you have a total of 41 percent --
most of it in an Interest Income fund, but I also counted 37
percent of your holdings in Fidelity Puritan as fixed-income
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   To get the highest prudent income stream, you might put all of
the money in offerings such as the Interest Income fund and the
GNMA offering, (which I assume, like most of the offerings, is
Fidelity s,) and Fidelity U.S. Bond Index. Such a portfolio ought
to produce a yield of about 6.5 percent, which would mean $21,981,
or $1,832 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with doing that is that while good bond funds
should retain their value over the long haul (although some
short-term periods can be very bumpy) there s very small prospect
for principal growth, and growth of principal is what you need when
inflation starts digging into the buying power of your income
stream.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason I hope you can work out a budget that calls for
only about $1,500 monthly withdrawals from the fixed-income side.
This would allow you to leave about $50,000 of your 401(k) savings
in a solid fund such as Fidelity Equity Income, and should make
your situation more solid in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are 55 years old and my husband will probably work 10 more
years. We have $110,000 in IRAs in American Century-Benham Target
Maturity 2005, $15,000 in Vanguard Wellington fund, $27,000 in
Vanguard High-Yield Municipal Bond fund, $10,000 in Vanguard Asset
Allocation fund, and $25,000 in a CD. My husband has $13,000 in a
401(k) program at his place of employment.
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell, our investments are very conservative because
we have little investment knowledge. Do you suggest any changes? We
have $30,000 in a savings account we would like to invest now. We
feel we have waited too long to prepare for retirement. Please
help.
</P>
<P>
   How much do we need to have invested to receive $25,000 a year
to supplement my husband s pension and our Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, since the answer to your last question is a little less
than $385,000, and since your current portfolio is likely to take
you well beyond that point during the course of the next 10 years,
you haven t done so poorly. To get that figure, I presumed that you
could achieve average 6.5 percent returns from a fixed-income
portfolio with a mild smattering of stocks -- a portfolio very much
like the one you now hold.
</P>
<P>
   Let s suppose your current savings of $226,000 achieves that 6.5
percent target over the next decade; its value would then be
$428,011, nicely above the target figure. Moreover, that figure
doesn t include the effect of any ongoing savings you might make,
or of continuing contributions to your husband s 401(k) program.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do those figures it include that $30,000 that you re
thinking of investing more aggressively. I have long noticed a
frequent common denominator in my mailbag -- that people who feel,
correctly or not, that they ve waited too long to focus directly on
retirement are most prone to make mistakes; just at the time they
should be beginning to reduce risk they want to crank it up in
hopes of catching up.
</P>
<P>
   As I outlined above, you are in a good position to meet your
target of having $25,000 income to supplement your pension and
Social Security. So what remains for you to worry about is the
effect of inflation on your income stream after retirement. For
that reason I suggest this: Treat your current portfolio (plus the
401(k) as your primary retirement pool, and keep it invested
substantially as it is. Then take that $30,000 account and treat
that as your inflation-fighting account. Given your current
portfolio, I m not going to suggest anything more aggressive than
you now have. The most volatile (and most potentially rewarding)
segment of your current portfolio is the holding in Vanguard
Wellington, a balanced fund that has a little more than 62 percent
of its portfolio in stocks and the rest in bonds and other
fixed-income issues. This fund has a long and excellent record,
easily demonstrating the summary of Morningstar Mutual Funds --
above-average, with average returns and below-average risk. But don
t jump in all at once. If you ve read this column very often, you
know I m very jumpy about the current market. Therefore I suggest
you employ a discipline called dollar cost averaging. For example,
you might initially put $833 of the money into Wellington, moving
the balance to Vanguard s Prime Money Market fund. You could then
instruct Vanguard to move a similar amount into Wellington each
month. If we presume average 5 percent returns from the money
market, this would spread the investment period out over the course
of 36 months, and the slow process of establishing your investment
would reduce the carnage if the market took a spill at some point
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if all goes according to schedule, you won t have to think
about that money when you retire. You ll have your other funds to
supplement your pension and Social Security. It s another 10 years
down the road that you re worried about -- when inflation will have
cut the buying power of the pension, and when that $25,000
supplement isn t doing so well either. That s when you can look to
the pool you established in Wellington for help. And if you
achieved average 10 percent returns from this pool over those 20
years (and I think this is a reasonable expectation, even counting
in the current markets and the dollar-cost- averaging hedge at the
beginning) it would amount to $201,824 -- a nice present for
yourselves on the tin anniversary of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What suggestion do you have for someone 38 years old who is
inheriting $10,000 and who wants to retire well? Where to put the
money to keep it multiplying fast but safely?
</P>
<P>
   S.D., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When you re 25 years or so away from retirement, the question
of safety becomes relative; it s such a long investment time frame
that what would seem like a fairly risky vehicle over any four- or
five-year period becomes a great deal less risky. I m speaking, of
course, about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get into considering the thousands of possible
market investments, it s better to begin by thinking about taxes.
If you simply bought a stock, or shares of a mutual fund, you would
face potential tax bills during each of those 25 or so years --
every time you got a dividend, or swapped stock holdings, or got a
capital gains distributions (if you chose a mutual fund), Uncle
would have his hand out. If you qualify for to open an IRA, I
suggest you put $8,000 of the money into a money market mutual fund
and the other $2,000 into a Roth IRA invested in Vanguard Index 500
portfolio -- a mutual fund which seeks to duplicate the results of
the Standard and Poor s 500 Index, which tracks the nation s
largest 500 companies. Each year as you become eligible to do so,
move another $2,000 into the Roth IRA. The result? By the time you
re 65 years old you should have $109,365, a calculation that
presumes 5 percent returns from the money market fund for the six
years during which you will have the account in existence, and 10
percent average annual returns from the Index 500 fund. Obviously,
$109,365 isn t enough to allow anybody to retire well, but it sure
wouldn t hurt, would it?

METS ARE SINGING THE BOOS OVER MIKE PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Piazza undoubtedly will be hurt and confused to learn there
are no plans in the works for a telethon on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, the best hitting-catcher in baseball history doesn't
need much provocation to take offense. Trapped inside a 6-foot-3,
215-pound catcher's body are feelings that bruise as easily as
Chuck Wepner used to bleed in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers offered Piazza $84 million this past
spring _ on top of the $8 million he is pulling down this year _ to
grace their lineup with his presence through the 2005 season. After
careful consultation with his agent, Piazza decided that such an
offer constituted an insult. Piazza wanted $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Well, who doesn't want $100 million? But Piazza managed to
convince himself he was entitled to the sort of money that would
embarrass Mark McGwire. In more ways than one, Mike Piazza is no
Mark McGwire. Which is how it came to be that a 29-year-old catcher
who has played in the All-Star game six years in a row is playing
for his third team this season. Less than three months after they
gave Piazza a hero's welcome, New York Mets fans are singing the
boos. They've rehearsed the tune so often at Shea Stadium, they can
spit out their hot dogs in mid-bite and not miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza pops out weakly with a runner in scoring position.
Boooooo! Piazza grounds out with a runner in scoring position.
Boooooo!! Piazza strikes out with a runner in scoring position.
Boooooo!!! By Piazza's admission, he is hitting a ``soft'' .307
this season.
</P>
<P>
   His batting average with runners in scoring position is plunging
like necklines on ``Baywatch.'' Even though the Mets are in
contention for a wild-card playoff berth, Piazza mopes around with
the wounded look of a puppy who can't figure out why he keeps
getting whacked on the head by a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza deserves as much sympathy as the next guy who takes a
$12-million-a-year offer to stay in a city where the fans worship
him as an affront. How soon people on the top forget what it was
like in the real world. Just a decade ago, Piazza went in the 62nd
round (No. 1,390 overall) of the free-agent draft. The Dodgers took
Piazza only because his godfather, then-manager Tom Lasorda, begged
them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was a match made in, well, Hollywood. Piazza started his
career with a series of bangs that would humble any right-handed
hitter this side of Joe DiMaggio. Even with the strike taking a
chunk out of 1994, Piazza averaged .337 with 33 homers and 105 runs
batted in over his first five seasons. Those are the numbers
befitting a perennial All-Star outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Or a first-ballot Hall of Fame catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Bench averaged .267 with 34 homers and 113 RBI during his
best five-year run. Roy Campanella averaged .296 with 30 homers and
104 RBI during his best five-year run. Yogi Berra averaged .299
with 27 homers and 109 RBI during his best five-year run. Dodgers
fans loved Piazza unconditionally, right up to the moment they
realized he didn't love them back.
</P>
<P>
   That rude awakening came when the season began, and Piazza was
complaining about what a toll that not knowing if he'd get his $100
million from the Dodgers was taking on him. The Dodgers offered
Piazza the biggest contract in major-league history, and that
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   He revealed himself to be just another mercenary, which is his
prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a price to pay for following the almighty dollar:
Employers and paying customers expect nothing less than the best.
Before Piazza burned bridges in Los Angeles, fans could have
forgiven Piazza _ even suffered with him _ for his struggles this
season. He'd produced for them in the past. He was one of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   New York fans, on the other hand, have precious few memories of
Piazza doing anything but letting them down in the clutch. They see
a hired gun who isn't earning his $8 million keep this year. They
see somebody who is likely to leave them after the season, so they
don't even realize that _ struggles and all _ Piazza is on pace to
finish the season with 27 homers and 91 RBI. One hot streak and
Piazza could be on his way to another 30-homer, 100-RBI finish. One
hot streak and Piazza could carry the Mets into the playoffs, at
which point anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Power hitters by nature are streaky _ capable of going boom or
bust without a moment's warning. Clearly, Piazza is pressing at the
plate, pressing like never in his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough year mentally,'' Piazza calls it, and whether he
brought it on himself should be immaterial to Mets fans at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   The more they boo him, the less likely he is to go off on the
sort of rampages that Mets management envisioned when they made the
May 22 trade. The more they boo him, the less likely Piazza is to
spend one New York minute considering signing with the Mets after
the season. The more they boo him, the less likely it is that the
Mets will regret giving up three prospects to rent a player whose
presence caused catcher Todd Hundley the embarrassment of trying to
play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza is going to be a tremendous force in this town,''
Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon was saying in May, when Piazza was still
a conquering hero. ``This is a guy who could become the kind of
player people talked about who played in New York 30, 40, 50 years
ago. We're talking (Mickey) Mantle, (Willie) Mays, DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans have every right to boo Piazza, boo him out of town,
boo him all the way to the Hall of Fame. Still, it seems a peculiar
and self-destructive way to go about making the best of the
situation. Having the right to boo doesn't make it right,
especially if Mets fans hope to have any sort of meaningful
relationship with Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Mets and Mike Piazza have had the most
dysfunctional courtship since Michael Douglas and Glenn Close got
together for a couple of drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a fatal attraction.

CONSIDER UPGRADING APPLICATIONS IN LIEU OF USING NEW, OLD WINDOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Windows 98 is out, but I want to keep Windows 3.1 on my
system as well. I know you can install both Windows 95 and 98 and
still keep Windows 3.1, but can I go ahead and use my Windows 3.1
applications with the Windows 98 installation? Or will I have to
reinstall them all over again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, if you decide to have both operating systems
on your computer, you will have to reinstall your applications.
</P>
<P>
   When you install Windows 95 or 98 in a folder other than your
system's current Windows folder, it doesn't pick up settings from
your Windows 3.1 setup. If you try to launch your applications from
Windows 98, they become confused and are likely to crash.
</P>
<P>
   If you reinstall them and point them to your Windows 98 setup,
you might render them useless in your Windows 3.1 configuration.
You may have to have two separate installations of your favorite
applications, which would take up lots of hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   It might be worth it to begin upgrading to Windows 95/98
versions of your favorite applications, rather than try to
reinstall your old Windows 3.1 programs with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having a problem with my modem and America Online. I can
connect once to AOL, but unless I turn my computer on and off, I
cannot connect again. I get a message saying that COM2 is being
used by another device.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have an external modem, you can usually turn it on and
off to fix this problem. But with an internal model, there's a
nifty little way to reset it using the Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Open the Windows 95/98 Control Panel and launch the Modems
module. Click on the Diagnostics tab and you'll get a box that
shows you the communications ports and modems on your computer.
Click on the modem listing, then click the More Info button.
</P>
<P>
   This will cause the modem to dump its internal information.
You'll get a snapshot of the current settings, and, as a happy
byproduct, your modem will be reset.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one other thing to check. Make sure you don't have any
software that ``listens'' for incoming phone line activity, such as
a voice-mail or fax program. Disable these _ they also can cause
this kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's also possible that your modem could be defective.
Have it checked by a qualified technician.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some friends and I heard on TV news recently about a virus
that would affect Windows 95 and 98. We have not heard anything
else since. You were not to turn on your computer Sunday for any
reason or you would be infected. Can you tell us what is going on
with this new virus, and should we be concerned with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a very nasty virus called W95.CIH. Fortunately, it's
rare, and it's not that new. The scare you heard Saturday, July 25,
was a bit of an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   W95.CIH is a virus that harms a computer in two ways. First, it
erases a system's hard drive. Second, if the system has a flash
BIOS _ a BIOS that can be reprogrammed _ it will scramble that
BIOS, rendering the PC unusable.
</P>
<P>
   It plants itself into EXE files on Windows 95 and 98 systems,
and when those programs are run, moves into memory and infects
other files. The most common strain activates on the 26th of every
month, not just July 26. There are strains that activate April 26
and June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Popular virus scanners, such as McAfee VirusScan and Norton
AntiVirus, can detect and remove it. But as I said, it is rare. If
you regularly scan your system, you should be fine. There's no need
to keep your computer off on the 26th of each month.

PERFECT PORTABLE COMPUTER REMAINS ELUSIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building the perfect small computer seems easy. Make it tiny,
fast, powerful, easy to use and with long battery life. And, oh
yeah _ make it cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this so hard?
</P>
<P>
   I've spent the last few weeks looking at smaller-than-usual
portable computers, ranging from a Windows 98 sub-notebook system
to a ``palmtop.'' While they all fall into the category of
Generally Cool, each has at least one drawback that keeps me from
moving it under the still-empty category headed: Perfect Portable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vaio 505GX, $2,700, Sony: The 505 line is one of the hottest
notebooks in the world right now, and at first glance it's easy to
see why. On the surface, this looks like the ultimate portable PC.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredibly light, at just under 3 pounds. It's thin, at
less than an inch thick. And it's a got a small footprint, 11-by-7
inches. If you're a road warrior, you'll barely notice its presence
in your briefcase as you dash between appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The 505GX has a 266-megahertz Pentium MMX chip, 32 megabytes of
memory and a 2.1-gigabyte hard drive. It comes with a brilliant
10.1-inch active matrix screen that can display in resolutions up
to 800-by-600 pixels in 24-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   Its pointing device is a touchpad that also doubles as a writing
tablet. You can use a built-in stylus on the pad to sign documents
or draw simple pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a 33.6K modem, a single PC-card slot, a Universal
Serial Bus port and a IEEE 1394 connection, also known as iLink or
Firewire. Sony added this so you can attach a camcorder and edit
videos on the Vaio.
</P>
<P>
   What's been left out to make this so slim and light? There are
no removable drives _ the CD and floppy drives are external (and
the CD-ROM drive is an extra-cost option). Sony also has placed the
traditional ports _ monitor, parallel, serial mouse and keyboard _
on a small external unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a dream machine, right? Well, there are a few
problems. First, if you've got big fingers, the
not-quite-full-sized keyboard will drive you nuts. I've got
average-sized hands, and while typing answers to e-mail was
tolerable, typing a lengthy document was not.
</P>
<P>
   And the touchpad leaves a lot to be desired. It was impossible
to set the sensitivity just right. It was either too sluggish or
too jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the battery life was poor _ I was lucky if I could get
two hours out of the slim cell that's stored in the 505GX's hinge.
Also, power management on the system slows everything down, making
performance abysmal _ it felt like a 486 system. When plugged into
AC power, though, the 505GX was plenty zippy.
</P>
<P>
   If Sony can work out some of these flaws _ particularly making
the keyboard a tad bigger and stabilizing the touchpad _ this could
easily be a home-run product.
</P>
<P>
   _ C-Series 2010C, $900, Compaq Computer Corp.: Compaq's first
system using Microsoft's Windows CE operating system was a bomb,
largely due to a Chiclet-style keyboard and a horrible
black-and-white display that was hard to see in almost any kind of
light.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq learned many lessons from that first product, dubbed the
PC Companion, and fixed them nicely with its C-Series.
</P>
<P>
   The 2010C is packed into a case that's about the size of a
checkbook on steroids and weighs just under a pound. It comes with
20 megabytes of memory, a 640-by-240-pixel passive matrix color
screen and a built-in 33.6K modem, which operates at relatively low
power. In earlier Windows CE units, a modem could drain a battery
in minutes _ this one does much better.
</P>
<P>
   The C-Series 2010C also comes with a feature that lets you
record quick memos to yourself. However, this will drain your
batteries quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The 256-color screen makes all the difference in the world. I've
always liked the Windows CE operating system _ it's great if you
are familiar with Windows 95/98 _ and version 2.0 is even better.
It comes with improved versions of Word, Excel, Internet Explorer
and an e-mail client that works a lot like Outlook and Outlook
Express.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great e-mail machine and organizer, but don't expect
it to do much more than that. The keyboard, while improved, is
useless for longer documents.
</P>
<P>
   _ PalmIII, $400, 3Com.: The PalmIII is the latest incarnation of
3Com's hand-held line previously known as the PalmPilot. These
6-ounce devices, which can fit in a dress-shirt pocket, have
developed a cult following that rivals that of the now-discontinued
Apple Newton.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no wonder. The PalmIII is a nifty device, though
extremely limited in its capabilities. However, that's by design;
it doesn't try to be all things.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmIII comes with two megabytes of memory (enough to hold
up to 6,000 contacts), an infrared port for wireless connections, a
docking station for connecting to your PC and a handful of built-in
software programs. Searching and retrieving information is
lightning-fast, which makes this hand-held device perfect for
storing information you need to get quickly.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy add-ons that extend the Palm's capabilities, turning
it into a pager or e-mail retriever. However, the latter is
something of a kludge _ you must dial up the PC where you get your
e-mail, and then download from there. You can't connect directly to
an e-mail server.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm's built-in software is simple and very intuitive.
Transferring data is foolproof _ you just push a button on the
Palm's docking station to synchronize everything.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to use it, though, is to rely on entering
information via your PC, then dumping it into the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Palm's main flaw is its reliance on
handwriting recognition. It uses Graffiti, a program that converts
specially designed letters into standard text. Unfortunately, you
must train yourself to use stylized characters, which, with my
notoriously nasty handwriting, I found quite tedious. You can fall
back to using an onscreen keyboard, but it's very slow going.
</P>
<P>
   I really like the Palm, even if it falls short of perfection.
But then, don't they all?

<HEADLINE>
DEFINING SPARKLE THAT MAKES A STAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everybody would probably like to be a star at work.
</P>
<P>
   But only 10 to 15 percent of workers are widely recognized as
innovative employees who do more than their share of the work,
according to Robert Kelley, author of the new book, ``How to Be a
Star at Work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, who has made something of a career studying what
differentiates a top performer from a so-so one as a management
professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, found that
many people think stars are either really smart or they have a good
personality brimming with self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some also think being a star comes from ``impression
management'' _ buying the right power clothes or carrying the power
accoutrements _ that distinguishes the top from the hum-drum. After
all, some of those guys in fancy pants have gotten ahead, Kelley
theorized, so maybe there's something to power ties.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those theories _ 45 in all _ held up after extensive
testing, he said. After studying the people that bosses, co-workers
and customers identified as stars, Kelley came up with nine traits
that tend to spell success _ all of which can be learned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Initiative: Most people think they have it but they don't,
Kelley said. Initiative is doing something outside your regular job
that makes a difference, he said. It's not carrying a tape recorder
to a meeting after your boss has asked you to take notes. That's
just part of your job.
</P>
<P>
   Along with initiative, good employees find relevance in their
work in many parts of their lives, said Tony Rosenstein, widely
regarded as a top-notch employment lawyer in Houston. It's caring
enough about your job to think about legal issues in the shower, he
said. One local lawyer is known for taping the seedy daytime talk
shows so he can keep his pulse on the programs his potential jurors
are watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Networking: The average performer thinks networking is keeping
up with the office gossip or handing out business cards at industry
luncheons. Stars, however, build a knowledge network so they know
how to get things done. They get information three to five times
faster and consequently, top performers tend to work less than
average performers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self management: Typical performers think of time management;
stars think about managing their whole life at work, Kelley said.
They think of the skills they need to stay marketable and then go
after them. They don't wait around for the boss to suggest a
training class like average performers do.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he is willing to admit the moral superiority of an
employee who keeps a clean desk but after extensive testing, he
found that the tidiness of an employee's desk has nothing to do
with star power. Stars can _ and often do _ have messy desks. Yeah!
</P>
<P>
   _ Perspective: Average performers have tunnel vision, Kelley
said. Stars develop multiple perspectives _ of customers,
competitors, co-workers and bosses _ and use those different
viewpoints, especially in a fast-growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, that tunnel vision has plagued human resource
executives because they haven't measured their results in concrete
terms and failed to show their value to an organization, said
Kathleen Fenninger, president of the Houston Human Resource
Management Association. Fenninger, who also is director of staffing
and retention for Enron Capital &AMP; Trade Resources Corp., is urging
executives to use specific measurement tools to gauge their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Followership: Stars learn to be good second fiddles, Kelley
said. If you help others, they look out for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leadership: The average performer thinks that means charisma.
Stars use persuasion to get people to do things. They understand
people's interests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teamwork: Most folks think that's a no-brainer in this
teamwork-driven society and spend too much time on teams. Top
performers are choosier and will only join teams that will make a
difference. That way, they save their energy for the important
issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Organizational savvy: Mediocre performers call that office
politics, while the stars view the office scene as competing
legitimate interests. Stars get to know the players and develop
credibility before they get into tough situations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Show and tell: The ho-hum performer doesn't consider his
audience when he makes a presentation. A star focuses on the
audience before he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the list seems impressive, Sara Childers, assistant
manager of the Southwest Airlines telephone reservation center in
Houston, said it didn't have the ingredient she considers the most
important: fun on the job.
</P>
<P>
   It's that special glimmer on someone's face that shows humor and
professionalism that makes a star, Childers said.

   TAKE-BOS  
 (f and a coding)  
 CARLSTADT, N.J.:... such as Mills Corp.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everything about Meadowlands Mills would be gigantic. It
would be the largest shopping mall in New Jersey. Together with an
adjacent office center and 1,000-room hotel, it would include more
than 5 million square feet of space, or the equivalent of two or
three pairs of Boston's Copley Place and Prudential Tower. It would
have parking for 17,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental aspects of the project are equally massive. It
would require filling 206 acres of the Meadowlands' already
diminished marshes, an amount federal officials say would be one of
the largest fills since the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act,
the law that protects wetlands from filling and dumping.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the proposed fill's size _ about one third of the
full 600 acres slated for the project _ is not the principal reason
it is controversial. The company and its experts argue that the
area was so mistreated in the past _ cut off from the Hackensack
River by the turnpike, filled up with trash and overrun by
phragmites, a sort of monster crabgrass that can grow to 15 feet _
that it barely functions as a wetlands anymore, and virtually
everybody involved in the mall battle agrees.
</P>
<P>
   But the company goes one step further. It says that the area can
never recover on its own, but can only come back with human help.
And it makes this offer: If Mills is allowed to fill and build its
mall, it will spend up to $25 million repairing an adjacent 300
acres of similarly damaged land.
</P>
<P>
   The offer has driven a huge wedge between environmental groups,
between federal agencies, and, as if they weren't already at odds,
between Smith and Sheehan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friction within
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with either man and it becomes clear they don't like
each other. But more is at work than a simple personality clash.
The pair represents the poles of compromise and confrontation that
are at center of the Mills controversy and have tugged at the
environmental movement from its very inception.
</P>
<P>
   At another time, Smith and Sheehan's disagreement might not have
attracted much attention. But not today. That's because wetlands
are a hot topic. In February, President Clinton made them the
centerpiece of his new environmental initiative with a promise to
add 100,000 acres a year to the nation's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the state agency for which he works, the Hackensack
Meadowsland Development Commission, believe the only way to protect
wetlands is to cut deals like the one Mills is offering. In fact,
they have spent more than a decade trying to sell
environmentalists, developers and government officials on a similar
development-for-environmental protection deal that would cover the
entire Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging across the marshes on a recent afternoon, the
commission's senior naturalist summed up his agency's view of the
region this way: ``We broke it; we've got to fix it. This is not a
pristine area. There are a lot of things that are not going to get
better and go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan concedes compromises may have been necessary when the
commission started its cleanup in the late 1960s. But he argues
that with development having claimed almost two-thirds of the
Meadowlands' 23,000 acres, the time for deal-making is done.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Kennedy's group, which recently named him a
kind of chief advocate for the Hackensack, Sheehan has lined up
impressive opposition to both the Mills project and the
Meadowlands-wide plan. In an unusual move, leaders of virtually
every major environmental group in the country wrote the White
House in February saying that in return for their politically
crucial support of the president's environmental initiative, they
want Clinton to fight the project and the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan's idea of how to resolve the dispute is simple: Mills
should build the project elsewhere, either on an irreparably
damaged tract in the Meadowlands or in a nearby city like Newark.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour of the Meadowlands that featured egrets lifting
off a marsh pond, but also garbage oozing from a riverbank and the
steady hiss of traffic on the New Jersy Turnpike, he was asked: Do
you really think this is beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a native of this area and being of limited means,'' he
explained, ``the Meadowlands are my Everglades, the Hackensack is
my Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbing in his boat along the banks of the flat, featureless
mall site one day recently, he expressed confidence that, with
time, the area will again become a rich green marsh. ``The river
will decide what it wants that area to be,'' he said. ``Whatever it
decides, whenever it decides it, that's good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But a new threat appears to be bearing down on Sheehan and on
the environmental movement generally, one that could make it much
harder to fight projects like the Mills proposal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New legal landscape
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The threat is a string of Supreme Court cases that have expanded
the notion of ``takings,'' the constitutional prohibition against
the government taking a person's property without ``just
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a government agency could generally limit an
owner's use of his land through zoning or other rules without
violating that prohibition. However, beginning in the late 1980s,
property owners and conservative legal groups succeeded in
convincing the high court that a broad array of government actions
that were not considered violations in the past are in fact
takings.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, officials worry that the government
could end up having to pay property owners to impose almost any
restriction, something that it is unlikely to do in
budget-balancing times such as these.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and regulators are scambling to avoid that
outcome by devising news ways to strike compromises with landowners
with property in environmentally sensitive areas like wetlands. And
they think that they have found the model for such deals in, of all
places, the Meadowlands commission's development-for-environment
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, some owners, such as those who own the Mills
site, would be allowed to develop part of their property in return
for pledging to keep the rest natural. Others would be prohibited
from developing at all, but would be compensated by payments from
those who could develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach a reasonable compromise (over the commission's
plan) we will have shown that this type of comprehensive planning
can be used to protect the environment across the country,'' said
Campbell, the White House environmental aide.
</P>
<P>
   Without a compromise, officials fear that Mills will file a
lawsuit that could result in the Supreme Court expanding its notion
of takings even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't reach an agreement here, you're going to end up
with a takings case the likes of which this country has never
seen,'' warned Robert W. Hargrove, a senior official with the New
York regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSTADT, N.J. _ For generations, people traveling up and down
the Eastern Seaboard have known where to expect the dirtiest,
ugliest, most stench-filled stretch of their trips _ here in the
Meadowlands of northern New Jersy.
</P>
<P>
   Since European settlement of this region three centuries ago,
New Yorkers and New Jerseyites have been dumping things they don't
want in these soft marshes, creating a mess of almost
incomprehensible proportions. For several decades, large swaths of
the area were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But largely unnoticed in recent years, the Meadowlands have
begun to come back, and, in a backhanded compliment to their
progress, they are now the focus of a fierce battle over whether to
bend federal wetlands policy to allow new development, including
construction of a huge new mall.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is becoming a flashpoint for one of the big
environmental questions of the era: Should the nation permit some
development of damaged natural areas, like many of those in the
Meadowlands, in return for agreements to save others, or should it
insist that all land covered by environmental laws be strictly
protected? The answer is of burning interest both to landowners and
to environmental activists, and could influence projects from
Massachusetts to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration touts the Meadowlands as a national
model for how to strike a balance between the environment and
property rights. But if the development plan that allows the mall
goes through, it would be a national disaster,'' said Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., the namesake son of the assassinated New York senator
and the chief attorney for the National Alliance of River, Sound
and Baykeepers, the group that is spearheading opposition to
further Meadowlands development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told we have all the makings of a tremendous lawsuit if
the decision is not in our favor,'' said Victoria L. Jenkins, an
executive with Mills Corp., an Arlington, Va.-based developer that
is awaiting federal permits to begin work on a $1 billion mall
called Meadowlands Mills. The company wants to build a similar mall
in South Weymouth on the South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't balance the envionment and development interests
in the Meadowlands...it will be a major setback for preservation
efforts across the country,'' warned Bradley M. Campbell, deputy
director of the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House
agency that entered the fight earlier this year to try to broker a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the idea that the Meadowlands is attracting so much
attention seems odd. After all, this is a place that was allowed to
collect more hazardous waste sites (three on the high-risk
Superfund list), more landfills (27, or about one every square
mile) and more serious pollution over the years than almost any
similar-sized tract in the nation. To others, the notion that all
the hubbub is over a shopping mall is downright laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we're not talking about virgin land in the
middle of Kansas,'' said Chip Hallock, president of the Commerce
and Industry Association of New Jersey, a business trade group.
``This is the shopping mall capital of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But at least a few people have begun to dream about a
very different future for the Meadowlands and have been encouraged
by recent changes in the land. For between the area's parking lots,
amid its spaghetti of highway interchanges, alongside its strangely
squared-off hills of garbage, herons and egrets have returned, the
spartina grass has started to grow again, and the marshes have
begun to mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, the Meadowlands is a testament to nature's
resilience against long odds,'' said John R. Quinn, a local
naturalist and author. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vantage points
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those driving south out of New England on I-95 across the
George Washington Bridge today, the Meadowlands still come as a
giant anticlimax, a flat industrial landscape that lets travelers
know they have made it past New York but gives them almost no clue
about where they have made it to. ``A place that people rush past
on their way to the rest of America,'' according to Robert
Sullivan, whose recent book ``The Meadowlands'' has attracted new
attention to the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists consider the area, together with Newark Bay, to be
one of the East Coast's great tidal estuaries, as important as the
Hudson River and New York harbor. But that's not how the
Meadowlands look from behind the wheel on the Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   From that vantage point, all that is apparent is a desolate
expanse, one that has often been home to strange and
not-always-pleasant occurences.
</P>
<P>
   Last month when New York heiress Irene Silverman disappeared
from her Manhattan townhouse, police were told the prime suspects
had been seen driving into the deep reeds of the Meadowlands in
Carlstadt. A search failed to produce a body, but did turn up a bag
full of fake Social Security cards. Three years ago, officials had
to evacuate hundreds of guests from a Meadowlands Days Inn when an
industrial yard next door blew up.
</P>
<P>
   But if events like these have convinced turnpike travelers that
the Meadowlands are an urban desert best left quickly, they have
not had a similar effect on the streets of Kearny, Secaucus and
Moonachie. Here, some residents behave as if they live at the very
edge of a wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the naturalist, has canoed the Meadowlands for decades
and has published a book about the area called ``Fields of Sun and
Grass.'' ``Not everybody has had the experience of camping in the
nocturnal glow of Giant Stadium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Just, the mayor of Secaucus, takes off occasional
afternoons to go out to Snake Hill, the blasted and
graffiti-covered outcropping that is the Meadowlands' tallest, and
just about its only, rise. ``It's a beautiful sight,'' he said of
the view. ``You can see the river bend around to Jersey City.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Smith, a naturalist with the state commission established in
the 1960s to clean up and develop the Meadowlands, and Bill
Sheehan, an environmental activist who works as a taxi dispatcher
in Union City, run rival boat tours along the Hackensack River,
which runs through the marshes. As school children gape at the
passing shoreline, they expound their drastically different views
of how to protect the area, views now on a collision course over
the Meadowlands Mills project.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Large scale
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of their history, the Meadowlands have had built-in
protection against overdevelopment. People couldn't figure out how
to build on the area's soggy soil. But with construction advances,
the land that once seemed useless has suddenly become attractive to
developers such as Mills Corp.

CYRK TIES FUTURE TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once a company that mostly made promotional T-shirts for the
likes of Reebok and Pepsi, Cyrk Inc. sees a big part of its future
in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its relationship with Yahoo Inc., the Internet search service,
is an example of how Cyrk hopes to expand its business beyond just
supplying Happy Meal toys for McDonald's and Marlboro Gear to
cigarette smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 12 years ago, Cyrk initially had a simple mission: It
made caps, shirts, and gym bags that big companies use to advertise
themselves and reward their most loyal customers. But now with help
of several acquisitions, the Gloucester, Mass. company is looking
to become something more as it begins to heavily promote a Yahoo
gear cyberstore it helped launch earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossing loyalty programs with electronic commerce is just one
of the new ways in which Cyrk is building brand value for its
clients,'' Cyrk notes hopefully in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks know how loyalty programs work. Save enough Pepsi
bottlecaps, and the bottlecaps can be redeemed for Pepsi-branded
merchandise that's featured in a special catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that consumers will have an incentive to load up on
Pepsi and that they won't be tempted to drink something else.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cyrk is experimenting with similar incentives for Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   On one front, Cyrk is assisting Yahoo with its branded credit
card. Those who sign up for a Yahoo Visa card qualify for the
equivalent of frequent flyer miles. As consumers pay for goods and
services with the credit card, Cyrk helps to electronically track
how many points an individual consumer has earned.
</P>
<P>
   In a traditional loyalty program, consumers have limited choices
for redeeming their coupons. For example, hoarded Marlboro coupons
can be swapped only for Marlboro Gear.
</P>
<P>
   But with an electronic loyalty progam, points can be used at any
number of cyberstores. In Yahoo's case, that includes on-line
bookstore Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   For Yahoo, the advantage of such a program is that it not only
provides Yahoo with an ``incremental revenue opportunity,'' but it
also encourages more on-line shopping over the Yahoo network, says
Laurel Rossi, Cyrk's chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the credit-card program, Cyrk operates a separate
cyberstore that sells Yahoo-branded gear such as shirts, clocks,
and slinky toys.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the goal here is to establish ``Yahoo as a household
name, a fun pop-culture brand,'' says Karen V. Edwards, Yahoo's
vice president of brand marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrk envisions its Yahoo relationships evolving into something
far more than T-shirt sales. One possibility is awarding points to
subscribers of Yahoo's electronic mail service; points could be
redeemed for discounts on Yahoo gear.
</P>
<P>
   The more e-mail a person sends, the more discounts he or she
might qualify for. The discounts would come in the form of an
e-mail coupon. And, of course, the more subscribers use Yahoo
e-mail, the more likely they will be exposed to the banner
advertising that Yahoo includes on its Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   For Cyrk, the Internet has the potential for shoring up a
weakness that has long dogged the company, a weakness that was one
reason it had to lay off nearly a third of its worldwide work force
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, Cyrk has had to rely heavily on a few
giant clients such as McDonald's and Marlboro because only such
``mega-brands'' have the resources to mount big loyalty rewards
programs, Rossi says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, nearly 90 percent of its revenues came from Philip
Morris Inc., and in Cyrk's last fiscal year, McDonald's Corp.
accounted for about a third of its $559 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rossi, the Internet helps make loyalty programs
affordable to smaller companies, partly by squeezing out the hassle
and high expense of paper coupons and paper catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   And so for Cyrk, the Internet may be an opportunity to lessen
its dependency on a few big customers and to establish ongoing
relationships with a wide range of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the leading promotional resource for the
world's best brands,'' says Dave Wilson, Cyrk's managing director
of client services.

BEAR MARKET'S INFLUENCE ON FUNDS WATCHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Having buckled their seat belts to sit tight through
Wall Street's tumultuous ride, mutual fund investors have displayed
steady-headed reason in holding onto their stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   But asset management firms and investment specialists were
divided Thursday over whether investors would show such
resoluteness and avoid panic-selling should a market correction
turn into an extended bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major fund groups have been preaching for some time that the
market's gains cannot be sustained,'' said Burton J. Greenwald, an
investment consultant in Philadelphia. ``But the real test will
come if the market drops to 8000.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors aren't thinking about what happens if things really
go down,'' added David Masters of MicropalInc., a fund consulting
firm. ``They're just waiting for it all to go back up again.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Americans have fallen for mutual funds this decade, funnelling
billions of dollars into stock funds and playing a major role in
stoking the bull market's run.
</P>
<P>
   But fund firms said Thursday that shareholders had shown once
again that they had learned to ride out market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that investors are in the market for the long
haul and have been very calm,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman
for Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund firm.
``Thursday,'' she added, ``was a very typical day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, becalmed after two days of
gyrations and heavy trading, nudged up 30.90, or 0.4 percent, to
close at 8577.68 Thursday. It was still down 3.4 percent for the
week. The break came two days after the Dow sank nearly 300 points,
or 3.4 percent, to 8487.31 on Tuesday _ its worst one-day drop of
1998 and more than 9 percent below its record high of 9367.84 on
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Other indexes also rose Thursday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index climbed 8.21, or 0.8 percent, to 1089.64. The Nasdaq
Composite index, dominated by computer companies, saored 41.31, or
2.3 percent, to 1829.51, its biggest gain in five months.
</P>
<P>
   The US market has been pressured by disappointing US corporate
earnings due to Asia's financial crisis, and, more recently,
President Clinton's political woes .
</P>
<P>
   To reassure worried fund investors, Fidelity had trotted out
investment icon Peter M. Lynch, posting a question-and-answer page
with the legendary stockpicker on its Web &UR;  &LR; site. But the firm also
reported positive net cash flows over the past three days, meaning
that investors put more money into mutual funds than they pulled
out. By Thursday, a standby reserve guard to man the telephones and
take incoming calls from investors was no longer needed, Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Putnam Investments, spokesman Matthew Keenan said the volume
of calls from fund shareholders fell 7 percent Thursday after
spiking 15 to 20 percent in previous days. ``People have stayed the
course,'' he said, adding that customers bought more Putnam funds
Thursday than they sold.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have held onto stock funds, but they have not been
putting new money into such funds. Money-market funds, a safe haven
in times of volatility, had attracted $7.3 billion in new
investments so far this week, double the amount of last October,
when the market suffered a 7.2 percent drop, according to IBC
Financial Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Individual fund investors own 20 percent of all US corporate
equity, according to the Investment Company Institute, a fact that
makes them crucial players in any market swings.
</P>
<P>
   Investment planners have been preaching for years about the
necessity of not rashly pulling long-term retirement money out of
the market. Retirement assets accounted for 35 percent of all
mutual fund assets at the end of 1996. Financial advisers have also
been telling investors to expect average annual gains of 10 to 12
percent, and not the high double-digit returns of recent years.
Some industry players say the advice is sinking in.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Group, which sells highly popular index funds, said
Thursday that investors had not abandoned index funds despite a
drop in returns. ``Investors have reaffirmed their belief that
staying the course is the best course in times of volatility,''
said Vanguard spokesman Brian Mattes. He said ``very few''
shareholders of the Vanguard Index 500 fund and other index funds
had sold their holdings. Vanguard had not needed to call out its
``Swiss Army'' of 1,000 executives to man telephones, and that
calls from shareholders had subsided.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchers outside the fund firms detect storm clouds
in the lull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days is hardly a test of the pudding,'' said James E.
Wilson, a financial planner in Columbia, S.C. ``I don't know if
over a three month fall, people would stay put.''

<P>
   EAST LEMPSTER, N.H. _ ``Can we race now?''
</P>
<P>
   Morning had made its way through the southwestern New Hampshire
woods, casting a bright, cloudless daybreak over a motocross theme
park that took up 132 acres of the middle of nowhere. Amid smoking
campfire coals and sleepy-eyed folks who walked along rows of
recreational vehicles and hundreds of motorcycles, the 5-year-old
boy in the racing suit sat on his dirt bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we race now?'' Jacob Robinson of Nashua said again with a
sigh, tired of waiting after 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline and David Robinson did not grow weary of their son's
persistent imploring. They knew how much he had anticipated this
morning since they promised him he could join his brothers Joshua
and Jeremiah in motocross competition three weeks before. For them,
it also was a time of anticipation. And of mixed emotions and
silent prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Jacob suffered a seizure and was subsequently
diagnosed with Arnold-Chiari Syndrome, a rare brain malformation in
which part of the cerebellum pushes down against the spinal canal.
He underwent surgery to correct the problem at Children's Hospital
in Boston, yet he must have an MRI every six months to make certain
the surgery hasn't generated too much pressure against his brain.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason the Robinsons forbade the buoyant youngster
from competing in motocross. Yet undoubtedly, they knew they
couldn't hold him back for long, not with 6-year-old brother
Jeremiah making such exceptional strides in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah was born with one nostril and bilateral club feet so
severe that his feet were turned almost completely backward. He
wore a cast from the hips down from the time he was 10 days old
until he was 3. When he was 2, he underwent reconstructive surgery,
during which doctors cut every bone in his feet below the arch into
smaller pieces, then inserted pins to make them face forward.
</P>
<P>
   After being in braces and wheelchairs until he was 4, Jeremiah
took up sports with varying success. But after his father _ himself
a motocross racer _ bought the three boys dirt bikes for Christmas
last year, Jeremiah was hooked. Pauline and David stifled their
fears to allow him to race, and he has become a hit at Jolly Roger
Moto-Sports Park, placing second in the New Hampshire Challenge
Motocross Series' 50-cc A-class (age 4-6) standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Robinsons tried to get Jacob to take part in his brother's
races by being one of the flag officials, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   So once again, the former high school sweethearts from
Billerica, Mass., led their family along a course of hope and fear
and courage and uncertainty, bolstered by two boyish smiles as
bright as a New Hampshire morning, haunted by voices of family and
friends who question whether they're doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
They don't give up
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Can we race now?'' Jacob Robinson asked again. Soon the young
racers were summoned for the two-lap practice run along the
one-eighth-of-a-mile track of steep hills and uneven curves.
Pauline and David took up stations at various points, she along
three consecutive humps, he at the top of the final incline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob and I walked the track last night so he would know where
to go,'' Pauline said. ``I say my prayers before each race. I get
so nervous. But I guess I wouldn't be normal if I didn't get
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that we are never burdened with more than we
can bear. How agitating it must be for the Creator to witness those
who buckle under the weight of mere milligrams of hardship _ folks
who confuse steppingstones for stumbling blocks and mourn losses
rather than count blessings _ and how perplexing it must be to see
the Robinson family coexisting among such whiners.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Joshua and Jeremiah Robinson are more courageous and
resilient than most adults _ particularly those who would chide
their parents for allowing them to be thrill seekers. They have a
will and tenacity that are perfect for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fearless, especially Jeremiah,'' said Gerald
Renillard, Pauline's father. ``When they were giving him stitches
in the hospital, doctors couldn't get over him. He was laying there
and then he said, `Aren't you done yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   With all they've been through in such a short time, the two boys
seem unfazed by steep hills and high-banked turns. Meanwhile, both
parents show them strength in the face of apprehension with support
and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, Pauline Robinson endures her own medical
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, an
autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system reacts against
itself, destroying exocrine glands, including those that secrete
saliva and tears. Women are nine times likelier to be affected than
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like having the flu every day of your life,'' said
Barbara Henry, president of the National Sjogren's Syndrome
Association. She added that if the condition is not detected and
treated early, it can lead to lymphoma, which can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to put Pauline's disease into remission have failed thus
far. ``I know what my kids are going through, because of my
disease,'' she said. ``We don't know what tomorrow is going to
bring. At least we all know, if I pass away, I enjoyed watching my
kids ride. Know what I'm saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``People criticize us for allowing them to race in motocross.
Some are friends, some family. We always tell people not to
prejudge us, because we love our sons more than anything. We
realize how short life is, all the surgeries they've had. I just
want them to be happy and support whatever they want. If we keep
teaching them the right way, they should be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cheers and fears
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the practice run began, a sound similar to the buzzing of
angry wasps could be heard in the distance. Then over the first
hill they came, youngsters storming along the track in multicolored
suits, revving their engines along each turn. Bike No. 5 scaled its
first hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Jeremiah. I don't see Jake,'' Pauline Robinson
muttered. Then Jacob Robinson's bike, No. 5X, headed downhill.
Pauline could hardly control her emotions. As her sons whizzed by
her, she gave the thumbs-up sign, then followed their progress up a
hill, watching until they were both out of sight, pumping her fist
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The first race, however, wasn't without mishap. On the first
table-top jump, a hill that was completely flat at the top,
Jeremiah careened off his bike and tumbled down the slope. ``Oh,
Jeremiah fell,'' yelled Pauline, scaling the wall between the hill
and her son with the dexterity of a mountain climber.

WHIGHAM PROVIDES FIGHTING SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ It was a little too quiet for Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there had been hitting and shoving at various times during
training camp. Emotions had run high. But it was never sustained
emotion, like the Patriots display when they're going well.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, Whigham, the All-Pro special-teams player,
came to practice Thursday ``with a little something on my
shoulder.'' He meant, of course, that he had a chip on his
shoulder. He wanted to make a point. Stir the masses.
</P>
<P>
   So on a goal line-line stand, usually emotional in nature,
Whigham hit second-year tackle Ed Ellis a little harder than a
safety normally would hit an offensive lineman. Ellis, who is 340
pounds, decided he wasn't going to take it from a 200-pound
defensive back. So they exchanged shoves and then punches. From
there, smaller skirmishes broke out, with offensive tackle Zefross
Moss also going after Whigham while defensive end Willie McGinest
was seen taking a swing at the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Whigham had accomplished his goal. Of course, there can
sometimes be excess. On the next play, the emotion didn't stop. Ty
Law got into a shoving match with Lovett Purnell. Shawn Jefferson
then got shoved around a circle of players. Lastly, second-year
linebacker Bernard Russ exchanged words and then blows with Rod
Rutledge. The rookie tight end shoved Russ, then knocked his helmet
off after Russ threw an overhand right to Rutledge's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing jumping in there?'' defensive coordinator
Steve Sidwell screamed at Russ, who had come on to the field while
Law and Purnell were shoving. ``Get your ass off the field!''
</P>
<P>
   The series of confrontations broke up the monotony. Precisely
what Whigham was getting sick of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me ... as far as fighting,'' Whigham said. ``This
team needs spunk. Pete Carroll's philosophy is a laid-back
philosophy. It's great for a football team. My philosophy is guys
need to get revved up and get ready to play football. If it takes
getting a little fired up in practice, that's what needs to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking on a 340-pound lineman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred, 400, 500 pounds _ it doesn't matter,'' said
Whigham. ``I didn't even know who I was fighting. Some guys knew I
was coming to practice looking for some contact after Thursday. It
wasn't anything that happened. It's what didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team needed that today. Everybody is going around here
nice and easy. Training camp isn't that hard. Nobody's bitching at
anybody. Guys were just trying to make their assignments. This team
is known for a little more than that. This team has a spunk about
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight was just a part of the frustrations of the camp, but
it was positive. I spoke to the rookie defensive backs the entire
night and I told them that I made this football team on effort. I
told them after this week, they're going to make a cut: `I'm not
gonna say this, but one of you guys is gonna make it on effort. The
least you can do is play each time like it's your last.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whigham's self-assessment was correct. He won over Bill Parcells
because he was a little more hyper than most. He wanted Parcells to
notice him and he made his mark on special teams, causing moments
of pure chaos for the opposition. Meanwhile, he learned to play
strong safety and has gradually improved. At 6 feet 2 inches, 205
pounds, he's very similar in size to Tebucky Jones, leading some of
his teammates to wonder why he wasn't tried at the right cornerback
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have tried it, but they drafted the kid
No. 1 and he's very talented, very fast, and very tough,'' siad
Whigham. ``If he can learn to play corner right away in this
league, that's a real plus. If not, last year's No. 1 (Chris Canty)
has played well and maybe he can do the job there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Whigham earned recognition for his efforts on special
teams, being voted to the Pro Bowl. But it was a frustrating season
for Whigham, who was often double- and triple-teamed. Even more
frustrating was that no one else took charge and made the big hit
or the big play. This year he sees younger, faster, more aggressive
players who might take the pressure off him and he's excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there, but it has to come out,'' said Whigham. ``We
didn't show that intensity against San Francisco and we have to
from here on out. There are four games left before the season
starts, but that creeps up on you quickly. We have to be ready,
completely ready to play Denver. The last two years we played them,
we haven't been at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Whigham believes every camp, every season has a turning point.
He thought that occurred Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we stepped up our game to another level,'' he said. ``We
knew we could do it. As a veteran team that's experienced, we know
when it's time to do that. Our team took a giant step today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll appreciated what Whigham was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a real spirit for the game,'' said the coach. ``He
works hard. He's a very effective special-teams guy. His ability to
get people jacked up is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll credited his players with excellent intensity and
aggressiveness in the morning practice but thought they might have
been irresponsible with the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we crossed that line a couple of times when a couple of
guys lost their poise,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Russ's episode, he said, ``There was a battle going
on in seven-on-sevens where a guy not even in the drill came in and
got involved, and that was a tremendous teaching opportunity.
Things like that are looked down upon by the league office. There
are fines for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whigham didn't cross the line. He just danced on the chalk a
bit. He is the poster boy for intensity. Special-teams coach Dante
Scarnecchia recently cited him as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach was talking about intensity, and a couple of plays he
showed were plays involving me being effective,'' said Whigham.
``It was good for my confidence to show guys that this was the
intensity we need. I thought to myself, `I wasn't even going all
out. If he thought this was good and if I can take it up another
level, then maybe I can make my dreams come true.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was making his teammates dizzy Thursday. He exchanged barbs
with Vincent Brisby. He gave rookie fullback Chris Floyd a shot
from behind on a special-teams play.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was all too quiet, almost church-like, for Whigham, who
added a little noise and made sure he will never be mistaken for an
altar boy.

TOMJANOVICH PERFECT FOR US COACHING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOULIAGMENI, Greece _ Arrogant. Pompous. Vain. Self-absorbed.
Pretentious. Imperial.
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasure it is to report that two-time NBA championship
coach Rudy Tomjanovich is none of these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always told my assistants,'' he says, ``that if I ever
change, they have my permission to take a running start and kick me
in the ass.''
</P>
<P>
   He is known universally throughout the NBA as Rudy T; nothing
more, nothing less. He doesn't have a ``guy'' hanging around to
say, ``Yes, Rudy.'' He's the same low-key individual he was when he
came into the NBA 28 years ago as a rookie forward with the San
Diego Rockets, except that he has a couple of rings and a lot more
money.
</P>
<P>
   For which, by the way, he's very grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin Murphy was my next-door neighbor when we played
together in Houston,'' Rudy reminisces, ``and we used to have these
little talks while we were leaning on the mailboxes. They were
talks people in the league should have a lot more often. They were
about how lucky we are to be getting paid to be playing a game we
love.''
</P>
<P>
   He's played it (11 years) and scouted it (two years) and
assistant-coached it (nine years and change) and head-coached it
(the past six-plus years), and now he is sitting in a luxury hotel
gazing out at the azure Aegean as the man in charge of a mystery
team with the letters ``USA'' on its chest. Rudy, Rudy, a partly
confused and partly ignorant nation now turns its lonely eyes to
you. They have asked you, Rudy Tomjanovich, the pride of Hamtramck,
Mich., to take this collection of Off-Broadway basketball players
into battle at the world championships in Athens. They have asked
you, Rudy Tomjanovich, to bring home the gold medal in order that
(a) we won't have to go through some sort of messy qualifying for
the Sydney Olympics two years hence, and (b) we don't lose our
international bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   They are asking you, Rudy Tomjanovich, to do this, and now what
is this you are saying, something about not even feeling like a
coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always amazing for me to be addressed that way,'' he
says. ``A lot of people in the beginning, knowing that I wasn't a
confrontational-type person, doubted that I could coach. Now, even
after all this time, someone will start off, `Coach,' and it'll hit
me: `They're calling me `Coach'?''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T has never been part of any NBA loop. Some guys go all
over the world every summer giving clinics, with junkets here and
there for either the league or a shoe company. Rudy stays home in
Houston and hopes his air conditioning doesn't break. ``I never
even heard of any of that stuff,'' he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   So this was going to be a nice ceremonial job, Rudy T's reward
for winning the non-Michael NBA titles in 1994 and '95. He was
getting the keys to the Porsche as sort of a Good Guy Lifetime
Achievement Award. He and his family would get free trips to Monte
Carlo, Rome, and Athens, and the best part was going to be that he
wouldn't even have to coach. The NBA stars would walk through this
tournament, and in years to come, people wouldn't even remember who
coached them in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   That fantasy died with The Lockout. Rudy T is now being forced
into some serious, stay-up-all-night coaching. Hyperbole? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up till 5 a.m. after losing to Lithuania,'' he
reports. ``We had to put stuff together to show them what they did
wrong against Lithuania (an 84-82 loss) and then we had to get
ready for a completely different team in South Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Be assured that if Chuck Daly stayed up until 5 a.m. in
Barcelona or Don Nelson stayed up until 5 a.m. in Toronto at the
1994 worlds, it was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy doesn't pine for a team he never had. Anyway, this job is
sure a lot more interesting than one in which your only concern is
keeping already pampered stars happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only lose in the other situation,'' he points out.
``You'd be critiqued for winning by 15 instead of 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Rudy, a.k.a. Mr. Understatement. How about being blasted
for not winning by 40?
</P>
<P>
   Rudy and assistants Del Harris and Lon Kruger had about two
weeks to whittle an original list of 30 players to 15 before
heading out for three exhibitions en route to Athens. That 15
became 12, and here they are, getting ready for this evening's
quarterfinal match against up-and-down Italy. Rudy's team is good
enough to win, and it's also fragile enough to lose. The
international pundits don't believe in it. Yugoslavia remains the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The players are lucky to have him, but of course, all except the
older members of the team (like, say, 34-year-old Wendell Alexis)
are clueless when it comes to their history. They don't know they
are being prepped by a man who averaged as many as 24.5 points per
game for a full season and was a career 50 percent shooter. ``Jason
Sasser says to me the other day, `Coach, did you play?''' Rudy
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they know that he played, they have absolutely no
idea how he played. They don't know that in the entire history of
basketball, no man has ever come close to Rudy T as the master of
the long-distance bank shot. This information is not going to win
them today's game, but just the same, they should know exactly who
this man is.
</P>
<P>
   This job is broadening Rudy because it's so radically different
from anything he has known. ``During the playoffs, I pride myself
on being able to make adjustments in time for the next game,'' he
says, ``but here you make your adjustments on the fly. And then you
play a team the following day that presents a completely different
set of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The junket has turned into pure hard work, but it will be worth
it if Rudy gets to see his team mount the top step of the podium
Sunday. ``It would be a very big thing,'' he says, ``not so much
for me but for them. I would really get emotional for them if we
can pull this off. This is a great story. You have this group of
strangers who've come here from all over the world, from different
levels of basketball, and who have come together in such a short
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   This Off-Broadway team didn't need a genius or an author as
coach. It needed a sincere guy with a lot of experience and just
the right human touch. The plain truth is that the Off-Broadway
team has gotten the coach who suits it to a, yes, T.

`BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS' IS CHARMING, BITTERSWEET COMEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' is a disarming romantic comedy
that is long on charm, sharply observed and bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with a Polaroid snapshot of Billy, waving at the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a homosexual,'' says Billy. ``I am also a fan of old
Hollywood movies, especially bad women's melodramas. I am a
photographer specializing in Polaroids. And an all-around nice
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy has come from his home in the Midwest, where, he says,
there are lots of heterosexuals but not many gays, to Los Angeles,
where he figures he finally has a lot better chance to find someone
of his own sexual persuasion to love. He also hopes he will have a
better chance of finding a market for his photos.
</P>
<P>
   Billy, played winningly and without any affectation by Sean P.
Hayes, is in the midst of an affair with a guy who keeps telling
him he's ``so special,'' but who has another boyfriend. Billy wants
romance, not just sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a coffee shop with his friend Georgiana, who has
appointed herself Billy's romantic adviser, Billy meets the man of
his dreams, Gabriel. Gabriel, played by Brad Rowe, a dead ringer
for Brad Pitt, responds in a friendly way to Billy, accepting
invitations to a party and later to a movie.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabriel also keeps talking about his girlfriend in San
Francisco. And he rejects Billy's tentative overtures to romance.
Is he straight? Is he gay? Gabriel's conflicting signals drive
Billy to distraction. He decides Gabriel is straight, but hopes he
might be open to new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel agrees to model for a series of Polaroids that Billy is
shooting parodying romantic scenes in Hollywood movies such as
``From Here to Eternity.'' But when a famous photographer (played
by the ever eccentric Paul Bartel) asks Gabriel to pose for him in
Catalina, Billy is beside himself with worry. Billy grabs Georgiana
and they rush off to Catalina. Billy still hopes to win Gabriel's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Tommy O'Haver enlivens the simple story with
amusing frills. When troubled, Billy's dreams turn into versions of
famous movies, with himself and Gabriel in the lead roles. A couple
of these are amusing; a couple are undeveloped and fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   When Billy tells Gabriel the story of how he learned as a child
that he was gay, the memory is told in Polaroid snapshots, the
self-pity cut by the amusing photos.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several subplots, such as Georgiana and her
boyfriends. Georgiana is one of those smart people whose brain
seems to turn off completely when someone of the opposite sex shows
an interest.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Greek chorus, three transvestites who pop
up at parties lip-syncing torch songs. Personally, I could have
done with a lot less of them, but they are amusingly awful.
</P>
<P>
   The real appeal of the story is Billy. Whether Gabriel turns out
to be straight or gay, in love with Billy or just a friend, we
don't want Billy to be unhappy. Like he said, he's an ``all-around
nice guy'' and overdue for a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first feature film for writer-director Tommy
O'Haver, though he has a lot of experience on short films. (He's
currently writing a feature film of the comic ``Archie'' for
Universal.) His strong point seems to be in writing little scenes
of dialogue and in gentle satire of people's hang-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about as slight as they come. It certainly doesn't
break any new ground, either as a gay film or romance, except for
the fact of treating the whole subject as a nonissue. Anyone who
feels all gay films should address issues such as AIDS or emotional
torment will find none of that here.
</P>
<P>
   The romance and sex _ there's not much of the latter _ is
handled with a very light touch, as you would expect in any
romantic comedy. There's more kissing than in ``In and Out,'' but
not much more.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Billy's feelings and situation are universal, whatever
the sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, as Billy, plays it low-key but he has a sure comic touch.
In September he will turn up on television in a new TV series,
``Will and Grace,'' again playing a gay character.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first film for Rowe, who played the boyfriend of
James Brolin's daughter on TV's ``Pensacola.'' He will next be seen
in ``Stonebrook'' with Sam Shephard. Rowe displays a shy sex-appeal
screen presence perfect for this role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,'' which is rated R, was
nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film
Festival. &QL;

KETEYIAN GETS IT STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armen Keteyian is not the typical sideline reporter.
He is a news guy, capable of being fair, accurate, and tough.
</P>
<P>
   His selection, then, by CBS to join its top NFL broadcast team
of Greg Gumbel and Phil Simms signals a transformation in the job
usually limited to injury reports, weather updates, and occasional
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   How this plays out during the season remains to be seen, but
it's clear Keteyian wants to broaden the job's scope.
</P>
<P>
   Sports is news, after all, and the off-field behavior of
athletes has become a never-ending source of front-page stories and
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though CBS is an NFL partner, spending $500 million a year
to secure the broadcast rights after a five-year absence, Keteyian
said his hiring signals the network's ``willingness to dig deep''
and cover ``the NFL as a news story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a reporter first,'' Keteyian said. ``I'm proud of the fact
that I try to be as accurate and fair and provide for viewers
(news) as unfiltered as I can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keteyian learned the sports-as-news approach during his
eight-year stint with Dick Schaap at ABC. Of the 400 or so stories
he reported, almsot 75 percent involved legal, social, or ethical
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost as if I was a cult of one,'' Keteyian said.
Gradually, more and more newspapers and television networks have
assigned reporters to cover sports as a business.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, athletes have become role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obligation factor,'' Keteyian said. ``Given this
society's emphasis on sports, professional athletes have almost by
default become role models. Some are incapable of handling that
responsibility and would perform a public service if they stayed
out of the press. Instead of being role mdoels, some have become
poster boys for the FBI Most Wanted List.''
</P>
<P>
   Keteyian, 45, bounced around newspapers for a while, then landed
at Sports Illustrated. In addition to CBS, he reports for HBO's
``Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' and ``Inside the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known recent reports was on the point-shaving
scandal at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meet the CBS lineup
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, CBS unveiled its talent and production crews
assigned to the NFL. They range from Marcus Allen, a superstar
running back, to Beasley Reese, a former defensive back for the New
York Giants. There also are some veterans, like Verne Lundquist,
Don Criqui, and Jim Nantz. Mark May, Randy Cross, Simms, and Sam
Wyche have both NFL and broadcast experience ... HBO Sports'
``Inside the NFL'' debuts Sept. 3 for its 22d season. Len Dawson
and Nick Buoniconti are joined by Cris Collinsworth ... Fox Sports
has until next Friday to decide whether to pay the NHL as much as a
reported $600 million for exclusive US broadcasting rights.
According to the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press, the Walt
Disney Company, which owns ESPN and ABC, offered the NHL that
amount despite hockey's dismal television ratings. Fox had a 1.4
rating last season, down from 2.0 in 1996-97. Fox is entering the
last year of its $155 million, five-year deal. ESPN's $100 million,
seven-year deal also expires after next season ... One-on-One
Sports (1510) has former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz on
Monday to talk about the upcoming college season and his new book,
``Winning Every Day.'' The call-in show starts at 2 p.m. ... On
Aug. 22, HBO airs two fights: Arturo Gatti vs. Ivan Robinson and
Fernando Vargas vs. Darren Maciunski. TNT airs three title fights
Sept. 22: Shane Mosley vs. Eduardo Morales, Angel Manfredy vs. Jeff
Mason, and Masibulele Makepula vs. an opponent still to be named
... CNN/SI's Vince Cellini joins Fred Hickman as co-anchor for
CNN's ``Sports Tonight.''

</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARRE, Vt. _ Drivers who have mastered speedways at Daytona,
Indianapolis, and Talladega are loaded with unmitigated gall. They
dart around mile-long tracks for 500 laps, often passing each other
on straightaways a mobile home could get through, then the winning
team stages a raucous celebration in Victory Lane, as if they've
done something exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Such drivers should spend Sept. 27 racing at Thunder Road
International Speedbowl. They would discover that exceptional is
when you're among 24 cars running in a three-stage, 150-mile race
around a quarter-mile, high-banked oval that narrows from three car
widths to two in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   They would discover that if you win the first of the three
50-lap stages, you must go to the rear for the second beacuse the
field starts in the inverse order of finish. The process is
repeated for the third stage. Points are given for each finish (one
for first, two for second, and so on), and the driver with the
fewest points claims a one-payoff prize.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, many drivers on the Winston Cup circuit have already
heard of the Milk Bowl, one of the most popular and challenging
short-track races in the sport. The 35th running of the event will
feature qualifying (which determines the order of the first stage)
Sept 26.
</P>
<P>
   First prize is $3,000. The race is also the final event in the
Texaco/Havoline Late Model Racing Series. The winner receives 80
series points.
</P>
<P>
   The Milk Bowl was created by Thunder Road founder and president
Ken Squier, a Vermont resident who does commentary on NASCAR races
for CBS. The name is derived from Vermont's dairy industry. The
three-stage format, he said, was adapted from hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the major races today on TV are from the era of the
500-mile race which began in Indianapolis,'' he said. ``All of a
sudden, we're not a `War and Peace' reading society, we're a
Reader's Digest reading society. We wanted to try to create a race
that fit the tempo of what people expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting thing the race has is its start. Once you
got them started, outside those moments of stark terror, a race is
a race. If you were to take hockey, which has three periods to
carry the action, put that into a race, then you have three starts,
four different potential winners.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one payoff, because as Squier found out in the early
years, ``everyone wants to beat the system.'' Thunder Road used to
award prizes to segment winners but discovered drivers would drop
out of the first race, complaining of mechanical problems, thereby
putting them at the front for the second.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 Milk Bowl winners (seven drivers have won the race at
least twice, with Robbie Crouch winning it a record four times),
only three have captured all three segments. Ten drivers have
claimed the championship without winning a segment. Three have won
two segments without winning the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal race because you can have the best day of
your career and still finish seventh,'' said Thunder Road announcer
Dave Moody.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you get past 24 cars driving at speeds of up to 75
miles an hour around a narrow, quarter-mile course? ``You have to
be patient while being aggressive at the same time,'' said Phil
Scott of Montpelier, who won the race last year, finishing third in
the first stage, first in the second, and second in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we like to do in a 50-lap event, we may run 18th for 25
laps until things get cleared out, until there's a lane you can go
in so you can pass cars. Then you have to make a mad dash for the
last 25, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Thunder Road drivers are accustomed to such a
format: All weekly events are handicapped so the best drivers start
from the rear. ``When you've got a racetrack in New England that's
doing well, you'll see they've got good car counts and good
handicapping, where they start the best guys out back and they make
them race to the front,'' said general manager Tom Curley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot of whining and a lot of the best drivers wishing
they could start up front. That's obviously the easy way, but it's
lousy for the race fans.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the Milk Bowl. Fans come with pen and pad in hand to
tabulate scores, knowing what each racer must do in the final
segment to win. Some stay long after the race to check their count
against the official tally.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all they stay for. There's one more wrinkle to the
Milk Bowl you won't see on the Winston Cup circuit: The winner must
kiss a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``After winning the Milk Bowl, it's wonderful (to kiss a cow),''
said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
AGAWAM, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You go to a racetrack every day and work on the pit crew of an
accomplished driver, and invariably, you're left with one thought
that spins around in your head like a fine-tuned racer around a
slick asphalt oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After working on her brother's pit crew for six years, Kris
Valerio put that conviction to the test in 1995. The Bristol,
Conn., resident purchased Rob Valerio's Strictly Stock Division car
after the former two-time Strictly Stock champion moved up a
division. It didn't take Kris long to prove she had a knack for the
sport, too: She earned rookie of the year honors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now the siblings race alongside each other in the Teddy Bear
Pools Truck Division. They are among the more competitive drivers
at Riverside Park Speedway, a quarter-mile, high-banked oval that
features as many as seven racing divisions.

WITH MORE MONEY AND POWER, WOMEN SEEK FINANCIAL SAVVY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After Princess Diana was killed in a Paris car
crash last year, people recalled her fairy-tale rise to fortune.
But few realized that she shared a common trait with many women:
financial dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a sheltered financial life, Diana went straight from her
father's home to the realm of Prince Charles. She left a job paying
an hourly wage in her hometown for life with royalty. Other people
paid her bills. She never handled her own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very financially naive,'' said Victoria Collins, an
author and financial adviser at Keller, Coad, Collins, Hakopian &AMP;
Leisure Investment Counsel Inc. in Irvine, Calif. ``She did share
things in common with women going through divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins spoke Thursday on the investment styles of women at The
Money Show, a popular financial conference that draws thousands of
small investors each year to San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle,
Chicago and Orlando. The conference was organized by InterShow of
Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a session called ``A Smart Woman's Guide to Life and Money,''
investment advisers warned the audience that some women still are
enslaved to out-of-date attitudes about money and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Older women grew up in a time when their fathers controlled the
family money. Women weren't allowed to talk about finance. And if
their Depression-era fathers gambled on Wall Street, they'd buy
only the safest blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women lack a certain confidence on this topic,'' said Gail
Seneca, founder of Seneca Capital Management, a San Francisco
investment firm that manages $4 billion in assets. ``It is truly
agonizing for women to make decisions on their investment
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Women and men tend to have different investment values, Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to move cautiously, weighing the lifelong impact of
their investments. In planning their finances, they anticipate
worst-case scenarios, such as poverty or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, men invest more aggressively. They focus on the
short-term gains or losses of individual stocks. They also tend to
move quickly and impulsively, often after hearing tips at the
office or on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men assume they know it all _ even when they don't,'' Collins
said, ``while women assume they don't know it _ even when they do.
But finance today is so complex that no one individual _ man or
woman _ can know it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rich or successful women have financial troubles. Marcia
Clark, the famed prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson case, earned
$96,000 a year with the Los Angeles district attorney's office, but
owed $37,000 in credit-card debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``While she was up there at the trial every day, she was
worrying about her finances,'' said Collins, who is Clark's
financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that millions of women today are savvy and well
educated about finance. Working women have tremendous economic
clout. And more women _ especially those under 40 _ take part in
key money decisions with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   All investors should explore their psychological motives for
investing, Collins said. What does money mean to them? Power and
status? Long-term security? Personal freedom? A way to enhance
family ties and relationships?
</P>
<P>
   Seneca said that women plunging into investments for the first
time should focus on the basics: Long-term financial goals. Asset
allocation among stocks, bonds and other investments. Yearly tax
planning. Assessing one's comfort and risk levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the big pieces right first,'' Seneca said. ``What does it
take to feel OK about your investments, not just today, but over
your long lifetime? That's more important than investing in Latin
American stocks or the hottest fund.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unwise to chase the unpredictable markets, according to
Janet Brown, president of DAL Investment Co. in San Francisco. No
one knows when hot fund managers and their investment sectors _
large or small companies, domestic or foreign stocks, growth or
value stocks _ will fall in and out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brown advised that women patiently watch for the
top-performing funds and investment managers, then invest
accordingly with these ``market leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in forecasting the market's direction, but we
can follow the top-performing funds,'' Brown said. ``Performance is
the bottom line. Stay aware of who's beating the market, and adjust
your portfolio gradually.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BARRE, Vt.: ... racing divisions.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When I first started out, I would race in the ladies' races,
which were called the Powder Puff Division,'' said Kris Valerio,
29, a customer service representative at FleetBank who has two
feature race wins this year. ``But this is a lot more
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   She had three Strictly Stock (now Sportsmen's) Division wins in
1997 and is currently ninth in the Truck Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Rob, 30, currently 13th in the Truck Division, began racing in
1980. He won the Strictly Stock Division in 1992 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to deliver newspapers, and one day I saw a race car in
the driveway of someone's house,'' said the auto body mechanic, who
won his first feature race of the year last weekend at Riverside.
``I got to know the owner of the car, and he helped me get involved
in racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob and Kris say they were never involved in the same activities
growing up, and it's one reason they don't consider what they're
doing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Their pit crews work alongside each other at Riverside. We're
not out there against each other,'' said Rob, who lives in New
Britain, Conn. ``We're here to help one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob said that when he discovered his sister wanted to enter the
sport, he was encouraged yet concerned about how she would handle
the agitation of male drivers who aren't accustomed to racing
against _ and being beaten by _ a female. But in addition to her
on-track success, she was voted the Strictly Stock's most popular
driver last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, whenever she stepped up to the trucks, I was
impressed,'' Rob said. ``Whenever you change like that, there is
usually an adjustment period, but she made a smooth transition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
STAFFORD SPRINGS, Conn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a young racing fan, Mike Stefanik discovered early that
Stafford Motor Speedway was the preferred track for modified
drivers. So when the Springfield, Mass., resident decided to take
up the sport, there was little doubt about which track he would
call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can win here, you can win anywhere,'' he said. ``That's
how this place's reputation has always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning to race at the half-mile, semi-banked oval helped him
earn a reputation as one of the best modified drivers on the
circuit. That reputation was solidified this year when he was
chosen as one of the top 50 modified racers of all time in a poll
conducted by Stafford Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The selectees are honored at each racing event at the
53-year-old track, which is owned by Jack Arute Sr., whose son Jack
Jr. is a college football analyst for ABC. Track officials came up
with the idea as a way to participate in the celebration of
NASCAR's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   After sending out thousands of ballots (each with 130 entries
and write-in space) to car owners, drivers, and trade shows, among
others, and tallying votes on the racetrack's website, Stafford
officials were startled at the response: 29,700 ballots, including
some from Canada, Italy, China, and Sweden. Two-fifths of the
responses came from the website.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 drivers are honored on two canvas billboards leading into
the track. ``The program's been a huge success for us,'' said Cory
Posocco, Stafford's marketing and special events director. ``A lot
of the celebration with NASCAR's 50th anniversary has been Winston
Cup-related, but we chose to honor modifieds because it is the most
popular racing series in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Posocco added that Stafford officials chose the modified cars _
open-wheeled, high-horsepower machines designed specifically for
speed _ because they constituted the original first division of
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made the list include Brett and Geoff Bodine and Jimmy
Spencer and Ron Bouchard, drivers who eventually made it to the
Winston Cup series.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always raced at Stafford; they would come from
North Carolina, New Jersey, and the rest of the East Coast,'' said
Stefanik, who last season became only the second driver in the
50-year history of NASCAR to win two division titles in the same
year _ the Feather Lite Modified and the Busch Grand National
North.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ran a modified, you needed a win at Stafford to be
good,'' he added. ``This is where the big races were, where the big
payoffs were, where all the big guys hung out. Now to be one of the
big guys is pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCARBOROUGH, Maine &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James McConnell said it began as a kindhearted gesture. The man
who founded Beech Ridge Motor Speedway in 1949 allowed the winner
of the first official race to keep the checkered flag as a
souvenir. The response to the gesture was so overwhelming that
McConnell allowed the second winner to keep his. Then the third.
Then the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A tradition was born. The one-third-of-a-mile track, which
celebrates its 50th anniversary this season, has given away every
checkered flag to feature race winners since its inception. That
has meant a lot of work for local seamstresses, since every flag
has been made by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother made all the flags for many years,'' said McConnell,
86, of Raymond. A former sawmill owner and race car driver, he
bought the land on which the track sits for its lumber. After
clearing it, he built the track. He sold it in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The flags are 3 1/2-inch cotton squares (black and white, of
course), which are quilted together: two separate pieces of squares
consisting of six rows across, five rows down, for a total of 30
squares on each side. Those who have made the flags have become
popular as well.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Jean Janson, 92, of Biddeford made the flags for 20 years
before retiring three years ago. ``In her last season, she made 300
of them,'' said Carmen Janson, her daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The current flagmaker is Sandra Jones, a Kennebunk seamstress
who got the job after making a souvenir signature flag for a friend
that became so popular in the area, she eventually sold 100. ``My
mother had Alzheimer's Disease at the time, so I needed something
to do while I spent time with her,'' she said. ``I make 200 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing at Beech Ridge has always been competitive, so the list
of those who have won flags is impressive, including Robbie Crouch
and Jeff Fuller. ``They'd always try to give them back to us
because they didn't think they were supposed to keep them,'' said
Bonnie Coffin, former promotions director.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants a checkered flag made by Jones need not bother
to ask. ``I have an agreement with (Beech Ridge) that I will not
sell checkered flags,'' she said. ``Plus, that wouldn't be fun. You
have to earn them.''

PAREJA THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ The Revolution have won once in their last
nine home matches. But their 3-0 victory over San Jose Wednesday
not only removed their stigma of having the worst record in Major
League Soccer but also rekindled their playoff hopes going into
tomorrow's visit to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Their all-out commitment was exemplified by Paul Keegan, who
expended an incredible amount of energy starting as a left-side
midfielder and also covering central defense as the Revolution
protected their lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the most encouraging component of the Revolution game was
Oscar Pareja's ability to control the pace in midfield. Pareja's
playmaking skills set the tone and gave them something to rely on
other than physicality.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Revolution reverted to frenetic kicking and
running did they seem vulnerable. But goalkeeper Ian Feuer, who
regained his starting position after more than two weeks on the
bench, prevented the Clash from capitalizing.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe-Max Moore, who had been on the verge of being traded two
days previously, combined with Raul Diaz Arce to provide a threat
at striker. Moore helped set up the first goal, by Ivan McKinley,
with a bold dribble into the penalty area, then scored the second
with an opportunistic follow against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore recognized the Revolution's potentially fatal lack of
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our possession in the middle of the midfield wasn't what it
should be,'' Moore said Thursday. ``We got stretched out and we
have to be more compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling everyone to try to keep possession, hold the
ball, make them run. I don't always say that. I want to go forward
and get the third or fourth goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Often when a team is protecting a lead in soccer, the best
defense is a good offense. But only if that offensive mentality is
displayed selectively. The Revolution lose their effectiveness by
attacking with little variation. Their predictability makes them an
easy mark for the better teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, at times we have given up late goals,'' Moore
said. ``And a lot of games that we should have won, we've thrown
away. Right now we need to win games, and it doesn't matter how
pretty or ugly it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution are in a similar position to their first
two seasons, when they were scrambling to avoid last place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still trying to find an identity,'' coach Thomas Rongen
said. ``Against San Jose, we had that `over my dead body'
mentality. We had a combination of blue-collar and technical
players. And we are going to step it up a notch in the next game.
We are going to be tested for our guts, our fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But they still must occasionally maintain possession and play
through midfield, which means Pareja will be a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar has a free role, and it is going to be important for us
to find him,'' Rongen said. ``He has an innate ability to fight off
pressure, he is very strong, and he got stronger as the game went
on. He shields the ball, keeps possession, which buys you time and
draws fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he has been willing to do a lot of the dirty work as
well as the playmaking. He covers a lot of ground. The amount of
running he did was amazing for an international player, who could
easily let the others do most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have been seeking a midfield choreographer since
Edwin Gorter moved to sweeper and Jair broke his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar has been given the role and the title,'' Rongen said.
``That should help give us an identity.''

CAGE ON A ROLL IN `SNAKE EYES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes'' runs counter to most recent Hollywood thrillers.
Rather than slick and mechanically paced (action every 12 minutes!)
with predictable plot and characters, ``Snake Eyes'' runs at its
own odd speed, draws attention to its glitzy style and features an
erratic, screwball hero.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Brian De Palma film, and De Palma is working in the
intense, eccentric personal manner that established him with films
such as ``Dressed to Kill,'' ``Scarface'' and ``Body Double.'' It
is more idiosyncratic than, for example, his films ``The
Untouchables'' or the mainstream ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   At times its strangeness gets in the way of allowing the
audience to simply enjoy it as a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is unusual, too. ``Snake Eyes'' stays from start to
finish (except for a short epilogue) in an Atlantic City casino
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 14,000 folks have come for a heavyweight championship
fight in the casino arena. Among them is the controversial U.S.
secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Guarding the secretary is naval Cmdr. Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise).
Dunne is old friends with an Atlantic City police detective, Rick
Santoro (Nicolas Cage) and has brought him in on the guard detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cage and De Palma quickly establish that Santoro is a flamboyant
good ol' boy, cocky and tastelessly loud, right down to his
Hawaiian shirt. When offered a bribe, he accepts it so casually
that we realize he's forgotten it's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne is his exact opposite. Ramrod straight-arrow, he is
pristine, neat, intense and conscientious.
</P>
<P>
   The movie hardly starts before De Palma's close-ups and
off-speed editing alert us to pay attention; something is about to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro and Dunne are sitting near the secretary of defense. The
fight starts. Dunne spots a woman on another aisle and walks away.
Santoro sees Dunne and the woman talk, then she runs off, and Dunne
runs after her. Like a person on drugs, Santoro begins focusing in
on various people around the arena.
</P>
<P>
   A shot is heard, and the defense secretary is killed. A woman
standing nearby is also shot but promptly disappears.
</P>
<P>
   In the slowed-down reality of the moment, De Palma gives us all
kinds of hints, clues and red herrings to think about. The clues
include why the heavyweight champ, who has just been knocked out,
pops his eyes open instantly at the sound of the gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   The whole assassination scene is a showcase for De Palma. His
shots and his editing of visuals and sound bombard us with details
and impressions. Events seem to be both speeding up and slowing
down at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   We will see the assassination scene again and again throughout
the movie. Each time it will be from a different perspective,
sometimes from eyewitness accounts, at other times from video
cameras taping the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro has the hotel sealed before anyone can leave so he can
conduct an investigation. He sees this as his steppingstone to
becoming mayor if he can crack the case quickly for national
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes'' is plotted like a traditional mystery thriller,
but De Palma is not interested in who done it, but in how he, De
Palma, presents it. Though the movie is packed with twists and
turns, most of them don't come as much of a surprise because De
Palma is more into showing off than in plot or logic.
</P>
<P>
   What normally would be the movie's big revelation _ you probably
will suspect it already _ is revealed early.
</P>
<P>
   But much of ``Snake Eyes'' is fascinating, thanks to those two
major showboats, De Palma and Cage.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma has all sorts of fun distracting us from the slight
story. In perhaps the most eye-catching shot, he tracks his camera
across the ceilings of several hotel rooms _ some of them with
activity irrelevant to the story _ as he moves from one group of
characters to another.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cage has, for the time at least, all but abandoned
serious drama to concentrate on his action-hero career, he has
continued to create some of the most peculiar and watchable
characters in the genre. Here he plays Santoro as both magnetic and
repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro is a guy you wouldn't trust with your wallet or your
wife, unless you were already friends. Then he would be as loyal as
a bulldog. (Which becomes an important plot point.)
</P>
<P>
   Cage has several memorable moments, including a bravura scene in
which he comes across like a good cop-bad cop while questioning the
boxing champ, who may or may not be involved in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, while Santoro and a material witness he is
protecting are hiding in a stairway, she tells him some information
he really doesn't want to find out. His reaction is priceless, both
funny and weird, but at the same time much more realistic than you
would get from most actors in most movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise, in a much less flamboyant part, is his usual rock-solid
self.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``feels'' strange in some ways that aren't intended.
An advertising point has been that the 14,000 potential suspects
are sealed into the building, and that all of the movie takes place
in a few hours. That's true, but it does not feel true.
</P>
<P>
   We never get the impression that guests are being detained or
that time is essential. The hotel casino is big, with many areas,
and it seems like nothing unusual has happened. People wander
around, play games and pick up dates. There's no sense of crisis or
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   While we are in the vague-complaint department, here's another.
The movie seems oddly short, and not just because, at 99 minutes,
it is shorter than most. Granted, most movies are too long, but
this one just seems to be hitting stride when all of a sudden
things wrap up abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   It feels truncated, like parts have been cut. There is a
hurricane outside the hotel during the investigation, but almost
nothing is made of it. Near the end of the movie, Cage refers to
something that happened underwater. But nothing happened
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the movie's underwater scenes, Sinise said the
hurricane originally played a much larger role in the action. ``But
they decided it was just not right for the movie,'' he said.
Apparently, it was too late to fix some of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated R, mainly for violence. De Palma, who has
often had trouble getting an R because his movies were so violent,
was contracted to bring this film in as a PG-13. He re-edited
several times to get the milder rating, but in the end had to
settle for the R.

 &HT;    SEARCH FOR INFORMATION A KEY TASK FOR CLINTON LEGAL TEAM
 &HT;    860&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his battery of in-house lawyers all but
sidelined in the most critical legal challenge of his career,
President Clinton is relying on three private attorneys skillful in
the ways of politics and scandal to prep him for grand jury
questioning Aug. 17_ and possibly save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The three _ David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and former cabinet
member Mickey Kantor _ bring a formidable set of instincts, skills
and experience to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Each one plays a unique role:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kendall, the bookish but street-smart senior problem solver
who heads the team.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seligman, the glamorous Harvard-trained font of strategy and
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kantor, the calculating Clinton confidant valued as much for
his sensitive political antennae as for his steel-toothed
negotiating style.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the White House has refrained from labeling the trio a
dream team.
</P>
<P>
   The key to their performance could be how well they perform the
daunting task of ferreting out exactly what Monica Lewinsky and
dozens of other witnesses have already told the grand jurors behind
closed doors, and what independent counsel Kenneth Starr has
learned from his seven-month probe into Clinton's Oval Office
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ''A defendant entering into a grand jury investigation would
like to know everything the grand jury and the prosecutors know,
because they don't want to state anything that would be
inconsistent with things that were stated before,'' said Bruce
Fein, a former deputy associate attorney general. ''But that's
going to be pretty hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been made no easier by recent court rulings suggesting
that White House counsel Charles Ruff and the nearly three dozen
lawyers in his office have no assurance of confidentiality in their
work for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to overrule a U.S.
appellate court's decision that White House deputy counsel Bruce
Lindsey _ and perhaps by extension, anyone else on the White House
legal staff _ could be forced to testify in the Lewinsky case. As
government employees, the lower court ruled, White House attorneys
are public servants, not presidential confidants.
</P>
<P>
   Anything those attorneys might discuss with Clinton, in other
words, could quickly become the subject of a grand jury probe.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Clinton able to confide and confer only with his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who cannot be forced to testify
against him, and his private attorneys, whose conversations with
Clinton are protected by the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   It will ultimately be the Clintons, both of whom have legal as
well as political expertise, who will frame the president's Aug. 17
testimony, hone its fine points and perhaps develop a companion
statement for the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is counting on Kendall, Seligman and Kantor to
give him a strong hand, and to do that they need to learn something
about the cards held by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to prevent Clinton's legal team from talking
directly with lawyers for other witnesses, or even to witnesses
themselves, in their search for investigatory intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout this investigation, as any lawyers would, attorneys
do speak with other attorneys and their clients on a regular basis
as the investigation has proceeded,'' acknowledged White House
counsel spokesman Jim Kennedy. ''That's just the normal process of
gathering information.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has denied that he had an affair with Lewinsky and
coached her to cover it up, has pledged to testify completely and
truthfully on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   If he sticks with his story, Clinton could find portions of his
testimony at odds with Lewinsky's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   In grand jury testimony on Thursday, Lewinsky, who has received
blanket immunity from Starr, reportedly contradicted earlier claims
by herself and the president by saying that she and Clinton had an
Oval Office affair lasting more than a year and that they discussed
possible cover-up schemes.
</P>
<P>
   If she did change her story, and if Starr has other witnesses
and perhaps even physical evidence to back up her reversal,
Clinton's attorneys would like to know about it before he
testifies, not after.
</P>
<P>
   Their problem is that grand jury proceedings _ in which jurors
hear testimony and weigh evidence to decide whether prosecutors
have sufficient reason to formally charge, or indict, someone _ are
held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to protect people who are under investigation, so
they aren't publicly maligned in case no charges are brought.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses are free to speak publicly, however, about what they
tell a grand jury, and there are no prohibitions against lawyers
for one witness conferring with lawyers for another.
</P>
<P>
   However, such practices are far from an exact science.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not guaranteed cooperation,'' said Fein. ''They don't
have to tell you anything. Moreover, they can lie to you, or omit
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in other words, could end up flying partly blind into
his testimony, something his legal team hopes to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton's lawyers are doing to get a peek at Starr's
playbook, they're not making their strategy public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't talk about it,'' said one of Clinton's three private
attorneys, who declined to be quoted by name even to refuse
comment. The other two did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   What is known about Clinton's team is that it provides him with
a balance of expert legal advice from Kendall and Seligman _ both
partners with the Washington firm Williams &AMP; Connolly _ and the
comfort of tested loyalty and political acumen from Kantor, with
the Washington office of the Chicago-based firm Mayer, Brown &AMP;
Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Team leader Kendall, like Clinton and his wife, graduated from
Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Clinton, Kendall quickly turned his training toward
the American South, where he spent the better part of five years
challenging death sentences as part of the legal defense team of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall later toiled under the tutelage of Edward Bennett
Williams, a master trial lawyer and Washington power broker
extraordinaire. Williams helped build his partnership, Williams &AMP;
Connolly, into what many regard as the pre-eminent Washington
superfirm before he died 10 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues call Kendall, 54, a father of three and a compulsive
movie-watcher, a lawyer's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a brilliant fellow who has sort of a renaissance sort of
knowledge,'' said Robert Barnett, a Williams &AMP; Connolly partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is widely read, extremely intellectual, but he also has a
street fighter's toughness,'' said Barnett, who represented Clinton
in the investigation into the Whitewater real estate deal before
turning it over to Kendall four years ago. ''He is just a decent
man. Smart, funny, and a hell of a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York native turned Baltimore Orioles fan, Seligman, 41,
graduated from Harvard University in 1978 and moved immediately to
Hong Kong, where she was an editor with the Asian Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of journalism, she decided, was enough. She returned
to Harvard to study law, graduated in 1983, and soon took on one of
the highest-profile cases of the decade: the defense of former
National Security Council official Oliver North in independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh's inquiry into the Iran-contra case.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has fought the independent counsel over a five-year legal
battle in the Oliver North case and has seen everything close-hand,
from congressional testimony, an indictment, a trial, an
acquittal,'' said Brendan Sullivan, who led North's defense.
''She's about as expert as you can get in these kinds of matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, also of Williams &AMP; Connolly, said Seligman can be a
bedeviling adversary in depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She can be tough on one hand and yet, on another, she can turn
very charming and feminine, which takes a witness by surprise,''
said Sullivan. ''So, if she doesn't get them one way, she'll get
them another. I'd have her on my team any day.''
</P>
<P>
   And, one way or another, Kantor has long been on Clinton's team.
The Nashville native has been a political compatriot of the
Clintons' for more than a decade, played a key role in the '92
presidential campaign and served in two important economic slots in
Clinton's first term, as U.S. Trade Representative and later, after
the death of Ron Brown, as Secretary of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor, 59, was among a close circle of friends contacted by the
Clintons last January, in the tumultuous days after the Lewinsky
allegations first surfaced. He reportedly worked closely with Mrs.
Clinton during a period when, for several days, the president
virtually disappeared from sight in preparation for a State of the
Union address clouded by controversy.
</P>
<P>
   As he once did during high-profile trade negotiations, however,
Kantor has kept his cards close to the vest, saying little publicly
about the Lewinsky matter and providing behind-the-scenes advice
and counsel to the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a relationship as an attorney to the president,'' White
House spokesman Barry Toiv told reporters last week. ''I honestly
don't know how often they talk, but I am sure they talk fairly
often.''

<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ Birds are chirping outside on the vine-covered
porch, as the music of opera singer Andrea Bocelli wafts through
the screened door and kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the small kitchen of her renovated 1851 Gothic house,
Cassandra Danz tells a visitor that ``when I go into the garden, I
never wear floral prints because the bees will come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Danz could be a fictional character in a children's book or a
character on ``Sesame Street.'' But many know her as Mrs.
Greenthumbs, through her offbeat gardening books, newspaper and
magazine columns, and as a regular on ``Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie
Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   What you see on TV is what you get in person. Mrs. Greenthumbs,
a.k.a. Cassandra Danz, 48, is a free spirit with a gentle, Auntie
Mame sort of personality and wry sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Danz is a former member of the comedy troupe Women in High
Heels, which she helped form in 1977. Her stand-up comedy stints
have included appearances at Second City in Chicago, Catch a Rising
Star in New York City and the Improv in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her flair for comedy, Danz has long held a passion
for organic gardening. So it seemed natural to the Brooklyn native
to combine stand-up comedy with gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Danz's character of Mrs. Greenthumbs was noticed in 1994 by
Michael Gelman, producing director of the Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee show.
Her career was boosted the following year when she made the first
of many appearances on the popular morning show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first saw her at an off-off-Broadway one-woman comedy
gardeners show,'' Gelman said in a phone interview. ``I'm a lover
of offbeat comedy, and she lit up the stage with her funny sense of
humor. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a natural. She interacts well with Regis and Kathie
Lee because they too are themselves on camera. Cassandra has a fun
bawdy side. `She's an earthy one,' as Regis would say. He's a
Catholic-school type who gets embarrassed by her silly, risque
antics. Kathie Lee gets a good chuckle out of Cassandra and how she
views and enjoys life and the world around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Danz said working on the TV show is ``like being part of a
family. A dysfunctional family, but a family. ... They are all so
supportive of anything you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Danz was recently offered her own gardening television show in
Canada. ``I just came back from Halifax, where I completed filming
26 episodes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a variety gardening show where we dance, sing and
do other silly things. We have a piano, musical director and my
announcer is a tenor. People from the audience come in with their
sick plants. They sit on a couch and I analyze them, like a
psychiatrist. Other times I play Greenah (like Xena Warrior
Princess), the Garden Warrior. We also have guests, like a tree
surgeon, a vegetable expert and a very high-camp floral designer
with lots of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   She also had a bit part in the movie ``Tootsie'' with Dustin
Hoffman. ``I think I got my part because I looked like Dustin
Hoffman in drag,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Danz lives with her husband, Walter, who works for a commuter
train line. They have a 19-year-old son. Their house is filled with
an eclectic blend of bargain finds that they have collected over
the years from yard sales, flea markets and auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach to gardening appeals to a broad range of people who
love gardening or reading about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives you courage to do gardening,'' said Hudson neighbor
Meg Mundy, an actress and former model and magazine editor.
``Cassandra is a delight to be around _ very witty and smart.''
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and Hudson resident John Ashbury took a
gardening class offered by Danz.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely good-natured and witty to work with, and if
you're into gardening, she makes it fun,'' Ashbury said. ``She's
quick to tell you that you shouldn't worry about damaging anything,
as `plants are very forgiving.'''
</P>
<P>
   To help people with their gardening, Danz has penned a couple of
humorous gardening books. Her latest tome is titled ``Mrs.
Greenthumbs Plows Ahead: Five Steps to the Drop-Dead Gorgeous
Garden of Your Dreams'' (Crown, $25). Her first book was titled
``Mrs. Greenthumbs: How I Turned a Boring Yard into a Glorious
Garden and How You Can, Too'' (Crown, $12 paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Danz's own garden is a compilation of floral beds placed
perpendicular to the house with just enough lawn to divide the
segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the flower gardens perpendicular to the house, so you
can see and enjoy them,'' Danz said. ``People tend to plant their
flowers alongside the house, where only the neighbors can see them
and you can't.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the various flowers, trees and plants in her
yard, Danz said, ``I love it here in my garden. It's like living in
heaven.''

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SUES OVER ADDITIVE IN GASOLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco-based environmental organization
is suing the major oil companies, seeking to ban them from using
the gasoline additive MTBE and force manufacturers to pay for
cleaning up toxic residue in California ground water.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court,
alleges that the oil companies knew that MTBE (methyl tertiary
butyl ether) was toxic and a hazard to human health when they began
blending it into their gasoline under a 1990 federal law requiring
oil companies to add air-cleaning chemicals to gasoline to reduce
carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE is an oxygenate that, when added to gasoline, reduces
carbon monoxide emissions from motor vehicles. It is colorless but
causes a foul taste in water. MTBE has been in wide use in
California since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says the additive can cause
cancer in animals. MTBE is soluble in water and has leaked out of
storage tanks and into the domestic water supplies in several
areas.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory concluded that more than 10,000 sites have been
contaminated by MTBE since the additive was introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil companies have been running the same kind of scam the
tobacco companies did for years, only it was with MTBE instead of
nicotine,'' said Donald Brown, executive director of Communities
for a Better Environment, which filed the complaint. ``They must
clean up their mess and pay back big time for profiting from
poisoning California's water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two major oil companies named as defendants, Chevron
and Tosco, both based in the San Francisco area, are testing
gasoline additives other than MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Tosco spokesman David Kory said the company was aware of
customer complaints and that ``we want to demonstrate that
solutions to the problem of reducing or eliminating MTBE from the
gasoline are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosco has replaced MTBE with ethanol, which is made from corn
and rice hulls, in its gasoline in several California counties.
</P>
<P>
   The East Bay Municipal Utility District, the Santa Clara County
Water District and several other jurisdictions in Los Angeles,
Orange and Kern counties, and the San Francisco area, have note
MTBE pollution in water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution
calling for a ban on MTBE after 168 ground water sites, three
reservoirs and three water treatment sites were found to have
traces of MTBE. The Tahoe Regional Planning Authority banned the
use of two-stroke outboard motors in the lake, and the East Bay
Municipal Utility District enacted a similar ban for its reservoirs
for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tosco and Chevron, major oil companies named in
the lawsuit were Mobil, Arco, Texaco, Shell, Exxon and Unocal.

CATALOGS HAVE FIRM GRIP ON BUYERS, JOIN FORCES WITH ONLINE
MERCHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who gets mail knows catalogs accumulate faster than dryer
lint, and they're a lot heavier. So it's no surprise to hear from
the Direct Marketing Association that there are at least 8,000
catalogs generating an expected $87 billion in business this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the statistics Amy Blankenship spews as
director of the DMA's shop-at-home information center.
</P>
<P>
   Today's catalogs may be less hefty and more specialized than
their weighty ancestors, but they're not being eclipsed by online
shopping services.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're joining up, making catalogs like JCPenney,
LLBean and Lands' End available in hand or on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship was in Seattle last week for a DMA-sponsored
marketing conference, telling anyone who would listen how to shop
the Net and/or catalogs successfully, while sharing online and
catalog shopping trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know you could have a complete clambake _ lobsters and
all _ sent by Clambakes to Go catalog via Federal Express? Or how
about a bright red British phone booth from Design Toscano _ a
catalog that also offers suits of armor.
</P>
<P>
   While food and gifts are popular with at-home shoppers, they
can't compare with clothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to DMA research, clothing accounts for about 33
percent of all catalog purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies even offer personal shoppers who can pull
together a wardrobe for a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers, on the other hand, focus on computers and
peripherals, as well as books and music.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping is a growing category _ especially now that some
catalogs allow shoppers to mix and match wares on screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Net-shopping is still way behind catalogs in dollar volume.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship says catalog shoppers will spend about $87 billion
this year, while online shoppers will spend about $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship has a knack for putting a positive spin on what some
consider the negative side of at-home shopping.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a congressman's press secretary in Washington,
D.C., before moving to New York and taking the DMA job a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's not aware that at-home shoppers sometimes find
that clothing that looks glamorous on the screen or page will be of
poor quality when it arrives, or that shipping costs can send the
price of an item into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the order form before placing an order,'' Blankenship
said. ``Companies use different services to get orders to
consumers. Ask about different shipping options.''
</P>
<P>
   Home shoppers don't have to pay local taxes if the catalog
doesn't have a physical presence or nexus in their state, according
to Blankenship.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States,''
she said. ``It would be extremely hard for companies to keep track
of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't a hot seller on the Net or in catalogs? Blankenship
hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, there haven't been a lot of cosmetics sold, but
the Body Shop is doing direct business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to DMA research, only about 5 percent of all shipments
are returned, and some companies make it easier than others to
return merchandise _ with an enclosed return label and free return
postage, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship encouraged shoppers to always read the customer
service section of a catalog or Web site for return/exchange
policies. Computer software and recorded music that can be
duplicated are sometimes not returnable, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for successful catalog shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Amy Blankenship, director of the shop-at-home information center
for the Direct Marketing Association has dozens of helpful hints to
make shopping at home successful. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   _When you find a catalog with good merchandise and service, tell
others.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask questions. Service representatives who answer phones are
usually trained to help with your purchasing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep records. Even when ordering by phone, fill in the order
blank, date it and file it away. Once merchandise arrives, save the
receipt, packaging and literature until you are certain you are
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   _Never give personal information such as bank account or Social
Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _If it's a ``special offer'' or involves a ``trial period,''
read the fine print and know your obligations before you join or
purchase. These offers are often linked to book, music and
collectibles ``clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   _Never send cash through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   _When shoping online, make sure you are on a secure site. If the
URL on the ``checkout'' page starts with https:// it means the
document is from a secure server.
</P>
<P>
   _When a shipping date cannot be met (30 days maximum unless
otherwise specified), the supplier must notify you of a new date.
</P>
<P>
   _Need more catalogs in your mailbox? The DMA publishes the Great
Catalog Guide featuring more than 270 different catalog companies
listed according to products and/or services. Send $3 check or
money order to: Consumer Services Department, Direct Marketing
Association, P.O. Box 33033, Washington, DC 20033-0033.
</P>
<P>
   _Problems? Home shoppers have options when a catalog company has
not resolved a complaint in an acceptable, timely manner. The DMA's
Mail Order Action Line is a free service, but requests for help
must be in writing, sent to: Mail Order Action Line, Direct
Marketing Association, 1111 19th St. N.W., Suite 1100, Washington,
DC 20036-3603. Include details about your order, the catalog
company, explanation of the problem, photocopies of documents,
copies of canceled checks and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   _If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.

   BOMBING-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton quickly
condemns fatal bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania as
terrorist acts and sends over medical aid. Federal investigators
and military support are also on the way from Washington and U.S.
bases in Germany. How will this affect security at U.S. embassies
around the world? What terrorist groups are being mentioned as
responsible? Wrapping up the developments from Washington. (Deans,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ The fatal bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are another sign that the United
States has to be ready to both reap the benefits as well as suffer
the consequences of being the world's last remaining superpower.
Namely, if you're going to make a statement, then do it by taking
on the biggest kid on the block. Moreover, the presence of U.S.
facilities around the world that are ``public'' buildings _ such as
the embassies _ makes for numerous vulnerable targets. (Glass, Cox
News Service). ETA: 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-SECURITY _ Security levels vary at U.S. embassies around
the world, depending on conditions in the countries. A look at
security at the two embassies hit by bombs Friday. (Martz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-REACT _ ATLANTA _ For Emma Mwangi, a Kenyan who has been
visiting friends in Atlanta, news of blast at the U.S. embassy in
Nairobi came as a shock. Afterwards, she frantically tried to reach
her father, a businessman who works in the same block. (Kurylo,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-PRESIDENT _ MIAMI _ Spouting a message of peace, Andres
Pastrana takes office as Colombia's new president Friday in the
face of some of the worst political violence to hit this South
American country in years. A nationwide rebel offensive by Marxist
rebels has killed more than 130 people this week. In the most
devastating action, rebels overran an important southern
anti-narcotics base, killing or dragging away dozens of soldiers
and police as possible bargaining chips. (Emling, Cox News
Service). ETA: 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-BANKBAILOUT _ MEXICO CITY _ Angry opponents have strapped
themselves to crosses to symbolize the ``crucifixion'' of Mexico's
poor. Headlines scream allegations that the rich are, once again,
getting a free break thanks to pals in the government. The dispute
is over a $65 billion bank bail out stemming from Mexico's 1994
economic crisis. What's different now is that Mexico has a stubborn
opposition Congress that isn't ready to rubber stamp a Zedillo
Administration request to publicly absorb the debt, which is 14
percent of Mexico's GDP. Earlier this week, in defiance of Mexico's
bank secrecy laws, the country's left-center opposition released a
list of names of bank debtors that include some of Mexico's
wealthiest. Also on the list are suspected white-collar thieves who
abused the bail out, and, opponents say, big-time campaign finance
supporters of the country's ruling party. Arguing that most debtors
are actually Mexicans of modest means is Treasury Secretary Jose
Angel Gurria, who briefed foreign reporters this week and is in
charge of negotiating with Mexico's now vigorous opposition.

   CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for feverish
speculation about the health of aging Cuban President Fidel Castro,
who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no exception. Just a
few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector living in Costa Rica
claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain disorder. There was
a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last summer, some even
announcing Castro's death. But, if anything, Castro appears more
robust than ever. He appears to be traveling more these days than
at any time in his 39 years in power. He continues his commitment
to communism, even as he's been striking a conciliatory tone
towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-ISRAEL _ JERUSALEM _ Go to the movies, and guards will
check your hand bag for bombs and ask if you have any weapons.
Leave a shopping bag unattended, and it could be blown up by the
``Sappers'' who patrol city streets in their high-tech vans. After
a while, you get so used to it and nearly forget about the
counter-terrorism security measures in every day Israel that would
be considered intrusive in the United States. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service). WEDNESDAY IN i and k CATEGORIES.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNAL-BRITAIN _ WEST HORSLEY, England _ In late June, I stood
on the front porch of my mom and dad's place an hour south of
Dallas and marveled at the old plastic thermometer. It reported the
temperature to be 112 degrees. So imagine the relief of arriving to
this place, where a cool spell is caressing an already mild
climate. The grass is thick, soft and green. My apple trees are
heavy with fruit and the berries are making the birds crazy.

   WORKFORCE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday signs the
Workforce Investment Act, which will convert most federal job funds
for states into block grants. (Harlan/Joyce, Cox News Service 400).
</P>
<P>
   DEWINE _ Good week for U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio: President
Clinton signs his major job-training bill today, and a bill he
sponsored with Pat Moynihan that would force the U.S. to release
all files on Nazi war criminals is on its way to Clinton for
signing. DeWine hopes this bill would spur other countries to do
the same. (Joyce/Montgomery, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LAWYERS _ WASHINGTON _ With his battery of in-house
lawyers all but sidelined in the most critical legal challenge of
his career, President Clinton is relying on three private attorneys
skillful in the ways of politics and scandal to prep him for grand
jury questioning _ and possibly save his presidency. The three _
David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and former cabinet member Mickey
Kantor _ bring an imposing set of instincts, skills and experience
to the field. But the key to their performance could be how well
they do at the daunting task of ferreting out exactly what Monica
Lewinsky and dozens of other witnesses have already told the grand
jurors behind closed doors and what independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has learned from his six-month probe. (Deans, Cox News
Service 900).
</P>
<P>
   DECADE _ WASHINGTON _ Let's take a stroll through the graveyard
of decades. There's the gaudy 1920s marker, with its epitaph of
``Roaring.'' Keep on marching past the ``swinging'' '60s headstone
and the human-shaped ``Me Decade'' of the '70s. The monstrous
tombstone for the '80s can't be missed _ it denotes the ``Greed
Decade.'' But now is a particularly grave time in pop culture land.
Just 17 months shy of 2000, there's no consensus among trend
trackers, pop culture mavens and futurists on a catch phrase for
the '90s. (Abulhassan, Cox News Service 650). MOVED WEDNESDAY in w

   TITANIC _ WASHINGTON _ In a search for relics and ratings, the
Discovery Channel will send remote-control camera vehicles to the

   FLA-GORE _ DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore,
Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt and Lt.
Gov. Buddy MacKay hold roundtable discussion on hurricane
prevention measures at Deerfield Beach High School. Later, Gore
meets with Democratic officials and might swing an endorsement of
MacKay from U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, who is miffed at the party
for snubbing black lawmakers. (Crowley/Belkin, Palm Beach Post)

</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-POLITICS _ Miami's long-running saga of political scandal
is under the spotlight again as ex-City Commissioner Humberto
Hernandez goes on trial for vote fraud stemming from last fall's
tainted city elections. The charismatic Cuban politician seems to
sum up what many feel is the heart of the city's problems: a
byzantine system built on cronyism and corruption, centered around
the unquestionable clout of the Cuban community. American-born but
the son of a Bay of Pigs veteran, Hernandez has repeatedly thumbed
his nose at prosecutors and media critics, claiming his unstoppable
Latin power base will protect him. (Williams, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   YAGER-HEARING _ ATLANTA _ Hearing continues on a motion for a
temporary restraining order to stop Faye and Howard Yager, accused
in a lawsuit of running a misguided underground network to protect
allegedly abused kids, from continuing to hide a Connecticut man's
son. (Williams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

ALL DOLLED-UP SPICE GIRLS SASHY INTO THE NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop-music history is littered with the memories of slickly
packaged, teen-oriented acts that sold millions of records before
disappearing into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to New Kids on the Block, anyway? And Menudo?
Vanilla Ice? Word has it he's still trying to make a comeback, if
only he would show up when he's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them, like the Monkees and Duran Duran, actually had
talent. Fewer still had true greatness. Take the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Spice (a k a Geri Halliwell) got out while the gettin'
was good. But she was a bit premature, quitting as she did just
before the start of the group's much-publicized U.S. tour. There
are still millions to be made pushing bubble-gum feminism and
peddling records, toys, dolls and all sorts of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Spice, who abruptly quit in May, missed her chance at
becoming a real doll.
</P>
<P>
   Her former Spicemates _ Scary (Melanie Brown), Sporty (Melanie
Chisholm), Posh (Victoria Adams) and Baby (Emma Bunton) _ are being
immortalized in a series of products manufactured by Toymax
International Inc., the company that brought you Creepy Crawlers.
</P>
<P>
   Though doomed to turn up on the swap-meet circuit, these dolls
and other toys will be treasured by young fans eager to cuddle with
something other than a poster, video or CD.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spice Girls' U.S. tour rolls into the Northwest for a
concert Saturday night, the big video screens will be pushin'
product _ from T-shirts and programs to cosmetics and soft drinks.
Hey, if The Artist (formerly known as Prince) can shamelessly fill
his concerts with product pitches, why not the Spice Girls?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from commercials, the show should be pretty soundly
entertaining for fans. The four Spice Girls perform with a live
backup band, six male dancers, prerecorded background vocals and
enough costumes to stock a fashion boutique.
</P>
<P>
   It's a flashy, giddy, high-flying show that attracts legions of
young, screaming girls. Parents who accompany their kids to the
Tacoma Dome will be absolutely dumbstruck by the sound of thousands
of high-pitched voices at full volume. It's enough to make you
queasy.
</P>
<P>
   The song list, which is heavily weighted with material from the
Spice Girls' two albums, ``Spice'' (1996) and ``Spiceworld''
(1997), encompasses various styles of pop music _ disco, reggae,
hip-hop, neo-swing and hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a slight feminist tone to the show are such songs as ``We
Are Family'' and ``Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Spice Girls' own songs, you can bet they'll perform such
tunes as ``The Lady Is a Vamp,'' ``Spice Up Your Life,'' ``Saturday
Night Divas,'' ``Move Over,'' ``Two Become One'' and ``Naked,''
which is done bare-shouldered with some teasing, suggestive props.
</P>
<P>
   Members also live up to their names with special costumes and
hair-dos. Baby sports ponytails and baby-doll dresses, Sporty wears
a soccer jersey and Scary favors a leopard-skin outfit. Posh simply
strives to look stylish and demure.
</P>
<P>
   When the show recently played in New York, many of the videos
hadn't yet been revamped to reflect Ginger's departure. Indeed,
life must be moving so fast for the group that precious little time
is available for a post-Ginger makeover. Even the the group's new
video, ``Spice World,'' which hit stores in June, features Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might have expected Ginger to come up with an interesting
solo gig. But thus far, only Scary has taken on an extracurricular
project, cutting a track with rapper Missy Elliot for the Frankie
Lymon biopic ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Spice Girls haven't been terribly forthright
regarding Ginger's hasty exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was a shock,'' Baby recently told Entertainment
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she just had different ideas about what she wanted to do.
And we've always been behind each other a hundred percent.
Fundamentally, the Spice Girls are about friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scary: ``She just wanted to move on and do her own thing.
... We support her and say good luck.''

   MEXICO CITY _ Angry opponents have strapped themselves to
crosses and marched in public to symbolize the ``crucifixion'' of
Mexico's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines scream allegations that the corrupt and rich have,
once again, hopped on a free ride from their pals in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   These are scenes from Mexico's latest emotionally-charged
national dispute, which center on a $65 billion bank bail-out --
the result of the country's 1994 peso crash and subsequent economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in this corruption-weary country say the rescue plan,
already equal to 14 percent of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), has benefited too many rich businesses and individuals who
recklessly helped themselves to money before the crash and now
expect the public to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the government pay for my personal needs, just the same
as it's done for its friends?'' asked an indignant Lourdes Flores,
a school teacher. ``I guess being a rich criminal is a guarantee of
privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' remarks sum up widespread disgust over reports that some
high-flying bail-out beneficiaries were bankers who committed
fraud, while others were loyal contributors to electoral campaigns
of Mexico's dominant political entity, the Revolutionary
Institutional Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   One such person who may have been a crook and a contributor is
Angel Isidoro Rodriguez Saez, a jet-setter nicknamed ``The Divine
One,'' who Mexican officials say loaned himself $400 million from
his own bank. The government bailed the bank out during the crisis,
but Rodriguez Saez has also been charged with fraud. Many Mexicans
still struggling with the impact of the crisis are angry that
pending charges, ``The Divine One'' remains free -- and rich --
following extradition from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a financial meltdown after economic disaster struck
Mexico in 1994, the government bailed out banks, like ``The Divine
One's,'' that were in trouble. Many banks had been privatized
during Mexico's rush to loosen state control in the early 1990s. As
a result, banks began making billions of dollars in speculative
loans that eventually went sour.
</P>
<P>
   A federal deposit-insurance agency here known as FOBAPROA bought
$65 billion worth of the bad debts with government bonds payable in
10 years. But now President Ernesto Zedillo's administration wants
congressional approval to convert the burden to public debt, by
turning the bonds into securities banks can cash sooner at better
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Congress, for the first time in 70 years, is no longer
controlled by the PRI and no longer willing to rubber stamp
executive proposals. The left-center opposition, the Democratic
Revolution Party (PRD) is leading a charge to modify Zedillo's
proposal, and this week made great political mileage by divulging
the names of extremely wealthy FOBAPROA beneficiaries it gleaned
from documents it was given.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD violated Mexico's bank secrecy laws by releasing
specific names, according to the administration, which is offering
documents to Congress -- in confidence -- as a way of smoothing
negotiations with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers here gobbled up the information with glee.
Mexico's Congress had no subpoena power to obtain the names, and
the PRD's defiant act was met by many disgruntled Mexicans with
hearty approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names on the list ``are among the world's richest
people, and FOBAPROA took on their bad loans,'' said PRD federal
deputy Dolores Padierna, who serves in Mexico's lower house.
``These multi-millionaires can pay their own debts. The Mexican
people shouldn't be paying them.''
</P>
<P>
   Padierna told reporters that the PRD's aim is to reduce the
bail-out's cost to the public by declining to back criminal debts.
She said the PRD estimates that as much as 70 percent of FOBAPROA's
$65 billion burden shouldn't be backed by the public because it
resulted from corruption.
</P>
<P>
   As much as half of FOBAPROA's debt originated from huge, often
dubious, loans made to the rich, including ``The Divine One,''
according to documents released to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria, who is in charge
of negotiating with skeptical political opponents, agrees that
public opinion seems to be running against the administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, he argues, more than 90 percent of the 600,000 debtors
on FOBAPROA's lists are regular business people, farmers and other
Mexicans of modest means who took out relatively small loans they
failed to repay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no International Red Cross for helping debtors,''
Gurria said, explaining that Mexico can't afford to abandon its
rescue proposal -- which also includes important reforms to help
tighten bank-lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bail-out, he said, the government hopes to create an
agency like the United States' Resolution Trust Corporation, which
would sell debtors' property to raise money to repay the bad
credit.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, it's unlikely that the debt will be
fully recouped. Many analysts predict that FOBAPROA will end up
collecting only 30 percent of the total -- if it's lucky.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Gurria, who discussed the FOBAPROA stalemate with foreign
reporters this week, admitted that the government will have
difficulty collecting debts from wealthy individuals who obtained
credit -- sometimes from cronies -- with ``signature loans'' based
on estimated assets but not guaranteed by them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even if many of these individuals still own vast
properties, they may be untouchable unless fraud is proved.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria said the administration wants to punish abusers of
Mexico's banking system as much as anyone. And analysts say it
would help the administration in the court of public opinion if a
few white-collar crooks were soon prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Diaz, an economist with the Mexico City Center of
Research for Development, said both sides of the FOBAPROA debate
have reasonable arguments that will have to be considered as
negotiations proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to pay a large amount of the debt because it is
attributed to corruption is risky, Diaz said, because it could
provoke a run on banks and capital flight. But the PRD, he said,
has correctly warned that the bail-out could actually be much
greater than the $65 billion estimate, and it could require
increasing taxes and cutting social spending.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound good to many Mexicans. So a refusal by
Zedillo's administration to compromise, Diaz said, could mean
``political disaster'' for his party in the future.

DEATH-ROW INMATE SEEKS TO HALT EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Condemned double-murderer Bill Bradford was so
overcome by recent visits from family members and an old friend
that he decided to try to stop his date with death, his lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly 15 years on death row, Bradford was visited only
by his lawyers, said his current attorney, Jack Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, 52, had told the court he did not wish to continue
appeals challenging his death sentence. An execution date of Aug.
18 was set.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened, Leavitt said: The news media reported
on the condemned inmate who was eager to die. People read about
Bradford and visited him at San Quentin. People, his lawyer said,
he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention which the press was giving to Bradford's
imminent execution ... produced an unexpected result,'' Leavitt
wrote in a formal request for a stay of execution, which he sent to
the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration states Bradford's intent to continue his legal
appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family and friends whom he had not seen for nearly 15 years _
and in some cases, blood relatives he had never known _ learned
about his death-row existence. They wrote to him, talked to him by
telephone and visited him, providing a supportive setting which had
long been denied him. He found a reason to continue living _ if
only to allow him to reconcile himself with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, an amateur photographer, was sentenced to die for
strangling two aspiring models _ Shari Miller, 21, and Tracey
Campbell, 15 _ in 1984 after luring them to the Southern California
desert with promises of modeling jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court upheld the death sentence last year.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said Bradford told him Thursday morning that he had
changed his mind, and that he wanted to seek a stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have walked into Bradford's life in recent weeks
were a 23-year-old daughter whom he had not seen in 14 years, a
half-sister whom he had never met and an old friend who is like a
brother to Bradford, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his legal filing, the lawyer wrote that ``Bradford has
decided to avail himself of his right to exhaust his federal
procedures before the state is permitted to levy a final,
irrevocable judgment against him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Bradford has changed his mind about
dying. He filed papers to halt his execution in the middle of July,
though he withdrew that request almost immediately.

<P>
   Africa's mixed record of democratization, including the
emergence of a large number of hybrid regimes committed to
effective governing and real economic development, but not
Western-style democracy, has led some analysts and foreign-policy
makers to question the wisdom of promoting democracy as a core
theme of U.S. Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the focus has been on leaders who have come to power in
Central Africa and the Horn _ in states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea
and Uganda, economic basket cases with a legacy of civil war. The
new commitments may be to sweeping away the failures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about Africa's most progressive new
leaders is that all have embraced economic reform, reestablished
political stability and reduced human-rights abuses, but have
resisted multiparty democracy _ a strategy that has achieved
dramatic results. Those African leaders who are committed to
putting their own houses in order deserve, and in many cases have
received, the support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But Africa's new leaders may also want to assert African control
of the continent's destiny, and thus reject a deferential attitude
toward outsiders and their advice. They may be impatient with
neighboring states that do not share these objectives and whose
regimes threaten their own. They may believe that economic
development must precede democracy and reject the view that
democratization and development are mutually supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the African countries with the highest long-term growth
rates have been Botswana and Mauritius, which also have the longest
records of democratic rule. More recently, positive growth has
returned to Benin, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa, where the
resurgence of democracy has been strongest. Growth is also positive
in Cote d'Ivoire and Malawi, where democratic transitions are still
at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's worst performers during the 1990s _ Kenya, Nigeria and
the former Zaire _ are cases not of failed democratization but
failed authoritarian rule. The clear lesson from Africa is that
economic renewal and democratization go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. policy, the implication of this relationship is that
countries in different stages of democratic transition must be
treated differently. African regimes can be divided into four
categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ First are a handful of states with strong and potentially
enduring commitments to both free-market economies and democratic
governance but that are not yet consolidated democracies. In this
category are Benin, Botswana, Mali, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second are those that have demonstrated a modest to strong
commitment to macroeconomic reform and have embarked on democratic
transitions by holding multiparty elections or have carried out a
significant degree of political liberalization. Included in this
group are Burkino Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique,
Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third are those that have embraced macroeconomic reform but
seek to promote development without democracy. In this group are
Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Niger and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth are those that either resist both economic reform and
democratic rule or are unable to exercise authority across their
territory because of civil war or state collapse. In this group are
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the United States is to maintain a clear and
consistent commitment to its foreign-policy goals while calibrating
them for each category of states. These goals, as articulated
during President Clinton's trip to Africa earlier this year, are
essentially three: economic reform and sustainable development via
Africa's integration into the global economy; improvement on human
rights and progress on democratic transition; and reestablishment
of political stability and effective governing in war-torn states,
particularly in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is particularly difficult vis-a-vis the hybrid
regimes in the second and third categories because of their diverse
mix of policies. Virtually all of these countries are better off
economically and politically than they were at the beginning of the
1990s. Several, including Ethiopia and Uganda, have had dramatic
improvement in their growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   None, however, is a consolidated democracy, and in some,
progress toward building democratic institutions has been painfully
slow. These hybrid regimes are brittle because few have established
strong institutions to sustain their economy or polity.
</P>
<P>
   They will either evolve into more democratic regimes or slip
back into the authoritarian rule that characterized Africa
throughout the 1980s. Such a return to authoritarianism would risk
state collapse and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with the northern third of Uganda fertile ground
for rebellions, President Yoweri Museveni must incorporate the
people of the region into the nation in the same way he reached out
to the Baganda peoples by restoring the kingdom of the country's
largest ethnic group to consolidate his regime in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In Ethiopia, President Meles Zenawi must likewise craft
appropriate mechanisms to bring the alienated Amhara and Oromo, the
country's two largest ethnic groups, back into the political
process if long-term stability is to reign.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, prospects for stability turn on whether Paul Kagame's
Tutsi-based minority regime can deal with the Hutu majority
politically rather than militarily. After the genocide, the rural
areas are now nearly 95 percent Hutu, which makes successful
counterinsurgency operations almost impossible without an effective
political component.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that in none of these cases is long-term
stability or prosperity likely without a more liberal and inclusive
politics, in which diverse interests bargain for, share and
possibly alternate power with each other. Democratization, in
short, is in the self-interest of those in power.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the United States should continue to
urge democratization for the good of such nations and leaders, or
whether it should ease up in order to maintain harmonious
short-term bilateral relations. While broadly cooperating with some
regimes, the United States should still maintain a dialogue about
the need to deepen the democratic process.

interest in Africa is the peaceful development of African states so
that they are no longer islands of instability and poverty that
require U.S. assistance or intervention, but partners in trade and
full members of the international community.

<P>
   Achieving these goals depends on the continued promotion of
democracy as a core element in U.S. Africa policy.

<P>
   Africa's mixed record of democratization, including the
emergence of a large number of hybrid regimes committed to
effective governing and real economic development, but not
Western-style democracy, has led some analysts and foreign-policy
makers to question the wisdom of promoting democracy as a core
theme of U.S. Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the focus has been on leaders who have come to power in
Central Africa and the Horn _ in states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea
and Uganda, economic basket cases with a legacy of civil war. The
new commitments may be to sweeping away the failures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about Africa's most progressive new
leaders is that all have embraced economic reform, reestablished
political stability and reduced human-rights abuses, but have
resisted multiparty democracy _ a strategy that has achieved
dramatic results. Those African leaders who are committed to
putting their own houses in order deserve, and in many cases have
received, the support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But Africa's new leaders may also want to assert African control
of the continent's destiny, and thus reject a deferential attitude
toward outsiders and their advice. They may be impatient with
neighboring states that do not share these objectives and whose
regimes threaten their own. They may believe that economic
development must precede democracy and reject the view that
democratization and development are mutually supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the African countries with the highest long-term growth
rates have been Botswana and Mauritius, which also have the longest
records of democratic rule. More recently, positive growth has
returned to Benin, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa, where the
resurgence of democracy has been strongest. Growth is also positive
in Cote d'Ivoire and Malawi, where democratic transitions are still
at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's worst performers during the 1990s _ Kenya, Nigeria and
the former Zaire _ are cases not of failed democratization but
failed authoritarian rule. The clear lesson from Africa is that
economic renewal and democratization go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. policy, the implication of this relationship is that
countries in different stages of democratic transition must be
treated differently. African regimes can be divided into four
categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ First are a handful of states with strong and potentially
enduring commitments to both free-market economies and democratic
governance but that are not yet consolidated democracies. In this
category are Benin, Botswana, Mali, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second are those that have demonstrated a modest to strong
commitment to macroeconomic reform and have embarked on democratic
transitions by holding multiparty elections or have carried out a
significant degree of political liberalization. Included in this
group are Burkino Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique,
Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third are those that have embraced macroeconomic reform but
seek to promote development without democracy. In this group are
Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Niger and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth are those that either resist both economic reform and
democratic rule or are unable to exercise authority across their
territory because of civil war or state collapse. In this group are
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the United States is to maintain a clear and
consistent commitment to its foreign-policy goals while calibrating
them for each category of states. These goals, as articulated
during President Clinton's trip to Africa earlier this year, are
essentially three: economic reform and sustainable development via
Africa's integration into the global economy; improvement on human
rights and progress on democratic transition; and reestablishment
of political stability and effective governing in war-torn states,
particularly in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is particularly difficult vis-a-vis the hybrid
regimes in the second and third categories because of their diverse
mix of policies. Virtually all of these countries are better off
economically and politically than they were at the beginning of the
1990s. Several, including Ethiopia and Uganda, have had dramatic
improvement in their growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   None, however, is a consolidated democracy, and in some,
progress toward building democratic institutions has been painfully
slow. These hybrid regimes are brittle because few have established
strong institutions to sustain their economy or polity.
</P>
<P>
   They will either evolve into more democratic regimes or slip
back into the authoritarian rule that characterized Africa
throughout the 1980s. Such a return to authoritarianism would risk
state collapse and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with the northern third of Uganda fertile ground
for rebellions, President Yoweri Museveni must incorporate the
people of the region into the nation in the same way he reached out
to the Baganda peoples by restoring the kingdom of the country's
largest ethnic group to consolidate his regime in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In Ethiopia, President Meles Zenawi must likewise craft
appropriate mechanisms to bring the alienated Amhara and Oromo, the
country's two largest ethnic groups, back into the political
process if long-term stability is to reign.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, prospects for stability turn on whether Paul Kagame's
Tutsi-based minority regime can deal with the Hutu majority
politically rather than militarily. After the genocide, the rural
areas are now nearly 95 percent Hutu, which makes successful
counterinsurgency operations almost impossible without an effective
political component.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that in none of these cases is long-term
stability or prosperity likely without a more liberal and inclusive
politics, in which diverse interests bargain for, share and
possibly alternate power with each other. Democratization, in
short, is in the self-interest of those in power.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the United States should continue to
urge democratization for the good of such nations and leaders, or
whether it should ease up in order to maintain harmonious
short-term bilateral relations. While broadly cooperating with some
regimes, the United States should still maintain a dialogue about
the need to deepen the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   The issues to be addressed might include strengthening the rule
of law, increasing government transparency and accountability,
making decentralization meaningful, developing an independent media
and civil society, and ensuring genuine electoral competition no
matter what the political framework.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. efforts to promote democracy abroad argue that
U.S. national interest is not served when foreign-policy objectives
are defined in moralistic terms rather than on the basis of
concrete interests. Yet in the post-Cold War world, the main U.S.

   How should the Holocaust be taught? Today, a specialized field
of study has grown up around it. While some thinkers believe the
Holocaust is getting the attention it deserves, others are uneasy
about focusing scholarship on an attempt to wipe out the Jewish
people instead of on the whole of Jewish history. The New York
Times asked Ruth R. Wisse, a professor of Yiddish literature and
comparative literature at Harvard University, and Steven T. Katz,
director of the Center for Judaic Studies at Boston University and
the author of ``The Holocaust in Historical Context,'' to lay out
their views on the purpose and meaning of teaching the Holocaust.

Holocaust is a singular event, perhaps the most significant
occurrence in 2,000 years of Jewish history, and that it therefore
deserves to be treated as such.
</P>
<P>
   HOLOCAUST-WISSE (Undated) _ Ruth R. Wisse counters that turning
the Holocaust into the defining event in Jewish history is a
terrible mistake, that it distorts the rich and long history of the
Jews, allows Hitler to define the Jews and obscures the political
nature of what happened in Nazi Germany.

COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS TO THE OPENING SCHOOL BELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the old days, parents packed their kiddos off
to the first day of school with a new metal lunch box and an apple
for the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of worrying about starting off on the right foot with
the teacher, now the big deal is preparing the child so the
strange, new routine, unfamiliar faces and the all-important Will
anyone play with me at recess? question smooth themselves out
without any major trauma.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in Crayola Kids magazine, parents are
supposed to follow a week-by-week countdown (much like planning a
wedding) to get their children ready for school. For instance, four
weeks before S-Day, you're supposed to get eyes, teeth and little
bodies checked out by doctors; make an appointment for haircuts;
and request a work schedule adjustment so you can help your child
make it through the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before school starts, you need to determine which
clothes still fit and which don't. And then clean and organize the
child's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before school starts, contact the school and get a
list of needed supplies, then purchase everything on the list. And,
in case junior is apprehensive, spend some time talking about the
big day.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, a week before school starts, parents are to start
conditioning the kiddos to get up and go to bed early, discussing
lunch menus and making school visits so they'll know exactly where
the classrooms, bathrooms, lunch room and lockers are. Also have a
camera loaded to document that first day of school. To subscribe to
Crayola Kids magazine, call (800) 846-7968.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   What the video won't tell you is the importance of carrying your
stuff with style. To the rescue is Hello Kitty's new red vinyl tote
that's shaped like a hat box with the Hello Kitty logo. It's $24 at
Sanrio Surprise stores at malls everywhere.

<P>
   For more details on how to be the hottest chick in class,
Bloomingdale's at Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks will hold a runway
show at 2 p.m. Aug. 22. They'll have boys' clothes, too, including
the new DKNY collection.
</P>
<P>
   CHECK YOUR CALENDAR: Whether you're a student or not, you'll
need a calendar and bulletin board to keep your social life
straight, and Miz Hot Tips has the ticket. New from DayRunner _ the
company that makes all those Looney Tunes planners _ now has
OrgBoards to make organization easy at home or in your office
cubicle. It features a corkboard, erasable board and calendar, with
a space for Post-It notes, too. OrgBoards are $20 to $24, depending
on the design, at mass merchandising stores everywhere.

GETTING AN EYEFUL WITH GLASSTRON 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ah, sitting in a hammock in the back yard, rocking
back and forth in the shade, ice-cold lemonade in hand, watching
``L.A. Confidential'' projected in digital glory across the insides
of my sunglasses. This is summer living.
</P>
<P>
   And you can do it with the Glasstron, which looks like a pair of
sunglasses, but in fact has high-quality digital television screens
behind each silvered lens, and earplugs at each temple to shoot
stereo sound straight into your brain.
</P>
<P>
   Sony representatives said the device probably will debut at
Christmas at a price of $700 to $800. During demos at the recent Hi
Fi '98 show, Sony paired the Glasstron with its paperback-size
portable DVD player for mobile movie heaven in high definition.
</P>
<P>
   And there'll be competition for your secret movie supershades.
Samsung reportedly has a similar set readying for release, price
and availability still undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   The Glasstron isn't the only gizmo Sony's been showing off
lately either. Lots of oohs and ahs at the Herring on Hollywood
conference were directed at cheap new notebook computers from Sony
that are thin enough to make Kate Moss diet.
</P>
<P>
   The VAIO 505 SuperSlim is less than an inch thick, sheathed in
brushed magnesium alloy, with a built-in 33.6-Kbps modem, 10.4-inch
screen, and external floppy-disk drive and docking port. An
external CD-ROM drive is extra, as are detachable speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-pound computer sports an equally thin price: about $2,000
for a machine with a 200-Mhz Pentium II MMX chip, and about $2,700
for one with a 266-Mhz chip. This is cool.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD, BUT LIVELY: Paul is dead. No, not that Paul. Paul Lomo.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Paul, don't you? Lead singer of the seminal, and
troubled, rock band Miasma back in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Miasma put out some great music on Conquest Records. Then Paul's
supermodel squeeze turned up dead. Followed two weeks later by
Paul, face down in a swimming pool, breathing a little too much
agua for the good of his lungs, and his longevity. You do remember,
don't you, all these years later?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you don't remember Paul. Or Miasma. Or Conquest
Records. Because they didn't really exist anywhere until John
Sanborn and Michael Kaplan created them, for ``Paul Is Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderfully dense and entertaining ``interactive rock 'n'
roll mystery'' centering on Lomo's bizarre life and death, that
just debuted on the Internet at www.paulisdead.com.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Paul Is Dead,'' Sanborn and Kaplan wove together 96
streamed-video shorts that will be released on the Internet a
couple of times a week through March, slowly unveiling the Lomo
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   They also wrote 16 songs that represent the Miasma ``oeuvre,''
(with each song containing clues), as well as a dozen alternate
takes and demos of the songs that also provide information.
</P>
<P>
   And they strung together another 300 pieces of what Sanborn
calls ``rock 'n' roll detritus,'' things like audio recordings and
documents, and 300 Web pages, many of them fake fanzines about the
band that flesh in more detail.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to the experience is Lenny Pochnik, an obsessive
Miasma ``fan'' whose responses actually are generated by a complex
computer program called a ``chatbot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 'bot's erratic behavior and feud with rock
critic/protagonist Elly Clyde, viewers/players of ``Paul Is Dead''
need to work with Lenny, or they'll never get in to see his trove
of Miasma material, Sanborn said.
</P>
<P>
   That interplay is part of what makes the twisty plot so fun. The
Web show is targeted for a broad-ranging audience that tends to be
more passive in its play, Sanborn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made for a mass-entertainment audience,'' Sanborn said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Paul Is Dead'' also has enough depth to satisfy people who
have a gamer's mentality, or who just like pawing through a
fictional world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, you can just watch it, or if you want, you can root
around,'' Sanborn said. ``There's puzzles, there's locked rooms,
there's Q-and-As, but they're not essential to the piece. ``Paul Is
Dead' is an attempt to create a world that people can get highly
involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   As involved as the plot may be, the Web show's financial history
may be even more confusing and mysterious. It originally was
commissioned by Microsoft Network, then was handed off to partner
MGM Interactive before finally ending up back with Kaplan and
Sanborn.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, the show survived, making ``Paul Is Dead'' is
a lively addition to the online world.
</P>
<P>
   ALL PLAY FOR THIS `BOY': After surviving online quite nicely the
past few years on the strength of its own brand of fun, Playboy has
decided to beef up its Internet site, signing partnerships with
three quirky Web sites, none of which has much to do with naked
women, martinis or Alex Haley interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known is Hecklers Online, which has been the
top humor site on America Online the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hecklers bill themselves more as humor editors than humor
writers, depending on daily submissions by thousands of readers for
the raw material of their constantly changing site. Reader potshots
become, for instance, an Interactive Top 10 of jokes each day, said
Barry Patterson, the company's business development director.
</P>
<P>
   The Hecklers said they will stay on AOL, but will be able to run
other edgier, more adult humor with their Playboy site that could
never appear on the squeaky clean AOL.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Patterson said, AOL has spiked comedy bits such as
a mock science story of a giant body part enveloping the galaxy,
and a reader-generated list of words that sound dirty but aren't.
Those are the sorts of things that will appear on the Hecklers'
Playboy site.
</P>
<P>
   The Hecklers also will routinely attend Playboy Mansion parties
and other events, digital cameras in hand, and create humor based
on what they see.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy also has become the online entry point to Monk, the
electronic version of the offbeat 13-year-old magazine of life on
the road, published by Michael Lane and Jim Crotty.
</P>
<P>
   The two travel the country in a pink motor home, theming each
issue around a specific city, and writing about its distinctive
places and people. With Playboy, the Monk boys will be focusing on
such things as the 40 gotta-see places in each town they visit,
Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   The other new site is the Smoking Gun, which has long qualified
as noir weird. The site specializes in publishing official
documents from notorious cases, big and small, with appropriate
annotation and explanation.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone with an interest in the sometimes bizarre verite of
judicial and government documents, the Gun site has long been worth
a bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deals, Playboy Enterprises CEO Christie Hefner
said the company decided a year ago that it needed to treat its Web
site, which is among the Internet's busiest, as more than just a
stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   That meant more partnerships and content, such as with Hecklers,
Monk and the Smoking Gun, and just-announced deals with seven
electronic-commerce sites for such things as compact disc sales.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's biggest addition, online gambling, remains a ways off
in the future, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the political environment will change, and so
will the ability for government to (collect) its taxes, which is
the precursor to legitimizing online gambling,'' Hefner said.

IT'S A CRASH COURSE IN COZY 101
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ask any college kid _ er, young adult _ heading
off to school in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating a dorm room ranks high on the list of things to do in
the first few days of the fall semester, right up there with
running to the bookstore before all the used copies sell out and
getting into classes that don't start before midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, dorm rooms are more than merely a place to crash.
They're a home away from home, the first place students can truly
call their own, where parents can't censor their choice of posters
or force them to pick up their dirty socks.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm-room decorating has become serious business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dorm room is a reflection of myself,'' said Juan Venegas, a
senior at California State University, Northridge. ``It's my
sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Torrey Pine residence hall, Venegas' theme is fraternity
paraphernalia and family photos. Down the hall, Tierney Sams, a
junior from Los Angeles, expresses her taste in music by hanging
posters of jazz and hip-hop performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a creative person, so I like a dorm room to describe who I
am,'' Sams said. ``It gives me a cozy, home type of feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tierney prowls the aisles of Pic N Save, finding bargains on
colorful containers she uses for storage, candle holders and vases.
</P>
<P>
   To give students some additional ideas, home-decorating experts
create their vision of the perfect dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sunyog, home trend manager for Mervyn's California,
created a room bursting with color by using fabrics in bright red,
yellow, blue and green.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Dean, owner of Dean Interior Design in Studio City, put
together a room ``that a couple of guys would actually live in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And a team from IKEA in Burbank _ Monica Lovkvist, an interior
designer, and Chrissy Bates, a visual merchandiser _ went for a
unisex look that was both utilitarian and stylish.
</P>
<P>
   Each decorator began with the basics: two twin beds, two brown
Formica dressers, two desks, off-white walls and a purplish-blue
carpet in CSUN's Building 6.
</P>
<P>
   In just under two hours apiece, they transformed the rooms into
dorm sweet dorm.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Dean accomplished a truly authentic male look _ minus
the dirty clothes strewn on the floor _ by keeping accessories to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Dean chose comforters in washable denim blue ($69.99 at Strouds)
and blue and gray stripes ($79.99 at Strouds), with a single throw
pillow ($12.99 at Strouds) on each.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed Pamela Anderson pin-ups and Dodgers pennants from
his 12-year-old son's room and surfing posters (ranging in price
from free to $5.95 at Val Surf) to make this a room any guy could
feel comfortable not making his bed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a small room and put a lot of items in it,
aesthetically placed, the room has a tendency to look bigger,'' he
said. ``It's the optical illusion of design.''
</P>
<P>
   (And, Dean reminds, no dorm room is complete without a framed
photo of Mom and Dad to help remind students who's paying the
bills.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever see those television commercials where IKEA worker bees
transform an operating room and subway car into cozy living areas?
</P>
<P>
   IKEA's Monica Lovkvist and Chrissy Bates accomplished no less a
feat at CSUN. Keeping in mind the tight budgets of most college
students, they chose some of the store's lower-priced items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dorm rooms can be cold and impersonal,'' Lovkvist said.
``Students should have some cozy things around them to make them
feel at home. It's the first step of starting their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BEDS: Most dorm rooms come with those awful white
hospital-style sheets that won't do much for making you feel at
home. In their place, the pair chose cotton sheets in black, white,
blue and red ($9.95 for a set of two pillow cases, $6.95 each for
flat and fitted sheets) with a coordinating duvet ($29.95) and
throw pillows ($5.95 to $12.95). For added color, they folded a
lightweight cotton blanket ($29.95) over the duvet.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid having to dig around in the bottom of a closet to find
the match to your favorite pair of platform shoes, put
space-saving, galvanized steel shoe racks ($5.95) under the bed,
said the IKEA team.
</P>
<P>
   THE SHELVES: Unfinished pine boxes in assorted styles and sizes
(ranging from $9.95 to $19.95) can help maximize space and avoid
clutter. Put them on a desktop to hold papers, under beds for
storage and on shelves for style. For a personal touch, students
can add handles (IKEA sells hundreds of varieties ranging from 95
cents to $6.95 for a set of two). For added flair, stain or paint
the wood, or simply use marking pens to draw whatever you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   THE DESK: Good lighting is essential for studying. Halogen desk
lamps ($29.95) provide a softer light than the overhead fluorescent
fixtures. Keep your papers organized with three-level paper trays
($24.95).
</P>
<P>
   An X-shaped magnetic board ($4.95) is an alternative to a
bulletin board for posting notes, and a wooden figurine ($12.95) is
a funky knick-knack. Empty, frosted glass bottles ($3.95 to $9.95)
can make simple accessories or vases.
</P>
<P>
   The white swivel desk chairs ($79 each) might not be the most
comfortable for long hours of hitting the books, but they do look
stylish.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALLS: On the left side, the IKEA decorators hung three
prints of scenes from New York ($7.95 each) in matted frames
($12.95 each). (The frames are also a perfect fit for old album
covers.)
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite wall, Bates searched the children's section of
IKEA and found ``fun-house'' mirrors ($4.95 each) to ``add some
dimension to the room,'' she said. Another option is hanging a
bright light in front of the mirrors, for a disco-ball effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the floors, Bates and Lovkvist laid two rugs ($19.95 each) in
complementary geometric patterns.
</P>
<P>
   They used an extra dresser between the beds to double as a
nightstand. No college student can expect to graduate without a
reliable _ and loud _ alarm clock. Rather than the standard black
digital kind, they chose retro-looking blue and yellow clocks
($14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Tabletop lamps ($24.95) with paper shades can provide ambient
light. Since students might not remember to water their plants, the
decorating duo chose a hearty ficus plant ($6.95) in a galvanized
steel pot ($7.95) to add warmth to the room.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important items in a dorm room is the bed _ not
only for a good night's sleep after staying up all night cramming
for finals but to serve as a couch for entertaining friends.
</P>
<P>
   A sure way to make your bed both luxurious for sleeping and
comfy for sitting is lot of pillows, whether they are the sleeping
kind encased in colorful pillowcases ($14.99 for a set of two),
fabric throw pillows ($14.99) or plastic, inflatable pillows
($9.99), said Steve Sunyog.
</P>
<P>
   No college dorm room is complete without plastic milk crates
($4.99 each). Stack them to make a night stand, a table for a
microwave or extra storage area for books and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A fitted sheet ($7.99) secured to the wall with a staple gun to
make a pouffy valance can work as an inexpensive alternative to
curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a nice little pop of color to your walls,'' Sunyog
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other homey accessories include: trash can ($14.99), plates
($3.99 each), bowls ($3.99 each), tumblers ($3.99 each), bath
towels ($7.99).
</P>
<P>
   A dorm room staple for decades, a beanbag chair ($39.99) is
still a great place to flop with a book.

RETURN TO A MAGICAL WORLD WITH `PETER PAN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Second star on the right and straight on till
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember those infamous directions from a pixie-face boy called
Peter Pan?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's making a return flight to Southern California for a
brief stay. The young boy who vowed he would never grow up soars on
to the local stage in a new national touring production, starring
Cathy Rigby as ``Peter Pan.'' Paul Schoeffler takes on the dual
roles of Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook, Elisa Sagardia plays Wendy,
and Dana Solimando plays Liza and Tiger Lily.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Rigby, the former Olympic
gymnast-turned-actress, has taken on the demanding role made famous
by Mary Martin in the 1954 stage production. Rigby starred as the
impetuous boy in 1990-91 _ at the same theater.
</P>
<P>
   And Rigby hasn't lost her touch or her energy. Her singing voice
shows power and exquisite range. It's hard to believe this is a
45-year-old mother of four soaring over the stage with the ease of
a veteran flying ace.
</P>
<P>
   The flying illusions provided by ZFX Inc. entrance young and old
alike, but credit must be given to Rigby, whose years of gymnastic
training most certainly have kept her agile. Her fluid movement is
apparent in the twirls and flips that have the audience ooing and
aahing with glee. Rigby's Peter Pan exhibits a full range of
emotions, from inquisitiveness to zeal to disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   From music to scenery, this lavish production captivates the
imaginations of child and adult alike. John Iacovelli's colorful,
bigger-than-life sets create the right feel for each scene. And the
costuming by Shigeru Yaji helps define the characters'
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best show-stopping choreography occurs during the
``Ugg-a-Wugg'' number with Peter, Tiger Lily, the Lost Boys, the
Indians, Wendy, John and Michael. From the intense pounding of the
drums to the free-style dancing, the audience is drawn into this
scene that is reminiscent of a ``Stomp'' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite scene is when Tinker Bell drinks the poison
meant for Peter. There is no one around except the audience. With
Tinker Bell in his hand, Peter asks the audience: ``Do you believe?
Do you believe in fairies?'' Dozens of excited voices shriek: ``We
believe!''
</P>
<P>
   Applause should also be given to Schoeffler, who plays a
delightfully rotten Capt. Hook. His cocky attitude and intimidating
persona had every kid paying attention. But when he tangos with his
pirate crew, the crowd goes wild. His portrayal of Mr. Darling as a
flustered but loving husband and father was also endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sagardia's Wendy showed range and maturity and was both
believable and sweet, but her microphone may have been poorly
adjusted during her early scenes because her voice was slightly
shrill. Solimando as Tiger Lily brought more depth to the character
than had been apparent in other stage versions. Her dancing and
drumming ability were astonishing and drew the audience into her
realm.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps one of the most appealing scenes was when Rigby flew
over the audience and sprinkled fairy dust on them. Adults and
children alike roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never experienced ``Peter Pan,'' this is the
production to see. The choreography, the music, the acting and the
singing are all superb. For a scant 2{ hours, you can become a kid
just like the one who never wanted to grow up.

WHEN BEHAVIOR BECOMES POLITICAL WHIPPING BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In 1885, as he lay dying of cancer, Ulysses
Simpson Grant, former president and former commanding general of
the Union Army, received an injection of brandy in his arm to ease
his pain. The next day, the Women's Christian Temperance Union
denounced the doctors for giving the general intoxicating liquor.
</P>
<P>
   At the high tide of American Puritanism, the WCTU symbolized a
Victorian obsession that still rules politics. Today, both parties
are fixated on OPB, Other People's Behavior, using scorn, piety,
and false pity.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans scapegoat homosexuality. The Democrats demonize
tobacco. Neither side, in their zealotry, heeds the New Testament
wisdom of St. Matthew: ``And why beholdest thou the mote that is in
thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine
own eye?''
</P>
<P>
   Self-righteousness is at the core of this politics. The GOP,
fearful of defectors among its armies of Christian soldiers, seeks
to energize the party base by waving the witch doctor's rattle of
OPB. The gay lifestyle is a handy talisman for stout defenders of
``family values'' to beat back the heathen hordes of lefty
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Piety keeps company with the bogeyman. We're not gay-bashing,
goes the pharisaic chant. We hate the sin but love the sinner.
Yeah, right, as anyone can say who ever witnessed a legislative or
congressional debate on a gay-related subject. Tolerance is seldom
the hallmark of any such discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance is also missing in talk about tobacco. While smokers
and gays may seem like disparate subjects, the reaction to each is
similar: a hot-eyed wrath that only OPB can evoke. With a
resounding sense of self-righteousness, the response often involves
a strong desire to proseltyize the heathen. An ex-gay or an
ex-smoker is not only a splendid trophy but living proof that
there's no zealot like a convert. When the conversion effort fails,
the next step is to turn the obdurate miscreant into a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is bad for everyone, a fact of science. Hysteria over
tobacco serves the needs of Democrats today, a fact of politics. If
Ulysses Grant were seeking the Democratic presidential nomination
today, he would be disqualified because he was once seen smoking a
cigar. He used to smoke 20 a day during the Civil War, which
probably caused his cancer, thus feeding a peculiar sense of
self-satisfaction that animates those fixated on OPB. When the AIDS
epidemic began to match the toll of lung cancer, the crocodile
tears of critics flowed smugly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-righteousness and even envy link gay-bashers to those who
swoon over the sight of a cigarette. In Palo Alto, near Stanford
University, smoking is banned in public parks. Why? To protect Palo
Altan toddlers in the unlikely event an offender would deliberately
exhale fumes over the jungle gym? No, it is designed to appease
adult dismay at the sight of another adult enjoying an unhealthy,
incorrect, and guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lecture smokers are perfect Puritans, the type Thomas
Babington Macaulay described in his ``History of England'': ``The
Puritan hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the bear,
but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   The instinct to criticize and ostracize is as strong as the arm
of Carry Nation, who wielded an ax to saloon walls on behalf of the
WCTU in the 19th century. H.L. Mencken, the leading American
student of Puritanism, wrote that Prohibition was flagging until
Carry Nation grabbed her ax.

GIVE YOUNG DRIVERS TIME TO LEARN THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Maine, now Massachusetts has adopted restrictions for
young, newly-licensed drivers. Maine requires adult copilots for a
time and the Bay State is putting a curfew into effect. The
legislation recognizes that we license young _ entirely too young,
perhaps _ and that experience informs judgment. The neophyte driver
needs some apprentice time.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account that we license youngsters when they
are going through extreme changes, when the judgment is clouded by
raging hormones. While the respective legislatures should be
applauded for the good intentions and the institution of
(itals)something(unitals) to reduce teenage carnage on the
highways, they should also get dope slaps for not attacking the
root of the problem: driver ed. It is not enough merely to curtail
the newly-licensed until a some experience is gained; we've got to
make certain the newly-licensed can actually drive before handing
them the keys.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the problem of teenage auto carnage is more likely
to be found in quality driver education than in enforcement of new
rules. In fact, real driver ed would likely make restrictions
easier for teens to swallow, thus easier to enforce. Of course,
improved education is much more expensive than legislating rules
changes. But Massachusetts and Maine are both boasting budget
surpluses currently _ what better way to spend the money than by
making a quantum leap in the quality and efficacy of driver ed?
</P>
<P>
   The improvement would not be simple; the issue of driver ed is
complicated by the same thing that makes improvement in the
Massachusetts educational structure difficult: the quality of the
teachers. Additionally, there is a small investment in equipment
and probably a large investment in insurance premiums, given the
current litigation-oriented mindset in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating on parallel parking, driver education
should concentrate on the real world of (itals)driving(unitals).
Young candidates for driving privileges should not just be preached
at to avoid the occasion of sin but given the skills to cope with
the perils of temptation. ``Don't drink'' and ``don't speed'' are
worthwhile admonitions but offer no knowledge of how to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   What should be taught? Classroom work should begin with the
physics of the car _ how it behaves, steering geometry, weight
transfer. The student should be taught how weight transfers in
braking, how that affects the contact with the road, how that
affects the possibility of skids.
</P>
<P>
   The driving exercises should begin with throttle steering
exercises, advance to the skid pad exercises in losing, then
regaining, control of the car. Correcting for a skid is a bit more
complicated than just ``steer in the direction of the skid,'' the
standard short lesson in driver ed _ sans practice, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises should follow to demonstrate what happens in braking,
how to maintain steering control while braking. And there should be
a thorough grounding in antlock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, slalom exercises to demonstrate control, finesse. Then the
motocross exercises, actually driving a closed course. In winter,
the exercises take advantage of snow and ice to teach winter
driving skills. None of this takes place on a public road; all of
this should take place before a youngster is given a learning
permit and allowed behind the wheel in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   So, does the state spend billions building training arenas for
drivers to accomplish this? No, Bunky, the state already has;
virtually every high school in New England already has a skid pad _
they call it a ``parking lot.'' A motocross course or slaloms are
easily assembled with traffic cones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are automotive technologies out there to help
_ so-called ``skid cars'' that vary traction and induce skids _
safely _ and autos that can simulate loss of reaction time and
skills in an alcohol-impaired driver _ safely and without the
booze.
</P>
<P>
   The result of such a program instills a new respect for the car,
exposes the limitations of the driver, and offers worthy avenues of
practice to sharpen skills. More important, knowledge and skill
reinforce good judgment, erect barriers to hormone poisoning on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes me an expert on the subject? For 20 years while
writing these weekly offerings, I've been going to schools that
offer just such curricula as I've outlined above. And taking course
_ Skip Barber's advanced driving, lessons here and there with Bob
Bondurant, track time with Jackie Stewart, winter driving schools
with Jean Paul Luc, Audi, and Saab. I remember my son's tales of
driver ed in high school and saw the difference a day with Skip
Barber's instructors made in his driving attitude and his skill.
And I remember being in a class with an instructor of driving
instructors for public schools, an offensive oaf who argued with
Barber's instructors until he had convinced everyone in the room
that he was an arrant ass teaching children to court disaster. Then
he proved it on the skid pad.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are a fact of life in America. We should be doing as much
as possible to prevent them from becoming a fact of death for our
children. It is not enough to tell them what not to do; we must
reinforce postive driving habits and real driving skills.

BWM RAGTOP SHINES IN `EXHAUSTIVE STUDY' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday is usually devoted solely to deadline duties at the
Globe; last Friday was different. Very different. The deadline
duties had to be dealt with, to be sure, but the bulk of the day
was given over to an exhaustive study of convertibles by the New
England Motor Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustive. Comprehensive. A fleet of rag-roofed vehicles had
been amassed for the project, and the vehicles and the NEMPA
Exhaustive Study Committee _ a committee of the whole _ would
assemble at the Globe early Friday morning. For me, the Exhaustive
Study commenced Thursday afternoon when the bright blue BMW Z3 M
Roadster was delivered _ my specimen for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was given over to the regular writing routine and some
of the Friday work; the remaining Friday work would be tackled in
the early morn prior to beginning the Exhaustive Study. This meant
staying in town, in a modest-priced motel close to the office. I
love my job.
</P>

   Friday dawned gray _ and wet. Pouring rain. Not a great day for
an Exhaustive Study of convertibles. Thursday night I had nosed the
Z3 into a space at the end of the empty cul de sac that serves as a
parking lot. Friday morning, the cul de sac was no longer empty but
full of vehicles filling every marked parking spot and some
unmarked places adapted for parking, serving to make me painfully
aware of a drawback peculiar to convertibles: visibility. Or to be
more specific, lack of visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 top is low, almost claustrophobic, and the backlight
(technobabble for the rear window) is plastic _ no defroster here _
and small. Rain has rendered the plastic opaque; there is no
visibility through the canvas to either rear quarter, and the
outside mirrors are rain-spotted and not much use _ especially the
passenger side in which objects appear farther away than they
actually are. So, it is exit (bumping my head on the low overhead),
reconnoiter, reenter (bumping again _ I just can't bend low enough
to avoid it), creep along in reverse until I forget locations,
repeat all of the above. Finally, I have effected a turn and can
drive out frontwards _ narrowly missing a pedestrian trying to get
across the lot.
</P>
<P>
   I hit the Globe at 7 a.m. plus a few minutes and meet no one I
know _ but then I haven't been to the Globe at this hour in years.
At 9 a.m. with deadlines dutifuly met, the real labor of the day
begins as the convertibles _ Mustangs, BMWs, a Jaguar XK8, Mazda
Miata, Chrysler Sebring, a couple of Mercedes-Benz cars, Acura NSX,
even a Toyota RAV4 with a canvas top, not exactly a convertible but
so what! I offer up my Z3 to another for ``familiarization on the
first leg'' trading for a much roomier 225-horsepower Mustang GT
with glass backlight. The Exhaustive Study Committee rolls out onto
Morrissey Boulevard and sets a course for Maine. At the New
Hampshire border, the committee pauses to swap specimens; I hang
onto the GT. The sky brightens, tops come down; in Maine, the sun
is shining, the GT top comes down.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first NEMPA Ragtop Rumble _ it was supposed to be
Ramble but a typo in the stationery caused a change in title to
avoid more paperwork and expense. It takes us into Ogunquit, along
the coast and a stop for lunch, then a run along the ocean and up
to Wells to the Wells Antique Auto Museum where notes are compared,
tires kicked, and the museum's eclectic collection of old cars,
music-producing machines, and automotive paraphernalia are assessed
(a story for another day _ wonderful place). With the sun long past
its zenith, I reclaim the Z and set out across Maine and home.
Exhausting work, this, but I love this job.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is given to more exhaustive studies of the Z3; Sunday,
I enlist the aid of son of auto writer, and we set out for the
seacoast again _ Orchard Beach, Saco, thence westerly along Route 9
into Kennebunk, back across Maine into Somersworth, N.H., over a
short stretch of 236, and north, more or less, along the country
lanes of the Granite State. Son Chris is driving; I am ...
studying. Exhaustively.
</P>
<P>
   With the ragtop folded, the Z3 offers no visibility problems,
naturally. Well, almost none; the rear-view mirror blocks a big
chunk of windshield and really gets in the way, especially when
making right turns, no matter where the top is.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to roll up the windows, fasten the net windscreen
in place behind the seats and carry on a normal conversation on a
65 m.p.h. interstate. This M version is not only a pretty little
roadster but also a dynamite driving machine. It flies. It is
elastic, too; the Z will accelerate nicely in any gear _ did I
mention it's a five-speed manual? Perhaps I've neglected to
mention, too, the 240-horsepower 3.152-liter I-6 in this mighty
mite, the same engine that powers the M3 performance models.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very comfortable two-seater, this, but it does have some
flaws. Although the gauge cluster on the dash is clear, a set of
meters on the mid-dash console becomes invisible at times due to
reflections. The motor that powers the rag roof is wimpy; one must
unlatch the roof and push it up a foot or so before the motor will
grab it and pull it down. There is a boot to cover it when folded,
and it's not all that bad to attach _ tabs slip under the body, and
two snaps lock it in place. But it almost fills the small trunk;
it's better left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is quick, precise, the Z sticks to the corners like
kittens to couch covers. The shifter is smooth and there is some
resistance to the reverse position _ at least on the test model _
which made fouling up a shift much less likely. The ride is firm,
didn't seem harsh.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning/heater controls are big knobs, easy to use
_ the AC will chill meat even with the top down in the sun. The
radio controls are not as user friendly but not bad _ on/off/volume
knob, large presets, and tuning rockers that are almost big enough
for gloved hands (in case you drive this in winter). There are two
cupholders, but behind your elbows between the seats, hardly
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage wasn't bad; the Z3 delivered 22.6 miles per gallon
during the Exhaustive Study, over a variety of roads covering some
400 miles measured. The bad news is price. The Z3 M Roadster lists
for $42,770 delivered, albeit very well equipped; if I had it, I'd
pay it. Despite its flaws and idiosyncrasies, this little car is a
big bag of fun and a machine of ecstacy on a winding country road.
The kid and I give thumbs up _ that's six thumbs if you include the
guy who swapped the GT. He loved it even in the rain.

LOW RATINGS SINK MAGIC JOHNSON AFTER ONLY TWO MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final stunt for ``The Magic Hour'' will be a vanishing act.
The late-night talk show, featuring the basketball legend Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson as its host, has been canceled by its syndicator,
20th Television, after only two months because of low ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the hourlong show appears on Fox at 11:30 on
weeknights. Reruns will continue until early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were improving with each day,'' Johnson said in a
statement, ``but this is television, and shows are canceled all the
time for one reason or another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magic Hour'' had an average Nielsen rating of 1.6, or a
little more than 2 million viewers each night, since its June 8
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the show was gaining in popularity, the economics of
such a major enterprise make it impossible to continue beyond its
initial commitment without gaining higher ratings in a very short
time,'' said the announcement by 20th Television, which is owned by
Fox's parent, the News Corp.

FIRST THE SHOW... NOW THE COMEDY ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld
was asked what it was like to end the run of his hit comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever take a dog into the park and take his leash off,
and he kind of looks up at you for a second and then just bolts
like a maniac?'' he asked. ``Something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but
before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time,
the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Seinfeld is going to bury the act with a live HBO
special called ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time.'' (It's tape
delayed on the West Coast.)
</P>
<P>
   The comedian has vowed that after tonight's performance he would
``never do any of these jokes again,'' and said he plans to start
working on an all-new act, though it may take eight months to a
year, ``depending on how hard I work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Seinfeld has been polishing his show on a
tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland, Australia,
England, Kansas City and Des Moines. He made an unpublicized
appearance at the Comedy &AMP; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach a few weeks
ago. On Wednesday, he began a 10-performance run at the Broadhurst
Theatre on Broadway that ends with tonight's show.
</P>
<P>
   As for why he decided to tour rather than take some time off,
Seinfeld said it was much more appealing than the usual vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in front of an audience is the most fun I can have,'' he
said. ``I've been on beaches. I've been on boats. It's pleasant,
but it's not really a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld is clearly enjoying himself on this tour,and performing
before his hometown crowd in New York City is especially rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York audiences have always been the best for me, because
humor is really a New York invention, as far as I'm concerned,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld isn't likely to pull any surprises tonight, though
reports say the material varies slightly from show to show. He is
at heart a Borscht Belt-style stand-up comedian who polishes his
material to a brilliant shine; his strength is wry, witty
observations. You'll see no wild, raw improv antics a la Robin
Williams. Neither will he go into a prolonged character, as Billy
Crystal or Whoopi Goldberg do in their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld is most comfortable being himself. He did, as you
remember, play a character for nine years named Jerry Seinfeld on
his hit series. The comedian's schtick, for the most part, is his
puzzlement and amusement over the absurdities of modern life. And
his look at the end of a joke, which combines a slight bewilderment
at the ridiculousness of a situation along with a bit of smug
superiority because he's aware of it, is what endears him to
audiences who feel the same way. (``Oh yeah,'' you're thinking as
you're laughing, ``I noticed that.'')
</P>
<P>
   The reviews of the tour and the Broadway performances have been
mostly positive. And even if the material is likely to be familiar
to fans, it isn't likely to stop anyone from laughing. One Midwest
critic started off by carping that a better title for the concert
would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've Heard This One,'' but throughout
the rest of the review repeated a lot of the show's jokes (we won't
do that) and talked about how much the audience enjoyed itself.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. ``Seinfeld'' reruns in syndication do handsomely.
Good jokes, after all, are hard to find, which makes tonight's
show, if Seinfeld keeps his promise, a keeper for anyone with a
VCR. (It will be repeated at 9:30 p.m. Sept. 12.) For those of you
who don't, the material will also be included on his upcoming
Universal Records album of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, one of the people watching those syndicated
reruns is Seinfeld himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were very funny, the ones that I saw,'' he
said. ``I found them very, very entertaining. I was upset that the
show went off the air when I saw them.''

JENNA'S LAW MAY DEFANG GOP ATTACKS ON DEMOCRATS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACEY TULLY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The name ``Jenna'' took on a sad,
larger-than-life quality over the last year in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Russell Sage College nursing students mourned
the death of their friend and classmate, Jenna Grieshaber, 22.
</P>
<P>
   On Interstate 787, a billboard _ an advertisement for a law firm
_ screams ``JUSTICE FOR JENNA'' in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, lawyers are preparing to defend the Albany Police
Department against a lawsuit that, in part, alleges that the police
let Jenna's suspected killer escape from the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   A memory. An ad. A lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, a law. On the steps of the state Capitol,
Jenna's name became permanently linked to legislation eliminating
parole for violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gov. George Pataki signed the bill, another potential
legacy of the death began to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   Because Republicans can no longer claim that Assembly Democrats
blocked the legislation, her name suddenly lost much of its power
as campaign ammunition in November's elections, according to
pundits and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a campaign issue,'' said Joseph
Crangle, a Buffalo lawyer who has served as past chairman of the
Democratic State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly takes some of the wind out of the Republicans'
sails,'' Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Majority Leader Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, had
initially blocked the lower house from voting on the bill, arguing
that the law should also include increased drug treatment and
education programs. Republicans responded by mounting an intense
campaign to portray Assembly Democrats as being soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, bowing to the fierce political pressure, Silver
called the Assembly back into session and the law passed with
strong bipartisan support. It requires first-time violent offenders
to serve at least six-sevenths of their maximum term and extends
the post-release supervision period.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant, agreed that
Assembly Democrats _ especially those upstate who face tight races
_ can certainly breathe easier. But this relief came at a high
price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, Sheinkopf said, has ``disarmed the Republicans'' in
districts with equal numbers of enrolled Democrats and Republicans,
where incumbents will face the toughest challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he paid a very big price. And Pataki's the big winner,''
Sheinkopf said. Pataki, a Republican, will now be able to
concentrate on criminal justice issues and downplay the struggling
upstate economy as he campaigns for re-election, Sheinkopf
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be the man who made you safer and the economic
villain at the same time,'' Sheinkopf said. ``Would you rather be
safe or would you rather be employed?''
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga County Republican Chairman John ``Jasper'' Nolan agreed
that Silver's decision to allow the bill to the floor for a vote
``nullified'' a potentially powerful campaign issue. But he said
Silver's initial reluctance helps the Republicans draw a clear
distinction between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years, no one could really grasp what the Republicans
where trying to say. And then tragically, this young woman's death
gave it a personality,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The law remains a powerful symbol of discord between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenna's law is a striking example of the kind of issues that
they (Republicans) are using to separate themselves from the
Democratic leadership in the Assembly,'' said Thomas Slater, a
Clifton Park political consultant who is working on several
Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, an Albany prison-rights activist and Green Party
candidate for lieutenant governor, said she believed the political
attacks leveled by Republicans have been successful. Green staged a
36-hour hunger strike last week in opposition to Jenna's Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hammered away enough at it. They've said: `We're the
people who want to protect you. They've completely dehumanized the
suspect,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, pollster John Zogby maintains that there is too much time
before the November election for the issue to have any real effect.
And he expects that low voter turnout in September and November
will benefit incumbents, whether Republican or Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not a year when you're going to be able to generate
any sense of passion in people,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ As an author and deadpan humorist, Calvin Trillin
often recycles his life into his essays and stories and then
recycles them into books. In ``Family Man,'' his latest and his
20th book, he says that for a writer nothing is off the record. He
gave an early warning to that effect to his wife, Alice, and their
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Although as adults, each daughter has shown signs of literary
talent, he does not fear filial reciprocity: ``When they were about
5 and 8, I asked them to sign a standard nondisclosure agreement.
Nothing fancy. When they didn't understand why they were doing it,
I said, `Trust your daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   After he finished writing his book _ wry tales and home truths
about life with the Trillins _ he asked them to vet it for moments
that might make them uncomfortable. His older daughter was peeved
because she had wanted to tell some of the stories herself. His
response: ``You should have gotten there first, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled. He loves his family and is having a happy life
_ and he is a little embarrassed about that fact. There is no Dark
Secret in his past, and he knows that Dark Secrets sell books.
</P>
<P>
   Trillin was having lunch at one of his favorite restaurants, the
Union Square Cafe, but the ground rules for the meeting were that
he would not talk about food. He often talks and writes about food,
as in his ``tummy trilogy'' about eating in America. The
conversational aim was to furrow new Trillinesque territory, but
feinschmecker that he is, his appetite kept intruding, as in his
opening gambit to the waitress: ``I would like the only martini
ordered here this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Family Man,'' he says that a writer's obligation to his art
and to his family depends on the quality of the art. He offers the
Dostoyevsky Test: ``If you have reason to believe that you're
another Dostoyevsky, you can say anything you need to say.'' And if
you don't, you can't.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if you're another Dostoyevsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``A rational human being would realize he's not another
Dostoyevsky around the time of the first piece he writes,'' Trillin
said. ``I can't remember whether Dostoyevsky was a late bloomer or
not. I do remember when there was a question about the dental plan
at The New Yorker, I was told that writers were basically artists
and didn't have to worry about such mundane, bourgeois things as
dental plans, and that Dosteyevsky didn't have a dental plan. I
said, did you ever get a load of his teeth? Dostoyevsky belonged to
the wrong HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the question, he said: ``I just thought of an
answer. If there's a comparison to Dostoyevsky in the review of
your first book, then at least you have a shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's a negative comparison?
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean like, `the notion of this guy writing on the same
planet with Dostoyevsky is laughable?' Let me think about that for
a minute. I thought about it. No.''
</P>
<P>
   The food arrived at the table, ``spicy deluxe chicken salad.''
``It looks more deluxe than spicy,'' he commented, then admitted,
``Spicy's hard to see, unless it has those big red things.''
</P>
<P>
   As a working journalist, he has said that the ``principal side
benefit'' of his profession is a ``decent-size death notice.'' He
imagined that in his own obituary, the subhead would read
``Monolingual Reporter Succumbs.'' He was asked what should come
after the comma, a writer who ...? Would it be Calvin Trillin, ``a
writer who never forgot Rule 6: Enough is enough.'' Or ``a would-be
Dostoyevsky who settled for a life of rhyme,'' or the ``funniest
man named Calvin?''
</P>
<P>
   Sifting possibilities, he said, ``My problem with that is that
I've never known exactly which hat I was wearing: the reporter
fedora with the little press badge in the hatband, or the jester
with the pompom bouncing in my eyes. If I had called in a
professional career consultant, he would have said you have to
figure out what's going to be after the comma in your obituary.
Then, you'll know how to get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Trillin said that recently he had been talking to a friend who
shared his birth date, Dec. 5. ``We were talking about famous
people who were born Dec. 5. I, of course, brought up Walt Disney.
Kansas City guy, Walt Disney. And either Somoza or Trujillo, one of
the big dictators. My friend said, `And Calvin Coolidge,' of
course. I said, `Calvin Coolidge was born on Dec. 5?' Does that
explain it? Could it be that my parents were going to name me
Grover or Millard, and then it turned out I was born on Dec. 5, so
they named me Calvin? I rather doubt it, since I looked up Calvin
Coolidge and he was born in July.''

<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Then he explained that he once thought about interfering with an
advance obituary. ``The wily and parsimonious Victor Navasky called
me and up and said, `This joke of yours about how cheap I am has
gone too far.''' Trillin has often said that when he writes pieces
for Navasky at The Nation, he is paid ``in the high two figures.''
Confronted with the editor's protest, he said he would be willing
to join in a letter to ask that in his advance obit ``the
chintziness should be moved further down in the story.''
</P>
<P>
   He thereupon confessed that he had been offered the high two
figures but that his agent had ``got him up to $100,'' in other
words, the lowest three figures, and that is what he is paid for
his poems in The Nation. ``Poets are normally paid by the line,''
he said. ``The highest payment, the last time I checked, was $10 a
line at The New Yorker. I'm paid $100 no matter how long the poem
is. That's absolute top dollar in that field. I write a two-line
poem, that's $50 a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Trillin then revealed the key to his poetry: ``I usually set the
shower to iambic pentameter on Sunday night. My shower has an
iambic pentameter setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot, cold and iambic pentameter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``and why do you think I'm so grateful to
Kenneth Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   Because his name is easy to rhyme?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but it's not as good as Ross Perot. Ross Perot was the
versifier's dream candidate for president _ an iambic pentameter
with an o rhyme.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Bush? ``It was hard because tush was not considered
respectful to the president,'' he said. ``In my farewell poem to
Bush, I only used his other names: `Farewell to you George Herbert
Walker.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among his more public ventures, Trillin has appeared in a
one-man show in the American Humorist series at the American Place
Theater, and he has acted in movies directed by Nora Ephron. ``We
prefer not to identify the director,'' he said. ``Then you think,
this man has been in a number of movies. Two. By chance by Nora
Ephron. Both of them were big successes. I'm sort of a talisman. I
was pretty good in `Sleepless in Seattle.' I didn't quite carry the
movie, although the Varsity Theater near the university in Seattle
had on its marquee, `Meg Ryan and Calvin Trillin in ``Sleepless in
Seattle.''' Tom Hanks did not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he explain that? ``Talent. Name recognition.'' He said
that he and his wife and Ms. Ephron were together for Trillin's
60th birthday, and the director said she was about to start
shooting another movie. Out of the blue he asked her if there was a
role in it for a sheriff. As a matter of fact there was and, months
later, he was offered the role. He assumed the character with great
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by chance, I had the creed of the Texas Rangers on my
bulletin board: `No man in the wrong can stand up against a man
that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'. When I got into my
sheriff's costume and walked onto the set, Nora actually thought
maybe one of the movie vans had been parked in a no-parking zone
and some law enforcement officer had come in. I exuded Law
Enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been offered several non-Ephron films, including
one in which his character was described as ``a geeky-looking guy
in plaid pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `That's not me. You're talking Tom Hanks.'''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress brought over a platter of cookies. He ate one, eyed
another and remembered Rule 6. Returning to an earlier subject, he
said, `` `Funniest person named Calvin' is very tempting. Can I put
a request in?''

ADOLESCENT GIRLS AS BABY SITTERS: IMAGE AND REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The baby sitter is downstairs, the children are asleep. The
phone rings. A maniac is calling _ from the upstairs extension.
</P>
<P>
   Baby sitters in jeopardy are a classic theme of the horror
genre, from the baby-sitter novels by R.L. Stine to movies like
``When a Stranger Calls.''
</P>
<P>
   To Miriam Formanek-Brunell, a professor of history at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City and the director of the Women's
and Gender Studies program there, the image of the baby sitter also
offers clues to deep-seated attitudes toward adolescent girls.
``Adolescent girls are either victims, villains or vixens in
popular culture,'' said Ms. Formanek-Brunell, who is writing a
history of baby-sitting in America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Formanek-Brunell's study is part of a new realm of scholarly
inquiry called ``girls' culture,'' which looks at girls and their
clubs, secret languages, games and books. This month, a new
anthology on girls culture, ``Delinquents and Debutantes:
Twentieth-Century American Girls' Cultures,'' edited by Sherrie A.
Inness, will be published by New York University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls' lives have been overlooked until recently by
historians,'' said Ms. Formanek-Brunell, author of ``Made to Play
House: Dolls and the Commercialization of American Girlhood,
1830-1930'' (Yale University Press, 1993) and editor of ``The Story
of Rose O'Neill: An Autobiography'' (University of Missouri Press,
1997). ``Girls' lives tend to be trivialized and dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But baby-sitting has been the leading form of part-time
employment for adolescent girls since World War II,'' Ms.
Formanek-Brunell said. ``By 1948, it was a $750 million
industry.'''' It is also, she said, one of an adolescent girl's
``first steps toward independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Formanek-Brunell combed child-care manuals, baby-sitter
handbooks, periodicals and newspaper articles. ``Until 1941, I
couldn't find any mentions of baby sitters in popular culture,''
she said. ``Teen-age girls were not singled out as baby sitters.
They were one among many caretakers `minding' the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The professionalization of baby-sitting started right after
World War II, she said. During the war, adolescent girls had
factory jobs as part of the war effort. But at the end of the war,
they were pushed out to make way for returning soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of a new ``youth culture'' aimed at girls, she
said, they began working to earn money so they could buy newly
available consumer goods, like records and clothing. At the same
time, as couples began moving to the suburbs, away from their
extended families, there were were fewer relatives to care for
small children. Parents became dependent on sitters. ``Now girls
could charge for it,'' said Ms. Formanek-Brunell. ``They feel brash
and brazen. And they make parents' lives hellish.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast and the Midwest, they tried to form unions.
``They were perceived as militant radicals,'' Ms. Formanek-Brunell
said. The unions didn't catch on, but adolescent girls began
developing a culture of rebellion. Suburban houses had been built
with young children in mind and they provided little private space
for adolescents to gather. The girls began inviting their
girlfriends _ and boys _ over for parties. Girls were seen as a
destabilizing force. The YWCA responded to the tension created by
these newly assertive adolescents by developing courses on
baby-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults are thinking that girls should baby-sit and not get
paid for it,'' Formanek-Brunell's said, ``The idea is that it is
their obligation as daughters and as young females. They should
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, parents felt guilty about hiring someone to
care for their children, said Ms. Formanek-Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   By the '50s, the baby sitter began to be seen as a sexual threat
to marital stability. ``She becomes an icon,'' said Ms.
Formanek-Brunell, ``She is dangerous. She represents social and
sexual disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Bother to Knock'' (1952), in which Marilyn Monroe plays
a young, disturbed woman hired to baby-sit, was an early example of
the baby sitter as villainous temptress. Later, in ``The
Babysitter,'' a story by Robert Coover, a husband has erotic
fantasies about the baby sitter. The story was made into a 1995
movie starring Alicia Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
   In movies like ``Fright'' (1971) and ``Halloween'' (1978) the
baby sitter is in for big trouble. ``Halloween'' actually has two
baby sitters who are attacked. Like Jamie Lee Curtis, the star of
``Halloween,'' many major female stars played baby sitters early in
their career. In the Stine novels, written in the late '80s and
early '90s, ``She is the victim of a crazed man who is beating up
baby sitters, and she becomes crazy herself,'' said Ms.
Formanek-Brunell
</P>
<P>
   She notes that on the covers of Stine's baby sitter books and in
``Baby Sitters Beware,'' one of The Baby-Sitters Club books: ``We
see the girl through the window. We become voyeurs, stalking and
watching her too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Formanek-Brunell points out the frequency of the image of
the telephone in the baby sitter horror genre. ``The phone is an
instrument of liberation for adolescent girls,'' she said. ``But it
is transformed into something extremely threatening that engenders
an undesirable intimacy with the maniac, and therefore brings about
her submission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular culture both mirrors and shapes the fears and
anxieties of adults about female adolescents,'' Ms.
Formanek-Brunell said. ``The girls are taking their first steps
toward independence, they're beginning to earn money, and they're
being hounded, stalked and frightened.''
</P>

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Repent of your sin! You have no inheritance in the Kingdom of
God! You are going to hell. You have made yourself homosexual
because of your carnality.''
 &HT;    Not intoned by some street-corner evangelist, this warning came
from the Rt. Rev. Emmanuel Chukwumu, an Anglican bishop from
Nigeria, outside the hall at the Lambeth Conference this week in
Canterbury.
 &HT;    Inside, Anglican bishops from around the world debated
homosexuality. Meeting in their once-a-decade convocation, bishops
from the Anglican Communion (the Episcopal Church in the United
States) soundly defeated any liberalization of Christian ethics
regarding sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Bishop Chukwumu continued preaching to gay activists: ``That is
why your Church is dying in Europe -- because it is condoning
immorality. You are killing the Church. This is the voice of God
talking. Yes, I am violent against sin. Sodom and Gomorrah were
destroyed.''
 &HT;    This encounter epitomizes the triumphs and tensions of
Christianity as it ends its second millennium.
 &HT;    Unbeknownst to most western Christians, the missionary
enterprise conducted by their forebears over the last three
centuries was successful. As
 &HT;    the world prepares to celebrate the 2,000th birthday of
Christianity's founder, the faith has undergone a remarkable
transformation.
 &HT;    The ``typical'' Christian is neither white nor of European
descent. Now, a Christian is more likely to be black, brown, yellow
or red. The world's largest religion has become the world's most
globally diverse faith.
 &HT;    Christianity's triumph confounds many liberal westerners.
Beginning early this century, many theologically liberal Europeans
and North Americans abandoned missions because of their
imperialistic assumptions.
 &HT;    However, when mainline Protestants stopped spreading the faith,
indigenous peoples began to evangelize their neighbors. Ironically,
liberal withdrawal created effective localized Christian missions
-- missions that transformed western Christianity into forms shaped
by native cultures.
 &HT;    Liberals were replaced not only by native missionaries -- often
theologically and biblically naive -- but also by the largest
evangelical mission force fielded in history. Following World War
II, evangelicals transformed the historically mainline mission
endeavor into a juggernaut of biblical literalism, traditional
values and conservative politics.
 &HT;    The views of these new missionaries meshed well with many
aspects of indigenous cultures. Armed with surprising cultural
sensitivity and advanced technologies, these missionaries and their
national partners converted millions previously outside the reach
of Christian churches. Through their efforts, and building on the
older missions, Christianity became the faith of sub-Saharan
Africa, South America, and large parts of Asia. Christianity isn't
the white man's religion anymore.
 &HT;    At Lambeth, Anglicans experienced the globalization of their
church. For the first time in their history, African and Asian
Anglican bishops outnumbered North Americans and Europeans.
 &HT;    From one perspective, this change delighted bishops from
traditionally British-based churches. Anglicanism is, indeed, a
lively, global, diverse and
 &HT;    growing faith. However, the change has also startled many. For
the most part, old-line Anglicans are socially and theologically
liberal; the new Anglicans -- influenced by cultural traditions and
theological literalism imparted by the evangelical mission force --
from the Two-Thirds World are not. Therefore, when sexual issues
came to a vote, the conservative Africa-Asian coalition demolished
any prospect of gay/lesbian ordination or same-sex union.
 &HT;    Many liberal Episcopalians, like myself, who take the Bible
seriously and favor liberalizing the church's teaching sexual
orientation, were distressed by the vote. We are rethinking
biblical theology regarding same-sex unions, and gay and lesbian
ordination. We are trying, in good conscience and fidelity, to
preach the gospel to our culture in a loving, grace-filled, and
meaningful way.
 &HT;    We believe that God's word lives as a powerful, healing force in
the church, our lives and our society. God calls each generation to
discern and speak that word and in the midst of the world's
turmoil.
 &HT;    Following Lambeth, many Episcopalians will blame the vote on
African and Asian homophobia or a vast right-wing conspiracy to
overturn theological liberalism in the church.
 &HT;    While Africans and Asians probably are homophobic and a
right-wing Episcopal conspiracy probably exists, that's not the
problem. The problem is that liberal Christians-- Episcopalians
included - have been too shy and slow to proclaim the good news as
we understand it. We abandoned the mission field, thus allowing
biblical literalism and ignorance to shape new churches and
theological education.
 &HT;    We were so afraid of our colonial sins that we silenced
ourselves, withholding our faith experience from our brothers and
sisters. We ignored Africa and Asia unless they fit with a liberal
political agenda. We neglected Jesus' command to go and teach the
nations. We failed.
 &HT;    We liberal chickens have finally come home to roost. For a
century, while Christianity has exploded across the globe with new
vitality, mainline Christians have sat puzzled on the sidelines.
 &HT;    No, Bishop Chukwumu, our churches are not dying because of
immorality. We are dying of timidity.

INVESTIGATION PUTS CRACKS ON PILLARS OF CLINTON'S LEGACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 9) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This was to be President Clinton's year for big
ideas, a time to cement his legacy as the first two-term Democratic
president since Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months ago, the president spent his 1997 vacation
reviewing a binder filled with projects that would form the pillars
of his place in history. This week, he is preparing to testify Aug.
17 before a grand jury investigating allegations he had an affair
with a White House intern and urged her to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the scandal, the pillars of his legacy are cracking.
And the projects _ race relations, anti-tobacco legislation,
climate change initiatives and Social Security reform _ are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidents in their second term always face the reality of
dwindling influence but this particular scandal has just perhaps
accelerated that process,'' said Earl Black, a political science
professor at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Added a top Republican congressional aide: ``He's destroyed his
bully pulpit and no one trusts him. His whole agenda has suffered
as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide recalled that in January Republicans braced for a major
State of the Union address by Clinton who then was riding high in
the polls and on a roll politically.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was being balanced for the first time in 30 years,
the economy was thriving, unemployment was at its lowest rates in a
generation, inflation was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of concerned about that, but all the momentum
just died as soon as the Monica Lewinsky story broke, and he has
not been able to regain that momentum,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has learned with a Republican-controlled Congress,
his greatest asset is his ability to use his office and his moral
authority, the bully pulpit of the presidency, to persuade the
public and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the president repeatedly has told people, this is the
time to solve the nation's big challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But his initiative to spark a dialogue on race relations has
been deemed lackluster by critics who complained the debate never
got off the ground. Tobacco legislation, patient bill of rights
legislation, campaign finance reform all foundered in Congress as
emboldened Republicans kept on eye on the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of specific legislative issues, I think the president
finds it difficult to be influential at critical moments,'' said
Robert Holsworth, a political science professor at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va. ``He certainly seems to
have lost his moral authority and his political clout has
dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that at a critical moment in the life of
the historic tobacco legislation, Clinton was unable to step into
the debate and control it. The legislation would have raised
cigarette prices by $1.10 per pack to discourage use by youths and
to reimburse states for the medical costs caused by ailing smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really bizarre political situation where you have a
president with an extraordinary high level of job approval who
can't seem to use it as leverage with the Congress,'' Holsworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holsworth also harkened back to Clinton's 1997 inaugural address
in which he pledged to help heal the wounds of the nation, to help
end rampant cynicism, to help revitalize the political center
against the extremes of the left and right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is that going nowhere, but he has to appeal to the
very elements of the culture that he wants to change in order to
fend off these attacks. So my feeling is this grand rhetoric about
articulating a third way and developing a new vital center is just
completely off the table at the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Congress has passed few pieces of legislation as the
Republican leaders have battled among themselves over the direction
their party should take. Neither party has much incentive to
compromise on major issues, preferring instead to turn them into
major political issues for the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill maintain the
president has pressed his agenda just as hard as possible and blame
Republicans for stalled legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried really hard not to let this affect the president's
public schedule,'' said Paul Begala, a senior Clinton adviser. In
an odd way, Begala said, the president was able to present his
agenda to the public more easily because networks so often
broadcast his speeches live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to manipulate this media obsession to the
advantage of policy,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been on message. He hasn't deviated,'' said
Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas. ``There has been a concerted effort to
distract him from the issues, and I don't see that ending when this
investigation is over. Still, the president stays focused and
pushes our message.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, said, ``As far as I can tell, the
president is out front and center talking about issues people care
about.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has since January, Clinton worked hard this week to
present a picture of a president going about his business, although
he studiously ignores reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here are doing there jobs,'' said spokesman
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton, attending a $1.2 million fund-raiser for Democrats
last week, told the crowd of contributors, ``When I was re-elected,
the vice president and I sat down one day and I told our people, I
said, `Look, I want us to drive the agenda of this country until
the last hour of the last day of my term in January of 2001. That
is what we signed on for; that is what we owe the American people;
that is the right thing to do.' '' &QL;

3 GAME PLANS FOR A CORRECTED PLAYING FIELD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC HUBLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this time different?
</P>
<P>
   As stunning as this week's stock decline was, the answer to the
question remains what it has always been: Nothing has changed _
unless, of course, it has.
</P>
<P>
   Three strategists, interviewed after the Dow Jones industrial
average dropped nearly 300 points on Tuesday, shared their views. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the sky truly is falling, don't tell Robert Froehlich, 45,
chief investment strategist for the mutual fund group of Scudder
Kemper Investments, that he failed to give you the heads-up.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor on Tuesday, he said, was more than just the ordinary
dip-and-rebound script that has played out so routinely over the
last several years. ``I think there's a confluence of some pretty
unique events causing this downdraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, Froehlich said, simultaneous crises of confidence
threaten the governments of the world's two biggest economies _ the
United States and Japan _ giving investors already skittish over
earnings, for example, one more reason to rush the exits.
</P>
<P>
   But don't downturns always lure bargain hunters? It may have
seemed that way for the last 10 years, Froehlich said, but one
ingredient is now missing. ``The buying opportunity usually comes
after you have an economic release the market can rally around,''
he said. ``Now, there is no economic release to rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of having some good economic news to cling to, he
continued, helps explain why European markets have outperformed
lately (though they did tumble on Wednesday, in sympathy with the
Dow's slide). ``Europe is doing better than most because they have
a great rallying point, the creation of a common currency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich advises a defensive posture but feels that consumer
confidence should remain strong. He recommends the drug, food and
homebuilding sectors, plus financial stocks that will benefit from
low interest rates. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sam Stovall, 43, sector strategist at Standard &AMP; Poor's, thinks
investors will look back on this period as the crisis that
(italics)almost(end italics) happened.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that the trouble spots are significant. If the
Dow were just ``bouncy,'' Stovall said, it would have turned north
at 8,600, where it has rebounded in the past. Instead, it crashed
right through that psychologically important level.
</P>
<P>
   Previous corrections of 5 percent to 10 percent since 1990 have
involved mainly small- and mid-cap stocks, leaving blue chips
aloft, Stovall said. Now, by contrast, ``we are hearing companies
that were Wall Street darlings caution analysts that forward
earnings could be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he continued, it was just the fundamental analysts,
those focusing on corporate financials, who were worried about
excessive price-to-earnings ratios, low dividend yields and the
like. Now, technical analysts are looking at ominous signals like
the increasing number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that
are hitting new 52-week lows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Stovall said, the market has a guardian angel: low
interest rates. ``I think in order for this market to really
tank,'' he said, ``the Fed has to raise interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't raise them, he said, because the Asian crisis will hurt
United States corporate profits enough to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   With low rates providing a cushion for stocks, Stovall said,
there is no reason to change his picks. ``I still favor the
consumer cyclicals, health care and selected technology issues,''
he said. ``But if investors are nervous and want to look to those
sectors that have held up best in market pullbacks, I would look to
the consumer staples _ food, beverage, tobacco and household
products _ as well as utilities.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Chuck Clough, 56, chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch, the perception that we were in a bull market before last
week's fall was illusory.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may come as a surprise to people, a market selloff has
been under way for months, Clough observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average stock has been declining for the better part of
the year,'' he said. ``The average stock on the American Exchange
and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market has been declining for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow Jones industrial average is only up about 4 percent
from where it was last July,'' he said, adding that investors have
been focusing for the last year on 15 to 20 stocks that have
powered the S&AMP;P 500-stock index and created the perception that the
market was stronger than it was.
</P>
<P>
   The fall on Tuesday was merely ``the culmination of something
that's been going on for a long time,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long you can run up 15 stocks and not the
other 97 percent,'' he continued. ``We might be in a position now
where the market trades sideways, in a range, for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Clough said, is overinvestment _ the Asian crisis
being only the most severe symptom.
</P>
<P>
   Investment will slow as some of the easy capital sloshing around
the world dries up, Clough predicted, but that is not as bad as it
sounds. ``The positive is, if that's true, inflation is going to be
astoundingly low as we go into 1999,'' he said. ``You could be
looking at 4 percent bond yields over the next year or two, and
that's good for financial stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to financial stocks, Clough would like to see his
firm's clients holding a handful of very high-quality companies,
because he thinks the rest of the market will tread water for the
foreseeable future. And don't skimp on bonds, he said, because this
is no time to be holding an unbalanced portfolio.

GAY ISSUE DIVIDES ANGLICAN COMMUNION, MANY U.S. BISHOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the significant messages coming out of the Lambeth
Conference in Canterbury, England, is the clear confirmation that
the Episcopal Church in the United States is much more liberal than
many other provinces of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Episcopalians from the United States _ including
Bishops Jack Iker of Fort Worth and James Stanton of Dallas _ are
usually in the minority when they speak out against gays in their
home country.
</P>
<P>
   But they were in the majority at the Lambeth meeting, held every
10 years. They joined with bishops from Africa and other parts of
the globe to push through a resolution strongly stating that
homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Iker, one of the few American bishops still refusing to ordain
women, also was buoyed by another resolution that said bishops
``should not be compelled to ordain and license women.'' It called
for establishing special provinces for bishops who oppose women's
ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, though he opposes ordaining gays and conducting
same-sex unions, favors ordaining women.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops voted 526-70 for the resolution on homosexuality.
Forty-five bishops, including Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold of
the United States, abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution rejected the practice of ordaining gays and
lesbians and conducting marriage ceremonies for gay couples. An
amendment explicitly condemned homosexual practice.
</P>
<P>
   After the homosexuality vote, members of the Episcopal Synod of
America, a conservative coalition based in Fort Worth, walked out
of the meeting room chanting ``V-I-C-T-O-R-Y,'' according to Katie
Sherrod of Fort Worth, who was a part of the Episcopal News Service
team of reporters covering Lambeth.
</P>
<P>
   Iker and Stanton have been saying all along that the American
church is more liberal than the rest of the Anglican Communion on
the subject of homosexuality. And the Lambeth Conference proved
their point.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Eustace Kamanyire of Uganda was quoted by Religious News
Service as saying that acceptance of homosexual practices by
Anglican clergy is undermining the church in many parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This false teaching emanating from part of the Anglican
Communion, when exported to Africa and other parts of the world, is
causing serious damage and scandal to Christ and his church,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resolution won't change the deep divisions over gay
ordinations and blessing of same-sex unions that exist among
Episcopal bishops in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop John Spong of Newark, N.J., one of the bishops who has
ordained gays, circulated a statement signed by other bishops from
the United States, England, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New
Zealand, South Africa and Wales vowing to continue seeking ``full
inclusion'' of gays in the life of the church.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signers, Bishop Catherine Waynick of Indianopolis,
was quoted by Religious News Service as saying, ``I want to suggest
that our call is not to correctness but to love.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-week-long Lambeth Conference, although influential, is
not a legislative body, as Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey
emphasized repeatedly. Decisions made at the conference are not
binding on any of the churches.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, at the end of the conference, urged his fellow church
members to engage in friendly dialogue on the controversial issues
facing the church.
</P>
<P>
   While rejecting ordination of gays and same-sex unions, the
resolution spoke out on the need to minister to many gays in
Anglican churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many ... are seeking the pastoral care and moral direction of
the church and God's transforming power,'' the resolution said.
``We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual
people. We wish to assure them that they are loved by God and that
all baptized, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual
orientation, are full members in the body of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the statement on homosexuality is not binding, Iker,
Stanton and other American conservatives will be energized anew to
carry on their fight against more liberal practices in the United
States.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

CLINTON'S BATTLE WITH STARR MAY DISCOURAGE FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES, EXPERTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whether President Clinton's failed efforts to keep
private conversations from a grand jury will affect the authority
of future chief executives is uncertain. But the allegations of
extramarital sex, obstruction of justice and perjury plaguing
Clinton will be a warning to his successors and may even discourage
qualified applicants from seeking the office, presidential scholars
say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's epic battle with independent counsel Kenneth Starr
over whether the president tried to cover up an alleged sexual
relationship has led to judicial decisions compelling the grand
jury testimony of White House attorneys and Secret Service agents.
The courtroom defeats might not have eroded the ability of future
presidents to be effective, but they have altered the course of
Clinton's presidency, the power of independent counsels and perhaps
the caliber of future chief executives, said Eastern Michigan
University professor Edward Sidlow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current situation is really in some ways real particular
to this president and this really aggressive special counsel,''
said Sidlow, who heads the university's political science
department. ``I think as much as one might sit back and question
how future presidents might be affected you also have to question
what sort of latitude future special counsels are going to have.``
</P>
<P>
   Sidlow said Starr's zeal in investigating Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky might dissuade
qualified people from running for office. ``Who's going to want to
serve as president ... if this is the kind of tawdry business
they're going to get involved with?'' the professor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former federal judge and U.S. solicitor general, has
not been afraid to test the boundaries of the sacrosanct
attorney-client privilege in seeking the testimony of White House
attorneys, including long-term Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey.
Starr, a renowned appellate advocate, also showed no fear in
seeking testimony from Secret Service agents regarding what they
saw or heard from the president during their efforts to guard his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., has ruled
against the president in both cases, delivering crushing defeats to
Clinton's efforts to keep the content of his conversations with
White House attorneys from the grand jury as well as the
president's attempt to keep his security detail from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has appealed the decisions to the Supreme Court. But, in
the meantime, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has cleared the
way for the White House lawyers and Secret Service agents to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's losses in the circuit court, if upheld, might give
comfort to his Republican detractors in Congress and undermine
efforts of future presidents to advance their national agendas,
said Rice University professor Paul Brace. As an extreme example,
Brace said, presidents would be unable to conduct private treaty
negotiations if opponents of such an international agreement were
privy to the confidential discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never good to have a precedent on the books that can
serve to reduce presidential prerogatives in the future,'' Brace
said. ``The presidency should be protected from that sort of
partisan meddling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brace said, future presidents can take some solace
in Clinton's poll numbers. Clinton continues to be immensely
popular with the electorate, as its misgivings regarding his
behavior and truthfulness have been superseded by the credit it
gives him for the U.S. economic well being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the right economic conditions, the public is willing to
disconnect the president's moral behavior,'' Brace said. ``You can
probably get away with a great deal'' as president if the nation's
fiscal health is good, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another legal setback for Clinton, a unanimous Supreme Court
ruled last year that a sitting president may be sued. That decision
cleared the way for Paula Jones to pursue her allegation that
Clinton, while Arkansas governor, sexually harassed her by making
unwelcome sexual advances toward her in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the high court's decision, Clinton was compelled
to sit for a deposition in that case. The president's testimony in
that litigation has led to Starr's investigation as to whether
Clinton committed perjury when he told Jones' lawyers under oath
that he did not have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones case, dismissed by a federal judge, has been appealed
to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The legal defeats, while dramatic, will have no effect on
presidents' ability to lead effectively, provided their poll
numbers are high, said Roderick Hart, a professor at the University
of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10 politics trumps law in the life of the
presidency,'' Hart said. ``The presidency rests more on political
pedestals than legal ones and always has.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's judicial losses, Hart said, will merely remind future
presidents of something they should already know: Be very careful
of what you say and to whom you say it. ``Presidents today assume
that most of the people they talk to are looking for a book
contract,'' Hart said. &QL;

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>

 &HT;    Transform your child's study sessions _ with the help of a
computer, CD-ROMs and the Internet.
 &HT;    The latest techno-tools can captivate reluctant students, bring
ordinary text to three-dimensional life and condense a bookshelf's
worth of reference guides into a single disk.
 &HT;    Is your son struggling with square roots? There's new and
exciting software _ see Algebra Smart _ that takes the drudgery out
of drill and practice and can be programmed to focus on square
roots, fractions or whatever else makes up this week's lesson plan.
 &HT;    Your daughter's studying Africa? With the click of a mouse _ see
Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe _ she can hear the music of Rwanda,
see a sweeping 360-degree panoramic map, even access a Website that
details the war between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples.
 &HT;    Below are recommendations on the best and most interesting study
aids and reference tools _ each of which has been approved by a
panel of parent and child testers. You'll need a CD-ROM drive for
all of the programs mentioned, and an Internet connection to visit
the Websites.
 READING AND LANGUAGE ARTS

comprehension.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Sanctuary Woods, $29.95, ages 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Claris Works for Kids. While older kids can handle the adult
version of Claris Works, elementary-age children will enjoy hearing
their stories read aloud, learning about fractions by making their
own pie charts and creating multimedia book reports and
presentations with sounds and movie clips.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

IT'S A LONG WAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS TO THE BASILICA FOR THIS
PRIEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Rev. Robert Sisk is 65. But he hustles up four
flights of stairs without huffing and puffing to show off his
favorite spot in an ancient basilica in the heart of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists never see this,'' said the buoyant priest,
pointing from a rooftop patio to a commanding view of the famous
ruins of the Roman Forum, the government center of early Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance is the Mamertine prison, where early Christian
martyrs were confined before being executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring,'' he said. ``Every day I can look out from the
patio and also from my office window and see the place where Peter
and Paul were in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Sisk, who was pastor of St. Maria Goretti Catholic Church in
Arlington, Texas, for four years before moving to Rome three years
ago, now is secretary-general and first counsel of the Third Order
Regular Franciscans, a worldwide order of missionary priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still write to some of my great friends in Arlington,'' he
said. ``They are beautiful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he lives and works amid history, helping supervise more than
300 missionary priests who work mostly among the poor around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Franciscan order, organized in 1447, was created by
followers of St. Francis of Assisi, the revered Italian monk who
led followers to take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and
then travel to many places spreading the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk is a true Franciscan.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 17 years in a 100,000-square-mile Amazon region, often
living in the jungle in primitive conditions. He traveled up and
down the river, creating hospitals, schools and mission churches.
Later, he was in South Africa during the time of apartheid, uniting
two branches of Fransiscans during a troubled period from 1979 to
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love getting out where the action is,'' he said. ``Since
I've been secretary-general here, I've visited all the missions,
except the Philippines, Sri Lanka, South Africa and a new mission
in Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been to India three times, Bangladesh twice, and Peru and
Paraguay once. He will travel to South Africa in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in India, I celebrated Mass at Mother Teresa's
tomb,'' he said. ``Some of the Franciscans in India helped Mother
Teresa when she was first starting her work.''
</P>
<P>
   People don't realize how many Christians there are in India,
Sisk said. In Bangladesh, only 3 percent are Christian, but
Franciscans do significant work with tribal people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission in Bangladesh is among the poorest of the poor,''
he said. ``The toughest mission to visit is in Peru. It is high in
the mountains. You have to have a good heart to move around up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sisk's headquarters are in the Basilica of Sts. Cosma and
Damian, itself a shrine and place of pilgrimage. The basilica's
Christian history dates back to the time of Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   It is built over structures once a part of the Roman Forum.
Close by are what remains of the Temple of Julius Caesar, and down
the street is the restored Arch of Constantine, honoring the Roman
emperor who converted to Christianity. A little farther is the
massive Colosseum, where early Christians became martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting being in the midst of all this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a noon meal at the basilica, the friars, sitting at dark
wooden tables, partook of a four-course meal of salad, pasta, meat
and dessert along with red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk gave a prayer of thanks, sampled the pasta, and told the
meal's preparers, ``This is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Branches of the Third Order Regular Franciscans also work in
urban areas, including the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 17 of our priests are in the Fort Worth diocese,'' Sisk
noted. One of them, the Rev. James Gigliotto, now is pastor of the
St. Maria Goretti church in Arlington. Another, the Rev. Raymond
Nedimyer, is an associate there.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries of all Franciscan missionary priests _ including those
in the Fort Worth Diocese _ go into a fund that finances the
international work of the order, Sisk said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is stimulating living among sites of early
Christianity, Sisk said his favorite part of the job is traveling
to the remote mission fields.
</P>
<P>
   His most nostalgic journey has been revisiting the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the young men I knew while in the Amazon now are
ordained priests working among their own people,'' he said. ``It
was my biggest joy to hear people say they are good priests.''

NISSAN GIVES A GLIMPSE OF ITS PLAN FOR RECOVERY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its advertising slogan notwithstanding, Nissan has not been
enjoying the ride. Now, it is counting on some new models to get it
down a very bumpy road.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where the company has historically been No. 2 to
Toyota, sales have fallen in a slumping economy while its debt has
soared to $30 billion. Nissan posted a net loss of more than $100
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, sales plunged 28 percent in the first half
of 1998. Sweet leasing deals of years past have produced a glut of
used cars, overvalued on the books, that haunts new-car sales
today. With 215,000 new vehicles unsold at midyear _ despite
discounts of up to $2,500 _ Nissan cut output at its plant in
Smyrna, Tenn., by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as sort of a Japanese BMW, thanks to durable,
fun-to-drive cars like the Datsun 510, Sentra SE-R and Maxima,
Nissan took chances on innovative designs, like the 240Z that
created a new market for moderately priced sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   But many recent Nissans have lacked flair, though the vehicles'
quality ratings remain high and their performance is competitive.
</P>
<P>
   With the axing of the 300ZX sports car two years ago, dealers
were left without an image-builder to lure shoppers. And Nissan's
Japan-centered decision-making showed a failure to understand
changing American tastes: The company still lacks a small sport
utility, and it is trying to sell a revamped Frontier pickup with
four cylinders, two doors and a cramped cabin to Americans who want
big engines, multiple doors and lots of space.
</P>
<P>
   With dealers anxious and the financial community suggesting that
Nissan might become a takeover target _ possibly for a newly merged
DaimlerChrysler _ the company gathered its top executives last
month for an American tour before dealers, financial analysts and
automotive journalists. In an unusual move, it also offered a peak
at future products and prototypes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the business front, Nissan reiterated its plan to reduce its
debt by 25 percent within three years and to consolidate its two
North American units to streamline decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to reduce the number of platforms _ the costly basic
building blocks of cars and trucks _ from 25 currently to 10 by
2003 and to slash $1,000 a car from its production costs, which are
now higher than Toyota's or Honda's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the company's design studio in California is
getting more responsibility to develop models for North America. In
the past, American designs were often pushed aside in favor of more
conservative vehicles from Japan that failed to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that while Nissan's coming products would
help, they did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Nissan to really change the image of the brand, they need
the coupes and convertibles and fun-centered concepts,'' said Susan
G. Jacobs, an automotive analyst in Rutherford, N.J. ``Most of its
competitors will be coming out with fun cars, while Nissan will be
focused on sedans, wagons and trucks. It's very hard to change a
brand with sedans and wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissan executives say they're building a base for the future.
``There's nothing like a good jolt of fear to release the creative
juices,'' Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design
International, said in New York as he took the wraps off these
vehicles: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2000 SENTRA More expensive-looking than the current model, the
next Sentra has a stylish rear end evocative of the Audi A4.
Hirshberg called it an entry-level car ``people don't have to
apologize for.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2000 MAXIMA In a bid to revive the Maxima's sporting image after
the last redesign produced a more mainstream family sedan, the
prototype of the next Maxima appears larger and jazzier, with
styling that emphasizes the wheels. Prominent, round taillights are
set into a tapered, Jaguar-like tail. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRONTIER FOUR-DOOR Nissan's slow-selling pickup will get a V6
this fall; next fall, it will be available with four full-size
doors. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SMALLER SPORT UTILITY Based on the Frontier, this yet-unnamed
truck is likely to be priced around $20,000. But in contrast to the
car-based Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, the Nissan will be defiantly
rugged, with body-on-frame construction, a two-step roof like the
Land Rover Discovery's and higher ``theater seating'' in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at young buyers _ ``people who need places for lots of
stuff,'' Hirshberg said _ the vehicle will have many nooks,
crannies and cubbyholes, including a ``backpack'' built into the
inside of the tailgate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPORT UTILITY TRUCK Also based on the Frontier, the ``SUT'' has
the look of a miniature Hummer. Hirshberg cited surveys showing
that truck owners use the cargo bed less than 70 percent of the
time, and even then, they use only 20 percent of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan would substitute a small bed for a utility vehicle's
usual cargo area, with a twist _ to accommodate objects too large
for the truck bed, the back seats could be folded and the rear of
the cabin opened.
</P>
<P>
   Initially viewed as a design exercise, the utility truck now
seems likely to be built, since it would cost little to produce. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LATTER-DAY `Z' CAR To come up with an image-lifting car for the
future, Nissan designers turned to the past, producing an updated
concept version of the Datsun 240Z of 1970 that meets modern safety
standards. &QL;

IS IT E-MAIL OR EEK-MAIL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I read about the latest so-called e-mail virus
scare. This sounds like just another hoax to me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skeptical
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SKEP: Maybe. You really want to take that chance?
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, some four-eyes with a lot of free time on his
hands discovered a potential problem with Outlook Express 4.x,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Communicator mail. Other mail programs may
be at risk, too. File attachments with very long names _ no, I'm
not going to tell you how long because my mailbox has already been
jam-packed with malicious missives _ can crash the e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled hackers could conceivably execute nasty little programs
as the program halts. Although no reports of dirty tricks have
surfaced, now that the story has made the news, you can bet some
pinheaded hacker wannabe is out there losing sleep trying to invent
a way to wipe out your hard drive before you know what hit you.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a partial fix at www.microsoft.com/ie/security,
but it's still grinding away on a complete patch. Netscape is
supposed to be hard at work, too. Check in frequently at
home.netscape.com/products/security/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just love hackers? This is starting to cut into
efforts to catalog every Carmen Electra-worship page on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I normally leave my computer running in order
to receive faxes. We have a lot of power failures in my area, which
has not been a problem as I am running Win95-early on a 486. The
computer restarts without all the Scandisk gobbledygook and
everything works fine. I have just ordered a new 400-mHz screamer
that will come with Win98, and I am sure I'll get the gobbledygook.
Is there a way to get Windows 98 to restart on an unscheduled
shutdown without Scandisk?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stormy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STORMY: ``You buy them books,'' a trusted mentor once told
me, ``and they eat the covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bill and his pals didn't put Scandisk in there to irritate
you. They were trying to save people from themselves. Every time
you close down Windows without going through the shutdown routine,
you run the risk of corrupting your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Stormy, I realize you're not doing the bad shutdowns
intentionally, but please think about getting an uninterruptable
power supply. Those power failures aren't doing your hardware any
good.
</P>
<P>
   The early versions of Win95 didn't run Scandisk to repair disk
problems after an improper shutdown. Why? Beats me, but most likely
because the guys at Microsoft underestimated how few people would
or could follow directions.
</P>
<P>
   New versions of Win95 and 98 automatically run Scandisk if a bad
shutdown is detected. Win 95 makes you click to get things started,
but 98 runs it on its own. I really hesitate to tell you the next
part, because this is one time when I'd prefer that you ignore me
even more than usual. You can change Scandisk's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   You should know that there's the very real potential of mucking
things up, but here goes: Use a text editor such as Notepad to open
Msdos.sys, which is in your root directory. Look for a line that
reads ``Autoscan(Equals)1.'' Change the 1 to 0 if you want to turn
off Scandisk. Change it to a 2 if you want Scandisk to run without
any intervention. Please don't touch anything else. You don't know
what you're doing, and you'll wind up blaming me.
</P>
<P>
   And if you turn Scandisk off, don't come crying to me when you
start getting ``illegal operation'' error messages out the wazoo. I
warned you.

GRAHAM'S PERFORMANCE EXPLAINS LACK OF TESTIMONY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we know why David Graham didn't testify last month in his
murder trial: Nobody would have believed a word he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lawyer, Dan Cogdell, was obviously well aware of this.
Shortly after Graham was convicted of murdering 16-year-old
Adrianne Jones, Cogdell told one of Court TV's legal eagles that he
figured Graham would not have been a good witness in his own
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he believed that he could be a better witness for
Graham than Graham could be. Cogdell said that his client simply
wasn't articulate enough or personable enough to persuade the
jurors of his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was that the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Graham turned up in an exclusive interview on NBC's ``Dateline''
the other night, serving up the story that his lawyer told in
court: Diane Zamora murdered Jones _ and Graham had nothing to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not there,'' Graham told interviewer Stone Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   So if he wasn't there, Phillips wanted to know, where the heck
was he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whereabouts that night?'' Phillips asked.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's reply was precisely what most people who followed his
trial would have expected:
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh ...''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Graham looked at Cogdell, who was seated nearby,
and Phillips' recorded narration informed viewers that the lawyer
had advised his client not to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Good advice, seeing as how any alibi Graham might have offered
would have been preposterous. Graham couldn't tell Phillips where
he was when Jones was killed because he was right there with her,
firing two bullets into her head.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts criticized Cogdell's decision to keep Graham
off the stand, but the 20-year-old killer's ``Dateline'' appearance
made it clear that Cogdell's reasoning was sound.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine Graham on the witness stand, trying to convince
jurors that he was somewhere else when Jones was murdered and the
prosecutor asks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham replies:
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh ...''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the jury convicted him in less than 10 hours. If
they'd heard him say, ``Uh,'' when asked for his alibi, they might
have convicted him in less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's problem on ``Dateline'' _ and his likely problem if
he had testified in court _ went far beyond his unconvincing
version of the murder. Graham simply came off as a smirking,
arrogant jerk.
</P>
<P>
   He came off, in fact, as exactly the sort of person who could
murder an innocent girl and leave her battered and bloodied body
along a deserted road, who could stand by silent and unrepentant
when an innocent man was mistakenly arrested for this heinous
crime.
</P>
<P>
   He came off as exactly the sort of coldblooded sociopath who
could commit murder for no reason except to please his psychotic
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Graham's tale of noninvolvement failed to account for
the detailed confession that he provided to police when they
finally connected him to Jones' murder. Graham told Phillips that
the confession was fiction, that his slavish devotion to Zamora led
him to implicate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Which was the same story _ from the other side of the looking
glass _ that Zamora told when she testified in her murder trial.
Zamora said that Graham alone was responsible for the killing _
although she did admit to being on the scene when the murder took
place _ and claimed that she confessed to participating in the
crime because she loved Graham and wanted to share the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's yarn was unbelievable, and the jury promptly convicted
her of capital murder. But she at least tried to show some emotion.
When Graham told his story on NBC, he could have been talking about
some teen-age prank that got him suspended from high school.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham wasn't talking about a prank. He was talking about a
vicious, senseless murder for which he and Zamora are now serving
life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Graham in action, it's easy to understand why
Cogdell didn't let him testify. And hard to understand why
prosecutors didn't ask for the death penalty.

WILD, UNPREDICTABLE POETRY FROM A `FOOL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hal Hartley became an indie-film hero not so much by breaking
the rules of filmmaking, but by ignoring them. In his early films,
Hartley's characters often spoke in a clipped, deadpan style, as if
they were rehearsing for a postmodern ``Dragnet.'' Hartley
preferred simple compositions, sometimes with such static camera
work that you could hang the scenes on a wall. So when people start
calling his latest film, ``Henry Fool,'' his most ``accessible,''
it's a relative term. It may be the most mainstream thing Hartley
has ever done, but nobody's going to confuse it with ``Dr.
Dolittle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Fool'' could just as easily have been called ``Simon
Grim,'' so much does it focus on Simon (James Urbaniak), a tall,
sad-sack garbage man who seems to weigh less than his coveralls.
Simon looks like a wounded sparrow, and he greets the world with
similar levels of vulnerability and surprise. Like many of
Hartley's characters, Simon doesn't have a happy home life; sister
Fay (indie-film princess Parker Posey) brings home a different
stranger every night, and Mom (Maria Porter, like Posey a Hartley
regular) is so depressed that she wanders the house in her bathrobe
and listens in on Fay's latest conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Things change for the Grims when Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan) rents
out their basement room; he's a Hartley standard, the Man With a
Past. Henry puts on a show of cynical, world-weary intelligence,
looking as if he can barely be bothered to shampoo or shave. He's
not prepared for what he reads, though, when he hands Simon a pen
and a notebook and tells him to write down his thoughts. Simon
turns out to be a poetic prodigy, and the epic work he produces has
a profound _ and not always positive _ effect on everyone who reads
it.
</P>
<P>
   You can never quite tell where a Hartley film is going; even
``Flirt,'' which used the same dialogue to tell three separate
stories, was wildly unpredictable. For Hartley, though, the
destination isn't as important as the journey. He's a rare
filmmaker who's truly in love with the rhythms and idiosyncrasies
of the English language, and with ``Henry,'' he almost wallows in
them. He uses Henry and Simon's unlikely friendship to address the
nature of art and criticism. When Henry complains that a prophet
isn't honored in his own country or that what's considered junk now
might be a masterpiece 10 years later, you know he's airing
grievances about the response to his own films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry'' is one of Hartley's longest films, and it unravels in
its last half-hour, which feels so tacked-on that it's almost as
though Hartley decided to make another movie. This is the most
conventional material he's ever presented; one shot even vaguely
echoes ``Casablanca's'' airport scene. It doesn't help that it
resolves an unnecessary subplot that features Kevin Corrigan, maybe
the most irritating actor in indie movies.
</P>
<P>
   That ``accessible'' tag shouldn't put you off; Hartley's films
are out of the mainstream, but they're never impenetrably bizarre.
For Tarrant movie buffs, ``Henry'' may prove to be his most
accessible film in another way; it's the first Hartley film to get
a Tarrant play date in at least five years. They'll still have to
wait at least a week for its UA Hulen date; for now, impatient
Hartley fans will have to make the trek to Dallas' Inwood theater.

A TRUE STORY ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't a column about my hard drive going belly-up. It's a
column how things should work after something quits working.
</P>
<P>
   And its moral doesn't apply to just the computer industry, but
to all businesses centered on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, the hard drive in a computer I use
basically for software testing informed me it had a problem. A
diagnostic program indicated part of the storage area had gone bad.
The cause could have been anything, including the ever-possible
explanation: These things happen.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Maxtor drive. It's several years old, and although it
had a massive storage capacity when I bought it, it is small by
today's Godzillabyte standards.
</P>
<P>
   I called Maxtor, this time as a customer with a problem, not a
computer writer. It may be an old model, they said, but it was
still in warranty. The technician said I'd have to do a low-level
format on it, which would correct all but the most serious of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   If it didn't, the formatting program would send back an error
code. If that happened, write it down and call back. I went home;
did a low-level format; wrote down the number; called back that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   A different technician, able to track my problem because the
first technician had entered the information into the computer
system, gave me an authorization number for a replacement and
handed me off to customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The customer-service rep asked for the serial number of the
drive. After confirming it was still in warranty, she said I could
send it back and they would send a replacement by return mail. Or,
they would send out a new drive, and I could send the old one back
within 30 days in the same shipping container. Otherwise, my credit
card would be billed for failing to return the defective drive.
</P>
<P>
   Could I speed things up by paying for overnight freight? No
problem, that's $10. The drive arrived the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Maxtor no longer makes a 1.6 gigabyte drive (I told you it was
rather long in the tooth). The smallest replacement, which they had
sent, was 2.1 gigabytes. For an additional charge, I could have
upgraded to a larger drive, but for the chores this computer does,
a small drive is more than adequate.
</P>
<P>
   At no time was I ever asked for a receipt, or told that I hadn't
sent in my warranty card, or quibbled with about whether the drive
could have had a virus, or told I would have to send the drive back
in the original packaging to obtain an exchange. (Yes, computer
companies sometimes make customers jump through these hoops.)
</P>
<P>
   They did not make excuses. They did not try to pass me around in
an endless telephone circle. They apologized for the failure and
for any inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   From the time I discovered I had a problem until the time the
replacement was installed: Less than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another figure that's just as impressive. Time spent
on hold during three telephone calls waiting for a technician or
customer representative: Less than five minutes. (While on hold, a
recording lists various tips for trouble-shooting problems or ticks
off information about the drive and computer system the technician
might need to know to help with the problem.)
</P>
<P>
   I was not surprised. More than five years ago, I also had a
Maxtor drive that developed a problem. The outcome was the same
then as it was last week: quick, no hassle, friendly help.
</P>
<P>
   Even since that first replacement go-round, every hard drive
I've ever had in a computer has been a Maxtor. When I was putting
one together from scratch about a year ago, the store listed a
Western Digital as the hard drive going in the machine. ``I want a
Maxtor,'' I said, and told them why. It's not that I don't like
Western Digital or Seagate or any of the other companies. They make
fine products. It's that I've had very good experience with Maxtor.
</P>
<P>
   And even though two of the drives out of the many Maxtors I have
used over the years failed, I did not lose one byte of information
in those failures. (You DO make regular backups of your hard drive,
don't you?)
</P>
<P>
   Lyn, the last Maxtor customer representative I spoke with, said
sometimes people aren't happy when their hard drives fail. ``Some
of them say they'll never buy our product again,'' she said. ``The
fact is, hard drives sometimes fail. But we stand behind our
product and currently have the lowest failure rate in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the president of Lexmark International Inc.
told a group of computer writers that his company's motto was:
Customers for life. He shared with us a letter from a customer who
had an ancient IBM laser printer (Lexmark is a spin-off from that
company), and was unable to find drivers for it to work with
today's operating system. Lexmark's customer representative had
worked with him, finally giving him a partial credit for a new
color ink-jet printer that was faster and had better resolution
than his old laser. The customer was delighted. Not only did he
have laser quality, but he had color capability as well.
</P>
<P>
   He was, said the Lexmark president, ``a customer for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark and Maxtor are two computer-industry companies that have
already learned it's much easier to keep customers than it is to
advertise to go out and find new ones. They know that word-of-mouth
is highly effective advertising that can't be bought.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be earned.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have had some not-so-good experiences with
computer-related companies. I, too, have had my share. But every so
often, some of them do things very well.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, be sure and reward them with your loyalty.

1999 NISSAN QUEST: GROWTH SPURT FOR A MINI MINI-VAN

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Fifteen years ago, as millions of baby boomers were
settling down to raise families, Lee A. Iacocca played midwife to
the Chrysler Corp.'s own promising, strapping newborn, driving the
company's first boxy mini-van off the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right product at the right time, and it virtually
supplanted the station wagon as family transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler still holds 40 percent of the 1.2 million mini-van
market, even as every major manufacturer has crowded in. But the
next wave of competition is sweeping in, with an all-new, bigger
Honda Odyssey arriving in October and redesigned vans from Ford,
Mazda, Nissan and Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager are getting
their first substantial makeover since they were introduced as 1993
models. As before, they are nearly identical, and they are still
produced through a joint venture of Nissan and Ford: the engine,
transaxle and body stampings come from Nissan's nonunion operations
in Smyrna, Tenn., and the vans are assembled by United Automobile
Workers members at a Ford plant in Avon Lake, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest and Villager are on the small side among mini-vans,
with a wheelbase 7 inches shorter than the Dodge Grand Caravan's.
They are thus more nimble and carlike than most of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the mini-vans had received only minor tweaks and
fell behind in competitive features like a fourth door. The
redesigned Quest keeps its old body structure and retains its
relatively agile handling, but it gains another door and adds
horsepower and cargo capacity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the Quest's wheelbase is unchanged at 112.2 inches,
but the body has been stretched nearly 5 inches and it is about an
inch wider. The interior capacity has grown by about 10 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Styled at Nissan's American design center in California, the
Quest has a fresher appearance. Every body panel is new, but the
most noticeable change is up front, where a prominent oval grille
protrudes like a snout. Other than that, the appearance is
mainstream, a plus with mini-van buyers who seem to like blending
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For owners, functionality is all-important, and a second sliding
door, this one on the driver's side, is now seen as essential. The
extra door is standard on the Quest, and it comes in handy for
unloading children away from traffic or loading shopping bags
without having to walk to the passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as the extra inside space are features that
allow more versatility. The second-row seats can be easily removed.
The third row slides forward or back on rails. You could, for
instance, remove the second-row seats and slide the third row all
the way back to provide maximum room for long-legged teen-agers or
to carry adults limousine-style.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the third row, Nissan has added a cargo shelf that can be
set at one of two levels, or removed entirely. The shelf is useful
for lining up two rows of grocery bags, for instance _ one on the
floor and one on the shelf above _ and nothing gets crushed. Or,
you could load a stroller, golf bags or luggage underneath, and
line the shelf with shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extra space and added versatility, cargo capacity
still falls far short of larger vans'. With my two children
strapped in, I drove a '98 Quest to a rented cottage in northern
Michigan, loaded with paraphernalia for a week's vacation. Space
was tight, so I couldn't imagine how the van would accommodate a
larger family on such an outing, unless they pack more
economically.
</P>
<P>
   On my return, I picked up the '99 model. Although it is not
vastly larger inside, space is used better and storage compartments
are more plentiful. Other ergonomic features have been improved.
The audio controls, for instance, are now situated above the
heating and air-conditioning controls that are used less often.
</P>
<P>
   My children most appreciated the improvements in the cup
holders. In front, they pull out of the center dash and are
sturdier than the wobbly gadgets that folded down from the side of
the seat in the '98 model.
</P>
<P>
   Options include an integrated transmitter that opens garage
doors and security gates, and driver's seats that memorize
preferred positions. New is a sportier SE model with 16-inch wheels
and a stiffer suspension. The Quest also comes with a standard
security system, less forceful dual air bags and four-wheel
anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest's most significant improvement is under the hood,
where a 3.3-liter V6 producing 170 horsepower has replaced a
3-liter V6 with 151 horsepower. While a difference of 19 horsepower
may not sound like much, back-to-back comparisons of the old and
new versions showed the '99 to be much livelier.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Quest, albeit loaded with gear, had chugged up hills
out of breath. Even empty, it gave me pause when passing. In
contrast, the '99 stepped smartly away from traffic lights and
confidently passed other vehicles on two-lane roads.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have not been announced, but they are expected to remain
in the range of the current model, from $23,589 to $29,087. The
Villager is priced about the same, and differs mainly in its front
styling, available colors and optional trim.  &QL;

MURPHY'S LAW IS ONLY THE BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday Aug 10)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people think that the world is controlled by Murphy's laws
(Nothing is as easy as it looks. Anything that can go wrong will go
wrong. Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.
Etc., etc.), but the truth of the matter is that Murphy told only
part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Conrad Schneiker, Ed Logg, Gregg Townshend and a book
by Arthur Bloch called ``The Complete Murphy's Laws,'' I now know
that there are a lot of corollaries, axioms, maxims and dictums
that fill in the gaps in ol' Murphy's cynical _ if all too accurate
_ laws.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   Acheson's Rule of the Bureaucracy: A memorandum is written not
to inform the reader but to protect the writer.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's Byroad: When you are over the hill, you pick up speed.
</P>
<P>
   Berra's Law: You can observe a lot just by watching.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard's Newspaper Obituary Law: If you want your name
spelled wrong, die.
</P>
<P>
   Boozer's Revision: A bird in the hand is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Borstelman's Rule: If everything seems to be coming your way,
you're probably in the wrong lane.
</P>
<P>
   Calkin's Law of Menu Language: The number of adjectives and
verbs that are added to the description of a menu item is in
inverse proportion to the quality of the resulting dish.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon's Cogent Comment: The leak in the roof is never in the
same location as the drip.
</P>
<P>
   Checkbook Balancer's Law: In matters of dispute, the bank's
balance is always smaller than yours.
</P>
<P>
   First Maxim of Computers: To err is human, but to really screw
things up requires a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's Rule: There are three ways to get something done: Do it
yourself, hire someone, or forbid your kids from doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Deitz' Law of Ego: The fury engendered by the misspelling of a
name in a column is in direct ratio to the obscurity of the
mentionee.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's Law: Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.
</P>
<P>
   Finagle's Fourth Law: Once a job is fouled up, anything done to
improve it only makes it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Getty's Reminder: The meek shall inherit the earth, but NOT its
mineral rights.
</P>
<P>
   Glatum's Law of Materialistic Acquisitiveness: The perceived
usefulness of an article is inversely proportional to its actual
usefulness once its bought and paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Gumperson's Law: The probability of anything happening is in
inverse ratio to its desirability.
</P>
<P>
   Gumperson's Corollaries:
</P>
<P>
   1) After a salary raise, you will have less money at the end of
the month than you had before.
</P>
<P>
   2) Children have more energy after a hard day of play than they
do after a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   3) The person who buys the most raffle tickets has the least
chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman's Automotive Law: Nothing minor ever happens to a car on
a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Herblock's Law: If it's good, they'll stop making it.
</P>
<P>
   Issawi's Law of Committo-Dynamics: The less you enjoy serving on
committees, the more likely you are to be pressed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Second Law: If, during the course of several months,
only three worthwhile social events take place, they will all fall
on the same evening.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland's Law: The usefulness of any meeting is in inverse
proportion to the attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Langin's Law: If things were left to chance, they'd be better.
</P>
<P>
   Occam's Electric Razor: The most difficult light bulb to replace
burns out first and most frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo's Postulate: Anything good is either illegal, immoral or
fattening.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll's Law of Media Accuracy: Everything you read in the
newspapers is absolutely true except for that rare story of which
you happen to have first-hand knowledge.

`SCREEN KISS': JUST YOUR AVERAGE SMOOCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   The arrival of ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' means that
someone out there is finally starting to listen.
</P>
<P>
   For years, critics whined about gay independent cinema's
infatuation with self-important AIDS melodramas and in-your-face
sexuality. For years, we griped about mainstream Hollywood's
preference for mincing effeminates or gay guys who just need to
meet the right girl.
</P>
<P>
   Can't we just have a gay romantic comedy where the characters
are just plain, excuse the word, normal? Is that too much to ask?
Pictures like ``I Think I Do, Kiss Me, Guido'' and now ``Screen
Kiss'' reply confidently, ``No, it isn't.'' In fact, the indies and
the majors alike are discovering that they attract a far bigger
audience with realistic gay characters than they ever did with
low-budget trash like ``The Living End'' or big-budget stereotyping
trash like ``Mannequin.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Tommy O'Haver's ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss''
follows the romantic shenanigans of Billy Collier (Sean P. Hayes),
a Polaroid photographer with a habit for falling for the wrong guy:
His part-ime lover is involved with someone else. He has reduced
the one guy who really loves him (Richard Ganoung) to ``just
friends'' status. When he finally meets his Prince Charming at a
party, he's not even sure if the guy's gay.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Prince is Gabriel (Brad Rowe), a handsome
model type whom Billy persuades to pose in his new series of photos
depicting famous Hollywood screen kisses. So begins Billy's
emotional ``Is-he-or-isn't-he?'' roller coaster ride that reaches
its crest when Gabriel gets a little too tipsy one night and asks
to sleep over.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most brilliant scene, Gabriel strips his shirt off
and curls up next to the wide-eyed Billy, who spends the next
excruciating five minutes trying to find a way to make his hand
casually fall against Gabriel's back. O'Haver never cuts _ the
scene is one long, unbearable shot that should make any viewer
squirm. As Ganoung says in the press notes, ``I don't care if
you're gay, straight, whatever. We have all been in that bed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's moments like that that elevate ``Screen Kiss'' from
mediocrity, because despite its ground-breaking averageness, it's
almost a little too average to be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Give it points for not ending the way you might think. No fair
telling whether Billy will get the guy. Suffice it to say that no
one goes home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and Rowe have a believable chemistry. Ganoung (remembered,
but almost unrecognizable, from his starring role in ``Parting
Glances)'' is just right as Billy's concerned but selfish friend.
And Paul Bartel puts in a hilarious cameo as a lascivious big shot
who wants to make Gabriel a star.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a lesson from the School of Focused Investing, two of
Fidelity Investments' three biggest funds have drastically pared
the number of companies in their portfolios over the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stansky, who runs the $74.6 billion Magellan fund,
reduced the number of stocks in its portfolio to 438 as of June 30
from 523 last year. William Danoff, who steers the $35.4 billion
Contrafund, cut back his portfolio even more over that period, to
336 from 654.
</P>
<P>
   The two also increased moderately the percentage of their funds'
assets in their top 10 holdings. Magellan lifted that percentage to
17.8, from 15.7. Contrafund raised its share to 20.4 percent, from
13.7.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally or not, both Magellan and Contrafund are beating
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index so far this year, a feat
managed by just 14.9 percent of United States diversified equity
funds. Through July 31, Magellan and Contrafund returned 17.2
percent and 17.7 percent, respectively, compared with 16.5 percent
for the S&AMP;P 500, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial
publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The average large blend fund, which invests in
large-capitalization stocks with both growth and value
characteristics, returned just 12.9 percent, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing this market fairly wisely,'' said Jim Lowell,
editor of the Fidelity Investor newsletter. The new tactics, he
said, are more ``saleable and defensible'' to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Danoff ``wanted to make larger commitments to stocks he likes,''
said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Fidelity. ``He's been
concentrating the fund on his very best ideas.'' Neither Stanksy
nor Danoff was available for comment, Ms. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Danoff, however, has changed his mind on some big positions.
Among his top 10 stocks, Schlumberger, Alcatel Alsthom, U.S.
Bancorp and AT&AMP;T have fallen off the list; they have been replaced
by Gillette, American Express, America Online and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Contrafund, which closed to new investors in April, still posts
an aggressive 144 percent turnover rate, down from 165 percent last
year. Many investors frown on frequent stock trading within a fund
because it often produces higher taxable capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan, under Stansky, holds far fewer stocks than it did
under some of his predecessors, especially Peter Lynch, who was
known for buying small positions in many small companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Lynch would have 1,100 stocks in the portfolio at times,
and that was when it was a $2 billion to $3 billion fund,'' said
Eric Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an investment
newsletter published in Boston. ``He was very quick to put a lot of
things on the farm team, which are stocks they want to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Magellan was closed to new investors last September. Among the
fund's top 10 stocks, Philip Morris, Cendant and Fannie Mae have
fallenl off the list, replaced by Lucent Technologies, Cisco
Systems and American International Group. The fund's turnover has
increased to 34 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest Fidelity fund, Growth and Income, has not
joined the stock-shedding party. Under its manager, Steven Kaye,
the $45.3 billion fund already had far fewer stocks in its
portfolio, compared with its siblings'. As of June 30, it held 246
stocks, one fewer than it did at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Growth and Income has returned 15.3 percent through July 31,
behind the S&AMP;P 500 but ahead of the average large-cap blend fund,
according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's turnover has tapered off to 30 percent from 38
percent. Its top three holdings as of June 30 _ General Electric,
Merck and American Express _ were all in the fund's top 10 at
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Magellan fell 3.5 percent, while both Contrafund and
Growth and Income fell 3.3 percent. The average United States
diversified stock fund fell 3.2 percent. &QL;

A DEBATE ABOUT TEACHING THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, this brief introduction may be used to accompany
BC-HOLOCAUST-KATZ and BC-HOLOCAUST-WISSE.)

<P>
   How should the Holocaust be taught? Today, a specialized field
of study has grown up around it. There are undergraduate and
graduate courses, academic centers and conferences, fellowships and
endowed chairs. There are libraries devoted to it, along with
museums, films, docudramas, Internet sites and novels.
</P>
<P>
   While some thinkers believe the Holocaust is getting the
attention it deserves, others are uneasy about focusing scholarship
on an attempt to wipe out the Jewish people instead of on the whole
of Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times asked Ruth R. Wisse, a professor of Yiddish
literature and comparative literature at Harvard University, and
Steven T. Katz, director of the Center for Judaic Studies at Boston
University and the author of ``The Holocaust in Historical
Context,'' to lay out their views on the purpose and meaning of
teaching the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Katz argues that the Holocaust is a singular event, perhaps the
most significant occurrence in 2,000 years of Jewish history, and
that it therefore deserves to be treated as such.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wisse counters that turning the Holocaust into the defining
event in Jewish history is a terrible mistake, that it distorts the
rich and long history of the Jews, allows Hitler to define the Jews
and obscures the political nature of what happened in Nazi Germany.

SEEING JEWS AS VICTIMS SAID TO INVITE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-HOLOCAUST-KATZ and BC-HOLOCAUST-INTRO)  
(js) 
 By RUTH WISSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The destruction of the Jews of Europe was all but ignored when
it was happening. The impulse to document it now and to fix it in
memory is quite natural, commendable and necessary. But insuring
that this genocide will not be forgotten is not the same as
teaching Judaism or making the world a safer place. Although some
well-intentioned folk evidently believe that advertising the
victimization of the Jews will discourage aggression against them,
they might as well believe that dying is good for your health.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an American child who knows nothing about the Jews being
introduced to them first as the objects of genocide! Of the Hebrew
Bible he knows nothing. Nothing of the Jews' reception of the Law
at Sinai, and their self-disciplined attempt to interpret and
maintain it through thousands of years. Nothing of the Jewish
yearning for God, the Ten Commandments, the Sabbath, the liturgy.
No information about Jewish history, about Jewish sovereignty in
the land of Israel or the concept of exile outside it; about Jewish
migrations and the development of multiple Jewish languages. No
awareness of Jewish philosophy and literature, folkways and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The child is expected to learn tolerance from the Holocaust, but
tolerance of what? How will he be prepared for the quirky tribe of
real Jews when he has discovered the Jews as perfect victims in
their death throes and martyrdom? The more he thinks of Jews as
victims of the Nazis, the less he will be able to appreciate the
stiff-necked, highly particularistic people who observe different
rituals and rites of passage, and who want to remain as distinctive
as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Mass murder is neither the defining moment of Judaism nor the
sound basis of a moral education. A Jewish college sophomore who
was educated in Hebrew school on a steady diet of
``Holocaustology'' said to me recently, ``The Jews of Europe may
have been killed for what they believed in, but I was never told
what they believed in.'' She knows she was cheated of a proper
education. If the slaughter of the European Jews dare not be
forgotten, neither should it overshadow the way of life it tried to
destroy. Jewish education and American education ought to have much
more to teach about the creative energy of the Jews than the
destructive energy of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characteristics of Nazism was its reduction of the
Jews to an abstraction of evil, a symbol of corruption. Teaching
the Holocaust separately from teaching about the Jews as a whole
runs the risk of abstracting them and diminishing them to the same
degree. The Jews of Europe did not seek to be martyrs, and were in
the process of emancipating themselves politically so that they
should be better able to determine their own destiny. Treating the
Holocaust as a secular crucifixion cuts off Jewish tragedy from the
historical continuum, and distorts the rich reality of Jewish
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews of Israel, in particular, are learning how to
re-fashion their own sovereignty after too many centuries of being
imagined as dead. Homage to the murdered Jews is morally
reprehensible when it takes precedence over, or becomes a
substitute for, education about the flourishing Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a second danger in focusing on the Jews as victims
of the Holocaust: it obscures the nature of aggression committed
against them. The murder of the European Jews was a political act,
a war within a war. The Germans were able to win their war against
the Jews even as they failed to impose the Thousand-Year Reich in
Europe. This was because in his war against the Jews, Hitler had
the support of most of the populations he overran. By the time he
conceived his Final Solution, anti-Semitism had become the most
powerful ideology on the Continent, a force that united the
conquerors with many of the conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism, which is the organization of politics around
antipathy to the Jews, battened on the longstanding image of the
Jews as victims, although the Jews had done everything possible to
resist this fate. Following an earlier catastrophe _ the Romans'
destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 _ the Jews
postponed indefinitely the recovery of their national sovereignty,
and determined to uphold their religious civilization among other
peoples. They learned to survive without land, without autonomous
political authority and without independent means of self-defense,
attempting to compensate for their political weakness through
economic and intellectual strength.
</P>
<P>
   Although this strategy of accommodation yielded certain
advantages, the temptation it offered the surrounding peoples
usually proved even greater. Jews often accumulated visible status
and wealth. But prosperity without the ability to protect their
assets made them the ideal target of rulers and mobs. Demagogues
inflated their power by attacking this small people with the very
large image. The reputation of the Jews as a no-fail enemy grew
with each successive expulsion, massacre and pogrom.
</P>
<P>
   Those who exploit the Holocaust as a moral fable make no
connection between it and the political predicament of the Jews:
being perceived as victims and targets. In fact, Hitler's
victorious war against the Jews inspires as much imitation as
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Jews have reclaimed their sovereignty since their
destruction in Europe, and in Israel they now command their own
self-defense. But as long as the demographic and political
imbalance between the Jews and those who wish to dislodge them
remains as lop-sided as it was in Europe, the precedent of the
Holocaust still tempts the aggressor. Far from regarding the German
genocide as morally abhorrent, Arab anti-Semitism recycles the same
accusations, and keeps its eye on the same prize.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever had trouble sympathizing with the dead Jews. But
the protection of the living _ and especially protection for the
Jewish political community that remains under siege _ requires the
opposite set of moral reflexes. Of course, it is imperative to
document, to study, to analyze and to commemorate the greatest
moral failure in Western civilization, which coincides with the
tragedy of the Jewish people. Preventing its recurrence requires
something else, and something more.

MASS KILLINGS SEEN AS A DEFINING EVENT OF THE MODERN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-HOLOCAUST-WISSE and BC-HOLOCAUST-INTRO)  
(gm) 
 By STEVEN T. KATZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VORONOVO, Russia _ This city is 30 miles from Moscow, at what
was once Trofim Lysenko's Agrarian Research Center. I am here under
auspices of the Holocaust Educational Foundation to lecture for two
weeks on the Holocaust to 23 professors, Jewish and non-Jewish,
from all over the former Soviet Union. They have come from as close
as Moscow and as far away as Birobidzhan, the ``Jewish republic''
created by Stalin in the 1930s in the Far East of Russia near
Manchuria. Each of the students has agreed, as the basis of their
participation in the seminar, to introduce or to continue teaching
a course on the Holocaust at their universities.
</P>
<P>
   I begin with this geographical backdrop because from here it
seems clear that those who argue that the Holocaust should not be
taught as a specialized field of study in university programs are
out of touch with the feelings of scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish,
around the world. Still, more important, they misunderstand the
Holocaust's significance not only for Jewish history but also for
the modern era in its totality.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust, along with the creation of the State of Israel,
is the defining event of Jewish history in the 20th century, if not
of the last two millenniums of Jewish existence. It is also one of
the defining events of the 20th century more generally, hence the
massive effort to relativize and de-Judaize it.
</P>
<P>
   For here the distinctive features of modernity _ nationalism,
the decline of religious authority, an innovative political
ideology, bureaucracy, technology, the secular state, racial
theory, and intentional state-sponsored genocide _ come together in
a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, given the inversion of all moral and metaphysical
values that Nazism represented, all the classical Western doctrines
of ethics, philosophy and theology are challenged to their core. As
such, anyone concerned to understand the modern world _ its
unprecedented capacity for altering the human condition, and its
immense potential for good and evil _ must confront, with all
seriousness, the events that together make up the whole of we call
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the teaching of the Holocaust has to be done
correctly. This means properly placing the event within the
narrative of European history and the dismal tradition of Christian
anti-Semitism, as well as within the contours of modern Jewish
history. In the latter context it means, in particular,
understanding the complex and difficult issue of Jewish
emancipation, which, in turn, gave rise to ``the Jewish Question''
(die Judenfrage) _ what to do about the Jews now that they had been
liberated from their medieval status.
</P>
<P>
   For the Holocaust, as Hitler described it, was intended as ``
die Endlosung der Judenfrage'' (``the Final Solution to the Jewish
Question.'' According to this logic, all of the earlier attempted
solutions that had dominated the 19th and early 20th centuries _
efforts aimed at religious conversion, assimilation, socialism and
religious reform _ were considered manifest failures. And they
failed because they were not rooted in the racial theory that alone
properly diagnoses the nature of the ``Jewish Problem'': that the
Jews, each and every Jewish man, woman and child, are literally
less than human. They, the Jews, incarnate negative principles of
being that necessarily cause them to be aggressive, destructive,
parasitical, ``Untermenschen'' (subhumans) in the grand scheme of
history. In consequence, the Aryan people must, in putative
``self-defense,'' act to protect themselves and their civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The whole of World War II is, in a fundamental sense, the
application and playing out of this racial-metaphysical theory.
This is especially true vis-a-vis the brutal war on the eastern
front, and the continent-wide unrestrained effort to gather up all
Jews from all quarters of Europe and to deport them to Auschwitz
and Treblinka, Sobibor and Chelmno, to be immolated, their ashes
used to fill swamps and to fertilize the Polish landscape.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, emotionally, psychologically, intellectually
and academically difficult material to decipher and comprehend.
How, for example, could the ``ordinary men'' who comprised the
Einsatzgruppen (the Nazi killing squads created as an integral part
of the Nazi war machine in Russia) _ who were not preselected
sadists, not professional killers, not volunteers, and who were led
by individuals possessing Ph.D.'s and other advanced degrees _ kill
1.5 million to 1.8 million men, women and children ``face to
face''?
</P>
<P>
   To ask such an elemental question, to confront such far-reaching
matters in all their complexity, should not lead to denying the
Holocaust a special place in the university curriculum, but rather
requires that it receive one. Given its monumental significance,
the Holocaust must be front and center, taught by experts to
students of all ethnic and religious backgrounds whose world has
been, in large measure, created by it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to teach this pivotal subject without either a
sufficient knowledge of its larger historical circumstance,
including the makeup and character of the Nazi state, or of Jewish
history is to tell less than the whole story and thus, by design or
ignorance, to distort it. One must know, among other things, the
remarkable character of that Jewish civilization that was
destroyed, the nature of the cultural, social, political and
religious life that was carried on in the Polish and Lithuanian
ghettos, the details of the impossible and unprecedented position
of the Jewish Councils, and the story of Jewish resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the shared methodological and pedagogical
circumstance of any academic subject taught in the university or
elsewhere. That is, proper academic (or other) instruction always
requires the necessary expertise. In this particular case, this
entails mastery of Jewish and non-Jewish historical and other
materials. Certainly this makes large scholarly demands on those
who would teach the subject, and assuredly much of the teaching of
the Holocaust falls short of this standard.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that Holocaust studies shouldn't exist as
an independent field of study. Indeed, it is all the more reason to
support the creation of first-rate programs that will train
competent scholars and that will help devise appropriate
pedagogical models for conveying the lessons and legacies of this
most overwhelming and consequential event.

GIVE YOUNG DRIVERS TIME TO LEARN THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Maine, now Massachusetts has adopted restrictions for
young, newly-licensed drivers. Maine requires adult copilots for a
time and the Bay State is putting a curfew into effect. The
legislation recognizes that we license young _ entirely too young,
perhaps _ and that experience informs judgment. The neophyte driver
needs some apprentice time.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account that we license youngsters when they
are going through extreme changes, when the judgment is clouded by
raging hormones. While the respective legislatures should be
applauded for the good intentions and the institution of
(itals)something(unitals) to reduce teenage carnage on the
highways, they should also get dope slaps for not attacking the
root of the problem: driver ed. It is not enough merely to curtail
the newly-licensed until a some experience is gained; we've got to
make certain the newly-licensed can actually drive before handing
them the keys.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the problem of teenage auto carnage is more likely
to be found in quality driver education than in enforcement of new
rules. In fact, real driver ed would likely make restrictions
easier for teens to swallow, thus easier to enforce. Of course,
improved education is much more expensive than legislating rules
changes. But Massachusetts and Maine are both boasting budget
surpluses currently _ what better way to spend the money than by
making a quantum leap in the quality and efficacy of driver ed?
</P>
<P>
   The improvement would not be simple; the issue of driver ed is
complicated by the same thing that makes improvement in the
Massachusetts educational structure difficult: the quality of the
teachers. Additionally, there is a small investment in equipment
and probably a large investment in insurance premiums, given the
current litigation-oriented mindset in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating on parallel parking, driver education
should concentrate on the real world of (itals)driving(unitals).
Young candidates for driving privileges should not just be preached
at to avoid the occasion of sin but given the skills to cope with
the perils of temptation. ``Don't drink'' and ``don't speed'' are
worthwhile admonitions but offer no knowledge of how to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   What should be taught? Classroom work should begin with the
physics of the car _ how it behaves, steering geometry, weight
transfer. The student should be taught how weight transfers in
braking, how that affects the contact with the road, how that
affects the possibility of skids.
</P>
<P>
   The driving exercises should begin with throttle steering
exercises, advance to the skid pad exercises in losing, then
regaining, control of the car. Correcting for a skid is a bit more
complicated than just ``steer in the direction of the skid,'' the
standard short lesson in driver ed _ sans practice, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises should follow to demonstrate what happens in braking,
how to maintain steering control while braking. And there should be
a thorough grounding in antlock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, slalom exercises to demonstrate control, finesse. Then the
motocross exercises, actually driving a closed course. In winter,
the exercises take advantage of snow and ice to teach winter
driving skills. None of this takes place on a public road; all of
this should take place before a youngster is given a learning
permit and allowed behind the wheel in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   So, does the state spend billions building training arenas for
drivers to accomplish this? No, Bunky, the state already has;
virtually every high school in New England already has a skid pad _
they call it a ``parking lot.'' A motocross course or slaloms are
easily assembled with traffic cones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are automotive technologies out there to help
_ so-called ``skid cars'' that vary traction and induce skids _
safely _ and autos that can simulate loss of reaction time and
skills in an alcohol-impaired driver _ safely and without the
booze.
</P>
<P>
   The result of such a program instills a new respect for the car,
exposes the limitations of the driver, and offers worthy avenues of
practice to sharpen skills. More important, knowledge and skill
reinforce good judgment, erect barriers to hormone poisoning on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes me an expert on the subject? For 20 years while
writing these weekly offerings, I've been going to schools that
offer just such curricula as I've outlined above. And taking course
_ Skip Barber's advanced driving, lessons here and there with Bob
Bondurant, track time with Jackie Stewart, winter driving schools
with Jean Paul Luc, Audi, and Saab. I remember my son's tales of
driver ed in high school and saw the difference a day with Skip
Barber's instructors made in his driving attitude and his skill.
And I remember being in a class with an instructor of driving
instructors for public schools, an offensive oaf who argued with
Barber's instructors until he had convinced everyone in the room
that he was an arrant ass teaching children to court disaster. Then
he proved it on the skid pad.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are a fact of life in America. We should be doing as much
as possible to prevent them from becoming a fact of death for our
children. It is not enough to tell them what not to do; we must
reinforce postive driving habits and real driving skills.

BWM RAGTOP SHINES IN `EXHAUSTIVE STUDY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday is usually devoted solely to deadline duties at the
Globe; last Friday was different. Very different. The deadline
duties had to be dealt with, to be sure, but the bulk of the day
was given over to an exhaustive study of convertibles by the New
England Motor Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustive. Comprehensive. A fleet of rag-roofed vehicles had
been amassed for the project, and the vehicles and the NEMPA
Exhaustive Study Committee _ a committee of the whole _ would
assemble at the Globe early Friday morning. For me, the Exhaustive
Study commenced Thursday afternoon when the bright blue BMW Z3 M
Roadster was delivered _ my specimen for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was given over to the regular writing routine and some
of the Friday work; the remaining Friday work would be tackled in
the early morn prior to beginning the Exhaustive Study. This meant
staying in town, in a modest-priced motel close to the office. I
love my job.
</P>
<P>
   Friday dawned gray _ and wet. Pouring rain. Not a great day for
an Exhaustive Study of convertibles. Thursday night I had nosed the
Z3 into a space at the end of the empty cul de sac that serves as a
parking lot. Friday morning, the cul de sac was no longer empty but
full of vehicles filling every marked parking spot and some
unmarked places adapted for parking, serving to make me painfully
aware of a drawback peculiar to convertibles: visibility. Or to be
more specific, lack of visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 top is low, almost claustrophobic, and the backlight
(technobabble for the rear window) is plastic _ no defroster here _
and small. Rain has rendered the plastic opaque; there is no
visibility through the canvas to either rear quarter, and the
outside mirrors are rain-spotted and not much use _ especially the
passenger side in which objects appear farther away than they
actually are. So, it is exit (bumping my head on the low overhead),
reconnoiter, reenter (bumping again _ I just can't bend low enough
to avoid it), creep along in reverse until I forget locations,
repeat all of the above. Finally, I have effected a turn and can
drive out frontwards _ narrowly missing a pedestrian trying to get
across the lot.
</P>
<P>
   I hit the Globe at 7 a.m. plus a few minutes and meet no one I
know _ but then I haven't been to the Globe at this hour in years.
At 9 a.m. with deadlines dutifuly met, the real labor of the day
begins as the convertibles _ Mustangs, BMWs, a Jaguar XK8, Mazda
Miata, Chrysler Sebring, a couple of Mercedes-Benz cars, Acura NSX,
even a Toyota RAV4 with a canvas top, not exactly a convertible but
so what! I offer up my Z3 to another for ``familiarization on the
first leg'' trading for a much roomier 225-horsepower Mustang GT
with glass backlight. The Exhaustive Study Committee rolls out onto
Morrissey Boulevard and sets a course for Maine. At the New
Hampshire border, the committee pauses to swap specimens; I hang
onto the GT. The sky brightens, tops come down; in Maine, the sun
is shining, the GT top comes down.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first NEMPA Ragtop Rumble _ it was supposed to be
Ramble but a typo in the stationery caused a change in title to
avoid more paperwork and expense. It takes us into Ogunquit, along
the coast and a stop for lunch, then a run along the ocean and up
to Wells to the Wells Antique Auto Museum where notes are compared,
tires kicked, and the museum's eclectic collection of old cars,
music-producing machines, and automotive paraphernalia are assessed
(a story for another day _ wonderful place). With the sun long past
its zenith, I reclaim the Z and set out across Maine and home.
Exhausting work, this, but I love this job.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is given to more exhaustive studies of the Z3; Sunday,
I enlist the aid of son of auto writer, and we set out for the
seacoast again _ Orchard Beach, Saco, thence westerly along Route 9
into Kennebunk, back across Maine into Somersworth, N.H., over a
short stretch of 236, and north, more or less, along the country
lanes of the Granite State. Son Chris is driving; I am ...
studying. Exhaustively.
</P>
<P>
   With the ragtop folded, the Z3 offers no visibility problems,
naturally. Well, almost none; the rear-view mirror blocks a big
chunk of windshield and really gets in the way, especially when
making right turns, no matter where the top is.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to roll up the windows, fasten the net windscreen
in place behind the seats and carry on a normal conversation on a
65 m.p.h. interstate. This M version is not only a pretty little
roadster but also a dynamite driving machine. It flies. It is
elastic, too; the Z will accelerate nicely in any gear _ did I
mention it's a five-speed manual? Perhaps I've neglected to
mention, too, the 240-horsepower 3.152-liter I-6 in this mighty
mite, the same engine that powers the M3 performance models.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very comfortable two-seater, this, but it does have some
flaws. Although the gauge cluster on the dash is clear, a set of
meters on the mid-dash console becomes invisible at times due to
reflections. The motor that powers the rag roof is wimpy; one must
unlatch the roof and push it up a foot or so before the motor will
grab it and pull it down. There is a boot to cover it when folded,
and it's not all that bad to attach _ tabs slip under the body, and
two snaps lock it in place. But it almost fills the small trunk;
it's better left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is quick, precise, the Z sticks to the corners like
kittens to couch covers. The shifter is smooth and there is some
resistance to the reverse position _ at least on the test model _
which made fouling up a shift much less likely. The ride is firm,
didn't seem harsh.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning/heater controls are big knobs, easy to use
_ the AC will chill meat even with the top down in the sun. The
radio controls are not as user friendly but not bad _ on/off/volume
knob, large presets, and tuning rockers that are almost big enough
for gloved hands (in case you drive this in winter). There are two
cupholders, but behind your elbows between the seats, hardly
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage wasn't bad; the Z3 delivered 22.6 miles per gallon
during the Exhaustive Study, over a variety of roads covering some
400 miles measured. The bad news is price. The Z3 M Roadster lists
for $42,770 delivered, albeit very well equipped; if I had it, I'd
pay it. Despite its flaws and idiosyncrasies, this little car is a
big bag of fun and a machine of ecstacy on a winding country road.
The kid and I give thumbs up _ that's six thumbs if you include the
guy who swapped the GT. He loved it even in the rain.

CHOKING OFF THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real change doesn't come down from up high. It bubbles up from
below.
</P>
<P>
   The lava theory of political change was ratified yet again with
the passage last week in the US House of a campaign finance reform
package that makes Newt Gingrich swoon, and Trent Lott gag. The two
Sun Belters who run the Congress have had no thornier issue than
the soft-money ban that would choke off the cash flow upon which
the GOP's thin edge in the House, and slightly-thicker edge in the
Senate, is predicated.
</P>
<P>
   Without its traditional edge in money-raising, the GOP would
very likely lose control of both branches of Congress. And it had
been 40 years in the minority wilderness before Gingrich and a
claque of right-wing millionaires wrested the House from a
dispirited and tired Democratic crew in '94.
</P>
<P>
   You can do marvelous things when you own the gavel. Bob Dole
would never have been his party's presidential nominee without the
deals he forged as Senate majority leader. Bill Clinton would not
be facing the Ken-and-Monica show, the Democrats' fund-raising
excesses would not be so visible, there would not have been seven
different independent counsels harassing Clinton cabinet figures,
if the Democrats were still running both branches of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Muttering about Monica knocked US Reps. Chris Shays (R-Conn.)
and Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) off more than one network talk show,
making sexual innuendo more valuable to the TV talk industry than
campaign finance reform. Since the TV industry winds up as the
chief profiteer off the soft money scam, in the form of payment for
TV spots, it's no wonder TV execs are cool to reform.
</P>
<P>
   It's the prerogative of leadership to try to change the subject,
which is why Gingrich, always a scorched-earth politician, and
Lott, who owes oily allegiance to oil, tobacco and other
anti-consumer forces, tend to rant about manufactured ``wedge''
issues like partial birth abortion, or cracking down on gays or
flag-burners. The Republican leaders mimic the current Israeli
government: a hard-line, abrasive regime kept in power by a
precarious balance of conservative party regulars and radical
religious fringe elements.
</P>
<P>
   When the country is unchallenged abroad, and enjoys unrivalled
prosperity at home, as at the present moment, it means that
so-called national leaders can indulge in the kind of frat-house
horesplay that allows Lott to rant about gays, or Gingrich to
bluster about his pet peeves, which are numerous.
</P>
<P>
   What happened last week in the House was of earthquake
proportions: the followship commandeered the agenda, and insisted
on passing toothy campaign reform. The vote was 252 to 179, but the
key number was 61. That's the number of House Republicans who
sucked it up and tucked it to Speaker Gingrich. Over his violent
objections, enough of his own troops deserted the leadership to
shove a meaningful reform bill past the House and over to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's fate there is problematic. But reform has a way of
garnering momentum even in the face of implacable opposition. The
package erected by Shays and Meehan would ban the corrupt influence
of ``soft money,'' the unregulated sums, hundreds of thousands of
dollars, which flow directly from special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also make it harder for shadowy
special-interest groups to buy attack advertising TV spots in the
run-up to an election, that could tip the outcome, without
disclosing just who is paying for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan pulled off a remarkable triumph. While Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) made it easier for Meehan to line up
Democrats, Shays had to contend with the vociferous criticism of
his fellow Republicans. He was called traitor, sellout and worse;
his longterm prospects in the House may not be healthy, so long as
Gingrich's motorcycle gang holds the reins.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays and Meehan have crowbarred their way to the national
stage with this victory. Lott's machinations may yet stall the
reform in the Senate, where a different version, McCain-Feingold,
died despite having 52 senators in favor. Because of Lott's desire
to keep corrupt soft money circulating through his own paws, he
decreed 60 votes would be needed to choke off debate, and reformers
fell short. Meehan said late Friday he has hopes that Sen. Alphonse
D'Amato (R-NY) can be knuckled to switching to the reformers' side.
D'Amato is up for re-election this fall, and the New York Times
will hammer him relentlessly on this.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible switcher is Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, in
Meehan's upbeat calculations. ``Nobody ever expected the House to
move the bill,'' said Meehan. ``We came from nowhere in just four
months.'' Every New Englander in both branches is for the reforms,
save three from New Hampshire: Sens. Gregg and Smith, and US Rep.
Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, Rhode
Island's John Chafee and Vermont's Jim Jeffords are all aboard.
``We need eight Republican senators'' in all, said Meehan, and a
D'Amato switch would make five.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the Monica Lewinsky circus, the public
pressure would be enormous for Republican senators to relent and
accept the soft money ban. But as long as television owners have
Monica video to play with, and Monica-talk to peddle, they can
forestall public presentation of dry old campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the obstructionist efforts of Gingrich, Lott, the
special interests, and the TV profiteers, reform passed the House.
Anyway you slice it, the people won one for a change.

A NEW HORIZON FOR THE DIXIE CHICKS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Familiarity breeds, well, if not contempt, certainly apathy.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with Dallas' own Dixie Chicks, who nabbed two major
Country Music Association nominations (best vocal group and the
Horizon Award) last week.
</P>
<P>
   The former would be nice enough, but it's the Horizon nod that
really counts. (After all, LeAnn Rimes won it last year.) It means,
basically, that Nashville has anointed the Chicks as newcomers to
watch. Even if they don't win the award (and we'll find out Sept.
23), the nomination alone gives them a big boost in country music
circles, a cachet that plenty of up-and-coming acts would kill for.
</P>
<P>
   This is both perfectly sensible, as their major-label debut CD,
``Wide Open Spaces,'' has sold more than 500,000 copies in six
months _ and pretty darned funny.
</P>
<P>
   Martie Seidel and Emily Erwin, after all, began playing street
corners in the West End nearly a decade ago. Adapting their name
from Little Feat's ``Dixie Chicken,'' the Chicks graduated to
birthday parties, club gigs and conventions, gaining a rep as a
cutesy/kitschy little country/bluegrass act, happy to twirl the
skirts and wear the boots and hats and play the role of Uber-Texans
to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   And that, really, is where a lot of us left them. The Chicks
became synonymous with cute, with nice little songs and reliably
winsome club shows. They were always a big draw in Big D and Fort
Worth, but after a while the shtick got a little old. Unless you
were a huge fan (and, to be sure, there are those who have stuck
with 'em from Day One) they became old news. Oh, yeah, the Dixie
Chicks. Great. Pretty girls. Saw 'em at Poor David's once.
Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   We could be forgiven for this, to an extent, because for a long
time, cute and bubbly and pleasant is about all the Chicks were.
They didn't break out nationally, and they didn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the apathy set in. It's the oldest story in the
book: If you're big doin's in your hometown, you either go to the
next level or a lot of the homies move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was like Stevie Ray Vaughan. Between going solo in
the late '70s and breaking out nationally in 1983, Stevie played
around here a lot. A LOT. I loved going to hear him; seeing Stevie
Ray Vaughan in a bar was kind of like coming home and finding
Michael Jordan shooting hoops in your driveway. But after a while
it became a case of, ``Oh yeah _ Stevie Ray. Incredible player.
Does the Hendrix thing real good. I think I'll catch him NEXT
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   But while we weren't paying much attention, the Chicks changed.
In 1995, following the departures of a couple of members, Natalie
Maines, daughter of legendary musician Lloyd Maines, came aboard.
She added a whole lot of fire, and the band, collectively, took on
a new persona _ cute for cute's sake was out. Suddenly they were
spokeswomen for young women leaving home (or getting a job after
college, or getting their heart seriously broken) for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus to the hit ``Wide Open Spaces'' says it all: ``She
needs wide-open spaces/Room to make her big mistakes/She needs new
faces/She knows the high stakes.'' Rarely has a country song
detailed the hopes and fears and giddy excitement and terror of
being in one's early 20s and realizing you have your whole life _
good AND bad _ before you.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's metaphors we're looking for, we couldn't find a
better one. After all these years, and all that trial and error,
the Dixie Chicks have become a band to really take notice of. For
the second time, and for better.

A GOLDEN RULE FOR GARDENING: DO NO HARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 9)  
(gm) 
 By ROBERT KOURIK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be more natural than gardening? Most people who grow
flowers or their own food think they're ``healing the Earth'' in
some small way.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners may be having fun, getting exercise and harvesting
tasty vegetables and fruits, but the best thing, as far as nature
is concerned, is probably no gardening at all. In fact, gardening
can be downright harmful: tillage releases carbon dioxide,
contributing to global warming; cultivation and compaction destroy
beneficial soil fungi, and excessive nitrogen fertilizers, even
manure, can contaminate water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While most gardeners assume that a plow, shovel or rototiller is
required for a good crop, the only comparable natural model is a
landslide. So why have most cultures used cultivation? Mostly to
create a zone where domesticated crops have little competition from
native plants. Global Warming  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The earth's soil contributes 10 times more carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere than all human activity, according to Dr. Tyler Volk, a
professor of biology at New York University and an expert on the
carbon cycle. It comes from the myriad life forms that inhabit the
soil _ microbes, pill bugs, worms and fungi _ as they breathe,
process food and die.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas in the past the increase in carbon dioxide gas produced
by small-scale tillage was absorbed by plants through
photosynthesis, Dr. Volk said, tillage has now become a large
contributor to the surplus of carbon dioxide. When soil is stripped
of its living cover to grow crops, up to one-fourth of its stored
carbon, which contributes to fertility, is lost as carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Volk estimates that the rise of the average global temperature
of one degree Fahrenheit in this century has expelled an extra
billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere from the soil.
Currently, he says, the global carbon cycle may be able to absorb
it, but carbon dioxide generated by cultivation _ even in gardens _
may contribute to a warmer climate.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners can compensate for a loss of carbon, Volk says, by
adding compost and manure. And they can minimize the loss of carbon
dioxide from their plots by experimenting with ``no till''
gardening: growing plants in deep mulch, up to a foot thick; sheet
composting (thin layers of a variety of compostable materials laid
out over the soil like a thick mulch), or by reserving portions of
the garden for soil-improving crops like fava beans or vetch.
</P>
<P>
   In undisturbed soil under many trees, perennials and some
vegetables lurks a mostly unknown but beneficial fungus called
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae _ VAM, for short _ which can
sometimes be spotted because of its above-ground fruiting bodies,
including Boletus, Amanita, Lactarius mushrooms and some types of
puffballs.
</P>
<P>
   VAM forms a remarkable symbiotic relationship with plants. Its
microscopic filaments either actually augment tree root hairs, or
they grow into the cells of the root hairs. The filaments provide
nutrients to the plant, mostly phosphorous, potash, zinc and
copper, and they receive carbohydrates for the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants grow much more lushly with this association. For
example, according to studies at various universities, when VAM was
present in otherwise untreated or poor soils, oat plants were
nearly twice as heavy and strawberries five times as heavy than
they would have been otherwise. Citrus trees growing in soil
inoculated with VAM were 16 times as heavy than trees in sterilized
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Most natural, undisturbed soils have plenty of VAM. But it can
be injured or destroyed by tillage, by removing the natural litter
called duff beneath trees, by stripping away topsoil for
construction, by compacting the soil (even by walking on it), by
fumigation or by overfertilization.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways of preventing compaction: keeping
permanent pathways away from trees, using deep mulches for
little-used paths, using some cover crops in your yard and rotating
crops with root systems of different depths to help keep untilled
soil friable. Keep annual crops away from trees (at least one-half
to three times the width of the canopy) so as not to disturb the
VAM.
</P>
<P>
   Some garden centers and catalogs are touting new VAM inoculants
for all gardens. They may not be required except in two cases: at a
new house on a bulldozed site or in sterile potting soil. But if
you've spotted the telltale mushrooms in a forest, you can just
shovel up some duff there and sprinkle it on your soil or add it to
a sterile potting mixture. Then let nature do the work, free.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus Nitrogen
</P>
<P>
   Most gardeners squander nitrogen, even manures. Because of its
cost, farmers tend not to waste fertilizer. To equal the amount a
farmer spreads on nitrogen-hungry crops like celery, cabbage and
potatoes, a home gardener need apply only a quarter to a third of
an inch of compost or steer or horse manure.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Burroughs of Sebastopol, Calif., a certified crop adviser
with the American Society of Agronomy, a professional association,
uses the same guideline for home-grown sweet corn and lettuce.
Broccoli and pear trees need only a dusting. I often observe
gardeners applying manure and compost far heavier than this,
wasting both money and nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   That excess nitrogen leaves the garden as a gas or leaches away
with rain or irrigation toward water supplies, and it can set back
VAM activity. Surplus nitrogen causes plants to grow more foliage,
not stems, tubers or other edible parts, and it stimulates weaker
growth more prone to pests and disease.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the ancient Greeks were right: all things in
moderation.

A HOMEOWNER ABANDONS THE SAFETY OF WHITE WALLS FOR ROOMS WITH A
HUE

<P>
   I was a woman living in fear.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, I was afraid to paint the white walls in my
all-too-vanilla home. It was our first house, and I clung to renter
mentality. We would have to sell the home someday, and experts say
buyers prefer plain walls that allow them to visualize their own
decorating tastes.
</P>
<P>
   But what about my decorating tastes?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I didn't know whether I had any and was too cheap
to pay someone who did. I wanted to be bolder, but I was drowning
in doubts.
</P>
<P>
   What if the paint color clashed with the fireplace? What if it
looked stupid? What if it was too light? Too dark? Too trendy? My
fears kept me paralyzed, clutching paintbrushes only in my dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis: color commitment anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that is actually a term bandied about by color experts such
as Leslie Harrington, director of color and design by Benjamin
Moore paints.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington reassured me that the condition is perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   I could be cured once I realized that painting is really the
easiest and cheapest way to add instant personality to a room (and
hide the fact that I don't have much furniture).
</P>
<P>
   My fears gave way to obsession as I began scoping out paint
chips. Soon I had more than 100 stuffed in my purse. I needed a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the growing ranks of interior design celebs. Lynette
Jennings, star of ``HouseSmart'' on The Discovery Channel,
suggested starting with a favorite piece of fabric and, from it,
building a color palette for the whole house.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the pastel floral pattern of my family room sofa and
love seat, so I started with that.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lowell, design guru of ``Interior Motives'' on The
Discovery Channel, urged looking through the clothes closet because
you tend to wear the colors you like best. If you wear purple, why
not paint your walls purple? he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   I was making progress, narrowing the possible palette down to
light blues and greens (the colors that filled my closet). It was
then that I realized just how many thousands of shades of aqua are
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed and confused yet again, I turned to the diva of home
decor. Martha Stewart offers a line of paint in Kmart stores that
ranges from Aquatic Green to Yellow Rose. Her plethora of blues and
greens mesmerized me _ I debated the virtues of Hooked Rug Green
vs. Tree Swing Green.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, anyone contemplating a trendy wall color
these days has to pay a visit to Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   The high priest of preppie style sells his line of paints at
Home Depot. Although he doesn't offer coordinated color cards a la
Martha, he does divide his colors by lifestyle. There's a Sport
collection for those who favor brawny colors to highlight their
buff furniture. The Desert collection spotlights Southwestern
style, and the more traditional Country collection featured my
favorite color, Montauk Gray.
</P>
<P>
   After several months, I had narrowed the choices down to three
bluish, grayish-green colors _ Martha Stewart's Atlantic, Ralph
Lauren's Montauk Gray and Benjamin Moore's Gray Sage.
</P>
<P>
   Still in doubt, I invited a friend over who had painted the
white walls in her house years ago. Before we got around to the
chicken salad, I popped out the paint chips and asked her opinion.
She told me Gray Sage was strong, but given the Southern exposure
of the room, ``The walls could handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the color, but somehow it seemed a bit too drab.
Emboldened to let my own tastes take control, I opted for the
slightly bluer Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It was a breakthrough to buy the paint, but the real point of no
return came when I stroked on that first brush of color. A few
hours later, one wall was transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Following the experts' advice, I waited a couple of days to see
how the color evolved through the day and night. A few days later,
the whole room was awash in Atlantic, which gave new punch to my
old white moldings.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington told me the measure of a successful wall color is
really how well it showcases the contents of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people walk in and say `Wow, look at those red walls, you
haven't succeeded,' '' she said. ``It has to show off the furniture
and accessories. Then it becomes a neutral and looks like a
magazine, and they say, `Wow, I wish I had to guts to do this.' ''

TIRED SLASHER FAILS THE SCREAM TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of ``Halloween H20'' as ``The Slasher Movie That Cried
Wolf.'' It's so intent on false alarms that it begins to look like
a practical joke on genre fans, a horror movie with no real horror.
Once the bodies do start falling, you're too bored to care.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis, returning for the first time since ``Halloween
II,'' wastes no time getting back into the thick of things. Even
before she's on camera, she's screaming that scream that made her
famous. It's 20 years later (H-2-0, get it?), and Curtis' Laurie
Strode character is living under an assumed name in one of those
anonymous California small towns, where she's the alcoholic,
pill-popping headmistress of a prestigious private school. Just
what you want when you've faked your death _ a high-profile
position.
</P>
<P>
   She's also a single mother, with a son named John (newcomer Josh
Hartnett _ first tip, Josh: Fire your hairstylist). John is 17, the
very age Laurie was in the first film. Understandably, she's
overprotective and reluctant to let John join his classmates on a
camping trip.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie still sees her brother, Michael Meyers, the ``Halloween''
series' demented killer, everywhere she goes _ she's literally
afraid of her shadow. WE know, of course, that he's really on the
loose, and he's coming to get her _ and John. But Michael's older
now, of course, and he moves a little slow _ kind of like this
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, by now we know all of ``Halloween's'' tricks.
The ``Scream'' movies ratcheted (or hatcheted) up the slasher genre
with their wit and pop-culture savvy; the closest this movie can
come to them is showing a ``Scream 2'' video on a TV screen.
``(Scream'' screenwriter Kevin Williamson reportedly did a
script-polish; maybe the video was his contribution.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Film: ``Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The destruction of the Jews of Europe was all but ignored when
it was happening. The impulse to document it now and to fix it in
memory is quite natural, commendable and necessary. But insuring
that this genocide will not be forgotten is not the same as
teaching Judaism or making the world a safer place. Although some
well-intentioned folk evidently believe that advertising the
victimization of the Jews will discourage aggression against them,
they might as well believe that dying is good for your health.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an American child who knows nothing about the Jews being
introduced to them first as the objects of genocide! Of the Hebrew
Bible he knows nothing. Nothing of the Jews' reception of the Law
at Sinai, and their self-disciplined attempt to interpret and
maintain it through thousands of years. Nothing of the Jewish
yearning for God, the Ten Commandments, the Sabbath, the liturgy.
No information about Jewish history, about Jewish sovereignty in
the land of Israel or the concept of exile outside it; about Jewish
migrations and the development of multiple Jewish languages. No
awareness of Jewish philosophy and literature, folkways and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The child is expected to learn tolerance from the Holocaust, but
tolerance of what? How will he be prepared for the quirky tribe of
real Jews when he has discovered the Jews as perfect victims in
their death throes and martyrdom? The more he thinks of Jews as
victims of the Nazis, the less he will be able to appreciate the
stiff-necked, highly particularistic people who observe different
rituals and rites of passage, and who want to remain as distinctive
as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Mass murder is neither the defining moment of Judaism nor the
sound basis of a moral education. A Jewish college sophomore who
was educated in Hebrew school on a steady diet of
``Holocaustology'' said to me recently, ``The Jews of Europe may
have been killed for what they believed in, but I was never told
what they believed in.'' She knows she was cheated of a proper
education. If the slaughter of the European Jews dare not be
forgotten, neither should it overshadow the way of life it tried to
destroy. Jewish education and American education ought to have much
more to teach about the creative energy of the Jews than the
destructive energy of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characteristics of Nazism was its reduction of the
Jews to an abstraction of evil, a symbol of corruption. Teaching
the Holocaust separately from teaching about the Jews as a whole
runs the risk of abstracting them and diminishing them to the same
degree. The Jews of Europe did not seek to be martyrs, and were in
the process of emancipating themselves politically so that they
should be better able to determine their own destiny. Treating the
Holocaust as a secular crucifixion cuts off Jewish tragedy from the
historical continuum, and distorts the rich reality of Jewish
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews of Israel, in particular, are learning how to
re-fashion their own sovereignty after too many centuries of being
imagined as dead. Homage to the murdered Jews is morally
reprehensible when it takes precedence over, or becomes a
substitute for, education about the flourishing Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a second danger in focusing on the Jews as victims
of the Holocaust: it obscures the nature of aggression committed
against them. The murder of the European Jews was a political act,
a war within a war. The Germans were able to win their war against
the Jews even as they failed to impose the Thousand-Year Reich in
Europe. This was because in his war against the Jews, Hitler had
the support of most of the populations he overran. By the time he
conceived his Final Solution, anti-Semitism had become the most
powerful ideology on the Continent, a force that united the
conquerors with many of the conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism, which is the organization of politics around
antipathy to the Jews, battened on the longstanding image of the
Jews as victims, although the Jews had done everything possible to
resist this fate. Following an earlier catastrophe _ the Romans'
destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 _ the Jews
postponed indefinitely the recovery of their national sovereignty,
and determined to uphold their religious civilization among other
peoples. They learned to survive without land, without autonomous
political authority and without independent means of self-defense,
attempting to compensate for their political weakness through
economic and intellectual strength.
</P>
<P>
   Although this strategy of accommodation yielded certain
advantages, the temptation it offered the surrounding peoples
usually proved even greater. Jews often accumulated visible status
and wealth. But prosperity without the ability to protect their
assets made them the ideal target of rulers and mobs. Demagogues
inflated their power by attacking this small people with the very
large image. The reputation of the Jews as a no-fail enemy grew
with each successive expulsion, massacre and pogrom.
</P>
<P>
   Those who exploit the Holocaust as a moral fable make no
connection between it and the political predicament of the Jews:
being perceived as victims and targets. In fact, Hitler's
victorious war against the Jews inspires as much imitation as
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Jews have reclaimed their sovereignty since their
destruction in Europe, and in Israel they now command their own
self-defense. But as long as the demographic and political
imbalance between the Jews and those who wish to dislodge them
remains as lop-sided as it was in Europe, the precedent of the
Holocaust still tempts the aggressor. Far from regarding the German
genocide as morally abhorrent, Arab anti-Semitism recycles the same
accusations, and keeps its eye on the same prize.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever had trouble sympathizing with the dead Jews. But
the protection of the living _ and especially protection for the
Jewish political community that remains under siege _ requires the
opposite set of moral reflexes. Of course, it is imperative to
document, to study, to analyze and to commemorate the greatest
moral failure in Western civilization, which coincides with the
tragedy of the Jewish people. Preventing its recurrence requires
something else, and something more.

MASS KILLINGS SEEN AS A DEFINING EVENT OF THE MODERN ERA

<TEXT>
<P>
   VORONOVO, Russia _ This city is 30 miles from Moscow, at what
was once Trofim Lysenko's Agrarian Research Center. I am here under
auspices of the Holocaust Educational Foundation to lecture for two
weeks on the Holocaust to 23 professors, Jewish and non-Jewish,
from all over the former Soviet Union. They have come from as close
as Moscow and as far away as Birobidzhan, the ``Jewish republic''
created by Stalin in the 1930s in the Far East of Russia near
Manchuria. Each of the students has agreed, as the basis of their
participation in the seminar, to introduce or to continue teaching
a course on the Holocaust at their universities.
</P>
<P>
   I begin with this geographical backdrop because from here it
seems clear that those who argue that the Holocaust should not be
taught as a specialized field of study in university programs are
out of touch with the feelings of scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish,
around the world. Still, more important, they misunderstand the
Holocaust's significance not only for Jewish history but also for
the modern era in its totality.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust, along with the creation of the State of Israel,
is the defining event of Jewish history in the 20th century, if not
of the last two millenniums of Jewish existence. It is also one of
the defining events of the 20th century more generally, hence the
massive effort to relativize and de-Judaize it.
</P>
<P>
   For here the distinctive features of modernity _ nationalism,
the decline of religious authority, an innovative political
ideology, bureaucracy, technology, the secular state, racial
theory, and intentional state-sponsored genocide _ come together in
a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, given the inversion of all moral and metaphysical
values that Nazism represented, all the classical Western doctrines
of ethics, philosophy and theology are challenged to their core. As
such, anyone concerned to understand the modern world _ its
unprecedented capacity for altering the human condition, and its
immense potential for good and evil _ must confront, with all
seriousness, the events that together make up the whole of we call
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the teaching of the Holocaust has to be done
correctly. This means properly placing the event within the
narrative of European history and the dismal tradition of Christian
anti-Semitism, as well as within the contours of modern Jewish
history. In the latter context it means, in particular,
understanding the complex and difficult issue of Jewish
emancipation, which, in turn, gave rise to ``the Jewish Question''
(die Judenfrage) _ what to do about the Jews now that they had been
liberated from their medieval status.
</P>
<P>
   For the Holocaust, as Hitler described it, was intended as ``
die Endlosung der Judenfrage'' (``the Final Solution to the Jewish
Question.'' According to this logic, all of the earlier attempted
solutions that had dominated the 19th and early 20th centuries _
efforts aimed at religious conversion, assimilation, socialism and
religious reform _ were considered manifest failures. And they
failed because they were not rooted in the racial theory that alone
properly diagnoses the nature of the ``Jewish Problem'': that the
Jews, each and every Jewish man, woman and child, are literally
less than human. They, the Jews, incarnate negative principles of
being that necessarily cause them to be aggressive, destructive,
parasitical, ``Untermenschen'' (subhumans) in the grand scheme of
history. In consequence, the Aryan people must, in putative
``self-defense,'' act to protect themselves and their civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The whole of World War II is, in a fundamental sense, the
application and playing out of this racial-metaphysical theory.
This is especially true vis-a-vis the brutal war on the eastern
front, and the continent-wide unrestrained effort to gather up all
Jews from all quarters of Europe and to deport them to Auschwitz
and Treblinka, Sobibor and Chelmno, to be immolated, their ashes
used to fill swamps and to fertilize the Polish landscape.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, emotionally, psychologically, intellectually
and academically difficult material to decipher and comprehend.
How, for example, could the ``ordinary men'' who comprised the
Einsatzgruppen (the Nazi killing squads created as an integral part
of the Nazi war machine in Russia) _ who were not preselected
sadists, not professional killers, not volunteers, and who were led
by individuals possessing Ph.D.'s and other advanced degrees _ kill
1.5 million to 1.8 million men, women and children ``face to
face''?
</P>
<P>
   To ask such an elemental question, to confront such far-reaching
matters in all their complexity, should not lead to denying the
Holocaust a special place in the university curriculum, but rather
requires that it receive one. Given its monumental significance,
the Holocaust must be front and center, taught by experts to
students of all ethnic and religious backgrounds whose world has
been, in large measure, created by it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to teach this pivotal subject without either a
sufficient knowledge of its larger historical circumstance,
including the makeup and character of the Nazi state, or of Jewish
history is to tell less than the whole story and thus, by design or
ignorance, to distort it. One must know, among other things, the
remarkable character of that Jewish civilization that was
destroyed, the nature of the cultural, social, political and
religious life that was carried on in the Polish and Lithuanian
ghettos, the details of the impossible and unprecedented position
of the Jewish Councils, and the story of Jewish resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the shared methodological and pedagogical
circumstance of any academic subject taught in the university or
elsewhere. That is, proper academic (or other) instruction always
requires the necessary expertise. In this particular case, this
entails mastery of Jewish and non-Jewish historical and other
materials. Certainly this makes large scholarly demands on those
who would teach the subject, and assuredly much of the teaching of
the Holocaust falls short of this standard.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that Holocaust studies shouldn't exist as
an independent field of study. Indeed, it is all the more reason to
support the creation of first-rate programs that will train
competent scholars and that will help devise appropriate
pedagogical models for conveying the lessons and legacies of this
most overwhelming and consequential event.

 &HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS: WHY DOES AMERICA HAVE TERRORIST ENEMIES?
 &HT;    With BOMBING-CLINTON-0808.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world has yet to find out who planted the bombs
that exploded minutes apart in two East African capitals on Friday.
But it was clear why the terrorists chose U.S. embassies as their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any site can be a target,'' said Vincent Farley, a retired top
U.S. State Department official who has accompanied former President
Jimmy Carter to East Africa. ``But a U.S. embassy is symbolic. It
is an attack on the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War -- and Russia's economy in shambles
-- the United States remains the last remaining superpower. The
nation's military forces serve in more than a dozen foreign lands.
Its diplomatic thrusts reach into virtually every major political
and ethnic controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Such circumstances are bound to yield enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has now become the weapon of choice of the weak,''
said former CIA director James Schlesinger. ``There are powerful
incentives to make use of terrorism, most notably the belief that
the United States might be induced to pull back and withdraw its
forces,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, terrorists are unable to pose a direct military
challenge to the United States. Attacks such as the one against the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania rely in large measure on
successfully evading a full-scale American military response
against the still-unknown assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the murderers of 19 U.S. servicemen in the 1996 Khobar
Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia have yet to be brought to justice,
and perhaps never will, although the case is still being actively
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a hope at the time of the incident at the Khobar
barracks that this one incident or perhaps one further incident
might lead us to pull back into the United States,'' Schlesinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened, although millions of dollars have been
spent in an effort to harden official facilities in foreign lands
against terrorist strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every embassy in the world has done significant upgrades,''
Farley, who now lives in Atlanta, noted. ``But you cannot protect
people against bombs of this size in a downtown area.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as World War II, he recalled, diplomats could be
reasonably sure of their personal security, even in the midst of
the fiercest fighting. Even in that epic struggle, all of the
combatant powers saw to it that enemy envoys within their ranks
remained unharmed before they were safely exchanged on neutral
ships.
</P>
<P>
   But those rules no longer hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents . . . underscore the truism that our
diplomatic corps, in this day and age, is as much on the frontline
as any of our military personnel,'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House International Relations Committee, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the attacks were well-planned and coordinated, a
consensus emerged among officials ruling out local groups in Kenya
and Tanzania as being responsible for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very pro-American countries, reaching out engaging
in aid, engaging in trade, good diplomatic relationships
bilaterally -- so it seems that they were used at convenient
sites,'' Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special envoy to Africa, told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The states that currently appear on a U.S. list of alleged state
sponsors of terrorism are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Cuba and
North Korea. Within this group, speculation quickly focused on
Muslim extremists in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While there are ample reasons why such groups should be regarded
as suspects, officials also recalled how news reports had initially
pointed at Middle Eastern extremists as being responsible for the
1995 truck bomb that demolished the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City. Two Americans were arrested and
convicted for that crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said
U.S. government agencies receive some 30,000 threats a year,
suggesting a wide range of possible assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there yet,'' Pickering warned.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was known that the all-out official investigation
which began on Friday will focus on a class of mercenaries who have
the means, and the motivation, to attack U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Engelhart, director of international investigations at
Kroll Associates, a corporate intelligence firm, said: ``We have
kind of forgotten that there is a strata of people out there who do
not like us, who will never like us and who view us as everything
bad in their world.''

 &HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS: WHY DOES AMERICA HAVE TERRORIST ENEMIES?
 &HT;    With BOMBING-CLINTON-0808.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world has yet to find out who planted the bombs
that exploded minutes apart in two East African capitals on Friday.
But it was clear why the terrorists chose U.S. embassies as their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any site can be a target,'' said Vincent Farley, a retired top
U.S. State Department official who has accompanied former President
Jimmy Carter to East Africa. ``But a U.S. embassy is symbolic. It
is an attack on the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War -- and Russia's economy in shambles
-- the United States remains the last remaining superpower. The
nation's military forces serve in more than a dozen foreign lands.
Its diplomatic thrusts reach into virtually every major political
and ethnic controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Such circumstances are bound to yield enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has now become the weapon of choice of the weak,''
said former CIA director James Schlesinger. ``There are powerful
incentives to make use of terrorism, most notably the belief that
the United States might be induced to pull back and withdraw its
forces,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, terrorists are unable to pose a direct military
challenge to the United States. Attacks such as the one against the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania rely in large measure on
successfully evading a full-scale American military response
against the still-unknown assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the murderers of 19 U.S. servicemen in the 1996 Khobar
Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia have yet to be brought to justice,
and perhaps never will, although the case is still being actively
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a hope at the time of the incident at the Khobar
barracks that this one incident or perhaps one further incident
might lead us to pull back into the United States,'' Schlesinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened, although millions of dollars have been
spent in an effort to harden official facilities in foreign lands
against terrorist strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every embassy in the world has done significant upgrades,''
Farley, who now lives in Atlanta, noted. ``But you cannot protect
people against bombs of this size in a downtown area.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as World War II, he recalled, diplomats could be
reasonably sure of their personal security, even in the midst of
the fiercest fighting. Even in that epic struggle, all of the
combatant powers saw to it that enemy envoys within their ranks
remained unharmed before they were safely exchanged on neutral
ships.
</P>
<P>
   But those rules no longer hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents . . . underscore the truism that our
diplomatic corps, in this day and age, is as much on the frontline
as any of our military personnel,'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House International Relations Committee, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the attacks were well-planned and coordinated, a
consensus emerged among officials ruling out local groups in Kenya
and Tanzania as being responsible for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very pro-American countries, reaching out engaging
in aid, engaging in trade, good diplomatic relationships
bilaterally -- so it seems that they were used at convenient
sites,'' Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special envoy to Africa, told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The states that currently appear on a U.S. list of alleged state
sponsors of terrorism are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Cuba and
North Korea. Within this group, speculation quickly focused on
Muslim extremists in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While there are ample reasons why such groups should be regarded
as suspects, officials also recalled how news reports had initially
pointed at Middle Eastern extremists as being responsible for the
1995 truck bomb that demolished the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City. Two Americans were arrested and
convicted for that crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said
U.S. government agencies receive some 30,000 threats a year,
suggesting a wide range of possible assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there yet,'' Pickering warned.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was known that the all-out official investigation
which began on Friday will focus on a class of mercenaries who have
the means, and the motivation, to attack U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Engelhart, director of international investigations at
Kroll Associates, a corporate intelligence firm, said: ``We have
kind of forgotten that there is a strata of people out there who do
not like us, who will never like us and who view us as everything
bad in their world.''

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has cured a springer spaniel of what he diagnosed
as ``rage without reason.'' He has helped a Great Dane overcome
sibling rivalry after the birth of its owners' first baby. At the
moment, he is ministering to a bulldog with a compulsive appetite
for its master's Gucci belts and Hermes bags.
</P>
<P>
   Bashkim Dibra, a dog trainer who has such a cult following among
Manhattan pet owners that he is known simply as Bash, like a rock
star, charges $200 an hour to go to your apartment and bang on pots
to quiet your barking schnauzer.
</P>
<P>
   His clients have included Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker,
Ronald Perelman, Linda Wachner and Henry Kissinger. He's the ``top
dog'' of trainers, said Georgette Mosbacher, the society figure.
</P>
<P>
   Bash said: ``Everything I do, I think of the dog's point of
view. I actually think like a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it usually takes six to eight lessons for him to
``city train'' a pet on a leash, and another seven lessons to
``country train'' it off the leash. Given the lifestyles of many of
his clients, a ``town and country'' dog, as he calls it, is a must.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bash flew to Paris for an emergency visit to a Jack
Russell terrier that had forgotten its table manners. Although the
dog had been trained to lie quietly under outdoor restaurant tables
along Madison Avenue, once away from home, it lunged at other dogs.
Bash spent two days going from bistro to bistro, teaching the dog
to nibble baguette crumbs peacefully off the cobblestones at its
owner's feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bash is as much a dog psychiatrist as a trainer,'' said
Victoria Newhouse, who is married to S.I. Newhouse Jr., the owner
of Conde Nast Publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dog, Nero, at 12, started to withdraw,'' she said. ``Bash
came up with the idea of teaching him a new trick every year. It
would revitalize him. The challenge of learning something new made
it not true that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bash, who is 46 and was born in Albania, has accompanied dogs to
their owners' interviews with co-op boards on the Upper East Side.
While the people try to prove their own good breeding, Bash shows
off the dogs'. After one such appearance at 1185 Park Ave., he
said, a board member told him, ``I wish the kids who lived here
could be so well mannered.''
</P>
<P>
   Bash and his family came to the United States in 1963, settling
in Riverdale in the Bronx. Bash is still based there, operating his
private training service through Fieldston Pets, a grooming and
pet-supply shop owned by his sister, Mereut. He has a degree in
animal behavior from City University and is the author of ``Dog
Training by Bash'' (Dutton, 1991), now in its eighth printing, and
``Teach Your Dog to Behave'' (Dutton, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 he was hired to train and domesticate a wolf pup for a
television movie, ``A Boy Who Cried Wolf.'' He named the pup
Mariah. ``This was my greatest teacher, the rearing and training of
her,'' Bash said. ``The wolf is the ancestor of the dog. It's the
primal part of the dog that exists. It gave me insight into the
mind of the dog.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he is not making house calls (all of his lessons are
private), Bash is a big kahuna on the pet charity circuit. In 1992
he started the Dog Walk, to benefit shelter programs sponsored by
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
in 1993 he created Paws for Cause, a dog walk for the American
Cancer Society to promote awareness that animals can also get
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on the board of the Delta Society, which brings dogs
together with people who have disabilities. Earlier this year he
created Canine Court in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first
dog playground in the city. And he is creating Starpet.com, an
online animal talent agency for advertising and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   With an average of 50 clients a week, Bash logs 14-hour days,
but he doesn't mind the schedule. ``I'm a good barometer of the
economy,'' he said. ``There's a new wealth of people _ young Wall
Street people living in Scarsdale, Greenwich, Pound Ridge. It's hot
to have a dog trainer, just like it's hot to have a personal
trainer. I'm like the dog's personal trainer.''

   Choosing one color is tough. Selecting two is almost painful;
any more than two almost requires the assistance of a professional.
The paint pros are aware of the problem. There are several new
publications designed specifically to address the multicolor theme
with paint-by-numbers simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color Palettes'' by Suzanne Butterfield ($40, Clarkson Potter
Publishers), suggests using a single creamy, yellow wall cover to
dissolve boundaries in an open floor plan, then shifting to a dark,
mossy green for the staircase or adjoining room.
</P>
<P>
   Various chapters spotlight palettes designed for a seaside
cottage or a Manhattan penthouse; unfortunately, she doesn't deal
with a suburban tract home.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the book is that the colors used are from the
Donald Kaufman Color collection, only available by calling (800)
977-9198. At that number, a recorded message directed us to two
paint shops in New Jersey and Santa Monica, Calif., the only
retailers selling the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Palette'' by Bonnie Rosser Krims ($30, Warner
Books) offers 50 paint schemes. Each scheme shows swatches of three
main colors and suggests shades for trim. She also discusses which
colors suit which rooms: Yellow, she says, is great for home
offices because it speeds up the metabolism and work attentiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Krims is clearly into the Zen of paint color, detailing how a
particular yellow reminds her of the south of France and how a
violet and gold combination invokes Mozart's ``The Magic Flute.''
``The recipe, like the flute itself, resonates with brilliance and
boldness and with sweetness of color.''
</P>
<P>
   This is paint we're talking about here.
</P>
<P>
   Major paint companies are rushing to help the perpetually
color-perplexed. Glidden recently launched Glidden Color Magazine,
available at Home Depot and other retailers that sell the brand.
</P>
<P>
   While editors swear the $2.95 magazine isn't a glorified Glidden
ad, the publication does showcase Glidden shades and the company's
new basic palettes: The Vibrant Collection, deep berry red and
blue; The Warm Collection, a food group of toasty almond and dark
chocolate; The Fresh Collection, lime green and white; and The Calm
Collection, soothing sanatarium colors, lavender, blue and gray.
</P>
<P>
   I like the furniture, shown in the magazine and wish they could
have labeled it or had a ``where to buy'' list. They use a lot of
that postmodern look which is visually appealing but doesn't work
in my traditional home. They show kids on top of the furniture,
which, in my home, is very realistic.

 &HT;    THIRD OF NATION FLIRTS WITH POVERTY, CENSUS STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    For release Monday, Aug. 10.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poverty in the United States may be more of a
revolving door than a trap door, with nearly one-third of Americans
falling into poverty for months at a time only to pull out later,
the U.S. Census Bureau reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report used seven different economic measures designed to
provide a ``video'' look at poverty instead of the more traditional
``snapshot.'' It concluded that while some Americans are mired in
chronic poverty, for most, poverty is ``a transitory condition,''
sometimes lasting no more than a couple of months in any given
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who experience poverty generally escape it within
a few months,'' said Mary Naifeh, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Naifeh, comparing 1993 and 1994 survey data, found that 30
percent of the U.S. population was poor for at least two months,
but only 5 percent was poor continuously for the full 24-month
period. She concluded that while ``poverty rates may suggest to
some that poverty is a chronic condition, the reality is quite
different.''
</P>
<P>
   She found that 41.8 percent of Hispanics and 40.2 percent of
African Americans slipped into poverty for at least two months
during the study period, compared to 18.3 percent of whites. People
in families headed by a single female had the highest poverty rate
of any group, 48.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average number of months spent in poverty was 4.5 over all,
with whites averaging 4.2 months; African Americans, 6 months;
Hispanics, 5 months; and single female households, 7.2 months.
</P>
<P>
   Children had the highest ``entry rate'' into poverty: 4.4
percent of those ages 0-17 who were not poor in 1993 fell into
poverty during 1994. The entry rate for those age 18-64 years was 3
percent. Among retirement-age adults, only 2 percent slipped into
poverty from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Naifeh also found that 21.5 percent of central city dwellers
experienced poverty during the study period, compared to 17.5
percent of ``nonmetropolitan'' residents and only 10 percent of
those living in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical poverty threshold, based on after-tax income and
the number of adults and children in a family, is adjusted each
year by the federal government. In 1993, it was $14,654 for a
two-adult, two-child family. In 1994, it was $15,029 for the same
family.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty experts cautioned that the new Census data could be
easily misinterpreted as suggesting that the United States, now in
the eighth year of unprecedented economic growth, does not have a
significant poverty problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that there's a lot of mixing and churning
going on,'' said Robert Haveman, an economics professor at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and an associate of the
university's Institute for Research on Poverty. ``And the way we've
traditionally measured poverty has taken that into account.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether upward mobility is occurring any
faster now that it has in past economic periods,'' said Jared
Bernstein, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington. ``And every indication is that appears to be
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, the rate of people moving out of poverty
has been relatively unresponsive to the growth of the economy,
according to Bernstein. Further, in the robust economic expansion
of recent years, the national poverty rate has dropped only 1.1
percent, from 14.8 percent in 1992 to 13.7 percent in 1996, the
latest year for which complete Census data are available.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, scattered thundershowers will
surround a decaying trough of low pressure moving slowly through
the Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes on Saturday.
Rainfall throughout this corridor will be less than in recent days,
though isolated thunderstorms could still produce an inch or two of
additional rain.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the low, residual moisture in the lowest few
thousand feet of the atmosphere will cause low stratus clouds to
linger over sections of eastern Minnesota and Iowa. Farther south,
burgeoning cumulus clouds will replace clear skies over the
southeast Plains and east Texas as rising currents of warm, moist
air ascend into a pocket of cool air at 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A boundary between humid and drier air will provide the focus
for clouds and spotty showers in central New England on Saturday.
Farther north, abundant sun and very warm air will cover northern
Maine. Meanwhile, ample sunshine and increasingly sultry air will
affect the Middle Atlantic States as high pressure along the
Eastern Seaboard draws humid air northward.
</P>
<P>
   Intervals of sunshine and puffy cumulus clouds will prevail from
Virginia to Florida on Saturday. A few of these clouds will produce
thunderstorms, especially during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the southeast will transport increasingly humid air
into the Southwest. As the intense sun heats the moist air,
isolated thunderstorms will develop in the afternoon and evening,
possibly leading to local flooding. Elsewhere, mainly sunny skies
and seasonably warm weather will cover the Pacific states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cold Funnels
</P>
<P>
   Ominous but harmless cold-air funnels dipped below cumulus
clouds over northwest Missouri on Friday. These funnel clouds earn
their ``cold'' moniker because, when they occur, they form in the
cool air aloft that follows a cold front between late spring and
mid-autumn. As the sun breaks through clouds and warms the ground,
cold-air funnels can develop as cumulus clouds build to modest
altitudes up to 25,000 feet. In contrast, funnel clouds associated
with destructive tornadoes form in very warm, humid and unstable
air masses in which parent thunderstorms can mushroom to 50,000
feet.

SEBRING TOPS AMONG CONVERTIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Thereare at least three good reasons why the Chrysler
Sebring convertible is, by far, the bestselling ragtop in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The first is obvious: beautiful styling. Here's a sleek and
classy-looking ride that benefits well from Chrysler's signature
cab-forward design, looking both aggressively poised and elegantly
modern.
</P>
<P>
   The second has to do with something the Sebring has that other
midsize convertibles don't: a usable back seat. Regulation-size
humans can sit three abreast and even have a place to put their
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The third is probably the top reason: moderate price. The
Sebring's not cheap, but you get a lot for your money, especially
in terms of a distinctive automobile that is fun, practical and
beautiful (see reason No. 1).
</P>
<P>
   Our fully equipped version topped $28,000, but the lesser
bestowed JX version starts at about $8,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Chrysler sold more than 53,000 of these things, fully
one-third of all convertible sales and more than twice as many as
its closest rival, Ford Mustang. The rear-drive Mustang is a
sportier critter, especially in its high-performance GT trim, and
appeals to a younger crowd. Compared with the Mustang, the Sebring
is a boulevard cruiser, more show than go.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Chrysler's steering and handling are above average,
and its V-6 engine will get you there, though not in a big rush.
Like many drop-tops, it will shake and shimmy on rough surfaces,
especially in curves, though not excessively.
</P>
<P>
   But sporty performance and sophisticated road manners have
little to do with why people buy these things (see three reasons,
above). None of that stuff really matters in the cool of the
evening with a brilliant sunset overhead. Or when your friends
behold you stylin' and profilin'.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sebring has a much better back seat than the Mustang
(see reason No. 2) so you can take some of those friends along for
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Restyled last year, the Sebring has an improved appearance,
smoother and more appealing. Designed on the Cirrus sedan platform,
the proportions on this car are really nice, from its short, low
snout to its broad rear end. There's a practical side, too, with
the Sebring having better trunk space than most convertibles with
the top stowed.
</P>
<P>
   The leather interior of the test car was solid, roomy and
comfortable, with a shade of retro appeal in its
black-with-white-inserts color scheme. Comfort is the key, and the
tall boys in the back seat certainly appreciated the extra space.
</P>
<P>
   Top up, the Sebring is quiet and snug, with scant wind noise or
flutter. Top down, well, some convertibles are just nicer than
others, something about how the breeze curls around the windshield
and how special it makes you feel. The Sebring is one of the nice
ones.
</P>
<P>
   That top, by the way, has a glass rear window instead of a
fragile plastic one. In Arizona summer heat, which tends to turn
plastic rear windows into brown potato chips, that's a major plus.
</P>
<P>
   The top slides down easily with the touch of a button, requiring
the human occupants only to unlatch it from the windshield frame.
The fabric tonneau cover is a pain, though, requiring you to haul
yourself out of the driver's seat and attach it. At least that's
what I hear, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who didn't bother
installing the tonneau over the stowed top. Not a good idea,
really, because the folded fabric can get weather damaged if not
covered.
</P>
<P>
   More-expensive convertibles, such as Mercedes-Benz's new CLK320
and Volvo's recent C-70, have hatches that open and close
automatically as the top glides down. But that's one of the things
you pay the big bucks for (see reason No. 3).
</P>
<P>
   Those high-end jobs also have safety roll bars that snap up into
place in the event of a rollover. The Sebring lacks this safety
feature, though it is well-equipped with safety equipment
otherwise. Just don't flip it.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was equipped with Chrysler's Autostick shifting
system that allows drivers to choose between full automatic or
manual gear selection. I didn't really feel that the Sebring lent
itself to the kind of performance driving where the Autostick
option is best appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Because I spent most of my test-driving time around the urban
area, the tranny stayed in the automatic mode most of the time,
which worked out fine. The few times I used the Autostick, I found
it operated well and made it easier to hustle into and out of
turns.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers will try the Autostick a few times, then leave the
transmission in Drive from then on. But for those of us who miss
real stick shift, the Autostick is there attempting to fill the
void.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler has had a great run of cars and trucks in recent years,
with such notable performance machines as the Viper; excellent
family cars such as Intrepid, Concorde and LHS; the popular new
Durango sports-utility vehicle; the big Ram pickup with its
tractor-trailer styling; and the superb remake of the classic Jeep
Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   The Sebring is not a new car for Chrysler, neatly replacing the
LeBaron, but the latest upgrade keeps it modern and right in there
with the best of them. Witness its booming popularity (see reasons,
above). &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``The only handwritten letters I get these days are
from stores,'' said Barry Cooper, a real estate developer who is an
avid shopper. Thank-you notes have become de rigueur, from Madison
Avenue boutiques to Pottery Barn and J. Crew. In their retail sales
programs, Paul Stuart, Bergdorf Goodman, Lord &AMP; Taylor and other
stores require classes in the art of writing thank-you notes to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, expressing gratitude is becoming more competitive. After
buying Volkswagen's New Beetle, Cooper received a note of thanks
with a tiny silver copy of the car.
</P>
<P>
   And for Edward Hunter, who has worked at Sulkha, the men's
clothing store on Park Avenue, for 12 years, a mere thank-you note
is too prosaic. He prefers to woo his clientele with verse:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics) Allow searchings for paths unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Wish us wisdom's weight of all clouds passing.
</P>
<P>
   Realize dreams hugging rainbow rays.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hunter doesn't reserve his poetry for big spenders. ``I give it
away with great energy,'' he said. ``I'm a great believer in
spreading the written word.''

   ``I feel like Roller Girl when I wear them,'' Tia Williams, 22,
said of her 1981 Sergio Valente jeans. ``The old 80s jeans are more
fun and a lot sexier than the ones today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams was in diapers when nothing came between Brooke
Shields and her Calvins. But after the success of ``Boogie Nights''
(with Heather Graham as Roller Girl) and ``The Last Days of
Disco,'' a new generation is snapping up circulation-restricting
jeans in secondhand stores like Antique Boutique on lower Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Disco-era designers have reissued their classics: Jordache
($40), Sergio Valente's V jeans ($70) and Calvin Klein's Original
Calvins ($52). But not everyone is pining for the days you had to
pull up your zipper with a pair of pliers. Jimmy Hanrahan, a
stylist at MTV, cautioned against banking on the trend.
``Individual style has conquered the designer label dictatorship,''
he said.

   In a recent video, an ode to materialism, the hip-hop idol Sean
(Puffy) Combs mentions Matsuda sunglasses, but he's wearing Barry
Kieselstein-Cords. BKCs, as they're called, are the latest from the
animal-loving designer whose handbags and jewelry are home to a
menagerie of frogs, alligators and other beasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has developed a cult following that started way back with
his jewelry,'' said Rise Gerber, the fashion director for
accessories at Bergdorf Goodman, where the sunglasses are a top
seller. ``This is a way for a woman who may not be able to afford a
handbag to have something of his.''
</P>
<P>
   With the shades' introduction in January, men joined the BKC
cult. Eddy Veder and Robin Williams have also bought the
sunglasses, which cost $395 to $18,000, the price of a
limited-edition pair bought by Elton John.

   When Naomi Campbell, Parker Posey, Donna Karan and Kirsty Hume
wanted hand-dyed dresses made from vintage lingerie, they all
sought out Momo Falana, a line sold at the 26th Street flea market
and by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio is also a customer. ``I went into great detail
telling him about the shimmer in the fabric and the dying
process,'' said Maureen (Momo) Roberts, one of the two creators.
``He was quick to remind me that the dress wasn't for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Designs range from a beaded 1920s dressing gown ($1,000) to
boldly dyed chiffon slips ($30). ``People seem to want that
timeless romantic feeling, no matter what the trends are,'' said
Michael Lublin, Ms. Roberts' husband and partner. Appointments:

   Fear of germs from all sorts of contact once thought to be
innocuous is growing. There are now antibacterial ballpoint pens
designed by C&AMP;K Manufacturing, Nike ACG sneakers with an
antibacterial foot bed and a new line of germ-free Clean Use
calculators from Casio.
</P>
<P>
   And these are not being marketed exclusively to the Howard
Hughes fan club, either. Products from dishwashing liquids to body
lotions have seen sales rise with the addition of ``antibacterial''
to their labels.
</P>
<P>
   No-rinse hand sanitizing lotions like Purell are even being
dispensed in public restrooms, left. And new competition for Purell
is Jao, which also offers aromatherapy benefits (available at
Bigelow Pharmacy).
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors believe that eliminating too many bacteria can have
health risks of its own. For the anti-anti-bacterial camp, there's
the High Performance Hygiene System, a collection of soaps ($8) and
facial dips ($12) available at Ricky's drugstores and Healthy
Pleasures markets, and coming to Bloomingdale's this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our products emulsify germs; they don't kill them,'' said
Steven Blaushield, the president of High Performance (orders from
888-262-5700). But this is no simple soap-and-water solution. You
immerse your hands in a tub of fatty acids and oils that feel like
Vaseline. And for germ-sensitive nasal and eye membranes, plunge
your face in a basin of water dosed with the hydrogen peroxide and
iodine dip and blink.

HOUSE WOULD BAN GAYS AND LESBIANS FROM ADOPTING CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest of a series of measures that gay
rights advocates view as anti-homosexual, the House has passed a
bill that would forbid unmarried couples _ including gays and
lesbians _ in the nation's capital to adopt a child.
</P>
<P>
   The measure _ an amendment sponsored by Rep. Steve Largent,
R-0kla., to a $6.8 billion spending bill for the District of
Columbia _ passed by a 227-192 vote shortly before the House
adjourned early Friday for its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects in the Senate are unclear. No corresponding adoption
provision exists in that chamber's D.C. spending bill, but one
could be added once the measure goes to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the D.C. bill because
of the adoption provision and because it includes a pilot program
that would give up to $3,200 in vouchers to some poor public school
children so they could attend private nonsectarian and parochial
schools.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth consecutive year that the House
Appropriations Committee has considered a measure to bar gays and
lesbians from adopting, but the first time one has passed the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., tried to attach the measure
to the D.C bill in the appropriations committee, but it was
defeated, after Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La., voiced qualms.
Largent then restored the provision on the floor Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   His amendment says, ``None of the funds contained in (the D.C.
spending bill) may be used to carry out any joint adoption of a
child between individuals who are not related by blood or by
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   During the floor debate, Largent said his measure ``does not
single out homosexuals. ... This could be a heterosexual couple
that does not have a marriage contract that binds them together.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Sure, it might give some gay rights advocates a warm
feeling to see gay couples treated just as if they were married.
But these are real kids ... who have already had a rough start. ...
It is simply wrong to turn them into trophies from the culture war,
to exploit them in order to make some political point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, said the amendment would deny
children in need a loving home. It would ``allow a philandering
married husband who abuses his wife on a regular basis to be able
to legally adopt a child,'' Edwards said. ``But if two nuns felt
God's calling to adopt a disabled, blind child from Romania, under
this amendment they would be prohibited from doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., also argued that adoptions should
be reviewed ``on a case-by-case basis,'' looking at ``the best
interests of each and every child.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the adoption amendment followed the chamber's
rejection earlier this week of a measure by Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colo., that would have blocked President Clinton's executive
order issued in May banning job discrimination against gays in the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the House passed a measure by Rep. Frank Riggs,
R-Calif., that would prevent San Francisco from using federal
housing money to implement its requirement that contractors with
the city must provide the same benefits to unmarried domestic
partners as they provide to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
compared homosexuality to kleptomania, and House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas, said homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also blocked the nomination of San Francisco
gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to become U.S. ambassador to
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Largent's measure, Ann Sullivan, adoption program
director for the Child Welfare League of America, a nonprofit group
of agencies that offer services for children and families, said it
is clearly aimed at preventing homosexuals from adopting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few straight unmarried couples who are seeking
to adopt,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 35,000 foster children in this country are waiting for
families to adopt them, Sullivan said. ``Why would we want to
arbitrarily rule out a part of the population? The capacity to
nurture a child, and sexual orientation are two very different
things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Numerous gays and lesbians in this country are already parents,
she added, noting that many of them were previously in heterosexual
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said if Largent's amendment becomes law, gays and
lesbians who want children will be driven to adopt them
independently rather than through agencies, which can better
prepare couples for the rigors of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, said
Largent's measure ``is a discriminatory amendment that is really
about (denying) gays and lesbians who can't get married the ability
to provide loving and stable homes. Gays and lesbians can be good
parents just as straight parents can.''

<P>
   Personal: Married to Norha Puyana; three children.
</P>
<P>
   Party: Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Born in Bogota, Pastrana is the son of the late
former President Misael Pastrana. He was once the mayor of Bogota,
a senator, and a television journalist. He narrowly lost a bid for
president in 1994 against Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
   THE U.S.-COLOMBIA CONNECTION:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. exports to Colombia, dominated by chemicals, were $5.2
billion in 1997 compared to $4.6 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. imports from Colombia -- mostly petroleum, coffee and cut
flowers -- were $4.7 billion in 1997, up from $3.7 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The United States will give the Colombian military about $100
million in aid this year. The United States has about 200 military
advisers in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trade between Florida and Colombia totaled $4.09 billion in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An estimated 1 million Colombians live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --About 50,000 Colombians live in the states of Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, North and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   --About 15,000 Colombians live in the metro Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   --About 300,000 Colombians live in Florida, with some 200,000 in

</P>
<P>
   --About 2,000 businesses in South Florida are owned by

</P>
<P>
   --About 60,000 Colombians live in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some of the U.S. companies operating in Colombia include
American Airlines, the Coca-Cola Co., General Motors Corp.,
Gillette, IBM, Microsoft, Mobil, and Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL FACTS &AMP; FIGURES ABOUT COLOMBIA:
</P>
<P>
   The land: About the size of Texas and New Mexico combined at
439,735 square miles, Colombia is in the northwestern corner of
South America, bordered by Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and
Venezuela. It is the fourth largest country in South America with
coast lines on both the Caribbean and Pacific. The capital, Bogota,
has a population of 6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The people: Colombia has a population of 36 million, of whom
about 58 percent are Mestizo, 20 percent are Caucasian, and 14
percent are Mulatto. At least 95 percent of the population is Roman
Catholic. The language is Spanish and the literacy rate is 87
percent. Education is free and supposed to be compulsory, but many
children in rural areas don't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   The government: The Senate has 102 members and the Chamber of
Representatives has 161. The president, who appoints his 13
ministers, is elected by popular vote for a term of four years. The
president-elect is Andres Pastrana, who will replace Ernesto Samper
when he takes office Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The history: Almost from its inception, Colombia has been a
scene of strife. Leftist rebels, that number about 15,000 today,
have fought the government for 34 years. One leftist group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), is Latin America's
largest and oldest guerrilla force. About 35,000 people have been
killed in the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The economy: Chief crops are coffee, rice, tobacco, cotton,
sugar, and bananas. As well as oil and gas, Colombia has the
largest coal reserves in Latin America.

 &HT;    COLOMBIA SWEARS IN NEW PRESIDENT FOLLOWING WEEK OF BLOODY
VIOLENCE
 &HT;    With COLOMBIA-BOX-0808.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Harvard-educated Andres Pastrana was sworn in Friday as
Colombia's new president following a week of unexpected political
violence, a bloody reminder of just how virulent the Marxist
guerrillas have become and how difficult it will be to forge peace
in this war-weary country.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful guerrilla offensive that began Monday and tapered off
by Wednesday left more than 140 soldiers and police officers dead.
At least 100 more were missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most dramatically, the rebels overtook an important
anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, in southern Colombia, killing or
dragging away scores of security officers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grim welcome for Pastrana, 43, who just last month
trudged through the jungle to meet face-to-face with leaders of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Latin America's
oldest and largest rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Following that historic meeting, Pastrana and rebel leaders
announced that peace talks would begin by November.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC -- and the smaller Cuban-inspired National Liberation
Army (ELN) -- number nearly 20,000 fighters. Demanding a
more-responsive government and increased social spending, they've
tried to topple the Colombian government in a civil war that has
spanned three decades and killed some 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's 147,000-member military has been ineffective against
an increasingly bold and influential guerrilla force that's
believed to be gaining wealth and firepower through fees collected
from drug traffickers in exchange for the protection of cultivation
fields and processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, a television journalist and former mayor of Bogota,
Colombia's capital, replaced outgoing President Ernesto Samper and
will serve a four-year term. The June 21 election of the
independent candidate, who had the backing of the opposition
Conservative Party, ended the ruling Liberal Party's 12-year lock
on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel groups had refused to negotiate peace with Samper's
administration, which they branded illegitimate following reports
that Samper's 1994 campaign was bankrolled by $6 million in drug
money.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, it appeared the rebels had ended their offensive in
an effort to underscore their desire to work with Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, the FARC said that its rash of
attacks was a final protest aimed at Samper's government.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians hope Pastrana will restore authority to an office
whose reputation eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of
Samper, who even had his tourist visa revoked by the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the rebel onslaught, there was reason to be
optimistic as Pastrana took office.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana met with President Clinton in Washington on Monday, a
clear indication that U.S.-Colombia relations have improved.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders of right-wing paramilitary groups behind much of the
nation's bloodshed agreed to participate in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Both guerrilla and civilian groups have agreed to hold a
national convention before Oct. 12 to discuss economic and social
reforms that could pave the way for a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still some question over how fast and how far the
new president can go in a nation so mired in political and economic
crises.
</P>

<P>
   Carl Thomsen, a financial consultant in suburban Washington,
actively uses two credit cards, sometimes piling substantial
business expenses onto them. No matter how much he spends, though,
his Visa and Mastercard issuers keep automatically raising his
authorized credit limits, which now run well into five figures
each.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is to tempt people like Thomsen _ a
customer with a good payment record _ to borrow ever-higher amounts
at interest rates that often approach 20 percent. But for some
consumers, it also means a chance to get into ever-bigger financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Do not count Thomsen, 55, among the less-disciplined consumers;
he usually pays off his card balances in full at the end of each
month and has never asked for more borrowing power. Indeed, he
said, ``I've never bumped up against a credit limit.''
</P>
<P>
   In watching those limits grow, however, Thomsen has plenty of
company these days. Banks and other credit-card issuers are raising
their limits far faster than consumers are borrowing _ even as
lenders report record proportions of delinquencies and charge-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite protestations that they're trying to get rid of the
worst excesses, the marketing of card credit is continuing largely
as usual, with little let-up,'' said Warren Heller, research
director for Veribanc Inc., a company in Wakefield, Mass., which
rates banks and savings institutions. ``One of the time-tested
rules of business is that your existing customers are your best
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two years ended in March, unused credit limits for
all bank-issued cards in the United States soared 50.3 percent, to
$1.78 trillion, according to Veribanc _ more than twice the growth
in card charges.
</P>
<P>
   This pushed consumers' potential spending power to a record 4.2
times their current indebtedness, up from 3.4 just two years ago.
When the data were first collected in 1990, the multiple was a
little more than 2.
</P>
<P>
   Other figures, compiled by the American Bankers Association,
also point to fast-expanding credit. The most common credit limit
for a standard card sponsored by a large bank, the association
said, climbed for the second consecutive year in 1997, to $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   That is 40 percent higher than the typical limit of $2,500 in
1993. And some ``premium'' cards _ which are not all that difficult
to get _ are being advertised with limits of $50,000 and even
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The average account balance on standard credit cards issued by
large banks is $1,987, the survey found, up from $1,479 in 1993.
For gold cards, it is $2,497, up from $2,334.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America sponsored a report on the
subject last month to bolster its opposition to a bill making it
harder for people to declare bankruptcy _ a bill that lenders are
pushing for Congress to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The organization attributes soaring bankruptcies largely to
``irresponsible'' promotion of credit cards and considers the
banking industry hypocritical in seeking legislation that they say
would make it easier to collect debts from consumers whom bankers
themselves had lured over the financial brink.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, increasingly dominated by a shrinking number of
major banks, often responds to such accusations by saying that
soaring credit lines are a statistical illusion or a reflection of
banks' improving ability to differentiate between the most
lucrative customers and potential deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Chimerine, consulting economist for Mastercard
International, estimated that 75 percent to 80 percent of the
increase in total credit lines reflected the issuance of new cards
_ for which no reliable count exists _ rather than expanded
capacity for existing card holders.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, MBNA, the second-biggest card issuer after Citibank,
added 11.4 million customers last year on top of a 9.3 million gain
in 1996. But some in the industry say that to hasten that growth,
MBNA engages in mass expansion of credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Frank, a spokesman for MBNA, disputed this, saying that
the company's lines have grown an average of just 8 percent in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   At First Chicago NBD, which issues the First Card, potential new
card holders are offered lower lines of credit than they were two
years ago, said Ralph R. Mueller, senior credit officer for First
Card.
</P>
<P>
   First Chicago attributes the growth of credit limits to the
issuance of more gold and platinum cards, which have higher limits.
It also notes that many card holders now have more cards to use;
according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit card
industry, the average is now slightly more than four cards per card
holder, compared with slightly more than three in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, the industry attributes the expansion of credit
limits to refined methods of judging their new customers' ability
to pay. Banks have become ``much more adept in distinguishing the
most profitable customers, those most likely to use their cards and
repay their balances,'' said Robert Stock, senior vice president
for credit products at Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that issuers have reduced their exposure to new
credit-card charge-offs, what risks can expanded credit limits pose
for consumers? An obvious one is that a generally responsible
borrower could leap into expensive debt because of an emergency _ a
serious health problem, for example, or the loss of a job.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists say high credit lines pose some risks even if
they are not used. Access to other credit, like a mortgage, can be
impaired if an applicant has too many cards with too much borrowing
potential. Lenders are wary that a consumer or spouse could
suddenly tap several credit sources so heavily that not all could
be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is taken into consideration,'' said Charlotte Newton,
vice president for consumer affairs at Mastercard. ``Whether or not
you use it, it's still there.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, Elise Berenzweig's mother telephoned to
say she'd spotted Elise's husband, Evan, dallying on a weekday
afternoon at a suburban New Jersey nail salon. Elise took this news
in stride, guessing that Evan had added manicures to what she terms
his ``going at it full force'' beauty regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud that he wants to look so good,'' Mrs. Berenzweig
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed about keeping my pants size,'' said Berenzweig,
42, a senior vice president at the Rag Shops, a chain of fabric and
craft stores. ``Nothing will come between my being 170 pounds and a
33 waist. Nothing. I will hurt small children if necessary.'' His
obsession doesn't end with his six-foot-tall physique. He maintains
a year-round tan (bolstered in wintertime, he concedes, with a
bronzing cream) and schedules frequent ``industrial strength''
teeth cleanings, massages and pedicures. Some ``eye work'' may be
in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am vain, but I'm not conceited,'' Berenzweig explained.
``Besides, women friends of mine implore their husbands to be more
like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention please, beer-gut Gus, hairy Harry and turkey-neck Tom.
Wake up and smell the skin conditioner before women start imploring
you to join men across America who are paying more attention to,
and more money for, their personal appearance. At all ages and
incomes, a steadily growing number of men are tightening their
muscles, filing their fingernails, having their smiles whitened and
eyes ``undrooped'' _ or worrying that they should.
</P>
<P>
   Health spas now organize ``guys only'' nights, and the newest
cosmetics stores are designed to be more men-friendly. Cosmetic
tooth-whitening appointments were requested by more men in 1997
than ever before, according to the American Dental Association. The
number of men undergoing face lifts more than doubled from 1992 to
1997, and male liposuction patients tripled, says the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK for a man to improve himself in ways that were at one
time considered artificial or, even worse, deemed feminine,'' said
Dr. Larry Rosenthal, a cosmetic dentist on Manhattan's Upper East
Side, who offers a one-day ``smile lift'' for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in male vanity is occurring now for a variety of
reasons, experts say. Some cite the baby boom generation's fear of
aging, coupled with younger men's acceptance that they will be
judged by their appearance _ a conviction reinforced by the
ubiquity of half-naked men in advertisements in the 1990s, hawking
everything from soft drinks to Versace jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Others make the point that today's self-reliant women, with
incomes of their own, have forced men to shape up because career
women can afford to be alone rather than live with a Neanderthal.
(Cosmopolitan magazine recently ranked men's back hair as its
readers' No. 1 turnoff.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bliss Spa in downtown Manhattan, home of Macho Mondays, has
recently doubled in size, partly for its growing male clientele,
said Marcia Kilgore, the owner. Offered a plate of peanut butter
cookies (``Guys don't like rabbit food,'' a Bliss staff member
said), Allen Bernstein declined politely, explaining, ``I've got to
maintain my girlish figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlish'' is the last word one would use to describe
Bernstein. At 6 feet 4 inches and 230 pounds, he looks fearsome
enough to be the private detective that he is and to play one in
movies like ``Ransom'' with Mel Gibson and ``Kiss of Death'' with
Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rough on my body,'' Bernstein said, while a beautician
gave him a $125 oxygen facial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work crazy hours, run from beeper to beeper, am constantly
on airplanes. When I get back from a hard assignment all I want to
do is veg out, get a manicure, a pedicure and have my face done. I
consider it required maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a bruiser like Bernstein loll his way through a spa day
blurs masculine and feminine stereotypes, not unlike the bearded
woman in a circus sideshow. An example of a genus as yet unnamed _
the Homo narcissus? The Homo fix-him-upper? _ this emerging species
of male has advanced Darwin's theory from survival of the fittest
to survival of the prettiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception among men that they are going to be judged, at
least initially, by their appearance is quite new,'' said Dr. James
Perlotto, a family physician in New Haven, who is also a professor
of medicine at Yale Medical School. ``In the baby boomer
generation, among men in their 30s, 40s, 50s, it often creates a
unique fear of aging. Guys in their teens and 20s, on the other
hand, put more value on the surface of things, how they dress, wear
their hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in thinking has produced insecurities in some men
about their appearance, suggesting that men are now internalizing
the same social message that women have suffered under for decades
_ their worth is based on their looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average guy is feeling an increasing pressure to be a
perfect manifestation of his gender,'' said Marie Sacco, a clinical
psychologist who works with people who have eating disorders at
Manhattan's Gracie Square Hospital. She estimates that one-quarter
to one-third of her clients are men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a healthy indulgence of oneself, be it going to the
gym or getting a facial,'' Sacco said. ``However, when someone
works out frantically because they feel inadequate, when people are
body dismorphic, that's another story. These men develop the
mistaken idea that if they had a perfect body, their lives would be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetuation of this belief may be traced to the ubiquity of
bulked, beautiful and unclothed men on magazine covers and in print
and television advertisements. ``Why do I think men are so
body-conscious?'' said Joan Kron, a beauty writer. ``If I had to
blame one thing, I'd say it was the Calvin Klein underwear ads.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In November, Viking will publish Ms. Kron's ``Lift: Wanting,
Fearing and Having a Face-Lift.'' ``Look what happened when
Sylvester Stallone, this icon of manliness, had his eyes done!''
she said. ``Guys now feel the same pressure to look young as women
do.'' The five top cosmetic procedures for men, starting with the
most popular, are hair transplantation, nose reshaping,
liposuction, chemical peels and collagen injections, according to
the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. With a growing
niche of male clients, Dr. Alan Matarasso has even equipped his
office on Park Avenue and 84th Street with a separate entrance for
men to insure their privacy. ``Men want to reconcile how they feel
with how they look,'' said Matarasso, who estimated that 25 percent
of his patients are men, up from 5 percent a decade ago. ``What we
do in plastic surgery you can't achieve alone. Even if you go to
the gym, you can't take the bump out of your nose, get rid of a
turkey neck or that droop in your eyelid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's now a heightened awareness of what guys can do for
themselves, of intervention in general,'' Matarasso said. ``I mean,
did we have Men's Health 10 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the September issue, now on the stands, marks the 10th
anniversary of Men's Health magazine (whose average reader,
according to MRI Research, is 35 and college educated). That its
circulation has soared from 100,000 in 1988 to 1.6 million today is
widely seen as reflecting and racheting up the American male's
growing insecurity about his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lafavore, the magazine's editor, bristles at the suggestion
that a Men's Health cover featuring an Adonis with bulging
pectorals and taut abdominal muscles might have any
anxiety-producing effect on the male ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, our covers are an ideal, but I don't think men take them
seriously as an attainable goal,'' Lafavore said. ``Our readers
need to lose a few pounds and are trying hard. Being perfect is far
from their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlotto of Yale Medical School finds that men are extremely
susceptible to criticism of their physique, especially when it's an
offhand remark from another man. Consider the experience of a
50-year-old New Jersey man. ``Eight months ago, I was in Hawaii,
and some guy I'd just met said, `You're such a handsome man, but
your eyelids are so heavy,' '' he recalled. ``My wife was there,
his wife was there, we were talking about general things.
Immediately after he said this to me, my eyes felt heavy. I went to
the mirror that night, and decided right on the spot to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some men are prone to such impulsiveness,
Matarasso, the plastic surgeon, felt compelled to institute a
two-day cooling-off period for male clients who are itching to go
under the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the opposite approach, Rosenthal, the cosmetic dentist on
the Upper East Side, capitalizes on men's haste by promising
same-day service for his ``smile lift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are trying to get jobs, get women, get other men . . .
whatever,'' Rosenthal said. ``One of the first things that break
down as we get older is teeth. Cigars, coffee, drinking red wine,
all are the source of major discoloration. People are not only
living longer, but they are trying to keep a viable presence for
longer, and teeth were not designed to last this long.''
</P>
<P>
   A photo album (helpfully emblazoned ``Dr. Rosenthal's Celebrity
Book'') prominently displayed in his offices across from the
Carlyle Hotel boasts pictures of clients like Frank Gifford,
Michael Bolton and Donald Trump. The implication is clear: why
wait? If you're in by 8:30 a.m., you can be fitted for custom
porcelain veneers and have a celebrity smile by cocktail hour.
</P>
<P>
   And as Matarasso's secret door suggests, they might not want to
be observed getting it _ a lesson not lost on Sephora, the large
French-owned cosmetics emporium, which opened last month in SoHo.
Men's fragrance and skin-care products stretch nearly the length of
one wall, all ``laid out alphabetically, without any counter in
front, since guys can be shy about asking for help,'' said Steve
Bock, executive vice president of merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Far from shy about anything related to personal beautification,
Evan Berenzweig, the gung-ho groomer in New Jersey, would enjoy
such unfettered access to the latest skin-care treatments, his wife
said. He is now busily passing along a lifetime of trade secrets to
his three growing sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Evan was young, he thought he had blackheads on his
nose,'' his wife said. Determined to spare their eldest son,
Addison, a similar fate, ``Evan's already prepping him,'' she said,
adding: ``He bought Addison cleansing pads and showed him how to
use them. Sometimes, they go together to get facials.''
</P>
<P>
   How old is Addison?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 12,'' Mrs. Berenzweig said, with a mother's pride. ``And,
he's very good looking.''  &QL;

cost the economy almost 160,000 jobs in July. The jobless rate in

 &HT;    PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOUSE SPEAKER GINGRICH
 &HT;    With GINGRICH.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a remarkable week in Congress. A House
committee recommended that that House cite Attorney General Janet
Reno in contempt of Congress. A former White House intern told a
federal grand jury about sexual liaisons with the president.
Despite Republican leadership opposition, the House passed a bill
to overhaul the way money is raised in campaigns. And bombs burst
in two U.S. embassies. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sat down
with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution to address the week's
activities before departing for Ireland. Below is a partial
transcript:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yesterday, a house panel found the Attorney General Janet
Reno in contempt of Congress. What do you think about that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the attorney general now has until we return in
September to either A, appoint an independent counsel as the FBI
director and her own senior lawyer have recommended, or B, turn
over to the House the documents which prove and explain why her
legal advisers believe there should be an independent counsel. ...
I think we have now served notice ...that we are tired of being
stonewalled by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Monica Lewinsky (reportedly) said yesterday that she had
several sexual liaisons with the president. You have said in the
past, that if the president has obstructed justice ...he should be
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's draw the distinction between whatever the rumors are
and what the principles are. ...First, no one is above the law. If
a crime, notice not a scandal, but if a crime has been committed,
the American people have the right to know. And third, the
president, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United
States, has an absolute duty, as does his staff, to cooperate with
a legitimate executive branch investigator. ...(But) until we get
the Starr report, until Henry Hyde and the Judiciary Committee have
a chance to to review it, we don't know anything. And so there is
more than enough gossip on television without us.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you like to see hearings as soon as possible?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it's very simple. If the report is overwhelming,
people will move in one direction. If the report is powerful, but
not overwhelming, people will move in another direction. Until we
see the report, any comment is prejudgment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the president has lied?
</P>
<P>
   A. What I personally think is irrelevant. I personally think we
should wait until we get the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have said in the past that you wanted anti-teen smoking
bill. Has that thought changed?
</P>
<P>
   A. When you only have an 11-vote margin, life stays permanently
interesting. Those members who represent tobacco-growing areas
legitimately want to vote no. I don't blame them. They are
representing their constituents. ...The Democrats have adopted a
deliberate strategy, which I think is understandable, but not very
helpful, where they want to stop anything because they would like
to claim that we are a do-nothing Congress. ...I am going to make
one more effort in September to see if we can find the votes to
pass an anti-teen smoking bill.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (Following public comments about the embassy bombings in
Africa,) what are you thinking about right now?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm an Army brat. My first reaction is always personal. It
reminds me of ... being in Europe as a child when we'd go on alert
in order to avoid theoretical Russian attacks. We lived with a
footlocker for three years so we could go to Switzerland if the war
started.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it slightly surreal to go from partisan squabbling to
bonding with the president over national security?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a natural constitutional tension between the
Congress and the president. ... And it has been this way since 1789
with George Washington. And so, what makes this a remarkable system
is we take the most human of behaviors on the one hand, and we are
able somehow to rise above them to create this most idealistic of
self-governing systems on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you most proud of? What do you look at as your best
accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have profoundly begun to move the agenda and language of
this country _welfare is the best example, balanced budget is the
second _ from the assumptions of the liberal welfare state to an
opportunity society that is very different. ...It will be more
obvious three years from now. 2001 will be the period when we
really get the real payoff. All this is an investment for when we
have a Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will you be that president?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. You can never tell. This is a strange
country. Never thought I'd be speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On campaign finance and what happened this week, were you
disappointed that Republicans broke with you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Republicans and Democrats alike voted for a bill that's
essentially hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is it hopeless?
</P>
<P>
   A. The bill is basically deluded about the nature of the
information age. It is expensive to reach people. It's getting more
expensive to reach people in the information age. ...Wisconsin has
very strict reform laws, which they have now found every possible
loophole in an attempt to get around. What you do is you make
politics more convoluted and more Byzantine and less honest and
less open.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Fact that you had members go over ... was that an act of
defiance?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the case of some members, they really believed it. In the
case of other members, they decided it was a politically expedient
vote. ...I lose less than 10 percent of the votes that matter in
this House with the narrowest majority since 1954.

 &HT;    GINGRICH BACKS PRESIDENT ON TERRORISM, ATTACKS HIM ON ETHICS
 &HT;    With GINGRICH-TRANSCRIPT
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN and REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of an eventful week in Washington, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich on Friday in one breath expressed solidarity
with President Clinton in condemning ghastly terrorist attacks and,
in another, ruminated about his possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a week in which Attorney General Janet Reno was under the
threat of being held in contempt of Congress, a former White House
intern reportedly told a grand jury that she had an affair with the
president and bombs ripped apart two U.S. embassies, the Georgia
Republican covered a range of issues in an interview squeezed in
around public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing whether the House Judiciary Committee would hold
impeachment hearings before the fall elections, Gingrich said it
depended upon the strength of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the report is overwhelming, people will move in one
direction. If the report is powerful, but not overwhelming, people
will move in another direction,'' Gingrich said. ``Until we see the
report, any comment is prejudgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker made clear his annoyance with, in his view, the
continuing reluctance and outright refusal by Clinton and his
administration to cooperate with Starr and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``To invoke totally phony and repudiated claims of privilege is,
I think, very distressing and a failure to do his job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, addressing reporters about bombings at the U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, Gingrich said no one should mistake ``family
arguments'' between Democrats and Republicans for U.S. weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are challenged, we unite as one country without any
questions,'' the speaker said, a few hours before he led a
congressional delegation on a weeklong trip to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The House left town for its summer vacation without tackling
nettlesome legislative issues such as a tobacco bill, and without
an agreement on how to go about cutting taxes, which the speaker
intends to make the centerpiece of the GOP's re-election campaign.
No more than two dozen work days remain before Congress hopes to
adjourn in early October.
</P>
<P>
   On passing a bill aimed at cutting down on the number of
teenagers who smoke, Gingrich said he planned to push for a bill
when Congress reconvenes after Labor Day. His biggest obstacle, he
said, is persuading Republicans from tobacco-growing states to
support any tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying right now to figure out how to get the votes to do
that,'' Gingrich said. ``When you only have an 11-vote margin, life
stays permanently interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the criticism that the GOP has been more interested
in attacking Democrats and holding onto their majority than passing
key public policy initiatives, Gingrich tried to turn the tables on
his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, he said, only want a tobacco bill that generates
taxes for new social programs. Failing that, they would prefer
using tobacco as a campaign issue rather than compromising on
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who used to serve in the minority in the Congress
with a Republican president, I know exactly the pain that they are
living through,'' he said. ``The conceptual challenge of the
Democratic Party today is that its ideology is obsolete and its
interest groups refuse to allow it to rethink what it's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But just this week, Gingrich faced a major disappointment when
61 members of his party defied the GOP leadership and supported a
bill that would ban unlimited, unregulated donations to political
parties known as soft money and regulate campaign advertising by
third parties.
</P>
<P>
   But addressing the uphill fight it faces in the Senate, where
Majority Leader Trent Lott killed a similar bill this year,
Gingrich called the legislation ``hopeless.''

`SUNSET BEACH' SHAKES AND RATTLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; George Becket's orders were clear and concise:
Create a major earthquake that will cause mayhem and trap people in
life-threatening situations. Devise a resulting tsunami that
overturns a cruise ship packed with beautiful people. And build the
interior of a ``Poseidon''-like capsized ship, from which the
panicked people must try to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Piece of cake, said Becket, a West Hills resident and production
director for the NBC soap opera ``Sunset Beach'' (2 p.m. weekdays,
Channel 4), who for the past month has organized the on-screen
disaster in pursuit of new summer viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The story line, which the ``SB'' powers that be have dubbed
``Shock Wave,'' is the show's answer to strong network hints that
one of NBC's daytime dramas will likely have to ride off into
cancellation sunset to make way for a new series under development
_ unless the ratings begin to climb substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that possibility, executive producer Gary Tomlin came
up with daytime's ultimate disaster story line.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin, who shares executive-producer credits with TV icon Aaron
Spelling, hopes the doom-and-disaster story line _ which airs into
mid-August and sends other story-line complexities spinning for
months more _ will pump up the popularity of the 18-month-old soap.
``SB'' consistently ranks No. 11 among the 11 daytime soaps, with
about 1.8 million viewers daily _ most of them females age 12 to
34.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't even know we're on the air,'' said
co-head writer Christopher Whitesell, who with Meg Bennett penned
the disaster epic. ``You need something to make 'em stand up and
take notice. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's working. Even before the disaster-at-sea scenes
began airing July 31, the earthquake sequences had grabbed an
additional 300,000 viewers nationwide, giving ``SB'' its highest
ratings yet, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin said he had originally planned to hit the fictional town
of Sunset Beach, Calif., with an earthquake, and envisioned sending
the soap's younger cast members off on a charity cruise as a
lighter counterpoint to the disaster story line. Then somebody said
``tsunami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to pull out all the stops and do both,'' Tomlin
said. ``The network said, `Can you really do that?' And I said,
`Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was bluffing ... just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came up with this idea, I never thought we'd be able to
execute it,'' Tomlin admits.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Becket _ a veteran of action movies and the TV show
``JAG'' came in. While the earthquake scenes involved mostly
falling objects, falling-apart sets and trapped people, making a
few sections of scenery in a tank of water look like a capsized
cruise ship was more difficult. Construction, lighting and
sound-effects crews under Becket's direction had to manufacture
explosions, steam and the force of rushing water strong enough to
knock actors off their feet, plus build interior sections of a
luxury cruise liner twice _ once right-side up and once
upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't very difficult,'' Becket said modestly. ``I
told them it would be no problem. There's nothing new. It's all
been done before. Just not on a soap.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing seen on film recently was 1997's Oscar winner
for Best Picture, ``Titanic,'' which took more than a year to
produce and film at an estimated cost of $200 million. ``SB'' is
admittedly no ``Titanic,'' but its summer story line has many of
the same elements going for it: on-screen death and destruction,
treachery and betrayal, heroics, peril at sea, young love fighting
life's odds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters is even eaten alive on screen by a shark
(OK, it's animatronic) _ and ``Titanic'' didn't have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took us 28 days to do it all,'' said Becket, who
worked with actors, directors, special-effects and stunt people,
wardrobe, makeup, construction and lighting people to pull the
whole thing together. ``We filmed 40 to 48 scenes a day, 12-hour
days, to get 48 minutes on air a day _ not the minute or two of
film you'd get if you were working on a feature film.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will say how much executing the ambitious story line
cost, but Becket says the additional cost _ paid by ``SB'' creator
Spelling and the network _ is ``many, many, many'' times the cost
of the soap's usual episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The action began in the closing seconds of the show's July 17
episode, when _ with a special attachment shaking cameras and
specially built sets destructing _ a major earthquake hit Sunset
Beach. When the show opened July 20, viewers saw characters trapped
under rubble in a mansion, in a hospital, at a construction site.
And, soaps being what they are, everybody seemed to be trapped with
somebody they hate.
</P>
<P>
   Then a second quake hit, sending ceilings splitting, trees
falling, floors breaking open and characters screaming as they were
buried under a new wave of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The two quakes buried Lesley-Anne Down, who plays doyenne Olivia
Richards, beneath pieces of walls and shards of timber in the foyer
of her character's mansion. But, with kneepads under her costume to
make the hard floor not quite so hard, Down showed how the crew had
actually made her a little cave that she could wiggle in and out
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have 100 percent confidence in any stunt,'' Down said,
examining her unpadded, scraped elbows and fluffing plaster dust
out of her eyelashes. Her hair was grimy with dust and debris, her
makeup smudged with ``blood'' and dirt. ``But you have to go into
it thinking that (safety) people are totally trustworthy and are
going to protect you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, gazing into the mansion's wrecked foyer as a
prop chandelier was dropped onto her stunt double, ``I'm glad I'm
not involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors in the cruise-ship scenes spent their days soaked to the
skin in a 30-foot-diameter tank into which a dozen or more
upside-down sets were lowered for different scenes. Actors got
safety instructions for the underwater scenes, and a safety
coordinator and a half-dozen divers hovered just out of camera
range ready to lend a hand if something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Bernie Kopell, who played Doc on Spelling's '70s TV hit
``The Love Boat,'' plays the captain of the SS Neptune, the cruise
ship that capsizes, but he is seen only briefly. Capt. Nelson is on
the bridge when the tidal wave hits and, like the captain of the
Titanic, he goes down with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young actors had a ball splashing around in between
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to do stunts like this,'' Randy Spelling, who plays
heartthrob Sean Richards, said as he treaded 85-degree water in the
1,000-gallon tank. He was waiting to have another go at a
minutelong scene in which he and Christi Ellen Harris, who plays
ingenue Emily Davis, dove underwater, swam through an air shaft and
emerged in another, drier part of what on screen appears to be a
full-size, submerged ship.
</P>
<P>
   The two weren't dressed for swimming: Spelling was wearing a
tuxedo minus the jacket, and Harris wore an evening gown, garnet
necklace and earrings _ and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the ballroom on the boat, arguing, dancing,
whatever, and then all of a sudden, the boat flips over,'' Spelling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were flying and falling,'' said Harris. ``We got to
fall down an 80-degree-incline wall into the water. It was so
exciting, so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And from then on, everything was upside down,'' Spelling said.
``It was real disorienting.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SIGNS BILL TO SHIFT JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS TO STATES
 &HT;    By SHANNON JOYCE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed a major overhaul of the
nation's job training programs into law Friday, giving states,
local governments and individuals the ability to tailor training
programs to fit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we celebrate a big step forward in making sure every
adult can keep on learning for a lifetime,'' Clinton said at a
White House Rose Garden ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Workforce Investment Act of 1998, sponsored by Sen. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, will consolidate job training resources, link and
monitor training programs, and make one-stop job centers the
gateway to training.
</P>
<P>
   ``To invest in our people, we have to give all of our people
access to world-class education and training,'' Clinton said. ``We
have to do more than we are already doing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine has called the bill a necessary companion to the 1996
welfare reform, giving welfare recipients the training they need to
find good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, everyone must be given the competitive skills that
are necessary to prosper in the new global economy,'' DeWine said
at the ceremony. ``This is the crucial second stage of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, communities and local businesses will
develop a three-year job training strategy. Local governments have
the freedom to pick programs that train workers for jobs in local
industries and businesses, and use local resources, such as a
community college or vocational school, to provide the training.
</P>
<P>
   Once the state governor reviews the plan, it will be sent to the
U.S. secretary of labor for final approval. States will receive a
block grant to pay for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the new process ``a model of what we should be
doing.'' In addition to allowing communities to choose what is best
for their local economy, the new law lets workers decide which
training program they want to use.
</P>
<P>
   Programs will now have to be accredited by the U.S. Labor
Department, and allow prospective students access to statistics
showing how many of the program's graduates have jobs and how much
they earn.
</P>
<P>
   Job training programs will be linked with courses that provide
training for people with disabilities, allowing students to
transfer between the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each trainee will have an individual training account to use for
training programs. After the trainee and a job counselor decide on
a training program, the trainee will receive a voucher to pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The new voucher system would replace the old practice of states
and counties buying slots in training programs and then finding
students to fill them, a move DeWine says will eliminate pushing
people into training programs they may not want to use.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will also boost Job Corps, a job training program
for youth, and give financially depressed areas more money for
youth training.
</P>
<P>
   Job Corps students will be sent to the center closest to their
homes and monitored six and 12 months after they graduate from the
program.
</P>
<P>
   High-poverty areas designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise
Communities will be eligible for $1.25 billion in grant money for
youth programs. Included in that grant program is $250 million to
help the children of migrant workers.

WORD FROM BOEING DUE NEXT WEEK ON 737 PLANS  
 ATTN: WICHITA, ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. plans to announce next week whether it will
establish a next-generation 737 production line at its under-used
factory in Long Beach, Calif., and several people familiar with the
plans said Thursday it is all but certain the work will be done
there.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report recommending the new assembly operations in
California has been prepared but has not been given the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute issues are still being worked out, including
negotiations with leaders of Boeing's largest union, which strongly
opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   California government officials ``have bent over backwards'' to
provide Boeing with economic incentives to add a 737 assembly line
at Long Beach, The Post-Intelligencer was told.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing senior vice president Fred Mitchell warned a team of
managers working on the 737 study Thursday to disregard ``media
speculation'' and emphasized ``we have not yet completed our
business case and we have not yet made a decision on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president for
airplane production, wrote: ``We are still testing logistics,
working with the unions who represent employees in the Puget Sound
and Long Beach areas, and working with government officials as part
of our study. Those open items are complex, and we have to work
through them before the business case, either way, is confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 737 study will be completed and a decision announced
within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the plans said the company is scheduled
to announce next Thursday its decision to set up the Long Beach
line. In addition, the company will announce a consolidation of
facilities - primarily defense and space - throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days Boeing will truck 737 wings from its
Renton factory to Long Beach to determine how costly the trip would
be, how long the journey would take and to pinpoint the best route.
</P>
<P>
   The company conducted a similar experiment a few weeks ago, when
it sent by train a mock-up fuselage of its longest 737 aircraft
from its Wichita, Kan., factory to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already makes fuselages in Wichita and ships them to
Renton for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is preparing a production bay in Long Beach
previously used to build McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets to
accommodate assembly of next-generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-ton crane is being installed to help move 737 aircraft
assemblies, and a three-story mezzanine structure is being built in
the the assembly area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are setting up an assembly line that will be identical to
the Renton 737 assembly line,'' said Boeing spokesman John Thom in
Long Beach. ``It's prudent to be ready for a 737 line but
everything is contingent upon a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 737 assembly operations could begin in California as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in May that it is sending some 737-model
aircraft to its Douglas Products Division for finishing work to
ease its overburdened Renton aircraft factory.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that the Long Beach plant ``can provide
some relief, because we don't have enough people or space for all
the work'' in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-based union has argued that establishing an
assembly line in California would be the equivalent of
subcontracting work to non-Machinist members.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, was not available for comment Thursday but a union
spokesman said talks with the company are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting between the union and Boeing officials is set
for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If a 737 assembly line were established in California, it would
focus on final assembly of airplanes such as the Boeing Business
Jet and the cargo version of the jet, which have significantly
different configurations from the next-generation 737s ordered by
airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing would consider doing assembly work on the
737-900 model in Long Beach and possibly other versions of the
next-generation airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, Boeing officials have said the
Renton factory will still be used as the primary final assembly
location for 737 and 757 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If the company goes ahead with a new production line in Long
Beach, it would be the first time Boeing has established commercial
aircraft final-assembly operations outside the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the Long Beach factory when it acquired
McDonnell Douglas last year.
</P>
<P>
   California politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, have been
lobbying hard for Boeing to save aerospace jobs in that state after
the company announced earlier this year that it would consolidate
its space operations in Southern California and end production of
three McDonnell Douglas jets now made at the Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 Boeing jobs in Southern California could be lost
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The California Trade and Commerce Agency has been quietly
working behind the scenes with Boeing on a multimillion-dollar
package of economic incentives to encourage the Seattle-based
aerospace giant to permanently shift some 737 work from Renton to
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency declined to discuss details of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city, Boeing and the
state are still discussing the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find every incentive we are qualified for to
make sure we have a package they (Boeing) like. But it's still be
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not comment on details of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach plant is located in one of the state's so-called
``enterprise zones,'' and Boeing would be eligible for significant
tax breaks if it established a new assembly line there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, our enterprise zone program is one of our most
powerful economic tools,'' said Jerry Miller, deputy city manager
in Long Beach who until recently headed the city's Economic
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been part of the on-going discussions between Boeing
and the state over the package of economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at liberty to say much about the package,'' he said
Thursday. ``It's fair to say, though, that Long Beach has been very
much involved, as has the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic incentive package would be in addition to the tax
breaks now available to Boeing in the enterprise zone. Boeing is
the largest of some 10,000 companies located within the zone. They
are all eligible for state tax credits on purchases of eligible
manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing can get a state tax credit on 100 percent of
the 8.5 percent California sales tax paid on up to $20 million of
the eligible manufacturing equipment purchased each year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it could cost Boeing as much as $1 billion in
tooling to start a 737 production line in Long Beach. Boeing has
refused to say what those tooling costs might be.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also gets a tax credit in the enterprise zone of $26,910
over a five-year period for every new worker its hires at its Long
Beach plant. The workers must be full-time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many workers would be needed for the 737 work
in Long Beach, but Boeing spokesman Thom estimated 400 to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrick Legg, president of the local unit of the United
Aerospace Workers, said be believes a new 737 line would save most
of the union jobs Boeing plans to eliminate.

NEW VOLVO S80 COMBINES LUXURY AND SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget ``boxy,'' put ``utilitarian'' and ``practical'' out of
your mind and get ready to change almost all your perceptions about
the venerable Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan,
the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Due in dealer showrooms as early as mid-September, this new
front-drive, full-size sedan will a) alienate some Volvo diehards
who think boxy is just the thing, and b) draw a whole lot of new
buyers into the Volvo fold, people who just couldn't bear to buy
the type of car associated with middle-age mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The S80, with a price range of $40,000 to $43,000, will be the
most expensive production Volvo ever. But anyone who drives the
vehicle will immediately put it in the same class as European
luxury cars such as the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class and the
Audi A6.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has gone upscale with this car, and you can bet it will be
a force in the marketplace even against such heady competition.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy. Take Volvo's long-standing reputation for safety,
quality and longevity, add a full measure of luxury, and you've got
a package that the consumer in the $40,000-sedan class has been
yearning for.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, which has always been Volvo's primary focus, takes no
back seat in the new S80. This car is, without a doubt, the safest
Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized
stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new
seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end
crashes, and the ``inflatable curtain,'' Volvo's version of the
side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the
event of a T-bone collision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volvo will offer the S80 with seven different engines,
including two inline six-cylinders and five five-cylinders, only
the six-cylinders will be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line engine will be the T6, a 2.8-liter, inline
six-cylinder with double turbochargers, rated at a whopping 272
horsepower. This engine's power is on par with that of 4-liter V-8s
in competitive makes and Volvo will also sell the vehicle with a
five-speed manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   A General Motors four-speed automatic is standard for Volvos
with six-cylinder engines, and will be the one most buyers choose.
It is so smooth-shifting that it's virtually seamless.
</P>
<P>
   The second engine destined for the U.S. market will be a
normally aspirated (non-turbo) 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder rated
at 204 horsepower. This engine is expected to be the biggest
seller; from my experience, this has all the power most buyers will
ever need.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost as much as the
driver enjoys driving it. It's smooth and cushy but with enough
road feel left to give the driver some fun on curves and turns. The
rear seat is roomy enough for three adults to ride comfortably,
even on long trips, and the front bucket seats are so comfy you may
want to order a couple for your living room.
</P>
<P>
   The S80's distinct, modern design copies no other vehicle, yet
it looks as contemporary as any of its competition from Europe or
Japan. The design is the product of Volvo's California studio, led
by U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the S80 is under way at Volvo's plant in
Gothenburg, Sweden. The official on-sale date is Oct. 12, but
dealers are taking orders, Volvo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future _ the company's
first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the
traditional Volvo safety and durability _ that about 25,000 dealers
and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the
Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn
about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FORD MINI-SUV: Ford plans to introduce an all-new compact
sport-utility vehicle for model year 2001 that will compete against
the Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than the midsize Explorer, the new model will be built
in Claycomo, Mo., where Ford makes Contour and Mercury Mystique
compact sedans. Production of those slow-selling vehicles _ if they
are still on the market by then _ will be transferred to Mexico,
the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Japanese partner Mazda will sell its own version of the
new sport-utility, the first SUV model shared with Ford since the
Mazda Navajo, a two-door version of the Explorer, was discontinued
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE: 1999 Volvo S80 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, inline
six-cylinder- powered, front-drive sedan, an all-new vehicle that

</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Outstanding safety, quality and Volvo dependability
in a design that breaks the boxy Volvo mold; high-performance
turbocharged engine is optional; excellent ride and handling; roomy
interior; lots of convenience features.
</P>

competitors: BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class, Lexus GS 300,
Saab 9-5, Audi A- 6, Acura 3.5 TL.

   BOMBING-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton quickly
condemns fatal bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania as
terrorist acts and sends over medical aid. Federal investigators
and military support are also on the way from Washington and U.S.
bases in Germany. How will this affect security at U.S. embassies
around the world? What terrorist groups are being mentioned as
responsible? Wrapping up the developments from Washington. (Deans,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ The fatal bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are another sign that the United
States has to be ready to both reap the benefits as well as suffer
the consequences of being the world's last remaining superpower.
Namely, if you're going to make a statement, then do it by taking
on the biggest kid on the block. Moreover, the presence of U.S.
facilities around the world that are ``public'' buildings _ such as
the embassies _ makes for numerous vulnerable targets. (Glass, Cox
News Service). ETA: 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-SECURITY _ Security levels vary at U.S. embassies around
the world, depending on conditions in the countries. A look at
security at the two embassies hit by bombs Friday. (Martz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BOMBING-REACT _ ATLANTA _ For Emma Mwangi, a Kenyan who has been
visiting friends in Atlanta, news of blast at the U.S. embassy in
Nairobi came as a shock. Afterwards, she frantically tried to reach
her father, a businessman who works in the same block. (Kurylo,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-PRESIDENT _ MIAMI _ Spouting a message of peace, Andres
Pastrana takes office as Colombia's new president Friday in the
face of some of the worst political violence to hit this South
American country in years. A nationwide rebel offensive by Marxist
rebels has killed more than 130 people this week. In the most
devastating action, rebels overran an important southern
anti-narcotics base, killing or dragging away dozens of soldiers
and police as possible bargaining chips. (Emling, Cox News
Service). ETA: 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-BANKBAILOUT _ MEXICO CITY _ Angry opponents have strapped
themselves to crosses to symbolize the ``crucifixion'' of Mexico's
poor. Headlines scream allegations that the rich are, once again,
getting a free break thanks to pals in the government. The dispute
is over a $65 billion bank bail out stemming from Mexico's 1994
economic crisis. What's different now is that Mexico has a stubborn
opposition Congress that isn't ready to rubber stamp a Zedillo
Administration request to publicly absorb the debt, which is 14
percent of Mexico's GDP. Earlier this week, in defiance of Mexico's
bank secrecy laws, the country's left-center opposition released a
list of names of bank debtors that include some of Mexico's
wealthiest. Also on the list are suspected white-collar thieves who
abused the bail out, and, opponents say, big-time campaign finance
supporters of the country's ruling party. Arguing that most debtors
are actually Mexicans of modest means is Treasury Secretary Jose
Angel Gurria, who briefed foreign reporters this week and is in
charge of negotiating with Mexico's now vigorous opposition.

   CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for feverish
speculation about the health of aging Cuban President Fidel Castro,
who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no exception. Just a
few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector living in Costa Rica
claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain disorder. There was
a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last summer, some even
announcing Castro's death. But, if anything, Castro appears more
robust than ever. He appears to be traveling more these days than
at any time in his 39 years in power. He continues his commitment
to communism, even as he's been striking a conciliatory tone
towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-ISRAEL _ JERUSALEM _ Go to the movies, and guards will
check your hand bag for bombs and ask if you have any weapons.
Leave a shopping bag unattended, and it could be blown up by the
``Sappers'' who patrol city streets in their high-tech vans. After
a while, you get so used to it and nearly forget about the
counter-terrorism security measures in every day Israel that would
be considered intrusive in the United States. (Kaplow, Cox News

   JOURNAL-BRITAIN _ WEST HORSLEY, England _ In late June, I stood
on the front porch of my mom and dad's place an hour south of
Dallas and marveled at the old plastic thermometer. It reported the
temperature to be 112 degrees. So imagine the relief of arriving to
this place, where a cool spell is caressing an already mild
climate. The grass is thick, soft and green. My apple trees are
heavy with fruit and the berries are making the birds crazy.

   DEWINE _ Good week for U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio: President
Clinton signs his major job-training bill today, and a bill he
sponsored with Pat Moynihan that would force the U.S. to release
all files on Nazi war criminals is on its way to Clinton for
signing. DeWine hopes this bill would spur other countries to do
the same. (Joyce/Montgomery, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LAWYERS _ WASHINGTON _ With his battery of in-house
lawyers all but sidelined in the most critical legal challenge of
his career, President Clinton is relying on three private attorneys
skillful in the ways of politics and scandal to prep him for grand
jury questioning _ and possibly save his presidency. The three _
David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and former cabinet member Mickey
Kantor _ bring an imposing set of instincts, skills and experience
to the field. But the key to their performance could be how well
they do at the daunting task of ferreting out exactly what Monica
Lewinsky and dozens of other witnesses have already told the grand
jurors behind closed doors and what independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has learned from his six-month probe. (Deans, Cox News
Service 900).

<P>
   DECADE _ WASHINGTON _ Let's take a stroll through the graveyard
of decades. There's the gaudy 1920s marker, with its epitaph of
``Roaring.'' Keep on marching past the ``swinging'' '60s headstone
and the human-shaped ``Me Decade'' of the '70s. The monstrous
tombstone for the '80s can't be missed _ it denotes the ``Greed
Decade.'' But now is a particularly grave time in pop culture land.
Just 17 months shy of 2000, there's no consensus among trend

   MIAMI-POLITICS _ Miami's long-running saga of political scandal
is under the spotlight again as ex-City Commissioner Humberto
Hernandez goes on trial for vote fraud stemming from last fall's
tainted city elections. The charismatic Cuban politician seems to
sum up what many feel is the heart of the city's problems: a
byzantine system built on cronyism and corruption, centered around
the unquestionable clout of the Cuban community. American-born but
the son of a Bay of Pigs veteran, Hernandez has repeatedly thumbed
his nose at prosecutors and media critics, claiming his unstoppable
Latin power base will protect him. (Williams, Atlanta

IN MEMORY OF A MAN YOU NEVER MET

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The pallbearers rolled the deep blue casket in slowly.
Every sniffle in the Lincoln Ward building, every sob, was muted by
the sound of one softly squeaking wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Allred's survivors followed a step behind, shuffling two
abreast, holding hands, wringing tissues. They passed by so
closely, you could breathe in the women's perfume, hear the
slap-slap of a little boy's new black shoes. Allred's wife, his
seven sons and daughters, took their seats in the center pews.
</P>
<P>
   The organ music quit. Every sound on Earth seemed to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Allred died at age 38 Monday morning, an hour before
sunrise. He was headed south on the Loop 101, approaching the
Southern Avenue overpass. His Ford van swerved hard left; he hit
the concrete median at freeway speed.
</P>
<P>
   Police, kin, friends all share the same theory as to the
accident's cause: Allred, they agree, fell asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   To all who knew him, this does not surprise. At 4:30 a.m., the
Scoutmaster and Sunday school teacher died delivering the
``Tribune`` newspaper. Just one job out of Allred's four.
</P>
<P>
   Accountant in the family firm and for a cousin's construction
business. Distributor of spray vitamins. Paper carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't like delivering the newspaper,'' said Steve's
uncle, CharlesAllred, during the eulogy. ``He liked driving around
in the quiet of the morning. He liked watching the sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   There, seated in a metal folding chair, in a hushed room washed
by a jelly of light, you can identify totally with a man you never
once met.
</P>
<P>
   In part at least, Steve Allred wanted to get away from the gray
noise.
</P>
<P>
   It surrounds us, this constant buzz. Clinton and Lewinsky. Road
rage. The NBA lockout. MTV. Talk radio. Whitewater. White House.
White vs. Black.
</P>
<P>
   The gray noise never relents, only distracts. The gray noise
comes with its own gravity, a powerful grip. But, on this day, it
can't reach this room full of those who loved Steve Allred.
</P>
<P>
   Their remembrances revolve around the same adjectives:
Hard-working, honest, soft-spoken, stoic, protective, private.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Roberts, Steve's little sister, a small woman in a pink
dress, recalled a brother who would take her along on his dates, to
Big Surf and Sonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve said he was a simple person. But sometimes he was the
most complicated man I ever knew, especially when it came to
reading his mind. You never knew what he was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   His Uncle Carl spoke of Steve the boy, ordered to go outside and
play: ``He looked at his mother and said, `Then you'll be all
alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not as alone as the two teenagers from his first marriage, Chad
and Lindsey. And not as alone as his wife of 13 years, Elizabeth,
left to mother five kids without the benefit of a life insurance
payoff _ her husband had none.
</P>
<P>
   She purses her lips at the thought of the future, manages the
hint of a smile. She is an Allred; no complaining allowed. Instead,
conversation moves back to Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I'd just have to say, `Go to bed, it's 9
o'clock.' He had to wake up so early for the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth glances down at Connor, the five-month-old asleep in
her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kind of did it,'' says the new widow of her husband.
``He just did it, never complaining.''
</P>
<P>

OBUCHI PROPOSES TAX CUTS TO SPUR JAPAN'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In his first major policy speech since taking over as
prime minister a week ago, Keizo Obuchi on Friday proposed cuts in
individual and corporate taxes, steps toward deregulating the
economy, cuts in government spending and new public spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am determined to make my utmost effort, at the risk of the
Cabinet's life, to bring the Japanese economy to a recovery path
within a year or two,'' he told Parliament, alluding to newspaper
reports that have described his Cabinet as standing on the edge of
a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   While he spoke forcefully, though, he was mainly just trying to
speed up changes his predecessors had been proposing for some time;
he offered little in the way of shock therapy for Japan's ailing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi plans to serve up a quick cocktail of tax cuts and public
spending to spur the economy. For the long term, his menu is far
less detailed, though he did reiterate an often-heard bias for
Western methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using as a guide the process by which the United States and
some European countries have rebuilt their economies since the
1980s,'' he said, ``I will promote measures for deregulation,
administrative reform, privatization of the public sector and
tax-system reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi may not have much time. ``It seems he wants to engineer a
soft landing of the Japanese economy,'' said Heizo Takenaka, a
professor at Keio University, ``and the basic question is: Is that
possible? I personally feel that some kind of shock therapy is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   It may well be. When Obuchi took office, the unemployment rate
had just hit yet another high, domestic auto sales were down for
the 16th straight month and the yen had sunk against the dollar.
Manufacturers are cutting production, and even in the midst of
sweltering heat, air conditioner sales are off.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was most specific about taxes. He promised 6 trillion
yen, or roughly $41 billion, in overall tax cuts next year,
effectively making permanent the 4 trillion yen in temporary cuts
that his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, extended this year.
</P>
<P>
   The individual tax cut is less generous than it seems, since
Hashimoto had already promised an additional 2 trillion yen in
temporary cuts, and those will be superseded.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi pledged to lower the maximum combined local and national
income-tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent, the first step
toward what he hopes will be a comprehensive overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would lower the corporate tax rate to 40 percent
from 46.3 percent starting in April, bringing it roughly in line
with Western levels.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have long criticized Japan's high taxes for
inhibiting entrepreneurs and forcing dynamic individuals to move to
other countries. ``I paid 200 million yen in taxes last year,''
Takuya Okada, chairman and chief executive of Jusco Ltd., one of
Japan's largest retailers, fumed recently.
</P>
<P>
   And the temporary cuts, which returned just 18,000 yen to him,
``did not really inspire me to spend,'' he said. ``Now, if they cut
my income tax to 50 percent, then I might think about spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Few economists, though, say a tax cut will put the economy on a
path to lasting recovery. ``Tax cuts are necessary because
bankruptcies are increasing and unemployment is spiraling up,''
said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders, but they are ``not
going to start a consumer-led recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   And corporate tax cuts will not necessarily stimulate capital
investment. Only 35 percent to 40 percent of Japanese corporations
pay taxes, and the low cost of capital _ companies can borrow at
around 1 percent _ offsets the tax burden for those companies doing
well enough to have to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While economists welcome a corporate cut, many say the tax
structure itself is in need of a fix. ``Companies now get tax
breaks for certain types of investment that made sense a long time
ago but, given changes in technology and the economy, now make no
sense,'' said Jeffrey Young, chief economist at Salomon Smith
Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   And voters want something that makes sense. The ruling Liberal
Democratic Party lost control of the Upper House of Parliament when
voters turned out in unexpected droves on June 12 to vent their
anger.
</P>
<P>
   That loss threatens to stall the passage of legislation to
revamp the debt-ridden banking system, and foreign investors will
continue to punish the stock market and the yen until they see
evidence of real change.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity ratings for Obuchi and his Cabinet are so low that
commentators see a bright side: They probably can't get any worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best we can hope for even in a year's time is that he can
stabilize the situation,'' Young said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though his words left lingering doubts about any eye-catching
banking overhaul, Obuchi was at his most eloquent when speaking
about the financial sector, likening it to the heart that is
responsible for circulating blood _ or, in this case, money _ to
the rest of the body, or society.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference after the speech, Akitaka Saiki, Obuchi's
deputy press secretary, was asked about whether the prime minister
would allow insolvent banks to fail. Foreign investors are all but
baying for a bank failure as a sign that the government is serious
about cleaning up the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to save bad banks,'' Saiki said. ``They need
to take responsibility for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi offered few specifics, but he did say he would try to
push through measures that would cut the government payroll by 20
percent over the next decade and cut government costs by 30
percent, both ideas that have been pushed for years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tax cuts, he plans to pay for them by issuing deficit
bonds, a financing technique all but prohibited by last year's
Fiscal Structural Reform Act. That law severely limited Hashimoto's
ability to maneuver when the economy started sliding toward
recession late last fall, and the prime minister said Friday that
he would submit legislation in the fall to suspend that law.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed a supplemental spending budget of 10 trillion
yen, or about $69 billion. That will come on top of a 16 trillion
yen package put together in the spring by Hashimoto, meaning that
Japan will spend more than 4 percent of its gross domestic product
this year trying to get its economy going again with public works
projects. ``This is an amazingly big set of packages by any
standards,'' Takenaka said.
</P>
<P>
   Saiki, the prime minister's spokesman, said Obuchi intends to
spend this money somewhat differently from the way such budgets
have been spent in the past, when they largely went to building
bridges, transportation facilities and roadways that kept the
politically loyal and labor-intensive construction industry afloat
when the bubble economy started losing air.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, he added, wants a bigger portion of the new supplemental
budget spent on ``industries of the future,'' like medicine and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Those industries are considered the best hope for putting a plug
in rising unemployment _ a source of continuing discomfort for
politicians, who consider it a ticking time bomb that could blast
them out of office.
</P>
<P>
   But economists see higher unemployment as painful but necessary,
for it means companies are trying to increase productivity and
profitability, which makes them more competitive globally.
</P>
<P>
   And even Saiki said that if deregulation proceeds, Japan may
face more unemployment in the short term. ``The structure of the
economy has to be changed,'' he said.

WORD FROM BOEING DUE NEXT WEEK ON 737 PLANS  
 ATTN: WICHITA, ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. plans to announce next week whether it will
establish a next-generation 737 production line at its under-used
factory in Long Beach, Calif., and several people familiar with the
plans said Thursday it is all but certain the work will be done
there.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report recommending the new assembly operations in
California has been prepared but has not been given the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute issues are still being worked out, including
negotiations with leaders of Boeing's largest union, which strongly
opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   California government officials ``have bent over backwards'' to
provide Boeing with economic incentives to add a 737 assembly line
at Long Beach, The Post-Intelligencer was told.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing senior vice president Fred Mitchell warned a team of
managers working on the 737 study Thursday to disregard ``media
speculation'' and emphasized ``we have not yet completed our
business case and we have not yet made a decision on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president for
airplane production, wrote: ``We are still testing logistics,
working with the unions who represent employees in the Puget Sound
and Long Beach areas, and working with government officials as part
of our study. Those open items are complex, and we have to work
through them before the business case, either way, is confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 737 study will be completed and a decision announced
within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the plans said the company is scheduled
to announce next Thursday its decision to set up the Long Beach
line. In addition, the company will announce a consolidation of
facilities - primarily defense and space - throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days Boeing will truck 737 wings from its
Renton factory to Long Beach to determine how costly the trip would
be, how long the journey would take and to pinpoint the best route.
</P>
<P>
   The company conducted a similar experiment a few weeks ago, when
it sent by train a mock-up fuselage of its longest 737 aircraft
from its Wichita, Kan., factory to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already makes fuselages in Wichita and ships them to
Renton for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is preparing a production bay in Long Beach
previously used to build McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets to
accommodate assembly of next-generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-ton crane is being installed to help move 737 aircraft
assemblies, and a three-story mezzanine structure is being built in
the the assembly area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are setting up an assembly line that will be identical to
the Renton 737 assembly line,'' said Boeing spokesman John Thom in
Long Beach. ``It's prudent to be ready for a 737 line but
everything is contingent upon a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 737 assembly operations could begin in California as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in May that it is sending some 737-model
aircraft to its Douglas Products Division for finishing work to
ease its overburdened Renton aircraft factory.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that the Long Beach plant ``can provide
some relief, because we don't have enough people or space for all
the work'' in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-based union has argued that establishing an
assembly line in California would be the equivalent of
subcontracting work to non-Machinist members.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, was not available for comment Thursday but a union
spokesman said talks with the company are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting between the union and Boeing officials is set
for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If a 737 assembly line were established in California, it would
focus on final assembly of airplanes such as the Boeing Business
Jet and the cargo version of the jet, which have significantly
different configurations from the next-generation 737s ordered by
airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing would consider doing assembly work on the
737-900 model in Long Beach and possibly other versions of the
next-generation airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, Boeing officials have said the
Renton factory will still be used as the primary final assembly
location for 737 and 757 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If the company goes ahead with a new production line in Long
Beach, it would be the first time Boeing has established commercial
aircraft final-assembly operations outside the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the Long Beach factory when it acquired
McDonnell Douglas last year.
</P>
<P>
   California politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, have been
lobbying hard for Boeing to save aerospace jobs in that state after
the company announced earlier this year that it would consolidate
its space operations in Southern California and end production of
three McDonnell Douglas jets now made at the Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 Boeing jobs in Southern California could be lost
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The California Trade and Commerce Agency has been quietly
working behind the scenes with Boeing on a multimillion-dollar
package of economic incentives to encourage the Seattle-based
aerospace giant to permanently shift some 737 work from Renton to
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency declined to discuss details of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city, Boeing and the
state are still discussing the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find every incentive we are qualified for to
make sure we have a package they (Boeing) like. But it's still be
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not comment on details of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach plant is located in one of the state's so-called
``enterprise zones,'' and Boeing would be eligible for significant
tax breaks if it established a new assembly line there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, our enterprise zone program is one of our most
powerful economic tools,'' said Jerry Miller, deputy city manager
in Long Beach who until recently headed the city's Economic
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been part of the on-going discussions between Boeing
and the state over the package of economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at liberty to say much about the package,'' he said
Thursday. ``It's fair to say, though, that Long Beach has been very
much involved, as has the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic incentive package would be in addition to the tax
breaks now available to Boeing in the enterprise zone. Boeing is
the largest of some 10,000 companies located within the zone. They
are all eligible for state tax credits on purchases of eligible
manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing can get a state tax credit on 100 percent of
the 8.5 percent California sales tax paid on up to $20 million of
the eligible manufacturing equipment purchased each year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it could cost Boeing as much as $1 billion in
tooling to start a 737 production line in Long Beach. Boeing has
refused to say what those tooling costs might be.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also gets a tax credit in the enterprise zone of $26,910
over a five-year period for every new worker its hires at its Long
Beach plant. The workers must be full-time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many workers would be needed for the 737 work
in Long Beach, but Boeing spokesman Thom estimated 400 to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrick Legg, president of the local unit of the United
Aerospace Workers, said be believes a new 737 line would save most
of the union jobs Boeing plans to eliminate.

   BELLSOUTH-STRIKE _ Advance on the BellSouth negotiations that
face a deadline of 11:59 Saturday. Progress is being made, but

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ When it was first announced we would

the opportunity, I have found them to be not only efficient, but
stress-reducing. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f. MOVED.

   TEST-DRIVE _ ATLANTA -- Less than 10 years after it was
introduced as a 1990 model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is
one of the vehicles reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors
carries out the talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are
four reasons it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best
buy'' and a car that ``does most things adequately, but
unexceptionally.'' (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) l, f.

FRANCE JOURNAL: A DISSIDENT IN THE `FREE' WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Communist bureaucracy made Alexander Ginzburg stateless
during the Cold War. French bureaucracy would have left him
stateless now if he had not raised his voice in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg knows something about protest. As a poet and outspoken
supporter of human rights in the Soviet Union, he was in prison for
much of the 1960s and 1970s. He was freed and flown to the United
States with four other imprisoned dissidents in 1979 in an exchange
for two convicted Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   The swap left him with freedom but ``indeterminate
nationality,'' as the French travel document he must use instead of
a passport describes it.
</P>
<P>
   Since he has lived and worked in France for most of the last two
decades, he finally applied for French citizenship three years ago.
But when the decision finally came, in a letter dated June 17, it
was, as he puts it, ``a resounding `nyet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand and speak French only indifferently and can
neither read nor write it,'' said the letter, signed by the
subdirector for naturalization in the Directorate of Population and
Migration of the Ministry of Employment and Solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   That title might have come from Gogol's satire on the Russian
bureaucracy, ``The government inspector,'' prominently displayed in
Ginzburg's library, but the subdirector's letter was no joke.
``Under these circumstances, you cannot be considered assimilated
into the French community,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginzburg, 62 and short of breath after a bout with cancer
that left him with only one lung, has not lost his combativeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact that I don't speak French well at all,'' he said,
in Russian, in his sixth-floor apartment near the Gare de Lyons.
``But it's also a fact that nobody ever gave me an examination that
would justify such a finding.''
</P>
<P>
   France, like the United States, prides itself on two centuries
of devotion to republican ideals of freedom, equality and human
rights. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, it gave shelter to
thousands of ``white Russian'' refugees who opposed the Bolsheviks.
Some survivors of that immigration still cannot speak fluent
French, but they hold French passports.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, though, and it is harder in these days of
double-digit unemployment rates and mass clandestine immigration to
qualify for naturalization in France or anywhere else in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So, as things stood in June, Ginzburg would not qualify, though
his wife, Irina, and their older son, Alexandre, 25, were granted
citizenship. Alexandre's younger brother, Alexis, 23, grew up in
Paris with him, but he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have in fact attracted the attention of the police, in
1995, for willful damage to private property (graffiti),'' the
letter to Alexis, also dated June 17, informed him. But it said he
could apply again for citizenship in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris is one of the world capitals of graffiti art,'' his
father said in exasperation. ``There are art galleries devoted to
it, and four art journals. There are exhibitions from time to time,
and the newspapers treat the artists as celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is offended when the newspapers write about him and
don't reproduce his art. He was painting on his own building when
the police came by, and all they did was ask him to show his papers
_ he never heard another word from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg came to France in 1980, after his release, to take a
job working for the European office of the AFL-CIO, so he could not
apply here for immigration status as a refugee. ``I came here from
New York City, so I wasn't fleeing persecution,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in France to work for a Russian emigre journal,
Russkaya Mysl, or Russian Thought, but he clashed with the editors,
he said, and was dismissed last year. His dismissal, he is
persuaded, was not unconnected to the refusal of his naturalization
request, since the editors are well connected to the French
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But so is Ginzburg, who says he has known President Jacques
Chirac for years. He proudly displayed an invitation to the July 14
Bastille Day garden party at Elysee Palace this year, though he was
not feeling well that day and did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   After news of his plight appeared in the daily Le Figaro and
other French newspapers, he received a handwritten note from the
culture minister, Catherine Trautmann, assuring him that his case
would be rapidly cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleague Martine Aubry,'' the minister of employment and
solidarity, Mrs. Trautmann wrote, ``is personally taking charge of
your difficulty, which we sincerely deplore.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ginzburg said, the police in the precinct where he
had applied for naturalization called and told his wife that he
would soon have his citizenship papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can finally get rid of this green snake,'' he said,
unfolding the accordion-like travel document. ``But they said they
knew nothing about Alexis' application. Me, an old man, they'll
accept, but they turn down a healthy young man who grew up in
France and considers himself French.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes, he said, that the authorities will soon relent and
grant Alexis, too, the citizenship of his adopted country.

US ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS ON A CLOSE CALL AGAINST ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ OK, Rudy T, how satisfying was this one?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were still drinking,'' said Rudy Tomjanovich, who has
been in an alcohol abstention mode for a while now, ``I'd have a
couple of beers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate foreign basketball adventure nightmare. Here
was Rudy's plucky US national team being slapped around by a 15-3
Italy run, unable to get a call and perilously close to being sent
home without even the opportunity to get a medal in the World
Basketball Championships. The indignity of a US team playing for
fifth instead of sixth, or perhaps even seventh instead of eighth,
was unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   But sing no sad songs. If Rudy T wasn't hoisting them at an
Athenian tavern, be assured some American was. For after falling
behind by a 7-point margin that felt at the time like 27, the US
finished off the game with a dramatic 14-4 run in 4:57 to defeat
Italy, 80-77, and move into a semifinal matchup Saturday against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The story gets better every day. It is almost impossible to
exaggerate the magnitude of what Rudy and his staff are trying to
do against professional teams that know each other intimately. ``If
the USA wins this,'' said Lithuiania assistant Donn Nelson, ``it
will be a minor miracle. Rudy would have to be Coach of the
Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of basketball to be played before that happens,
but at least the Americans will be playing in games that really
matter, and there were many people both here and back where all you
fine folks are who doubted they'd even get this far.''
</P>
<P>
   I know this much: Not many people ever dreamed that one of the
key players on the team would be Kiwane Garris.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: If this kid had missed the bus or gotten food
poisoning, the US would now be looking at a morning consolation
game against Lithuania. Garris, the 6-foot-1-inch guard from
Illinois who spent most of last season in the CBA, played the final
seven minutes as a shooting guard alongside starting point Michael
Hawkins (himself a huge contributor) and made some big plays.
Really big.
</P>
<P>
   Included among them was a 3-pointer that got the aforementioned
7-point deficit to 4 at 73-69 (4:44); a 12-foot banker (75-71); two
free throws (75-75 at 3:10); a key defensive rebound at 2.9
seconds; and finally, a free throw to create the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T is a fearless coach who will make any adjustment he feels
is necessary, and he is having fun _ when he isn't courting a heart
attack. He was a totally animated sideline presence in the second
half. You'd almost swear he was back in the Summit for a Rockets
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions are the same,'' he admitted. ``I'm attached to
these guys. I was really into the game, running around, jumping all
over the place. But you have to love 'em. They're a bunch of
hardworking guys, although there were times we didn't look very
good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T knew his team was in trouble when it got off to an 11-2
lead. You want a good start, but you don't want too good a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too easy,'' he pointed out. ``Then they start thinking
it's another Australia (against which the US was up by 30), and you
know the other guys are going to come roaring back.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy had played the US tough in an exhibition two weeks ago and
clearly had no respect for Rudy's Off-Broadway team. The most
athletically disrespectful player of them all was 6-2 Jamaican-born
guard Carlton Myers, who showed any Americans who didn't already
know why he is a star for Teamsystem Bologna in the Italian League.
Myers tortured the US for 32 points and was particularly adept at
worming his way to the foul line, where he was a gaudy 15 for 15.
</P>
<P>
   After going to the hoop for what turned out to be Italy's final
basket at 7:21, Myers went to the line five more times, once for
three shots on an ill-advised Garris foul (did anyone say the kid
was perfect?). He was a European maestro playing the European game
in a European arena in a European atmosphere, and for a long while,
it appeared he would be good enough to defeat the Americans all by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Myers repeatedly stepping to the line for a pair of
swishes was starting to aggravate Rudy T, so much so that during
each stoppage of play, he kept yelling one thing at his players:
``Let's see if the guy can make a shot! Stop putting him on the
line!.''
</P>
<P>
   He did miss a couple in crunch time, but one was enough to age
Rudy by a couple of years. That would be a heart-stopping
in-and-out 3-pointer with the US leading, 79-77. Myers launched it
from a good 5 feet behind the arc, and it looked awfully good
before it finally popped out and Garris grabbed the rebound with
2.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The US needed both stops and points to pull this out, and it got
the latter from such reliables as Hawkins, who crammed all 16 of
his points into the second half and gave the US the lead (77-75)
with a banked runner at the 41.4-second juncture, and from the icy
veteran Wendell Alexis, whose two free throws broke the last tie
with 25.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Rudy &AMP; Co. would have at least a full day to recover
and perpare. Not here. It's off to the videotape, because the only
Russians Rudy knows are the Black ones, and as you've already been
informed, Rudy isn't drinking _ yet.

 &HT;    CLINTON VOWS TO CATCH BOMBERS 'NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES'
 &HT;    With BOMBINGS-ANALYSIS-0808.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assailing the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in
eastern Africa on Friday as ''cowardly attacks,'' President Clinton
sent emergency medical and disaster teams to the region and vowed
to cast a global dragnet to try to bring the perpetrators to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the difficulty of countering anti-American
terrorists, however, Clinton also ordered heightened security at
the 260 U.S. embassies and missions around the world and sought to
reassure the thousands of foreign service officers who are
stationed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent. They are
inhuman,'' a solemn Clinton said during a Rose Garden event marking
a worker education initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will use all the means at our disposal to bring those
responsible to justice, no matter what or how long it takes,''
Clinton pledged. ''We are determined to get answers and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   American flags were lowered to half-mast around the capital --
and at U.S. facilities around the world -- to mourn the eight
Americans confirmed killed by a powerful bomb at the embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya, and the State Department said six more U.S. foreign
service officers were missing and 14 were hospitalized by late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A second bomb exploded at the American embassy in the Tanzanian
capital of Dar es Salaam within minutes of the Nairobi attack. No
Americans were confirmed killed in that attack, though at least
five Tanzanians, including three guards and two embassy employees,
were reported dead by late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, officials said the terrorist bombs killed at least
81 people, injuring more than 1,700 and turning buildings into
mountains of shattered concrete where crowds crawled over looking
for victims, calling out and waving their arms for help to pull
bodies from the wreckage and free trapped people crying for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon moved quickly to mobilize emergency assistance,
flying a C-141 cargo plane loaded with medical supplies, personnel
and other gear to the region from a U.S. Air Force Base in Germany.
A second C-141 took off from Andrews Air Force Base, outside of
Washington, ferrying additional supplies and staff; while still
more aircraft were scheduled too fly into the region from elsewhere
in Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cut short a vacation
in Italy to return for an immediate meeting with Clinton on the
matter and to help manage a State Department task force set up to
help deal with the fallout from the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of yet there has been no claim of responsibility for these
dastardly and cowardly acts of apparent terrorism,'' Albright said
before leaving Rome, vowing that ''the United States will spare no
effort, and use all means at our disposal, to track down and punish
the perpetrators of these outrageous acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city that has been consumed this week by midsummer partisan
bickering and distracted by escalating developments in the
investigation of Clinton's relationship with former intern Monica
Lewinsky, the president's political foes set those matters aside to
rally around themes of national unity amid shared trauma.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a week that has seen Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
renege on a U.N.-brokered weapons control regime that averted U.S.
airstrikes earlier this year, House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned
that the nation stands as one against attacks on the country or
threats against American interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one anywhere in the world should doubt that when you
challenge the United States of America and you kill those who serve
the American people, that there is no partisan argument, there is
no scandal, there is no distraction, there is nothing which
prevents us from coming together as a people and doing what we have
to do to protect our own,'' said Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one anywhere should think that the United States is weak
because it is free, should think the United States is timid because
it occasionally has family arguments,'' Gingrich told reporters at
a Capitol press conference. ''When we are challenged, we unite as
one country, without any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, there were more questions than answers in
Washington about the shocking strikes against American missions
half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Although no group immediately came forth with a credible claim
of responsibility for the bombings, Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering told reporters that investigators presume they were
linked.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that we have had two such coordinated
explosions,'' the career diplomat said. ''It obviously required
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin
Gilman, whose position conveys access to classified intelligence,
said he knew of no organization indigenous to eastern Africa
regarded as a serious terrorist threat -- adding that he suspects
the bombers represented some non-African group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of those nations do not have any history of political
terrorism or even dissent, so it appears highly unlikely that these
outrages were perpetrated by any local organization,'' said Gilman,
R-N.Y. ''So we have to look further, apparently, than the local
people. We don't know yet who is truly responsible for these
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering declined to specify the measures ordered to shore up
security at U.S. missions abroad in the wake of Friday's attacks.
He said, though, that the bombings were a tragic reminder of the
danger American diplomats face day-in and day-out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get some 30,000 threats a year,'' against U.S. diplomatic
facilities around the world, Pickering said. ''We treat them all as
extremely important.''

   MARKETS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An August Storm &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was as though a gale hit Wall Street on Tuesday, blowing
stocks loose from their moorings. The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31, and other
market gauges were down even more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   No one factor caused the havoc that left traders like one on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, left, in despair. The Asian
economic crisis was cited, as were stunted growth in corporate
earnings and even the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, a little calm had returned as some of the
most-damaged sectors _ small-capitalization stocks and technology _
helped lead the market higher. The Dow industrials ended the week
at 8,598.29, still down 285.27 for the week. One sector that
appears thoroughly battered is new issues; the year is shaping up
as the worst since 1990 for initial public offerings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ECONOMY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Longer Sizzling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators painted a far less robust picture than they
had earlier in the year. The Conference Board reported that its
Index of Leading Economic Indicators slipped in June, as it had in
May. It stood at 105, down 0.2 percent from May. ``It doesn't mean
bad times for the U.S. economy, but we've seen the best,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Federal Reserve said in releasing its beige book
that although the economy was healthy, growth showed signs of
slowing as exports to Asia slumped. Personal incomes rose a scant
0.2 percent in June. The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
4.5 percent and wage growth eased in July. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hemorrhaging Red Ink &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, manage thyself, investors might well say. United
Healthcare, one of the nation's largest health maintenance
organizations, said it would take a $900 million charge in its
second quarter, in part to abandon unprofitable Medicare plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to forget that Medicare was created because
private insurers could not make money on the elderly population,''
said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights
Center, a consumer organization in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Following the debacle at Oxford Health Plans, another managed
care concern, the move sparked an investor stampede out of health
care stocks and possibly jeopardized United Healthcare's proposed
$5.5 billion merger with its rival, Humana Inc., which would create
the nation's largest HMO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Streamlining GM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, the world's largest auto maker, said it would
build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North
America. To the dismay of the United Automobile Workers, which
effectively shut down GM with eight-week strikes against two parts
facilities, the new plants could use as little as half the number
of workers currently employed at GM assembly plants, like the one
in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   Outside suppliers, many with nonunion workers, would do much of
the work. GM, which reported that sales fell 38 percent in July,
also announced a sweeping reorganization of its internal
distribution structure that is expected to save $200 million to
$300 million a year and eliminate as many as 1,000 white-collar
jobs, and said it would spin off Delphi Automotive Systems, its
parts unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported a 4.3 percent slide in domestic car and truck
sales for July, and Chrysler registered a 3 percent gain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;  (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   SUNBEAM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less Than Sunny &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, the appliance maker, said it would restate last year's
financial statements, resulting in a ``material adjustment,'' and
possibly the results for 1996 and the first quarter of this year,
too, because of possible accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst estimated that the adjustment would be $25 million
to $50 million. The stock slid $1, to a new low of $7 on Thursday.
The disclosure followed an announcement that Sunbeam and Albert J.
Dunlap, the former chairman and chief executive ousted by the board
in June, had signed a ``joint cooperation agreement'' to share
various documents related to lawsuits and an investigation into the
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides quickly began bickering about what they had
agreed on. Still, one thing went right for the company: the
American Medical Association agreed to pay Sunbeam $9.9 million for
backing out of a deal to endorse the company's humidifiers, blood
pressure monitors and other products. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERNET &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Frontier for Business &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A century and a half ago, when Americans pushed back the Western
frontier, they panned for gold. Well, so far, this century's
frontier, the Internet, has not proved itself a gold mine. But
business is trying. Amazon.com, showing that its aspirations extend
to selling far more than books over the Internet, bought the
Junglee Corp., which operates a service that lets people shop on
line for everything from clothing to computers, and Planet All,
which operates a vast Internet address service.
</P>
<P>
   And Agency.com agreed to acquire Eagle River Interactive. The
Omnicom Group will own just under half the combined company, which
will be the Internet's largest ad agency. &QL;

   Allied Signal, a maker of aerospace and automotive products,
announced a $9.8 billion unsolicited offer for AMP Inc., which said
it would review the offer. ... Albertson's Inc. said it would
acquire American Stores for $8.3 billion in stock, in a deal that
would create the nation's largest supermarket chain. ... Eastman
Kodak agreed to buy the Imation Corp.'s medical imaging business
for $520 million in cash. The move shows that Kodak, after
shrinking operations and its work force earlier this year, is now

   A federal judge ordered Microsoft to turn over to the government
the source code for its operating systems, Windows 95 and Windows
98, and to make its chairman, William H. Gates, and 16 other
executives available for pretrial depositions taking as long as the
Justice Department deemed necessary to prepare for a Sept. 8 trial
in the government's antitrust suit against the company. ... A
vulnerability was discovered in Eudora, the most widely used e-mail
software, just days after a serious security flaw was found in two
rival electronic-mail programs.

   Bankers were cheering five months ago when the Supreme Court
ruled that the nation's laws did not permit credit unions to
include more than one occupational group in their memberships. But
credit unions had the last laugh. Congress passed a measure to
permit them to expand their memberships, and President Clinton said
that he would sign it, even though it does not require credit
unions to abide by fair-lending rules that banks must follow.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate
Banking Committee &UR; , &LR;  said of the credit unions, ``We need them in

Midland.

<P>
   In one episode, Michael D. Andreas, of Archer Daniels met with
Ikeda Hirokazu, of the Ajinimoto Co. of Japan, with which the
government contends Archer Daniels conspired to fix prices of a
feed additive, and Mark Whitacre, an Archer executive and secret
government informer. &QL;

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, July 31, the Senate approved, 97-2, a $252 billion
defense spending bill. The bill allows $1.9 billion for U.S. forces
in Bosnia. The Senate rejected a measure to pressure the
administration into withdrawing the troops. Supporters said the
funds will provide resources and flexibility for soldiers in Bosnia
to meet the challenges of living conditions and family separation.
Nobody took the Senate floor to oppose the bill. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LEGAL
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday voted, 255-170, to provide $250 million for
legal aid next year. The Legal Services Corp., which provides this
service for the poor, received $283 million in funding this year.
Supporters said legal aid is an essential service for those who
could not otherwise afford legal counseling. Opponents said the
organization pursues an activist, ideological agenda. A ``yes''
vote would approve the funding.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 201-227, an amendment to the
Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending bill that would
have allotted full funding for the Census Bureau for next year.
Supporters of the amendment said the bureau needs the full funding
to fulfill the Clinton Administration's plan to combine statistical
sampling with the traditional head count in order to account for
people, mostly minorities, that are often overlooked. Opponents
argued that sampling could distort counts and it could enable
politicians to fix numbers to meet their own political needs. A
``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: PROSECUTE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 82-345, an amendment to strike
a provision in the Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending
bill designed to protect citizens from unfair prosecutions by
setting up a Misconduct Review board for unethical prosecutors.
Supporters said the provision was too restrictive on prosecutors
and not an integral part of the spending bill. Opponents said
Americans need a method for fighting back when treated unfairly by
prosecutors. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GAYRIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 176-252, an amendment to the
Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending bill that would
have revoked President Clinton's ability to prohibit discrimination
against gays in the federal workplace. Supporters said it was
unfair for Clinton to be able to give special breaks to special
interests. Opponents said taking away Clinton's ability would have
legitimized government-sponsored discrimination. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 252-179, a bill that would reform
the campaign finance system. The measure would ban the unlimited,
unregulated ``soft money'' contributions to political parties,
impose restrictions on issue advertisements mentioning a
candidate's name and increase disclosure requirements. Supporters
said the campaign finance problems stemming from 1996 show that the
system is corrupt and needs an overhaul. Opponents said the bill
infringed on free speech rights guaranteed under the First
Amendment. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   UNDATED _ I was a woman living in fear. For five years, I was
afraid to paint the white walls in my all-too-vanilla home. It was
our first house, and I clung to renter mentality. We would have to
sell the home someday, and experts say buyers prefer plain walls
that allow them to better visualize their own decorating tastes.
But what about my decorating tastes? The truth is, I didn't know
whether I had any and was too cheap to pay someone who did. I
wanted to be bolder, but I was drowning in doubts. By KATHRYN
HOPPER. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category. (Accompanied

   UNDATED _ Hal Hartley became an indie-film hero not so much by

ECONOMY SHRUGS OFF GM STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate held firm at 4.5 percent in July
despite a strike by workers at General Motors Corp. which cost the
nation its biggest monthly job loss in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Labor reported Friday that the US economy,
which has slowed dramatically in recent months, created only 66,000
new jobs in July. Although that is well below the pace of job
growth in the three prior months, enough new jobs were created to
leave the jobless rate unchanged from a seasonally adjusted June
rate of 4.5 percent and just above the 28-year low of 4.3 percent
reached in May.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses were made up especially in the booming retail and
housing industries.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report is ``very encouraging,'' said Lawrence Horwitz,
an economist with Primark Decision Economics, a Boston consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Economists had braced for much worse news in the labor market
amid lower corporate profits and sporadic layoffs, a meltdown by
Asian trading partners, and a new government estimate that economic
growth slowed dramatically in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pace of job growth was about right for easing fears
on Wall Street that a tighter labor market could cause inflation to
rear its head and force the Federal Reserve Board to react by
raising interest rates. Wages, a key concern at the Fed, also rose
at a slower pace last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is still locked on hold,'' William Dudley, chief US
economist for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York. ``This report isn't
strong enough or weak to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street remained settled Friday after a riotous week. The
Dow Jones stock market index closed up 20.34 points at 8,598.02.
For the week, the blue chip average finished down 285 points and
failed to recover from Tuesday's 299-point slide.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's small gain hid broad market strength. Advancing issues
outnumbered declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange by
about a 2-1 margin on volume of about 760 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nation's ability to withstand the damaging effects
of a 54-day strike at the country's biggest automotive company, the
jobs report contained troubling news.
</P>
<P>
   Most obvious was the fact that the strike cost the nation
111,000 of a steep 176,000 decline in manufacturing jobs last month
_ that is the largest job loss in one month since October 1982. The
company quickly followed up a strike settlement last week with the
United Autoworkers by announcing that there would be plant closings
and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Asia's economic contraction can be seen in the
manufacturing sector. When General Motors is taken out of the
picture, the nation lost 42,000 manufacturing jobs in July,
according to Primark. That accelerated the pace of job losses in
manufacturing in May and in June, which averaged about 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic components, which relies heavily on Asian export
markets, lost jobs, as did the food industry and textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really seeing the Asia impact taking a bite out of
manufacturing,'' said Primark's Horwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in manufacturing ``does reflect slower exports and the
struggles that firms are having to keep earnings strong and finding
they have to cut back their labor force in order to save costs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings were rose 3 cents for the third
consecutive month, to $12.79. That's smaller than the average
monthly increase of 5 cents during the first four months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   There were other positive notes. To handle high summer spending
by consumers, retailers increased employment by 125,000 last month,
including 69,000 jobs at restaurants and bars. Amid high housing
starts and sales, the construction industry added 18,000 jobs last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of 66,000 jobs last month pushed total employment
in the non-farm sector to 125.8 million. Though the jobless rate
was unchanged, the rate for black men jumped from 6.9 percent to
8.9 percent and from a record low of 20.2 percent to 28.6 percent
for black teen-agers of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment among Hispanics fell from 7.6 percent to 7.2
percent, and for whites, from 4 percent to 3.8 percent.

HUSSEIN'S ILLNESS HAS JORDANIANS JITTERY ABOUT FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 9) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ For days following news that King Hussein had
been diagnosed with cancer, anxious Jordanians flooded downtown
money changers in a rush to trade their country's dinars for more
stable U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the frantic activity had begun to subside due to a
speech the 62-year-old monarch gave via satellite from the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he has been receiving treatment
for lymph cancer since July 14. Doctors, he told his jittery
public, were optimistic that they would be able to bring the cancer
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not over and done with yet,'' he said. ``My cancer is a
new battle I am determined to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the king's speech helped bring calm, many Jordanians
admit they remain worried about the future of one of the Middle
East's most enduring monarchies. The king's illness has rekindled
uncomfortable questions of succession to the Hashemite Crown and
concerns that a close U.S. ally who has been Israel's staunchest
friend in the Middle East may not be able to rule much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians say the idea seems almost unfathomable. For 46
years, King Hussein, born Prince Sharif Hussein and descended from
a family that traces its ancestors to the Prophet Mohammed, has
ruled them with a mixture of benevolence and brutality that has
brought deep respect and left him unquestionably in control.
Three-fourths of his subjects have never lived under another ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is King Hussein,'' said Bassam, a 37-year-old
grocer in the middle-class neighborhood of Medinet al-Riyada. ``We
got used to him. If he's gone, we don't know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments echo from the impoverished Palestinian refugee
camp of Baqa, at the edge of Amman, to the upscale neighborhood of
Abdoun. With a reputation for balancing his impoverished country's
interests with the often conflicting ones of the mightier countries
around him, Jordanians wonder whether anyone else possesses the
finesse to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``People associate Jordan's stability with the personality of
the king, his charisma, his ability to lead,'' said Radwan
Abdallah, a Jordanian political consultant affiliated with Middle
East Consulting, Research and Analysis, a think-tank based in
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think his illness might lead to instability,'' said
Abdallah. ``There are some unknowns that lead people to be a bit
anxious about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts, Jordanian and Israeli alike, say that the kingdom
is stable enough. The king's likeliest successor is his brother,
Crown Prince Hassan, an affable, Oxford-educated intellectual who
has been Hussein's political adviser for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   But some palace watchers predict a struggle between Prince
Hassan and the king's sons. Prince Abdallah, an army general in
charge of the Royal Guards, elite units of paratroopers and
military intelligence, and Prince Hamzah, 18, who will attend a
British military academy in the fall, are the two likeliest
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordanians worry whether their country, which borders
Syria, Iraq and the Israeli-occupied West Bank and which is filled
with Palestinians, would be able to hold on to its territory, its
Hashemite identity, or its current form of government. The glue
that kept those elements in place is the king himself, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great shock for Jordan to lose King Hussein,''
said Abdallah Hassanant,'' editor and political commentator for the
English-language Jordan Times. ``They have great trust in him that
after each crisis, he will come out with the fewest loses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassanat, like most analysts here, says Jordanians favor a
continuation of the monarchy. Despite a prolonged downturn in the
economy and the king's decision to make peace with Israel, a move
initially welcomed but increasingly unpopular, they think it is the
best way to maintain security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Palestinians, who by some estimates make up 70
percent of the population, do not enjoy all the rights of native
Jordanians, most also want the monarchy to continue, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Successive waves of Palestinian refugees, granted citizenship
and allowed to integrate, now dominate Jordan's thriving business
class. The wealthy Abdoun neighborhood, for instance, is
overwhelmingly Palestinian, some government ministers are
Palestinians and one segment of the royal family is Palestinian:
King Hussein's third wife _ he divorced the first two and she died
in a plane crash _ was a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any change in the system will have to come from Jordanians,
not Palestinians,'' said Sari Nasir, a sociologist at the
University of Jordan whose Palestinian family fled from a village
near Tel Aviv during the 1948 war that created the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinians can vote but they are not interested in changing
Jordan into a Palestinian entity,'' he said. ``That will never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts say it is unlikely Jordanians will press for change
either, even though much of the loyalty coming from both
Palestinians and Jordanian Bedouin tribes is to the king himself.
Crown Prince Hassan, they say, has not built such close ties with
these groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Islamists are very much loyal to the king,'' said the
University of Jordan's Abdallah. ``They are not very radical. They
are affiliated with the political system.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is likely to come from within the royal
family itself. Already, dynastic rivalries have surfaced, pitting
Prince Hassan against the king's sons, say palace watchers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordan's constitution, the crown should go to the
king's first-born son, Abdallah, 36. But he was born to an
Englishwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, that idea did not sit well with the
anti-colonial sentiment rife among Jordanians still shaking off bad
memories of British rule here. Bowing to public sentiment, Hussein
agreed to amend the constitution and named Prince Hassan as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that that 1965 constitutional amendment might
lead to royal friction came in 1992, when Hussein was first
diagnosed with cancer. Then, he suggested creating a Hashemite
council responsible for electing his successor _ either his brother
or one of his sons. After intense lobbying by Prince Hassan, the
idea was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the king battling his second bout of cancer, the idea
has resurfaced. So has a compromise: Prince Hassan would take the
helm next, but the dynasty would then revert back to Abdallah _
rather than going to Hassan's eldest son, Rashid.
</P>
<P>
   And speculation that the king might name his youngest son,
Hamzah, born to fourth and current wife, Queen Noor, the
American-born Lisa Hallaby, started after the king sent him a
letter on his 18th birthday reminding him that Hussein was king
when he was Hamzah's age. ``It was taken to mean that he is
eligible to sit on the thrown,'' said one Jordanian observer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli observers worry that whoever does take the helm may
not have the personal charm that has helped Hussein maneuver
through some tough times, both at home and in Jordan's relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The king's warmth has endeared him to most Israelis, first when
he spoke at the funeral of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and then when he knelt in from of the grieving family members
of Israeli schoolgirls who were killed by a Jordanian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts agree that whoever does succeed Hussein will
follow the king's path of peace with Israel, despite its current
impasse with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace with Israel is in the interest of Jordan at this
moment,'' said the Jordan Times' Hassanat. ``Anybody who comes
after the king will follow the same policy.''

B-2 TRAINING MISSIONS CANCELED BECAUSE OF EJECTION SYSTEM
TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Air Force has suspended the B-2 stealth
bomber's training missions at Whiteman Air Force Base because of
problems with the aircraft's ejection system, the Air Force
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 of the active bombers are based with the 509th Bomb Wing
at Whiteman, 60 miles southeast of Kansas City near Knob Noster,
Mo. The Air Force said the grounding would not hurt the 509th Bomb
Wing's combat capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a real-world conflict, we could put them right
back into service,'' said Maj. Art Haubold, an Air Force spokesman
at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also suspended training for about a week in 1997
when an engine shaft assembly on a bomber broke in a test flight.
</P>
<P>
   The first B-2 entered service at Whiteman in 1993. The warplane
is covered with a special ``skin'' that enables it to absorb or
deflect radar signals and avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, regulators have questioned the aircraft's
effectiveness. A report from the General Accounting Office in June
raised doubts about the bomber's ability to detect radar and avoid
detection. An earlier report questioned the aircraft's
effectiveness in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, discovered the
problems with the ejection system in testing at its B-2 plant in
Palmdale, Calif. Haubold said the problem was with the initiators,
which control when the plane's hatch opens and when the crew is
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The eight initiators on each aircraft will be replaced at
Whiteman and in California. Each aircraft will resume peacetime
training as soon as replacement parts are installed and inspections
are complete. Air Force officials offered no timetable for the
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they consider this to be a long-term process,''
Haubold said. ``This won't be a hard fix to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge warplane can drop either nuclear or conventional bombs.
Eleven bombers are under construction, in addition to the 10
already at Whiteman.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the bombers has flown on a combat mission. But
in April, two of the bat-winged aircraft flew to Guam on a training
exercise, the first long-term overseas deployment of the warplane.

NEW US ENVOY TO TANZANIA STILL ON TRACK TO ASSUME POST

<P>
   BOSTON _ Three weeks ago, Boston's Rev. Charles Stith, the newly
named US ambassador to Tanzania, left with his family for their
annual 21-day vacation to the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. He
gave his wife, two teenaged children and mother-in-law ``Team
Tanzania'' family briefing books and tapes of Swahili to study
between rounds of golf and romps in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the day before the family was to return to Boston and a
month before they expect to move to Africa, the Stiths awoke to the
news that the US embassy in the Tanzanian port city of Dar es
Salaam had been the target of a terrorist bomb. Stith gathered the
family to pray for the victims of the attacks in Dar es Salaam and
Nairobi, and he made plans to fly to Washington Sunday morning to
meet with State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I were there right now,'' Stith, 48, said in a
telephone interview. ``That's the post I've been selected to lead.
In a time of crisis a leader wants to be present. That's not to say
folks aren't handling this in a professional and competent manner.
I wish I were there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith got a call from the State Deparment around 6:30 Friday
morning. Half an hour later, Stith's nephew from Atlanta called and
the rest of the family arose and followed events in Africa on Cable
News Network for the rest of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just shocking that something this devastating and brutal
and cowardly would happen in any context,'' Stith said. ``Obviously
we're concerned'' for the family's safety. They give you training
around security issues. Something like this brings home the fact
that this stuff is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith did not believe the bombings would change the family's
plan to leave for Tanzania around September 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little devastated about what's happened,'' said his
wife, Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, an associate dean at Harvard's
School of Public Health, who plans to travel between Boston and Dar
es Salaam. ``It raises some concerns obviously about issues of
safety. We haven't talked a lot about that. In light of what
happened at the Capitol and Oklahoma City, they are not issues that
would keep us from going but it's concerning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very excited about going and understand this as an
isolated event that's not reflective of the relationship between
the United States and Tanzania.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the family has relaxed on Sint
Maarten. &UR;  &LR; Sith also spent time concluding business with the
Organization for a New Equality, the civil and economic rights
group he founded and from which he is resigning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The family shopped for lightweight clothes to bring to Africa,
and 16-year-old Mimi, who'll wear a uniform at the international
school in Dar es Salaam, looked for outfits with navy blue bottoms
and white shirts. They read their briefing books. They listened to
Swahili tapes in the car and on the beach and in their two-bedroom
time share condominium. Prothrow-Stith, 44, counted her leg lifts
in Swahili during her aqua aerobics. They laughed when they
discovered that the set of four language tapes came mistakenly
packaged with two in Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Friday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, my sister and I looked at each other and said, `Man,
are we going to still be going?' But it almost makes me want to go
more now,'' said 19-year-old Percy, who will take a leave of
absence from Bates College to serve as an assistant to his father.
``Maybe my first natural instinct is to stay away from harm's way,
but when I thought about it, I thought this is a freak thing. It's
tragic, but it definitely doesn't change my feelings about wanting
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at a picture (on television) now,'' he said. ``It
hurts a lot to see something like this.''

POSTAL SERVICE TO OPEN TELEPHONE INFORMATION CENTER IN MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ The U.S. Postal Service will create about
1,100 new jobs in Kansas City, Kan., by opening a telephone
information center inside the beleaguered Indian Springs
Marketplace, which has been losing tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials on Thursday announced a nearly $68 million
contract with a Denver company to operate the second of six planned
National Service Centers. The Kansas City, Kan., one should be in
the former Dillard's department store space by December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Rene Brunetti, who manages his father's
Italian Delight restaurant, which has seen good times and bad over
22 years at the mall entrance. ``Oh gosh, this will help
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and
Kansas City, Kan., also were elated at the announcement, which they
have hoped was coming for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only a great opportunity for our citizens but also a
shot in the arm for the Indian Springs Marketplace,'' said Mayor
Carol Marinovich. ``Hopefully, this will be the attraction for new
retail opportunities at Indian Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jobs are expected to pay in the range of $8 an hour
plus benefits with on-site child care, said Don Denney, spokesman
for the Unified Government.
</P>
<P>
   The service center will be operated by TeleTech Facilities
Management Inc., which also operates a service center in Denver.
Company officials could not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Unified Government Commissioner Tom Bruns, whose district
includes Indian Springs, said Kansas City, Kan., had been competing
with another area city for the service center. He would not name
the other city.
</P>
<P>
   Bruns said Kansas City, Kan., did not offer a financial package
to entice TeleTech. But the Kansas Department of Commerce and
Housing will provide funds for job training as well as tax credits
for the new center, said department spokesman Matt Brisch. Details
will be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the service center will answer postal-related
questions around the clock on toll-free lines for customers in 13
central states, from Minnesota to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   People who call will be able to speak to actual human beings.
</P>
<P>
   They will provide information on postal rates, ZIP codes, post
office locations and mailing restrictions. If necessary, the
service center can transfer callers to a local post office.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Postal Service will urge all Americans to call
the same toll-free number with postal questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to provide consistent information,'' said
postal spokesman Don Smeraldi. ``When people from time to time call
post offices, the employees there are concentrating on getting the
mail moving and sometimes the questions may not be answered as
quickly as we would like.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of people into Indian Springs Marketplace, which is
more than half empty, comes as Stein Mart clothing store prepares
to open an outlet in the former J.C. Penney space. Other tenants at
Indian Springs include Montgomery Ward, Radio Shack and Harold
Pener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited for the surviving businesses at Indian
Springs,'' said Denney. ``This is certainly a reward for their
patience, and hopefully it will benefit them more.''

   COLUMN: Nurturing rain draws audience in celebration
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Mayc. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. -- It had been such a long time. Weeks that
seemed like months had drifted by on waves of punishing heat. With
no rain that I had seen. Such a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   A toll had been taken, of course. Here in the mountains, some of
the less hardy new plants had bitten the dust, literally, joining
it after withering and shriveling. A tiny anise was the most recent
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Atlanta the list was growing, including several ferns, a
new beautyberry, wintergreen, a corkscrew willow. There was no
escape from the heat, the drought. Day after day, night after
night, I sweated and watered, knowing even as I held the hose that
nothing would satisfy like water from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain's the only thing that'll keep 'em alive,'' an elder man
here had agreed as we struck up the inevitable weather
conversation. ``Rain's got minerals in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But we hadn't seen any in such a long time. Even on days and
nights when thunder rolled. Nothing. Dry heaves.
</P>
<P>
   Until that Saturday. I woke up early, hearing, for the first
time in McCaysville, a rooster crowing for day. Through the bedroom
window, looking southwest, I could see the usual, stunningly
beautiful morning mist hanging over the distant ridge, gray-blue.
</P>
<P>
   Toward noon, skies darkened. Clouds sank and, along with a
breeze, drifted toward Fightingtown Creek, toward my ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m. I went from the creek side of the cabin to
the road side, where herbs, the rock garden and Big Momma's garden
grow near the door. I knew rain was on the way, and I wanted to see
the plants feel it. I wanted to feel it.
</P>
<P>
   It came. First in a light mist. Then drops, so few that I could
count them as they pattered onto the hydrangea leaves, splattering
in the dust around the four-o'clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The pace quickened, and soon there had been enough drops to
clean the dust from everything _ plants, rocks, the car. Enough
drops to turn the driveway's gravel a slick charcoal tone
everywhere except a car-sized rectangle that remained artemisia
gray.
</P>
<P>
   I had to go out there. As I did, I recalled another rain,
decades earlier, when as a boy soldier in Germany I grabbed a bar
of soap and dashed into a downpour along with other GIs, stripped
naked and lathering happily.
</P>
<P>
   On this day I remained fully clothed, welcoming wet pants,
shirt, shoes. Turning my face into the rain, I let it shower my
forehead, trickle down my chin, through my beard, onto my chest and
back. It was good.
</P>
<P>
   As was the smell of wet red clay and black humus _ sweet, rich,
fecund.
</P>
<P>
   Among the plants, I could feel them embracing the rain,
responding to it as eagerly as I was. The liatris, suffering heat
prostration, stood a bit taller, as did the bee balm and the
rhododendron.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, all the plants seemed to especially enjoy the rain.
On the creek side, I stood face to face with oaks whose suddenly
vibrant leaves held diamond raindrops glittering against creek and
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies, too, loved this shower. They never stopped dancing,
dashing from buddleia to zinnia, then soaring across treetops,
toward the giving clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, it was over _ leaving all of us to dry and wonder how
long it would be until next time.

POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN GOES AWRY IN MERRIAM, KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIAM, Kan. _ Merriam's decision to oust a longtime business
owner from his property to make way for a BMW dealership expansion
is a stark reminder of the downside of eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   While this practice is traditionally perceived as government's
power to take private property for public use, it has been many
years since this was strictly the case. There was a time when
government's condemnation powers were used almost exclusively to
expropriate property for a genuinely ``public'' good such as a
roadway or a school. As such, eminent domain was perceived by most
Americans as a sometimes bothersome but nevertheless acceptable
exercise of government power as long as owners were justly
compensated.
</P>
<P>
   As the go-go economy of the postwar era gained momentum,
however, governments increasingly broadened the concept in the name
of promoting economic development. What evolved is a process by
which government now routinely uses its condemnation power to take
private property for private use if public benefit can be credibly
assumed in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more controversial recent uses of eminent domain
locally has been by Kansas City, Kan., and Wyandotte County, Kan.,
to create a site for a proposed speedway. The justification is that
the area badly needs the economic boost a development of this size
could give it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone buys that claim, of course, but the reason the
initiative has gained enough public acceptance to proceed is
because it's at least a credible claim. While there are no
guarantees the raceway's promise will be fulfilled, the magnitude
of the potential reward is considered big enough to merit the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam's most recent use of eminent domain is quite a different
situation, though, for a couple of reasons. The City Council's
decision seems to turn on the expectation of the car dealership's
capacity to generate substantially more sales tax revenue than
current use generates.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the same thing as using condemnation powers to
encourage a comprehensive development. Rather, it would seem, it's
simply a matter of government using its power to favor one
business's interests over another.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing in the discussion preceding the council's
decision, however, was an adequate explication of how the
additional sales tax revenue would benefit the public. It seems
reasonable to assume a positive trade-off, but such things
shouldn't be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubling aspect of Merriam's move in this regard is how
it offends the sense of community. This isn't a big city where
eco-devo wheeling and dealing is likely to be a more impersonal
affair. It's a relatively small town that should be at least as
concerned with maintaining an atmosphere of neighborliness and
community as it is with economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   This is, in fact, a primary reason many Americans prefer small
towns to big cities. Merriam's move, though, overrode the interests
of somebody who's been part of the local business scene and
community for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   While the desire of city leaders to promote Merriam's economic
vitality is understandable, even laudable, there's more to consider
in this case. Government's only legitimate role is as steward of
the broad public interest. While promoting a healthy economic
climate is in the public interest, no business's right to exist
should depend on its ability to generate taxes.

 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly Brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo 66 NR
</P>
<P>
   Don't shuffle off to this ``Buffalo.'' Former Calvin Klein
underwear model Vincent Gallo wrote, directed and stars in this
uneven fable about an ex-con who kidnaps a voluptuous teen
(Christina Ricci) to pose as his wife while he visits his parents
(Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). The first half is amusingly
bonkers, thanks to the cast, but overall, the film is all over the
place _ self-pitying and sardonic, arty and maudlin. Not rated but
includes strong language, graphic violence and nudity. 1 hour, 46
minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Clockwatchers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this wicked take on workplace hell, four temps (Toni
Collette, Lisa Kudrow, Alanna Ubach, Parker Posey) bond over Happy
Hour wings and shared grievances about working in a place rife with
petty politics and ubiquitous Muzak. Fledgling filmmaker Jill
Sprecher has some plot problems, but when she sticks to the subtle
nuances of the typical dysfunctional corporate ``family,'' she's
dead-on. So's her cast, especially Posey as a born rebel who keeps
herself sane by minor acts of sabotage. Rated PG-13 for language. 1
hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Directr Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fool R
</P>
<P>
   More challenging but irritatingly oblique foolishness from Hal
Hartley. A nerdy, withdrawn garbageman (James Urbaniak) is
befriended by a grandiose, overbearing stranger (Thomas Jay Ryan)
with literary pretensions and a secret past. Encouraged to write
himself, the protege surpasses his mentor. Hartley has wit and an
eccentric vision. But his trademark monotone style is emotionally
deadening. The movie just goes on and on and on. Rated R for sex,
nudity, language and graphic scatological humor. 2 hours, 18
minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   High Art R
</P>
<P>
   Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives us a stunning lesson in the
high art of acting as a once-famous photographer who becomes
involved, both personally and professionally, with an ambitious
young editor (Radha Mitchell) at a chi-chi manhattan magazine. In
the film's pivotal role, Sheedy is all wired intensity and wary
irony. Rated R for language, drug use, nudity and sex. 1 hour, 42
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mafia! PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Francis Ford Coppola is sobbing. But his masterpiece,
``The Godfather,'' isn't the only movie to take a hit in this
ridiculous spoof by writer/director Jim Abrahams, part of the trio
who brought us ``Airplane!'' and the ``Naked Gun'' series. There
are also jabs at ``Casino'' and ``Il Postino.'' Lloyd Bridges plays
the head of a crime family; Jay Mohr (``Jerry Maguire'') is his
ruthless son. Rated PG-13 for profanity, violence and drug content.
1 hour, 33 minutes. (Knight Ridder Newspapers) Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). Rated PG-13 for
violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>

   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. Rated R for
violence and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The fine supporting cast
includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for vulgar language,
sexual situations, some nudity and sexual references. 1 hour, 40
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. Rated PG for mild profanity and alcohol
use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   (pi) R
</P>
<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to eighth-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or God. Named
best director at Sundance, Aronovsky is clearly a talent to be
watched. Rated R for vulgar language and grotesque violence. 1
hour, 25 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Polish Wedding PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Though it's playing the art-house circuit, this is more like a
``Moonstruck'' wannabe than anything Christina Ricci has done
lately. In Detroit, a large first-generation Polish family wrestles
with everything from adultery to teen pregnancy. Director Theresa
Connelly's debut film may be shaky and cliched, but her strong cast
(Lena Olin, Gabriel Byrne, Claire Danes) comes to her rescue. Rated
PG-13 for sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City, N.J., cop
who finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camera work and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour,
58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Though the feature film continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV
series offers more gore and profanity, it never accelerates to that
stratospheric level of action, suspense or awe that we hope for in
a summer movie. As FBI agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and
Gillian Anderson take a smooth step up from television to the big
screen. Rated PG-13 for mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours,
2 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked

 &HT;    Dc Talk walks the walk on racial harmony
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most music fans know dc Talk through its music.
</P>
<P>
   Its last studio album, ``Jesus Freak,'' went platinum and netted
the trio a 1996 Grammy for best rock gospel album. The group also
won a 1997 Grammy for its live album, ``Welcome to the Freak
Show,'' and a 1993 Grammy for its album ``Free at Last.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people know about the group's campaign to promote racial
unity. This interracial trio created the ERACE (Eliminating Racism
and Creating Equality) Foundation last year to promote what dc Talk
members call ``living integration.''
</P>
<P>
   They have promoted ERACE through public service announcements
and speaking engagements. And they now plan to build a house for
gang members in Long Beach, Calif. _ a meeting place for those who
want to use the Bible to help them leave gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   The trio opened their national ERACE tour in Atlanta in June.
Trio member Toby McKeehan talked with Cox News Service about ERACE
and dc Talk's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why did dc Talk create the ERACE Foundation?
</P>
<P>
   A:It was obvious that we had the right to say this, considering
we're an interracial group. For a long time, we spoke out through
our music and just lived integration. We've worked together for 10
years and we now have this privilege of saying, ``This can work,
not only on an artistic but a business level.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why is integration so important to dc Talk?
</P>
<P>
   A:It grew out of our friendship. We know that it can work.
People often talk about being colorblind, but I don't want to be
colorblind. I want to recognize all the colors and appreciate the
beauty that they bring to society.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's happening with dc Talk right now?
</P>
<P>
   A:We're finishing our new record. It'll come out in September.
And we'll do a big tour in January.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's the musical style for this record?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's definitely along the lines of ``Jesus Freak.'' It's a
diverse record. (Laughs.) We're the band that's ever reinventing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any radical departure in music from (``Jesus Freak'')?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'll just say that we are venturing creatively. I'll just save
it for the ears.

 &HT;    Religious dating services are growing as the faithful go
high-tech in finding partners.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Life looked good for Ken Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   At 40 years old, Edwards was a dentist who had built a
comfortable upper middle-class existence around his Christian faith
and his family, a wife of 19 years and three children.
</P>
<P>
   But his world collapsed in 1992 when his marriage ended in a
bitter divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to rebound, enrolling in divorce recovery classes and
joining his church's singles ministry. But life was difficult and
lonely in his new role as a middle-aged bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the 'What if?' game,'' Edwards, 48, said. ```Could I
have done better? Why am I such a failure?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he joined a Christian dating service, Equally Yoked, and
was introduced to a woman whose husband had died two years earlier
after 20 years of marriage. On their first date, Edwards took the
woman, Cathy Reed, to an Italian restaurant. They talked for hours,
until 2 in the morning, about their families and childhood and
about their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was so excited after this first meeting, he called Reed
on his car phone and talked to her for another hour as he drove
home.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, they were married on a beach in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Popular wisdom suggests church and other such houses of worship
are the best places for singles to meet potential mates. But
religious dating services are growing in popularity as the faithful
take a high-tech approach to finding soulmates.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of such services are popping up across the country and
most can be found on the Internet. Christian Meeting Point, Faith
Mates and Soul Attraction are a few of the services that can be
found on your computer. Many are aimed at specific denominations.
Some are interdenominational. Most offer photos and biographies of
singles interested in finding mates.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, there are two Christian and one Jewish dating
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear from most singles is that dating is hard and
difficult,'' said Lauren Stone, director of Impressions, the Jewish
dating service based in Midtown. ``But when you're Jewish, and you
want to meet someone who is Jewish, it's even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Single adults who have never married are one of the largest and
fastest growing groups of Americans, accounting for one in four
(about 44.2 million) people older than 18, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau. That's twice the number in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church hasn't caught up with demographics,'' said Wayne
Parker, who created Faith, Hope &AMP; Love Online, a Christian dating
service based in Sandy Springs that also offers its services on the
Internet (www.faith-hope-love.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to churches that have thousands of people, and
they'll say that they have only 12 people who show up for their
singles program,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   And since many people think religious compatibility is one of
the keys to a successful relationship, many seem to be turning to
dating services to help them meet potential mates.
</P>
<P>
   The same philosophy holds true for Jewish singles.
</P>
<P>
   Impressions offered Jan Glazer, 44, a quick way to meet a man of
her faith after her first marriage failed. A member of Impressions
introduced Glazer to Glenn Sugarman, 42, at an Impressions party.
Glazer was smitten by Sugarman's darkly handsome features.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the same values, the same spiritual
background,'' said Glazer, who lives in east Cobb. ``My children
are Jewish. I felt like it was important for me to carry over that
Jewish identity in another marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious dating services also tend to filter out people who are
not serious about their faith. Before joining Equally Yoked, for
instance, applicants must be interviewed by the dating service's
staff and sign a ``statement of faith and conduct.'' The statement
demonstrates that the client agrees with basic doctrines of
Christianity, such as belief in the Bible and sexual abstinence
before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can say they're a Christian in a newspaper ad,'' said
Doug Cozart, who works with Equally Yoked. ``But there's really no
gatekeeper. We're the gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a focus on Christian beliefs is what drew Reed, now Cathy
Edwards, to its service.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 43, said she had prayed she would meet a man who was a
strong spiritual leader. She was struck by Ken's spiritual strength
after watching him talk about the importance of his faith on a
viedotape produced by Equally Yoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew where he was, and he knew where he had been,'' she
said. ``It was his love of the Lord that drew me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are drawn to religious dating services because there
seems to be less pressure than going out on a traditional date,
that such services in some cases are simply a means to find
religious fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep expectations manageable,'' said Cozart. ``We
tell people to meet as brothers and sisters in Christ. Don't set
the bar at 8 feet and try to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious dating services have their critics, though. Dick Dunn,
a minister of singles at Roswell United Methodist Church, has
authored six books on launching a successful singles ministry. Dunn
said many religious dating services unwittingly reinforce ``the
whole myth that you need to be coupled to be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn also said religious compatibility is not enough for a good
marriage. He pointed out the divorce rate for Christians is just as
high as non-Christians. In fact, a study done by the
California-based Barna Research Group concluded born-again
Christians and self-described Christian fundamentalists are more
likely than non-Christians to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith alone is not going to help,'' Dunn said. ``It's the
mundane things that can get in the way. We don't agree how to raise
children. We don't agree how to spend money. If faith goes beyond
Sunday, it may work.''
</P>
<P>
   A year into their marriage, Ken and Cathy Edwards said their
faith and marriage are still working. Cathy still gushes about Ken
like a newlywed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first night, I knew he was special,'' she said of
their first date. ``He ended up being everything that I could
imagine.''

CHINESE PREPARE TO DESTROY DIKES TO EASE FLOODWATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a desperate attempt to contain the worst flooding
of the Yangtze River since 1954, Chinese authorities evacuated more
than half a million people in central Hubei province while
preparing Friday to blast dikes to dissipate raging waters.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding from torrential rainfall of up to seven times normal
levels in central and eastern China this summer has claimed more
than 2,000 lives since June, according to official figures, but
some non-governmental groups estimate casualties are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of dikes along the Yangtze, the overflow of the
world's third-longest river has affected 28 provinces and cities
and 240 million people _ one in five Chinese citizens, or a
population the size of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 million people have been left homeless by landslides,
mudslides and toppled buildings, and an estimated 65 million acres
of crops _ or one-sixth of China's farmland _ have been damaged or
destroyed, according to Fan Bojun, vice minister of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding is an annual occurrence in China that has taken
millions of lives over the centuries, especially along the river
dubbed ``China's Sorrow,'' because of its flooding.
</P>
<P>
   A disaster relief worker with years of experience with war and
famine in Somalia and Rwanda who was reached by telephone Friday in
Yunnan province, said she was shocked by the extent of devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible'' to see ``the amount of water. You look
down and see just the roofs of buildings. People have put plastic
sheeting on top of a five-story building and are living on top of
that,'' Montserrat Batllo, China country manager for international
relief group Doctors Without Borders, said of the flooding in Hunan
province, where she was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people are living in tents atop narrow dikes in
scorching daytime heat, some for as long as 50 days without access
to safe drinking water or sewage facilities, she said. Cases of
dysentery, respiratory infections, and eye disease are rising. In
Zaotong, Yunnan province, two hospital buildings have been swept
away, leaving no facililities for dressing, sterilization, or
laundry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions are appalling,'' said Alyson Froud, Doctors Without
Borders' medical coordinator in Hunan province. ``We need to get
these people off the dikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there is nowhere for them to go. Meanwhile,
people are contaminating the river and groundwater with feces, and
floods have washed away the harvest for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   China's longest flood season on record has already caused some
$5 billion in damage and is expected to shave between half a
percent and 1 percent off China's gross domestic product this year,
government officials said. The fertile Yangtze River basin supports
40 percent of the nation's agricultural and industrial output and
is home to one third of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Worst-hit regions are now accessible only by boat, and transport
in much of central China is at a virtual standstill, authorities
said. The Yangtze snakes 3,900 miles from Qinghai province in far
western China to the eastern port of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Hubei authorities Friday imposed a 6:30 p.m. curfew in Gongan
county, some 120 miles west of the provincial capital of Wuhan, as
they awaited orders to explode dikes to divert floodwaters from the
city of several million. Also Friday in central Jiangxi province,
residents were urged to evacuate Jiujiang city after flooding
breached a major dike and submerged parts of the city under 6 1/2
feet of water, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels in the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze, the most
treacherous and winding section of the river, on Thursday surpassed
levels recorded in 1954, when flooding killed 30,000. Far fewer
people have perished in the current disaster, because of stronger
dikes, improved transport, and rescue facilities and better
early-warning systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucks, railways, helicopters were hardly available in rural
China in 1954. ... And from our point of view, we have seen the
government of China go all out to assist people worst hit,'' said
Doctors Without Borders' press officer Justine Geldard, who praised
authorities for providing $316 million worth of emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   Relief groups working with authorities are distributing food,
medicine, prescription drugs, water purification tablets, and
chlorine to combat unsanitary conditions. Geldard described a
floating mess of ``dead rats, fish, farm animals, and human feces''
in the aftermath of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   One relief worker who asked not to be named said that when
floods ravaged Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic last summer,
``it didn't look any better than China. It was just on a smaller
scale. The Chinese are dealing not with hundreds of thousands, but
with millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Standard Friday attributed flooding to erosion
caused by rampant deforestation, and slammed China for not taking
better preventative measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the many millions affected by floods were to pay a small
tax each year ... much can be done on reforestation ... as well as
removing the silt from the riverbed,'' the paper said in an
editorial. The controversial Three Gorges Dam is scheduled to be
completed by 2009, but the Standard said damming alone _ without
providing alternatives to illegal logging or enforcing
environmental protection laws _ will never solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   China's state media reported that a number of officials will be
punished for fleeing the flooding or refusing to help bolster
levees.
</P>
<P>
   China has forbidden reporters from visiting flood-ravaged areas
to verify official reports and casualties. Authorities have
detained those who have ventured there anyway, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Anhui province in central China is now girding for disaster as
the Yangtze rages from the west and Typhoon Otto slams the east
coast of China, according to the People's Daily. The unusual
rainfall is being attributed to last year's El Nino effect, and
meteorologists forecast that five to seven more typhoons will hit
China in the next three months, Xinhua reported.
</P>
<P>
   Vian Lai, public relations officer of World Vision Hong Kong, an
international relief group, described tremendous suffering in a
flood-stricken area she visited in Jiangxi province. She saw
waterlines at waist height in people's homes, and met a sick,
teenaged orphan whose grandmother lost her savings in the flood,
and whose plight seemed emblematic of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no money and no food. It was truly a `heavenly
disaster, earthly calamity,''' she said, quoting a Chinese proverb.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa Friday praised the
millions of Chinese citizens and soldiers who are frantically
bolstering river embankments, and appealed to Hong Kong residents
to donate to relief efforts. The Hong Kong government has set aside
$1.15 million for flood relief, he said.

 &HT;    For one Atlanta couple, the solution to juggling work and home
is one large warehouse
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Stephen and Terry Drahos knew all the pluses of
working from home. After all, they had done that while renting for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding two years ago to buy a place big enough for both
raising a family and running two businesses proved another story.
That is, until they stumbled upon a warehouse in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking for a warehouse but couldn't find a house
that met our needs,'' Terry Drahos said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,500-square-foot red-brick building held tons of space for
her frame shop, Stephen's law practice and a home for them and
their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Even their new neighbors supported their plans, which required
the typically controversial rezoning of the property for commercial
use. ``But they kept asking us, `Dutch Valley Road? You want to
live there?''' Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction was just the beginning of it. Despite the growing
market among young, mostly single professionals for lofts in
downtown warehouses, the Drahos family faced several major hurdles:
downgrading the property's industrial zoning, securing an
affordable mortgage and insuring the mixed-use site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unheard of. It was like we were being penalized for
doing something off the wall, when it's an age-old concept in large
cities up north,'' recalled Terry, who grew up in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after unraveling all the red tape, the family has renovated
the cavernous building into a bright, urban setting ideal for the
dual-career couple struggling to spend more time with their kids.
And it even comes with a view of neighboring Piedmont Park and the
skyline to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all a battle, but a lot better than owning three
places,'' Terry observed.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had shared a similar setup in a rental house in
Buckhead. ``The other place was a test drive, so we pretty much
knew what we were doing,'' said Terry, 38. ``It all had worked so
well, we were hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1996, when the house was sold and they lost their lease,
they set out to buy. The location had to be in town, with
commercial zoning and reputable schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, they had difficulty finding a real estate
agent willing to devote the time necessary for finding such a
place. As a result, Terry figures that she scouted 20 to 30
properties.
</P>
<P>
   After turning to commercial properties, they discovered Dutch
Valley Road, a short dead-end street of small warehouses and
offices off Monroe Drive. Because the street was zoned industrial,
the property needed to be reclassified as commercial, which allows
residential use. ``In industrial zones, you can do anything _ put
in a junk yard, a chicken processing plant _ just not a home,''
Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest opposition was from banks. Because the property
would house her framing business as well as his law office, the
couple could not qualify for a residential loan. At $342,500, the
price was a steal, but a commercial mortgage required them to put
20 percent down _ some four times more than they would on a house.
(They estimate they've invested another $30,000 in renovations.)
</P>
<P>
   Insurance for a building housing both a home and businesses
proved another hassle. ``They didn't know where to put us,'' Terry
said of the companies. They finally secured a commercial policy
with a rider for residential coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The final hurdle arose after the purchase. By then, the Summer
Olympics were beginning, and construction activity surrounding the
event made contractors scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the roadblocks, the move offered more positives than
negatives. Because the building formerly housed photography
studios, the warehouse offered some unexpected amenities: a
kitchen, four bathrooms, a dark room and a garage.
</P>
<P>
   A receptionist area leads on one side to her business, Odyssey
Frame Shop, and on the other, to his law office. In between, a
corridor extends to two large rooms at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is one long space with living and dining areas,
defined by furniture groupings, with a small kitchen nestled under
a storage loft. An adjoining room houses Terry's work area and the
family room, which allows her to keep an eye on sons, David, 6, and
James, 2. Above that room is a small loft where the couple created
two bedrooms, for themselves and the boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Drahoses did much of the renovations themselves, except for
the biggest project _ opening the rear brick wall to create three
large windows. ``It was like living in a cave before we did that,''
said Stephen, 43.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected perk lay just beyond the kudzu banks of Orme
Creek, which runs beneath the windows. There, surrounding a city
sewer facility bordering Piedmont Park are more than 20 acres of
designated green space. ``So nothing can ever be built behind us
and block our view,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, she and her husband maintained much of the warehouse
look by sandblasting white paint from the brick walls. They've
decorated them with contemporary paintings, family photographs and
framing displays.
</P>
<P>
   The Drahoses also took steps to make the building more energy
efficient _ especially after receiving their first electric bill.
``We said, 'Whoa, over $1,000?' '' Terry recalled. Their monthly
utilities, including gas, water and electricity, now average $500.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting that is the $1,500 per month the couple figure they
save by not owning or renting three spaces. There's also the
savings in child care and transportation to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   With children, the Drahoses acknowledged, there is the
disadvantage of having no yard (they're planning a deck and a roof
garden) and no neighborhood for the kids to roam.
</P>
<P>
   But the warehouse has brought more solutions than challenges in
juggling careers and households.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, once past their dismay at the amount of space, are
realizing the potential, Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everyone seems to be waking up to the idea.''

WORD FROM BOEING DUE NEXT WEEK ON 737 PLANS  
 ATTN: WICHITA, ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. plans to announce next week whether it will
establish a next-generation 737 production line at its under-used
factory in Long Beach, Calif., and several people familiar with the
plans said Thursday it is all but certain the work will be done
there.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report recommending the new assembly operations in
California has been prepared but has not been given the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute issues are still being worked out, including
negotiations with leaders of Boeing's largest union, which strongly
opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   California government officials ``have bent over backwards'' to
provide Boeing with economic incentives to add a 737 assembly line
at Long Beach, The Post-Intelligencer was told.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing senior vice president Fred Mitchell warned a team of
managers working on the 737 study Thursday to disregard ``media
speculation'' and emphasized ``we have not yet completed our
business case and we have not yet made a decision on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president for
airplane production, wrote: ``We are still testing logistics,
working with the unions who represent employees in the Puget Sound
and Long Beach areas, and working with government officials as part
of our study. Those open items are complex, and we have to work
through them before the business case, either way, is confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 737 study will be completed and a decision announced
within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the plans said the company is scheduled
to announce next Thursday its decision to set up the Long Beach
line. In addition, the company will announce a consolidation of
facilities - primarily defense and space - throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days Boeing will truck 737 wings from its
Renton factory to Long Beach to determine how costly the trip would
be, how long the journey would take and to pinpoint the best route.
</P>
<P>
   The company conducted a similar experiment a few weeks ago, when
it sent by train a mock-up fuselage of its longest 737 aircraft
from its Wichita, Kan., factory to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already makes fuselages in Wichita and ships them to
Renton for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is preparing a production bay in Long Beach
previously used to build McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets to
accommodate assembly of next-generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-ton crane is being installed to help move 737 aircraft
assemblies, and a three-story mezzanine structure is being built in
the the assembly area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are setting up an assembly line that will be identical to
the Renton 737 assembly line,'' said Boeing spokesman John Thom in
Long Beach. ``It's prudent to be ready for a 737 line but
everything is contingent upon a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 737 assembly operations could begin in California as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in May that it is sending some 737-model
aircraft to its Douglas Products Division for finishing work to
ease its overburdened Renton aircraft factory.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that the Long Beach plant ``can provide
some relief, because we don't have enough people or space for all
the work'' in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-based union has argued that establishing an
assembly line in California would be the equivalent of
subcontracting work to non-Machinist members.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, was not available for comment Thursday but a union
spokesman said talks with the company are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting between the union and Boeing officials is set
for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If a 737 assembly line were established in California, it would
focus on final assembly of airplanes such as the Boeing Business
Jet and the cargo version of the jet, which have significantly
different configurations from the next-generation 737s ordered by
airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing would consider doing assembly work on the
737-900 model in Long Beach and possibly other versions of the
next-generation airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, Boeing officials have said the
Renton factory will still be used as the primary final assembly
location for 737 and 757 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If the company goes ahead with a new production line in Long
Beach, it would be the first time Boeing has established commercial
aircraft final-assembly operations outside the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the Long Beach factory when it acquired
McDonnell Douglas last year.
</P>
<P>
   California politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, have been
lobbying hard for Boeing to save aerospace jobs in that state after
the company announced earlier this year that it would consolidate
its space operations in Southern California and end production of
three McDonnell Douglas jets now made at the Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 Boeing jobs in Southern California could be lost
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The California Trade and Commerce Agency has been quietly
working behind the scenes with Boeing on a multimillion-dollar
package of economic incentives to encourage the Seattle-based
aerospace giant to permanently shift some 737 work from Renton to
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency declined to discuss details of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city, Boeing and the
state are still discussing the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find every incentive we are qualified for to
make sure we have a package they (Boeing) like. But it's still be
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not comment on details of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach plant is located in one of the state's so-called
``enterprise zones,'' and Boeing would be eligible for significant
tax breaks if it established a new assembly line there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, our enterprise zone program is one of our most
powerful economic tools,'' said Jerry Miller, deputy city manager
in Long Beach who until recently headed the city's Economic
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been part of the on-going discussions between Boeing
and the state over the package of economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at liberty to say much about the package,'' he said
Thursday. ``It's fair to say, though, that Long Beach has been very
much involved, as has the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic incentive package would be in addition to the tax
breaks now available to Boeing in the enterprise zone. Boeing is
the largest of some 10,000 companies located within the zone. They
are all eligible for state tax credits on purchases of eligible
manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing can get a state tax credit on 100 percent of
the 8.5 percent California sales tax paid on up to $20 million of
the eligible manufacturing equipment purchased each year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it could cost Boeing as much as $1 billion in
tooling to start a 737 production line in Long Beach. Boeing has
refused to say what those tooling costs might be.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also gets a tax credit in the enterprise zone of $26,910
over a five-year period for every new worker its hires at its Long
Beach plant. The workers must be full-time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many workers would be needed for the 737 work
in Long Beach, but Boeing spokesman Thom estimated 400 to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrick Legg, president of the local unit of the United
Aerospace Workers, said be believes a new 737 line would save most
of the union jobs Boeing plans to eliminate.

LEWINSKY TESTIMONY KNOWLEDGE VITAL TO CLINTON LEGAL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects school where Douglas Kmiec, a Reagan administration
adviser on constitutional law, teaches.)    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his legal team will be using
all their contacts and resources to learn what Monica S. Lewinsky
told a federal grand jury Thursday, and they will use that
knowledge to shape the president's upcoming testimony before the
same panel, legal analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what they learn in this perfectly legal pursuit,
the president may still try to avoid making any statement to the
grand jury, some analysts speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed late last month to testify on Aug. 17 by video
hook-up from the White House, and he told reporters he was
``anxious'' to answer questions ``completely and truthfully.'' But
on Wednesday, the White House invoked a claim of executive
privilege to block prosecutors from taking testimony from White
House lawyer Lanny Breuer _ a move some analysts said could
foreshadow an attempt by Clinton to apply the same claim of
privilege to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is laying the groundwork for the president to exert
executive privilege,'' speculated Douglas Kmiec, a Reagan
administration adviser on constitutional law who is now a professor
at Pepperdine University. ``I think the president is going to show
up on Aug. 17 and questions will be given to him, but at a critical
point he will say, `Mr. Starr, I'd like to cooperate, but the
interests of government preclude me from doing so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
invoking a privilege against testifying is one of several course of
actions still open to Clinton. Trying to use the privilege to
shield Breuer from testifying ``suggests that the president is not
averse to raising claims to bar information from the grand jury,
and he may then do it himself to keep himself out of it,''
Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Schertler, a former federal prosecutor, took a
narrow view of what information Clinton could withhold under a
claim of executive privilege, saying that privilege usually applies
to matters of government. ``It would not apply to questions about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,'' Schertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive privilege is a controversial power, not mentioned in
the Constitution, that has been occasionally invoked by presidents
to withhold documents or testimony on secret or sensitive matters
from Congress and courts. Raising it might allow Clinton to avoid
testifying without invoking a Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination, a move that some Republican lawmakers have
asserted could be grounds for impeachment in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the Fifth'' might also paint Clinton, in the public
eye, as a kind of criminal figure. ``The Fifth Amendment reminds
people of Jimmy Hoffa testifying to a committee. It tarnishes the
presidency,'' Kmiec said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is some evidence courts might accept a claim of
executive privilege. The US Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia has rejected claims that the attorney-client privilege
shields White House lawyers from testifying in the Lewinsky matter,
Rothstein said, but on two occasions the court suggested it might
be open to a claim of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had apparently agreed to testify before it became known
that prosecutors had obtained a dress from Lewinsky that might
contain physical evidence of a sexual liaison between the president
and the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the dress may have Clinton rethinking his
agreement to testify, several analysts speculated. Faced with ``he
said-she said'' testimony about a romantic link between Clinton and
Lewinsky, and possible attempts to cover it up, prosecutors could
use evidence from the dress, if it exists, to challenge the
president's version of the events.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team will base some decisions about the
president's testimony on information they obtain about Lewinsky's
statements to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a White House lawyer, I'd be calling up (Lewinsky
counsel) Plato Cacheris and taking him out to dinner, breakfast and
lunch,'' said Schertler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet the White House will make an effort to get sources
in the courthouse to find out what she said, and to craft that
testimony in response,'' said Kmiec, who is on leave from Notre
Dame to teach at Pepperdine University in California, the same
school that extended a job to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
Among other things, the White House will want to know if
prosecutors obtained testimony from Lewinsky or other witnesses
that can be used to lay traps for Clinton during his own testimony,
perhaps to induce statements from the president that prosecutors
can later claim amount to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   It would be legal, analysts said, for Clinton and Lewinsky to
have arranged a joint defense agreement in which each gives the
other details of any statements to prosecutors or the grand jury.
Starr, in fact, has no powers to block Lewinsky from telling
Clinton's lawyers what she said to the grand jury, Schertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as part of an immunity agreement, Starr could not have
forced Lewinsky to withhold details of her testimony from Clinton's
team, Schertler said. ``It's the opposite side of the principle
that prevents someone from influencing witnesses or obstructing
justice,'' he said. Silencing a witness ``interferes with the
defense's right to investigate a case.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)  
 (af)  
 By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the space of two years, it appears that Fidelity Investments
has gone from eating crow to having something to crow about.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended June 30, Fidelity's United States equity
funds, weighted by asset size, were the top performers among the
industry's 10 biggest fund companies, according to Kanon Bloch
Carre, a fund consulting firm in Boston. A year ago, the Fidelity
funds ranked third. And the year before that, they were dead last
among the 10 largest groups.
</P>
<P>
   The improved performance follows Fidelity's high-profile
reorganizations of staff and policies in the last two years. Most
publicly, Jeffrey Vinik, the manager of the Magellan fund, the
company's flagship, left Fidelity and was replaced by Robert E.
Stansky.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kanon Bloch, Fidelity's United States diversified
stock funds, which exclude global, foreign and sector funds,
delivered an average total return of 26.4 percent in the latest
period.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other large fund outfits, Vanguard Group was second,
with gains of 25.8 percent, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was
third, at 25.6 percent. Franklin Templeton was last of the 10
groups, at 17.5 percent. The return of the average United States
equity fund for the period was 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Kanon Bloch study offered more good news for
Fidelity. Through the end of July, only 18 percent of domestic
growth and growth-and-income funds outperformed the Vanguard Index
500 fund, which mirrors the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. But
a fat 45 percent of the total assets of those winning funds was
managed by Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is shocking to me _ to have that large a percentage of
the assets beating the S&AMP;P to be in one family,'' said William
Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch. ``Of course, we all know why:
It's because of Magellan and Contrafund.''
</P>
<P>
   Magellan and Contrafund are the industry's No. 1 and No. 6 funds
in assets, with $74.6 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively. They
have rebounded from below-average performance since Fidelity
installed Stansky at Magellan, overhauled Contrafund by, among
other things, refocusing it on large-capitalization stocks, and
closed both funds to new investors to limit growth.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended June 30, Magellan and Contrafund
returned 29 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively. Fidelity Growth
and Income, the No. 5 fund with $45.3 billion in assets, was just
slightly less impressive, returning 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the average large-capitalization blend fund, which
invests in stocks with either growth or value characteristics,
returned 25.8 percent in the period, according to Morningstar Inc.,
the financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at Fidelity also included the promotion early last
year of its general counsel, Robert C. Pozen, to president of the
Fidelity Management Research Co., its asset-management arm. Pozen
began a series of changes to bolster the company's fundamental
stock research and free its portfolio managers from administrative
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone back to their roots,'' said Eric Kobren,
executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an investment newsletter
published in Boston. ``They understand that they make money by
stock-picking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozen said the turnaround was attributable not only to
Fidelity's biggest offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Magellan and Contrafund,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Cracow, Poland, where he was on vacation.
``We have a whole group of other managers who have done just a
terrific job.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other funds, he cited Dividend Growth, Emerging Growth and
the Fidelity Fund as having turned in superior one-year
performances.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? ``There's been no one magic bullet,'' Pozen
said. The staunching of Fidelity's once-frantic turnover of fund
managers has certainly been a factor, he said, as has the creation
of a senior management team that has shouldered responsibility for
trading, marketing and computer systems _ tasks that used to fall
to portfolio managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pozen has also reorganized the research department, whose
research director, William R. Ebsworth, is now focused on domestic
fundamental research. Areas like quantitative, technical and
foreign research are now under the purview of others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinik, the manager of Magellan when it sank to bottom-quartile
performance in 1996, made a big and unsuccessful asset-allocation
play _ an ill-timed move out of stocks and into bonds. Now, Kobren
said, ``they are concentrating more on stock-picking than on sector
or asset-allocation bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobren said Fidelity's fund managers had avoided troubled areas
of the market, like energy stocks, while overweighting more buoyant
sectors like financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Kanon Bloch's data are based on asset-weighted performance,
which gives more credit to funds with more assets. Dougherty said
he took this approach because more shareholders benefit when a big
fund does well than when a small one does.
</P>
<P>
   This method also helps pit giant fund complexes against one
another, instead of against smaller, nimbler firms. Fidelity and
Vanguard are the largest and second-largest groups in the industry,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer size has benefited Fidelity in another way, Kobren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large portion of their success has to do with the largeness
of some of their funds, which by dent of their size are forced to
invest in the larger-cap area of the market,'' he said.
Large-capitalization stocks have been wildly outperforming small
and midsize issues for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren said that while Fidelity's recent results were
encouraging, ``I don't agree that short-term performance like this
should be read as something extremely significant.'' He said it
would take several years to judge all the changes Fidelity has
made.

JOBS REPORT SHOWS SLOWER BUT STILL ROBUST GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a slower but still
robust pace last month and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5
percent, the Labor Department reported Friday. Continued strong
employment growth in service industries more than offset the damage
that Asia's woes are inflicting on manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers added 66,000 jobs to their payrolls in July, the
lowest monthly level in two-and-half years. But the figure was
distorted by the strike against General Motors, which was settled
late in the month after idling more than 140,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that without the temporary effects of the GM
strike the payroll increase would have been above 200,000, a slight
slowdown from the pace of job creation earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The figures provided further but by no means definitive evidence
that the economy may be gradually cooling off, reducing concerns
about an outbreak of inflation without raising any serious risk of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after a gut-wrenching 299-point drop in stock prices on
Tuesday and several subsequent days of sweaty palms on Wall Street,
the report reassured investors that the economy remains basically
stable despite the confusing and sometimes conflicting forces, from
Asia's downturn to the buoyancy of consumer spending, that have
left the outlook unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining as much as 132 points, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell back in late trading today and closed 20 points higher
at 8598.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving towards a desirable soft landing, but we're not
quite there yet,'' said M. Cary Leahey, an economist at High
Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of the year, the economy added an average
of 245,000 non-farm jobs a month, heightening concern that
employers would have to bid up wages to attract workers, setting
off an inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Leahey said that July's underlying job gain of around 207,000
was consistent with an economy growing at between 2.5 percent and 3
percent a year, still high enough at the current low unemployment
rate to make inflation a threat, at least in the view of many
Federal Reserve officials.
</P>
<P>
   A slowing of job growth to around 150,000 a month, Leahey said,
would suggest a moderation in growth to around 2.25 percent, within
the Fed's non-inflationary ``speed limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy slowed to a 1.4 percent growth rate in the
second quarter from 5.5 percent in the first three months of the
year, most economists see growth in the second half of the year
running at an annual pace of between 2 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking aspect of the report was the wide gulf between
the strong growth in jobs in consumer-oriented service jobs,
especially retailing, and the slide in employment among
manufacturers, who are having trouble exporting to Asia and are
facing increasing competition from imports from that part of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Service industries created 229,00 jobs during the month,
including 125,000 in retailing. Manufacturers, by contrast, shed
176,000 jobs during the month, including those lost temporarily to
the GM strike; even after adjusting for the effects of the strike,
the manufacturing job loss was about 20,000 jobs in July, in line
with the scale of the manufacturing downturn throughout most of
this year. Last year manufacturers added an average of 20,000 jobs
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing and services are in two different worlds,'' said
Cliff Waldman, an economist with the National Federation of
Independent Businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that wage gains appear to be moderating or
holding steady. Average hourly earnings in July increased 3 cents,
or 0.2 percent, to $12.79, although the gain might have been
slightly greater in the absence of the GM strike.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months earnings have increased at a 4.2 percent
annual pace, matching its pace over the 12 months ended in June and
slightly lower than its annual pace in April and May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has been in a stage of heightened alert for
inflation since March, but has held off on raising interest rates,
both because there are no signs that inflation is actually taking
root and because any increase in rates in the United States could
further destabilize already shaky financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report is unlikely to lead the Fed to change its stance
at its next meeting on Aug. 18, analysts said. They said the
central bank would wait for more conclusive evidence that the
economy is slowing to a non-inflationary rate before dropping its
formal bias towards higher rates as its next most likely move.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they said, Fed officials were sure to track
closely the tug of war between those sectors of the economy that
are being hit by the combination of the strong dollar and Asia's
difficulties and those being driven by the domestic consumer's
confidence and willingness to spend. The Fed reported Friday that
consumer installment credit in June jumped $6.7 billion _ a 6.4
percent annual pace _ indicating that consumers remained willing to
borrow to continue their long spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think consumers are about to become more cautious,
reflecting the slowdown in wage growth and record-low savings. But
others see few signs of consumer moderation and think
service-sector job growth will continue to put pressure on wages
even as manufacturing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's job report ``indicates only the most minor slowdown in
labor demand, almost exclusively in the manufacturing sector,''
said Ian Shepherdson, an economist with HSBC Securities. ``There is
nothing in this report to support the idea that a wider slowdown is
gathering pace.''

SOME OF JAPAN'S BAD DEBTS ARE BECOMING INVESTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic showing bad debt in Japan and U.S. is being sent
to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Norie Nishikawa scans the parking lot and walks into the
apartment complex, moving quickly to a mailbox. She pokes the
letters she finds there, noting the return addresses, especially
the ones from collection agencies, before a building clerk asks her
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, she snaps a roll of pictures and is off, jotting down
notes on everything from maintenance problems to hints of the
presence of gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nishikawa and hundreds of brokers like her are working
alongside American investment banks to transform Japan's mountain
of bad debt and depressed property into an investment opportunity _
and, some experts hope, to reverse Japan's long economic slide.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, acquiring Japan's bad real-estate debt is a big
gamble even at sale prices, but, if successful, it could help shore
up the foundations of the Japanese economy and reassure markets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Americans and other foreigners are moving in to buy
``packages'' of the bad loans held by Japanese banks, for around 10
cents on the dollar, and then trying to sell the collateral that
backed the loans. They hope to either get an immediate profit or
else hold on and enjoy big gains when the property market picks up.
</P>
<P>
   The dividends throughout the economy could be substantial: If
foreign investors help increase liquidity in the Japanese property
market, the banks could get rid of some of the nation's bad debt _
which is estimated at anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   If property prices turn around, confidence in the economy could
soar, and this could put new pressures on yakuza, as Japanese
gangsters are called, who have been occupying many properties _
sometimes at the behest of property owners who want to discourage
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole economy is frozen because everyone thinks there's a
yakuza in every garage,'' Jack Rodman, the national director for
Asia at E&AMP;Y Leventhal Real Estate, said.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, investors here and abroad hope that the infusion
of interest and cash could bolster the real-estate market and help
bring an end to eight years of paralysis in the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very active market, a very healthy market,'' Rodman
said, though he added that it is fraught with frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The government intends to give the emerging market for bad
Japanese debts a push in the fall with a blueprint called the Total
Plan that will encourage banks to part with their loans, partly by
easing the process for them to sell collateralized properties at
the government auction.
</P>
<P>
   (On Friday, Keizo Obuchi, the new prime minister, announced a
series of measures to stimulate the economy in his first major
policy speech since he took office. He proposed tax cuts and public
spending to spur the economy in the short term, but offered few
details.)
</P>
<P>
   Already, over the last 18 months, many foreign companies have
flooded into the business of combing the bad-debt market and
bidding up prices for the depressed land. So far, however, the
profits and the number of transactions have been limited and they
seem not to have done as well as they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in thinking it was a good business and everyone had
their home office calling up and saying: Why haven't you done a
deal yet?'' said an American investment banker who is involved in
such sales but refused to be identified. ``There is no market.
These sales don't represent a market.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the foreign companies make any money, their
activity could still help rescue Japan's troubled economy as they
create a new business: wrapping up the bad debt into a tradable
security.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is helping put the packaged transactions together,
advising Japanese banks how to take bad loans, bundle them in
groups of up to 300 loans and sell them for a bit of cash and a lot
of tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists like Rodman note that the method is similar to the way
the United States extricated itself from the savings and loan
debacle of the 1980s. One key difference, though, is that the U.S.
government set up Resolution Trust Corp. to clean up the crisis in
five years, which is about as long as the Japanese have taken just
to talk about the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from clear whether the plan will work as well in
Japan as it did in the United States. For starters, Japan's bad
loans are worse than the United States' bad loans were. Japan also
is dependent for buyers not on local people _ who generally have
not touched the stuff _ but on the fickle appetites of foreigners,
mostly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bundles of bad Japanese loans have already attracted
significant interest: midsized real-estate investors, as well as
blue-chip names like Merrill Lynch; Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley,
and Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   After Japan's bubble economy, which had been built on inflated
real-estate values, burst in 1990, banks and property owners hung
onto bad loans even as prices fell. The entire property market
congealed and banks became stuck with bad assets. But they often
did not demand repayment for fear of putting their longtime clients
into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a freezing situation that was comfortable to both'' the
banks and their borrowers, said Kiichi Miyazawa, who was appointed
finance minister in July and is a former prime minister. Miyazawa
added, however, that Japan was now beginning to address the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of Japan's real-estate market is central to the
restoration of health of the finance sector and the economy as a
whole. But for now, bad loans remain the fundamental source of
economic disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Properties in Japan have lost up to 90 percent of their value in
some locations, so Japanese banks have been reluctant to sell
collateral at cut-rate prices and lock in huge losses, or to turn
their backs on long-time clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing the banks,'' said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, who
resigned recently as parliamentary vice finance minister. ``There
should be a variety of ways of resolving the bad debt, and the
largest part should be through sales, bulk sales or singles sales _
straight sales to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks have been selectively selling their
collateralized properties at public auctions and private sales,
already removing billions of dollars' worth of bad loans from their
balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper,
estimated that the face value of the transactions might have
reached $28 billion, and bankers involved in such sales say that
estimate is reasonable. If so, the sum is equivalent to nearly
one-third of the official accounting of unrecoverable loans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A typical sale works this way: A Japanese bank assembles a giant
package of many bad loans, some backed by collateral properties,
some not. The total face value of the package may be worth as much
as a few billion dollars, but the bank sells the package to foreign
investors at a deep discount, anywhere from 5 percent to 50 percent
of the total face value.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the savvier banks first go out and sell the
collateralized properties themselves because they think they can
get a decent return through the government auction process or
private placements. Then they include these unbacked loans in the
package to foreigners free, bundling them along with the
collateralized ones, just to sweep the bad debt off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Selling loans can be a messy business because a collateralized
property may have as many as 50 liens on it, making it hard for the
bank to seize.
</P>
<P>
   And the packaging of the bad debt is a risky undertaking for
everyone involved, in part, investors and brokers say, because of
the yakuza, the Japanese gangsters who control rackets involved in
squatting in troubled properties and small-debt collection, among
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to knock on the door to collect the rent on a new
investment and find the yakuza at home. And while the police may be
able to help in pinpointing a yakuza connection to a particular
property, they sometimes cannot do much until it's too late; few
have forgotten that a Sumitomo Bank executive involved in loan
collection was murdered in 1994, and industry executives suspect
the yakuza.
</P>
<P>
   Many investment bankers say the yakuza connection is exaggerated
and illegal squatting is on the decline because courts are starting
to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the most pressing questions on the mind of every
investor is whether a given piece of property is somehow linked to
the yakuza.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Miss Nishikawa comes in. Her company copies the
auction listings from dog-eared postings at the Tokyo courthouse,
where real-estate auctions are held, and she and her colleagues
dash off to check out the properties and draw up a report for
customers looking to buy homes or buildings on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people might have the image that this kind of property is
involved in the cleanup of unhappy problems,'' said Takami Toriya,
a board director at Tokyo Auction Forum Co., which brokers
properties sold at the government's auction. ``But there are good
properties at any auction. We opened this place in central Tokyo to
try to remove this dark, dangerous and fearsome image.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises because companies that own real estate with
bubble-sized loans sometimes pay for the yakuza or other gangsters
to squat on the property on the theory that they will dissuade the
bank from foreclosing and make the property impossible to sell,
according to experts in Japanese real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bank initiates a foreclosing and tries to evict a tenant
or a loan shark, sometimes trouble happens,'' said Shoichi Honda,
executive vice president at Kennedy-Wilson International, which
helps evaluate mob connections when it appraises properties for
investors. ``When we checked one portfolio, we found 15 percent of
the property contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   One owner of a real-estate company, who bought a collateralized
property at a government auction, acknowledged that he had to call
in mob affiliates to evict squatters in a building he bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The properties put on auction are not such good quality,''
said the real-estate executive, who refused to be identified.
``They've got all kinds of dirty connections. In some cases, the
houses are built illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   That presents another impediment to investors. For example, if
buildings were constructed illegally, without access to the street,
new investors may not get a local license to demolish and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``These properties,'' the real-estate executive added, ``are
actually just trash.''

EX-DEFENSE MINISTER OF FRANCE A TARGET OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A conservative former defense minister of France and an
aide were formally placed under investigation Friday on suspicion
of taking part in a money-laundering scheme to finance their
political party.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Francois Leotard, who considered running
for the French presidency three years ago, emerged from a session
with Investigating Magistrate Laurence Vichnievsky Friday in a
furor, yelling ``a fist in the face'' to a reporter who asked him
what had happened. Under French law, being placed under
investigation is one step short of being formally charged with a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigation, one of scores over the past
decade that have exposed shakedowns, phony front companies and
systematic fraud in the financing of nearly all French political
parties, was focused on 5 million francs _ $830,000 _ in small
bills deposited in a Luxembourg bank for Leotard's Republican Party
in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, lawyers familiar with the case said, the party _
later renamed Liberal Democracy _ received a loan in the same
amount from an obscure Milan bank. The money was needed to finance
the purchase of the party's Paris headquarters, Leotard's
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Jean Veil, said that Leotard denied all the charges
of wrongdoing Friday, as did the aide placed under investigation
with him, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.
</P>
<P>
   After a wave of party financing investigations and indictments,
since 1995 French law has forbidden ``moral persons'' _
corporations and, presumably, the government _ from making
contributions. Allowances are openly provided to established
political parties from public funds.
</P>
<P>
   French press reports have said that Leotard told investigators
the cash had come from savings in special funds provided to the
party by the prime minister's office. The investigating judge is
understood to be pursuing charges that the Milan bank, the Fondo
Sociale di Cooperazione Europea, agreed to be used as a front for
laundering the cash.
</P>

<P>
   The French government budget this year included 48 million
francs _ about $8 million _ in special funds for undisclosed
purposes and 346.7 million francs _ about $57.8 million _ in
designated special funds thought to be for secret service agencies,
Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
   Leotard, 56, was defense minister in the conservative government
of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur from 1993 to 1995. Since 1996,
he has headed the Union of French Democracy, a conservative
umbrella group that fractured earlier this year after some of its
leaders accepted support from the extreme-right National Front in
order to hold power in French regional parliaments. Leotard's own
party left the Union of French Democracy then.
</P>
<P>
   He and Philippe Seguin, the leader of President Jacques Chirac's
Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, announced in May the
formation of a new conservative umbrella group called the Alliance,
in hopes of rebuilding the French right after it lost legislative
elections last year to a leftist coalition headed by Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, a Socialist.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, July 31, the Senate approved, 97-2, a $252 billion
defense spending bill. The bill allows $1.9 billion for U.S. forces
in Bosnia. The Senate rejected a measure to pressure the
administration into withdrawing the troops. Supporters said the
funds will provide resources and flexibility for soldiers in Bosnia
to meet the challenges of living conditions and family separation.
Nobody took the Senate floor to oppose the bill. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LEGAL
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday voted, 255-170, to provide $250 million for
legal aid next year. The Legal Services Corp., which provides this
service for the poor, received $283 million in funding this year.
Supporters said legal aid is an essential service for those who
could not otherwise afford legal counseling. Opponents said the
organization pursues an activist, ideological agenda. A ``yes''
vote would approve the funding.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 201-227, an amendment to the
Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending bill that would
have allotted full funding for the Census Bureau for next year.
Supporters of the amendment said the bureau needs the full funding
to fulfill the Clinton Administration's plan to combine statistical
sampling with the traditional head count in order to account for
people, mostly minorities, that are often overlooked. Opponents
argued that sampling could distort counts and it could enable
politicians to fix numbers to meet their own political needs. A
``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: PROSECUTE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 82-345, an amendment to strike
a provision in the Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending
bill designed to protect citizens from unfair prosecutions by
setting up a Misconduct Review board for unethical prosecutors.
Supporters said the provision was too restrictive on prosecutors
and not an integral part of the spending bill. Opponents said
Americans need a method for fighting back when treated unfairly by
prosecutors. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GAYRIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 176-252, an amendment to the
Commerce, State, Justice and judiciary spending bill that would
have revoked President Clinton's ability to prohibit discrimination
against gays in the federal workplace. Supporters said it was
unfair for Clinton to be able to give special breaks to special
interests. Opponents said taking away Clinton's ability would have
legitimized government-sponsored discrimination. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 252-179, a bill that would reform
the campaign finance system. The measure would ban the unlimited,
unregulated ``soft money'' contributions to political parties,
impose restrictions on issue advertisements mentioning a
candidate's name and increase disclosure requirements. Supporters
said the campaign finance problems stemming from 1996 show that the
system is corrupt and needs an overhaul. Opponents said the bill
infringed on free speech rights guaranteed under the First
Amendment. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

EXPERT ON DYING FINDS LIFE  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Elisabeth Kubler-Ross is still alive. She is
not dying, although she may have considered giving up at one point.
Death, her old friend, has instead been sent packing like an
overripe houseguest. She is doing fine now, and living in a desert
home in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a serious sixth stroke three years ago, and
despite national news stories about her bitter attitude toward a
rapidly approaching death, the 72-year-old woman is again walking,
and even dancing, in the desert around her home. Not bad for a
woman whose very name conjures up death to those who remember her
as the author of the landmark 1969 work ``On Death and Dying'' and
17 other death-related books.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have not forgotten, and who have quietly visited
her this past year, are Muhammad Ali, Britain's Sarah ``Fergie''
Ferguson and a few film stars. Hollywood folks recently have come
by to talk about doing a movie about her life with Susan Sarandon
hinted as the lead role. Plus, the phone rings throughout the day
and the postman brings uncounted thousands of long, interesting,
often unread letters from around the world. She only has time and
energy to read the postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet fame has been well-earned: She has faced death
squarely, up close and during the 1950s and '60s, when death was
the great unmentioned.
</P>
<P>
   She was a country doctor in Switzerland for a short time, then a
hospital psychiatrist in the United States, where she was shocked
to see dying patients isolated in rooms at the end of hallways.
</P>
<P>
   She talked to terminal patients and patted their arms as they
died, nearly following them in. She got the stories from those who
somehow came back. The stories about following the light, moving
through the tunnel, meeting the beings of light: all the repetitive
stories and images that, beginning in the 1970s, would become a new
language of death and the basis for a ``new age'' of mysticism. Her
clinical stories and her books reshaped how we think of death.
</P>
<P>
   She dared the medical establishment to start changing their
ways, to think about emotional support and pain relief for the
dying. She helped bring hospices to America.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Phoenix three and a half years ago to be closer to
her son, Kenneth Ross, after her farm burned in Virginia, possibly
by arson because neighbors didn't approve of her starting a center
there for children with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years of studying death has also given her some ideas
about the meaning of life. Life is for learning, she believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have learned all you have come to learn and taught
all the things you can teach, then you can graduate to the next
level,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry, God will give you what you need to learn. He
gave her a series of strokes that once left her a crumpled shadow
of her old self.
</P>
<P>
   Why? To master the things that she hates: ``patience, surrender,
self-love and all that crap,'' she said, chain-smoking, surveying
her desert acres from her living-room recliner-chair.
</P>
<P>
   For sending her the strokes, she said she called God every name
in the book. ``Take me!'' she says she shouted at him. ``Two years
is a long time to be sitting in a chair, 18 hours a day in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the woman who focused her life on death is now focused on
her own survival.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point was in May of this year and the moment did not
go uncelebrated. About 30 friends and family members had a party by
the teepee and totem pole at Kubler-Ross' home. They sent balloons
up to symbolize the release of the old, negative Elisabeth. They
smoked an Indian pipe of Elisabeth's and announced the birth of the
new, positive Elisabeth.
</P>
<P>
   She never thought she would walk again. At that party, she
danced, very slowly, for the first time in three years. And with 11
different men.
</P>
<P>
   She has begun the hard work of getting her life back. She agreed
to accept a speaking engagement again this fall, her first in more
than three years. Remarkably, she participated in five 10K runs
during the past year _ in a wheelchair pushed by friends. She is
having cosmetic dental work done. A swimming pool is planned for
her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   She is still weak enough that a walk across a room wears her
out, even with a walker. Outside, she uses her wheelchair. She
spends most of her day in her easy chair, often on the phone with
people from the neighborhood or from around the world. She no
longer writes, but her friends hope that her writing, too, will
come back.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of her partial recovery, which she credits in part to a
personal healer, is unconventional, but it fits with the original
styling of her whole life. As she wrote in her 1997 memoir ``Wheel
of Life,'' ``what feels right, not what's expected'' has guided her
decisions. Some of her professional colleagues and her late
ex-husband, Manny Ross, felt that, by the late 1970s, she was
drifting too far from science and too close to mysticism. But
that's where her interests were taking her.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1991 book ``On Life After Death,'' she dismissed the idea
that death even exists, ushering in another boatload of New Age
books about afterlife experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Kubler-Ross, in her luxuriant Swiss accent, railed against the
premature reporting of her death and dying that has been
distributed in the media during the past three years. ``They made
up every story possible: I have had cancer. I am dying _ I have
died _ of everything possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am alive and well and kicking,'' she said, weakly
karate-chopping the air. She wishes she were fit enough to
karate-chop some of the interviewers who have shown up at her door.
While she welcomes many people, she also ``chases more people out
of this house than you can count.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors come seeking photographs, autographs or a glowing blurb
for any new book about to be published on the subject of dying or
the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors cross the line and get the bum's rush. She asked a
German woman to not take flash photos for fear of triggering a
seizure. The lady flashed away, and Kubler-Ross ordered her beloved
assistant, Ana Garcia, to follow her out and take her camera.
Garcia returned trembling, camera in hand, and Kubler-Ross took out
the film. ``Now you can take it back to her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some are surprised to see this feisty, grouchy side of
Elisabeth, friends say. It is, after all, her warmth and
sensitivity that are more visible in her writing.
</P>
<P>
   Among her visitors, however, are also welcome professionals from
the world of medicine and psychiatry, paying respects to one of the
great lights of our era. ``On Death and Dying'' introduced the now
well-known psychological stages of dying: denial, isolation, anger,
bargaining, depression and acceptance, setting a framework for
grief counseling.
</P>
<P>
   As a pioneer in the hospice movement in the United States, she
recounts how the first one took four years to get approved: `` `We
don't want death houses in our area,' the real-estate people would
say.'' Now they are popping up ``like Chicken Delights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubler-Ross was a hospice patient after her stroke until it was
clear that death wasn't on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think she got tired of just sitting,'' said one of
her doctors, Gladys McGarey of Scottsdale, a U.S. pioneer in
alternative medicine who has been a friend for 30 years. ``She is
such a wonderful and dynamic person and it finally got through to
her that the world needed her and God wasn't going to take her now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were people all over the world praying for
her couldn't have hurt, either.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarey and Kubler-Ross give credit to self-trained healer
Joseph Bortniak for getting her on a positive mental track. Twice a
month, Kubler-Ross attends a healing circle he conducts in the
Valley. On Sundays, Bortniak, who is 33 and prefers to go by his
first name only, comes out to the Kubler-Ross home for
individualized healing work.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent healing circle led by Bortniak in a north Scottsdale
New Age bookstore, Kubler-Ross looked 20 years younger than she had
earlier that same day, partly because of a purple silk pants suit,
but more from a constant smile and giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Kubler-Ross is impatient for her full recovery. She says she
would rather die than sit around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she revels in the upbeat presence in her home
of little angels, butterflies and ``E.T.'' dolls.
</P>
<P>
   She saw that movie 15 times and fell in love with the ``E.T.''
alien. ``It was a good example of unconditional love,'' she says.
Another thing to learn before going, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   A great life's work fills the bookcases. But the work is
unfinished. &QL;

MOUNTBATTEN BOMBER IS FREED, OUTRAGING MANY IN BRITAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ To many Britons, the Irish Republican Army's bombing of
the Shadow V pleasure boat on Aug. 27, 1979, was the most shocking
of all the horrors inflicted during the darkest days of the Irish
Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The boat belonged to Lord Mountbatten, Queen Elizabeth's cousin,
and the explosion from the 50-pound bomb detonated from the Irish
coast killed him, his 14-year-old grandson and two other people.
The explosion, which was followed by another bomb on land that
killed 18 paratroopers, also seriously injured three other family
members and did as much as anything to harden the hearts of many
Britons against the IRA and its goal of forcing Britain to
relinquish control of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how much times have changed since then, Thomas
McMahon, the former IRA man who was convicted of preparing and
planting the bomb, on Thursday became one of the first prisoners to
be released since the signing of a peace plan for the war-torn
province in April. The plan, known as the Good Friday agreement,
provides, among other things, for prisoners belonging to terrorist
groups that continue to observe cease-fires to be released from
prison within two years.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, 50, who was one of the longest-serving prisoners in
Ireland, was the seventh inmate to be freed there this month. And
although officials from both sides of the conflict say the release
of prisoners is essential to the peace effort, it remains one of
the most controversial aspects of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible murder, as were all the other murders,''
said Joe Hendron, a member of the moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party, who supports the Good Friday agreement. But, he added,
``for the sake of the future of the young people in Northern
Ireland, I think the agreement must be put into effect.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the release of McMahon, who for the last two years has
been allowed to leave prison for short periods to train as a
carpenter as part of a pre-release program, was met Friday with an
outpouring of anger. For many, it brought back the horrors
surrounding the killing of Mountbatten, the only member of the
British royal family ever to be killed in the 30-year Northern
Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Mountbatten, who presided over India's transition to
independence as Britain's last colonial viceroy there, was spending
the day with guests on his boat in Donegal Bay, near a quiet
fishing village off Ireland's northwest coast, when the bomb went
off. It was detonated at 11:45 a.m. in full view of the police
patrol watching the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Mountbatten _ who was the Prince of Wales'
godfather and mentor, and had introduced the young Princess
Elizabeth to her future husband, Philip, before she became queen _
shocked Britain because it struck so close to the heart of the
royal family and the British establishment. It also helped convince
the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher to take a hardline
stance against the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities said the bombing was the work of a
number of people, McMahon _ who said he renounced all ties to the
IRA several years ago and who had been formally regarded as a
``nonaligned'' prisoner _ was the only person ever convicted of
Mountbatten's murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday opponents of the peace plan said it was an outrage
that any prisoners should be released before both sides gave up
their weapons and while violence from splinter groups opposed to
the peace accord continued.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have prisoners being released, but no decommissioning of
terrorist weapons taking place, no end to violence from
paramilitaries, punishment beatings continuing, murders continuing,
bombings continuing,'' said Jeffrey Donaldson, an outspoken critic
of the agreement and a member of parliament from the Ulster
Unionist Party, which supports Britain's continued control over
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a pretty dreadful circumstance, and I think
it's wrong that the British and Irish governments continue to make
concessions to the terrorists without requiring the terrorists to
deliver on peace,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement has by no means brought total peace to the
province. Last month, three children in Ballymoney, Northern
Ireland, burned to death after someone firebombed their house. And
every week, more people are threatened, beaten up and shot in
revenge attacks, mostly by paramilitary groups. But parties to the
agreement have insisted that they have maintained cease-fires, and
that the violence is the work of breakaway factions.
</P>
<P>
   If the cease-fires continue, several hundred more prisoners
could soon be released. In the notorious Maze prison near Belfast,
prisoners began on Thursday to fill out the preliminary application
forms that could lead to their release. And the Irish government
recently freed six former IRA terrorists from a high-security
prison near Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Michael O'Brien, 38, who was sentenced to 18
years in prison in 1993 for the attempted murder of two police
officers in an incident in which a police constable, Glenn Goodman,
was killed by one of O'Brien's associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affront to justice,'' Constable Goodman's father,
Brian, told the Press Association. ``The politicians who signed
this deal should hang their heads in shame.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan Adler wants to be perfectly clear: he has all the
respect in the world for traditional potters who churn out pretty
glazed vases and earth-tone dinner plates. But when he approaches
the kiln, he is not thinking Mother Earth, but rather a different
sort of woman _ Coco Chanel, say.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when he was a semiotics major at Brown University
and first dabbling in pottery at the neighboring Rhode Island
School of Design, he made a very rococo Chanel-inspired pink
teapot, complete with double Cs. ``The pottery teacher said, `I
don't think you have what it takes,' '' Adler said. ``I was
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   But his fashion-oriented approach to pottery would later bring
him a large fan club, especially among the designers he admires.
The collectors of his eclectic pieces include Geoffrey Beene,
Cynthia Rowley and John Bartlett, and his work is sold in such
stores as Barneys New York, Neiman Marcus and Amalgamated Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely go in someone's house who doesn't have his work
somewhere,'' said the men's wear designer Gene Meyer, who has
several of his pieces. ``It is amazing how much he is collected by
other designers, which is the highest compliment, I think, that can
be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many influences on clothes and decor are coming
from late modernism, Adler's boldly striped black and white pots or
his all-white Jetsonesque vases with geometric reliefs look as if
they would fit well in the living room of a Pop Art collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what I love about his work is how he readjusts the
idea of pottery and uses a lot of modern references that no one has
really used for a long time,'' said John Bartlett. ``A lot of his
pieces can be mistaken for pieces from the 50s and 60s, which
bridge the gap between our modern heritage of 20 years ago and
today. A lot of people in fashion love it, because it is so urban
and cool and it doesn't shout at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler's approach to his work in many ways has more to do with
fashion than housewares. ``Most potters find one thing they do and
do it,'' he said. ``I could relate more to fashion ideas, like,
`This season it is all about blah blah blah.' I express all the
different parts of design that I am interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler's hipster locution certainly doesn't fit the potter
stereotype long ago sealed by the crunchy crowd that gathers in
Vermont to throw pots and play folk music. He is more likely to be
found in Bar Pitti in downtown Manhattan than at a food co-op, and
he favors tight Lacoste shirts and flip-flops over hand-woven
sweaters and Birkenstocks.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration is from pop culture, skateboard graphics and
fashion, among other sources that have not traditionally informed
pottery. His 1970s-style vases in mustard and avocado tones with
rich glazes grew out of trips to flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his admiration of fashion full circle, Adler, 31, has
applied business principles to his own work that have been used by
many fashion houses in recent years: product lines at every price,
for every sort of customer.
</P>
<P>
   There is Jonathan Adler Couture, which this season consists of
hand-thrown porcelain pieces embellished with bold geometric relief
patterns. Then there is a line he calls Pot au Porter _ less
expensive items in hip 70s colors, and bright, colorful pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Ralph Lauren formed Lauren, a line of inexpensive
sportswear, Adler has just developed a line for Pottery Barn _ the
first collection bearing a potter's name that the chain has
stocked. If the Pottery Barn venture is a success, Adler could go
from downtown artist to wealthy mass marketer.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that all designers seem to make, to feel that they
have arrived, Adler is opening his own store this fall in SoHo, on
Broome Street between Greene and Mercer Streets. Joint ventures are
also part of his mix; he has developed a special pottery line for
Todd Oldham's SoHo clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Given his college pottery teacher's discouraging words, it was
never assured that Adler would make it so far. At that point, he
did what many young people have done when other dreams fail: he
went into the film business.
</P>
<P>
   He started in the mail room of a talent agency. Later, he worked
for a producer he will not name because he said he was so tortured
by the experience that it led him to abandon any hopes of becoming
the next Jeffrey Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   He said he became depressed. He leaned on his parents, Harry and
Cynthia Adler, lawyers in Bridgeton, N.J., for financial support.
He went back into the studio and made more pottery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he was discovered by Bill Sofield and Thomas O'Brien,
former partners who ran the influential home design store Aero in
SoHo. ( O'Brien runs the store now.) Soon after, a buyer for
Barneys discovered him, and his signature work at the time _ black
and white vertically striped pieces _ began winning attention from
fashion and interior designers, as well as other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very `it's time to make the doughnuts,' '' Adler
said, referring to endless days and nights of throwing, glazing and
refining pottery for his various clients. ``It was
super-manual-labor-y, and I was losing my noodle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he went to Peru through a group called Aid to Artisans,
which matches artists with residents of host countries to make
marketable products. He found a small studio on the beach outside
Lima and in early 1997 started to produce his Pot au Porter line.
</P>
<P>
   His low costs allowed him to lower his retail prices and sharply
increase his distribution _ Pot au Porter now sells for $20 to $120
at Neiman Marcus, Barneys and dozens of specialty stores around the
country. The Couture line sells for $120 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Although fashion remains a major influence, Adler still seems to
be one part semiotics major, one part child of the 70s. His Couture
pieces, for example, refer to his love of Reform synagogue
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been driven by and fantasized about moving into
those synagogues,'' Adler said. ``They have such a groovy,
brutalist, modern thing doing on. Growing up, we went to a
Conservative synagogue, and I was always jealous of those kids who
went to Reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Such personal references do not exclude fashion designers from
connecting to his work. ``I am in a major stripy phase in my
collection,'' said Cynthia Rowley, referring to Adler's early
striped pieces, which are still a staple of his collection. ``So
Jonathan's work could be the basis for a lot of fabrics maybe in my
women's business.''

   UNDATED -  &QL; 
 &QL; 
1926 _ Born as a triplet to an upper middle-class family in Zurich,
Switzerland, Elisabeth weighed 2 pounds at birth and was not
expected to live. &QL; 
1945 _ Signed up to work for the International Voluntary Service
for Peace, founded after World War I and a model for the American
Peace Corps. The group of young, smart idealists from around Europe
helped ravaged communities after the war. Her greatest lesson about
the meaning of life came at Maidanek, the site of a former
concentration camp. On the walls of barracks where people spent
their final hours before dying in a gas chamber, she found
butterflies carved all over the walls. She was spellbound. For the
next 25 years she would ask herself the meaning of those
butterflies, believing they could help explain the processes of
death and dying. &QL; 
1951 _ Accepted into medical school, where she fell in love with
fellow medical student Manny Ross, of Brooklyn, N.Y. In 1958, after
finishing medical school, they married and moved to the United
States. &QL; 
1959 _ While in residency, she was shocked to learn that doctors
routinely avoided the mention of anything to do with death. Dying
patients were shunned and abused. &QL; 
1962 _ She studied psychiatry at the University of Colorado and
began lecturing on the topic of care for dying patients. &QL; 
1969 _ In Chicago, she wrote her landmark book, On Death and Dying,
that became an international best seller. Ordinary people began
talking about the five stages of dying. The only place where it did
not enjoy instant acceptance was her own hospital. &QL; 
1970s _ She left hospital work to lecture and give ``Life, Death
and Transition'' workshops around the world. She began researching
the subject of life after death. Her findings led her to the belief
that ``death did not exist _ not in its traditional definition.''
She sought mystical and spiritual experiences. Her husband objected
to the unconventional direction of her studies and they divorced.
She moved to California, but her plans to build a healing center
fell through. Kubler-Ross continued writing books, eventually 18,
in 23 languages. &QL; 
1980s _ A successful author, Kubler-Ross bought a 300-acre farm in
Virginia as a healing and workshop center. In 1985, she announced
plans to treat AIDS babies on her farm, sparking community protests
and a zoning battle she ultimately lost. When the farm burned in
1994, including all her lifelong collections, she suspected that
the animosity of the community might have been behind it. She
helped to find homes for 350 AIDS-infected children who needed
adoption and her lecturing continued worldwide. &QL; 
1995 _ Kubler-Ross' son, Kenneth Ross, persuaded her to make a
fresh start in Arizona, where she bought an adobe house on five
acres in north Scottsdale. On May 13, 1995, she suffered a major
stroke _ her sixth _ that paralyzed her left side. She since has
recovered some of her mobility. &QL;

MONET'S `LATE PAINTINGS': SIGNPOST TO 20TH CENTURY  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - It's like watching the centuries change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet: Late Paintings of Giverny From the Musee Marmottan'' is
the blockbuster Impressionist show on view at the San Diego Museum
of Art through Aug. 30. In the 22 late paintings Claude Monet made
in his suburban Paris gardens during the first quarter of this
century, you can see the sensibility of the previous age give way
to that of the current one. And you see Modern Art being born
before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Monet is not the sole creator of Modern Art, of course. In fact,
he might be considered a latecomer to the movement. By the
beginning of World War I, the avant-garde of painting in Europe had
already seen the advent of Fauvism, Cubism, Orphism and Futurism.
And during the war it saw De Stijl and Dada.
</P>
<P>
   But the old eagle, having been in on the creation of
Impressionism in the 1860s, was not left behind as he plunged into
his seventh decade.
</P>
<P>
   And the paintings he made in his garden _ some 250 of them _
chart the change in sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest work in the show, his ``Water Lilies'' of 1903,
you can see the familiar imagery of Impressionism. It is a picture
of the surface of the lily pond on his estate. The illusion of the
reflection of the distant trees in the water is seductive. Across
the water float several rafts of lily pads, creating a horizontal
movement across the vertical tree reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas is still, in some sense, a window through which we
look at a pleasant scene, and the virtuosity of the illusion is
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years go by, Monet becomes less interested in the
illusion and more interested in the paint, so that by the time we
get to ``Water'' ``Lilies and Agapanthus,'' of 1914-17, there is
almost no depth to the scene. It is not a landscape at all, but a
canvas inhabited by images all the same visual distance from the
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a single definition of Modernism, it is that
painting ceases to be a virtual window we look ``through,'' and
becomes one we look ``at''.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time in the late paintings, the gobs of paint build
up on the surface like daubs of tar, forcing us to see the paint,
the brush strokes, the patches of unfinished canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, Monet was not alone in this. Cezanne, for instance,
had already been headed in the same direction two decades before
Monet joined in. Gauguin and a host of later Post-Impressionists
forced the issue. But it is a sign of Monet's stature that he never
felt as if he could merely repeat himself and his earlier
successes, but continued what he called his ``little researches
into forms and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the time recognized the change. One review said,
``His language differs more and more from nature (and) replaces
it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see that happening in ``Weeping Willow,'' from 1918. The
painting may in part be a response to the horrors of the war that
raged around him, a symbol of a weeping tree, but more than
anything else it is a denial of illusionistic space. The background
is the same distance from our eye as the tree trunk, all built out
of the squirrelly and obsessive zips of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Or the ``Japanese Footbridge,'' from the same year, in which it
is difficult to find any subject matter at all. If we weren't so
accustomed to seeing the stereotyped arch of the bridge from his
earlier paintings, we'd be hard pressed to say what the picture is
of.
</P>
<P>
   One after another of these late paintings becomes about paint,
or rather, about the application of paint to surface. In some, the
application is soft and feathered, in others, it is violently
gouged into the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's accomplishments are all the more astonishing in light of
his increasing blindness. Beginning in 1912, he developed cataracts
in both eyes. By the end of the decade, he was mixing colors more
by memory than by eyesight, sometimes using the names printed on
the side of the tubes instead of the pigments, which were becoming
increasingly distorted by his clouded corneas.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Monet became the visual equivalent of Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were those who believed the change in Monet's
painting was caused by the cataracts. They blamed the eye disease
for what they thought was a falling-off of Monet's talents.
</P>
<P>
   The painter went into surgery in 1923 and the cataracts were
removed, restoring his vision. But the change in the painting style
remained; it was not due merely to pathology.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 paintings in the central portion of the exhibit will not
make everyone happy. They are not the easy-on-the-eye parasol and
silk-skirt paintings that Impressionism devolved into. As others
around him repeated the stylistic habits he pioneered 40 years
earlier, and let Impressionism descend into shtick, Monet moved
ever forward, finding ever new things to express.
</P>
<P>
   He was disgusted with these epigones, and as hordes of largely
American imitators descended on the little town of Giverny to
create an ``artists' colony,'' Monet even considered moving away.
Artists don't live in colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed until his death in 1926, unable to leave the
gardens he created and loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have earned has gone into these gardens,'' he
once told and interviewer. ``I do not deny I am proud of them.'' &QL;

WORD FROM BOEING DUE NEXT WEEK ON 737 PLANS  
 ATTN: WICHITA, ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. plans to announce next week whether it will
establish a next-generation 737 production line at its under-used
factory in Long Beach, Calif., and several people familiar with the
plans said Thursday it is all but certain the work will be done
there.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report recommending the new assembly operations in
California has been prepared but has not been given the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute issues are still being worked out, including
negotiations with leaders of Boeing's largest union, which strongly
opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   California government officials ``have bent over backwards'' to
provide Boeing with economic incentives to add a 737 assembly line
at Long Beach, The Post-Intelligencer was told.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing senior vice president Fred Mitchell warned a team of
managers working on the 737 study Thursday to disregard ``media
speculation'' and emphasized ``we have not yet completed our
business case and we have not yet made a decision on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president for
airplane production, wrote: ``We are still testing logistics,
working with the unions who represent employees in the Puget Sound
and Long Beach areas, and working with government officials as part
of our study. Those open items are complex, and we have to work
through them before the business case, either way, is confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 737 study will be completed and a decision announced
within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the plans said the company is scheduled
to announce next Thursday its decision to set up the Long Beach
line. In addition, the company will announce a consolidation of
facilities - primarily defense and space - throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days Boeing will truck 737 wings from its
Renton factory to Long Beach to determine how costly the trip would
be, how long the journey would take and to pinpoint the best route.
</P>
<P>
   The company conducted a similar experiment a few weeks ago, when
it sent by train a mock-up fuselage of its longest 737 aircraft
from its Wichita, Kan., factory to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already makes fuselages in Wichita and ships them to
Renton for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is preparing a production bay in Long Beach
previously used to build McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets to
accommodate assembly of next-generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-ton crane is being installed to help move 737 aircraft
assemblies, and a three-story mezzanine structure is being built in
the the assembly area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are setting up an assembly line that will be identical to
the Renton 737 assembly line,'' said Boeing spokesman John Thom in
Long Beach. ``It's prudent to be ready for a 737 line but
everything is contingent upon a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 737 assembly operations could begin in California as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in May that it is sending some 737-model
aircraft to its Douglas Products Division for finishing work to
ease its overburdened Renton aircraft factory.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that the Long Beach plant ``can provide
some relief, because we don't have enough people or space for all
the work'' in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-based union has argued that establishing an
assembly line in California would be the equivalent of
subcontracting work to non-Machinist members.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, was not available for comment Thursday but a union
spokesman said talks with the company are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting between the union and Boeing officials is set
for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If a 737 assembly line were established in California, it would
focus on final assembly of airplanes such as the Boeing Business
Jet and the cargo version of the jet, which have significantly
different configurations from the next-generation 737s ordered by
airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing would consider doing assembly work on the
737-900 model in Long Beach and possibly other versions of the
next-generation airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, Boeing officials have said the
Renton factory will still be used as the primary final assembly
location for 737 and 757 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If the company goes ahead with a new production line in Long
Beach, it would be the first time Boeing has established commercial
aircraft final-assembly operations outside the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the Long Beach factory when it acquired
McDonnell Douglas last year.
</P>
<P>
   California politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, have been
lobbying hard for Boeing to save aerospace jobs in that state after
the company announced earlier this year that it would consolidate
its space operations in Southern California and end production of
three McDonnell Douglas jets now made at the Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 Boeing jobs in Southern California could be lost
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The California Trade and Commerce Agency has been quietly
working behind the scenes with Boeing on a multimillion-dollar
package of economic incentives to encourage the Seattle-based
aerospace giant to permanently shift some 737 work from Renton to
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency declined to discuss details of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city, Boeing and the
state are still discussing the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find every incentive we are qualified for to
make sure we have a package they (Boeing) like. But it's still be
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not comment on details of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach plant is located in one of the state's so-called
``enterprise zones,'' and Boeing would be eligible for significant
tax breaks if it established a new assembly line there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, our enterprise zone program is one of our most
powerful economic tools,'' said Jerry Miller, deputy city manager
in Long Beach who until recently headed the city's Economic
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been part of the on-going discussions between Boeing
and the state over the package of economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at liberty to say much about the package,'' he said
Thursday. ``It's fair to say, though, that Long Beach has been very
much involved, as has the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic incentive package would be in addition to the tax
breaks now available to Boeing in the enterprise zone. Boeing is
the largest of some 10,000 companies located within the zone. They
are all eligible for state tax credits on purchases of eligible
manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing can get a state tax credit on 100 percent of
the 8.5 percent California sales tax paid on up to $20 million of
the eligible manufacturing equipment purchased each year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it could cost Boeing as much as $1 billion in
tooling to start a 737 production line in Long Beach. Boeing has
refused to say what those tooling costs might be.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also gets a tax credit in the enterprise zone of $26,910
over a five-year period for every new worker its hires at its Long
Beach plant. The workers must be full-time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many workers would be needed for the 737 work
in Long Beach, but Boeing spokesman Thom estimated 400 to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrick Legg, president of the local unit of the United
Aerospace Workers, said be believes a new 737 line would save most
of the union jobs Boeing plans to eliminate.

MUSEUM MOVES PLENTY OF PEOPLE AND MERCHANDISE  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - The big Monet show in San Diego is an excellent
representative of the alimentary school of exhibit design, which is
most frequently used for blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the museumgoer enters the show like an egg entering the
maw of a great snake or lizard, and works his way through the
system, one gallery after another, and just before exiting, stops
to be drained of a last dollar by the cecum of the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The design discourages dawdling and is the most efficient at
moving the large crowds through the show like bamboo through a
panda. There is never any question where to move next.
</P>
<P>
   The first room contains a short video presentation, which gives
an overview of the Impressionist painter and his home in Giverny.
On the walls are enlarged black-and-white photographs of the artist
and the estate that became the subject of his most famous
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The second room includes more photographs, both black-and-white
and color, some of the restored Giverny and its current gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings begin in the third gallery, which contains mostly
paintings other than the featured works from Paris' Musee
Marmottan. These are earlier Monet paintings, either from the
museum collection or borrowed elsewhere. The central panel, though,
is the first of the late paintings.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining and informative ``accoustiguide'' takes viewers
through these galleries and into the main one, which presents the
main course: the late, very modern-looking paintings that Monet did
at Giverny in the first quarter of this century.
</P>
<P>
   It is amusing to watch the crowds with their headphones on,
whole groups turning together like sardines in the current as their
cassette tapes move from one painting to another. Oddly, they all
seem to coagulate in the center of the galleries, leaving a
corridor of empty floor running around the room.
</P>
<P>
   The next gallery includes a couple of the Japanese woodblock
prints that influenced Monet and so many of the Impressionists, and
one of Monet's wooden palettes, crusted with daubs of dried paint.
</P>
<P>
   A last gallery shows off the many caricatures Monet drew as a
teenager, and makes the case that if he did not become a painter,
he would have had a very successful career in journalism as a
cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   But then comes the piece de resistance, the gift shop, which is
even more crowded than the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what to make of all this merchandise. Sure,
there are the expected calendars, address books and jigsaw puzzles
_ and four completely different designs of tote bag _ but there are
also shiny silver gardening tools, watering cans and flower seeds,
playing off the Giverny garden theme.
</P>
<P>
   By the cash register, there are miniature mattocks and machetes,
although I doubt Monet would have used the tropical machete in his
temperate garden.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Monet waterlily mouse pads, Kodak disposable
cameras with Monet designs printed on them, and brightly colored
Monet umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   There was a CD called ``Music in the Age of Monet,'' with lots
of pretty 19th-century French music, and another group of CDs in
circular tin boxes. These were outrageously priced at $18, despite
the fact they were made by the same Pilz recording company that
regularly dumps its releases in mass market stores for as little as
99 cents a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's dinnerware is also available in reproduction for $110
per dinner plate. If that is too rich for you, the same yellow and
fuchsia design is available on paper plates for $5 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure why a furry little frog has anything to do with
Monet, but a refrigerator magnet in that form is a popular item.
Perhaps it's because it is wearing a tiny little T-shirt with a
tiny little Monet signature logo printed on it.
</P>
<P>
   There are videos, too. Most are respectable public television
documentary-style items. But my favorite was ``Paint Like Monet in
a Day With Oil Pastels by Sandra McFall Angelo.'' If only the tape
were available a hundred years ago, it could have saved Monet a
lifetime of effort and study. &QL;

CLIMATE IS RIGHT FOR `GIVE 'EM HELL' ATTACK ON CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: ADDS sentence to end of the 5th graf noting House passage of
a campaign finance measure.)  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ If Harry Truman returned to
Earth to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his astonishing
campaign against Thomas E. Dewey, he would find the climate
conducive to a reprise of his ``give 'em hell'' assault on a
``do-nothing'' Congress.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When lawmakers headed home over the last two weeks for their
August vacation, they created the proper atmosphere for a
Truman-style tirade by rejecting or leaving unattended a number of
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Truman's day, the issues were a post-war housing shortage,
inflation, federal aid to education and civil rights. Today the
need is to save Social Security, curb the use of tobacco by young
people, reform campaign financing, protect patients in managed
health care plans and improve educational standards while
safeguarding public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most divisive matters before the Republican
leadership is whether to use an expected budget surplus to cut
taxes or save Social Security or both.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 80th Congress that Truman attacked with such vigor and
success in 1948, the 105th has bowed to the dictates of big
contributors and has failed to fulfill a number of its promises. It
has also placed the financial well-being of the Republican Party
ahead of the need to devise a more honest system of raising and
spending campaign funds. Despite a House vote for such a system
last week, the measure stands little chance in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Such a situation would have provided fertile ground for the
plain-spoken Truman, who was heading, according to Democrats and
Republicans alike, toward certain defeat at the hands of New York
Gov. Dewey, the GOP nominee, in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia that July no
speaker who appeared before Truman did talked of winning as though
he or she meant it, according to Truman biographer David
McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   But Truman meant it. He was a fighter who refused to accept
defeat as his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Striding into the convention hall at 2 o'clock on a hot, humid
morning, he ended the lethargy that until then had held delegates
captive.
</P>
<P>
   He did it first by predicting that he and his running mate,
Kentucky Sen. Alben W. Barkley, ``will win this election and make
these Republicans like it _ don't you forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he truly roused the crowd's partisan passions by announcing
that he was summoning the 80th Congress back into session on July
26 _ ``which out in Missouri, we call Turnip Day'' _ to see if the
members would pass laws to implement their platform promises.
</P>
<P>
   Furious at Truman, whom they denounced with every conceivable
epithet, the Republicans did convene on Turnip Day and, as the
president had anticipated, did nothing to fulfill the party's
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Truman then launched his nationwide whistle-stop campaign,
lambasting the 80th Congress, and won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has been critical of the 105th Congress' poor
performance but does not have Truman's political option of calling
the lawmakers back into session. Congressional leaders already have
agreed to return next month.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful, however, that much will be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But the record of Congress, while dismal, has not been a total
disaster. Working closely with Clinton, legislators already have
accomplished a goal close to Truman's heart. They have balanced the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also voted to reform and modernize the Internal
Revenue Service and approved a massive and much-needed highway
construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   They also have provided support for Clinton on important foreign
policy matters just as the 80th Congress did for Truman in
approving the Marshall Plan and other vital Cold War policies.
</P>
<P>
   How Truman would react personally to Clinton is anyone's guess.
He probably would find the current president charming and
intelligent, and as a lifelong Democrat he probably would support
him without condoning his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since his own administration was besmirched by scandal, Truman
might possibly sympathize with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He would not, however, approve of any extra-marital adventures.
In Truman's life, there were only four women of importance _ his
mother, his sister Mary Jane, his daughter Margaret and his wife
Bess, whom he courted for many years before she agreed to marry
him.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin for his 1945 Potsdam conference with Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Truman
met a young Army public relations officer who told the president he
could get him anything he wanted, including women.
</P>
<P>
   Truman bristled. ``Listen, son, I married my sweetheart,'' he
said. ``She doesn't run around on me, and I don't run around on
her. I want that understood. Don't ever mention that kind of stuff
to me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned morality meant a lot to Truman, as did
old-fashioned politics and old-fashioned decency.
</P>
<P>
   At the commissioning of the $4.5 billion nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman on July 25, Clinton noted that 50
years ago that week Truman integrated the armed services for the
first time and that since then ``our men and women in uniform have
truly been a force for freedom and a shining example to all
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his good deeds and accomplishments, Truman also was a
tart-tongued, free-swinging politician. If he were around today, he
undoubtedly would have some pithy comments about characters and
events.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly would be able to pierce the fog of hypocrisy and
pomposity that too often envelops Capitol Hill and the White House.

MONET'S `LATE PAINTINGS': SIGNPOST TO 20TH CENTURY  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - It's like watching the centuries change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet: Late Paintings of Giverny From the Musee Marmottan'' is
the blockbuster Impressionist show on view at the San Diego Museum
of Art through Aug. 30. In the 22 late paintings Claude Monet made
in his suburban Paris gardens during the first quarter of this
century, you can see the sensibility of the previous age give way
to that of the current one. And you see Modern Art being born
before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Monet is not the sole creator of Modern Art, of course. In fact,
he might be considered a latecomer to the movement. By the
beginning of World War I, the avant-garde of painting in Europe had
already seen the advent of Fauvism, Cubism, Orphism and Futurism.
And during the war it saw De Stijl and Dada.
</P>
<P>
   But the old eagle, having been in on the creation of
Impressionism in the 1860s, was not left behind as he plunged into
his seventh decade.
</P>
<P>
   And the paintings he made in his garden _ some 250 of them _
chart the change in sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest work in the show, his ``Water Lilies'' of 1903,
you can see the familiar imagery of Impressionism. It is a picture
of the surface of the lily pond on his estate. The illusion of the
reflection of the distant trees in the water is seductive. Across
the water float several rafts of lily pads, creating a horizontal
movement across the vertical tree reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas is still, in some sense, a window through which we
look at a pleasant scene, and the virtuosity of the illusion is
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years go by, Monet becomes less interested in the
illusion and more interested in the paint, so that by the time we
get to ``Water Lilies and Agapanthus,'' of 1914-17, there is almost
no depth to the scene. It is not a landscape at all, but a canvas
inhabited by images all the same visual distance from the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a single definition of Modernism, it is that
painting ceases to be a virtual window we look ``through,'' and
becomes one we look ``at''.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time in the late paintings, the gobs of paint build
up on the surface like daubs of tar, forcing us to see the paint,
the brush strokes, the patches of unfinished canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, Monet was not alone in this. Cezanne, for instance,
had already been headed in the same direction two decades before
Monet joined in. Gauguin and a host of later Post-Impressionists
forced the issue. But it is a sign of Monet's stature that he never
felt as if he could merely repeat himself and his earlier
successes, but continued what he called his ``little researches
into forms and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the time recognized the change. One review said,
``His language differs more and more from nature (and) replaces
it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see that happening in ``Weeping Willow,'' from 1918. The
painting may in part be a response to the horrors of the war that
raged around him, a symbol of a weeping tree, but more than
anything else it is a denial of illusionistic space. The background
is the same distance from our eye as the tree trunk, all built out
of the squirrelly and obsessive zips of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Or the ``Japanese Footbridge,'' from the same year, in which it
is difficult to find any subject matter at all. If we weren't so
accustomed to seeing the stereotyped arch of the bridge from his
earlier paintings, we'd be hard pressed to say what the picture is
of.
</P>
<P>
   One after another of these late paintings becomes about paint,
or rather, about the application of paint to surface. In some, the
application is soft and feathered, in others, it is violently
gouged into the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's accomplishments are all the more astonishing in light of
his increasing blindness. Beginning in 1912, he developed cataracts
in both eyes. By the end of the decade, he was mixing colors more
by memory than by eyesight, sometimes using the names printed on
the side of the tubes instead of the pigments, which were becoming
increasingly distorted by his clouded corneas.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Monet became the visual equivalent of Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were those who believed the change in Monet's
painting was caused by the cataracts. They blamed the eye disease
for what they thought was a falling-off of Monet's talents.
</P>
<P>
   The painter went into surgery in 1923 and the cataracts were
removed, restoring his vision. But the change in the painting style
remained; it was not due merely to pathology.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 paintings in the central portion of the exhibit will not
make everyone happy. They are not the easy-on-the-eye parasol and
silk-skirt paintings that Impressionism devolved into. As others
around him repeated the stylistic habits he pioneered 40 years
earlier, and let Impressionism descend into shtick, Monet moved
ever forward, finding ever new things to express.
</P>
<P>
   He was disgusted with these epigones, and as hordes of largely
American imitators descended on the little town of Giverny to
create an ``artists' colony,'' Monet even considered moving away.
Artists don't live in colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed until his death in 1926, unable to leave the
gardens he created and loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have earned has gone into these gardens,'' he
once told and interviewer. ``I do not deny I am proud of them.'' &QL;

SUSPENDED IRISH SWIMMER MAINTAINS INNOCENCE, PLANS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michelle Smith de Bruin, the Irish swimmer who was banned
Thursday for four years because her random drug test had been
manipulated, denied Friday that she had done anything wrong and
vowed to fight to clear her name.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Dublin, the 28-year-old de Bruin said
she would sue the International Swimming Federation, which assessed
the ban, for ``substantial damages.'' She said she would appeal the
ban to the Sports Arbitration Council, an independent international
body.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, de Bruin, a good swimmer but new
to the top level, won three gold medals and a bronze. She became an
instant heroine in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Such quick improvement, especially for an older swimmer, was
astonishing, and many coaches and swimmers from other nations
suspected that it came from the use of bodybuilding drugs barred in
swimming and most other Olympic sports. They pointed out that her
husband and new coach, Erik de Bruin, a former Dutch discus
thrower, had once been suspended by track and field for using
illegal bodybuilding drugs.
</P>
<P>
   No traces of such drugs have ever appeared in one of her drug
tests. But the international federation, known by its French
acronym of FINA, said a random test last January contained an
inordinate amount of alcohol, probably whisky, which served as a
masking agent.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's news conference, de Bruin read a 13-point statement
that rejected each allegation. She said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe thst there has been a concerted effort on the
part of FINA to ensure that I did not swim again and to ensure that
by whatever method available to them a ban would be imposed. I had
no motive for introducing alcohol or indeed any other masking agent
into my sample. ... We now go on to the appeal process, which I
know will prove my total innocence. I don't think you can ever
recover completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Arbitration Council, where de Bruin's appeal is
headed, was founded in November 1994 by the International Olympic
Committee to resolve disputes emanating from the Olympic Games. Th
council quickly accepted disputes involving international
federations governing Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   Th council is independent of the IOC. From an international
panel of 40 to 50 sports jurists, almost all lawyers, the council
appoints a panel to hear appeals of decisions by sports in the
Olympic family. While council decisions are binding on the
federations, dissatisfied athletes have sometimes appealed to a
court. The courts have generally upheld the council's findings.
</P>
<P>
   People in Rathcoole, the village outside Dublin where de Bruin
lives, continue to support her. Louis Fitzgerald, who owns and
manages Poitin Stil, the local pub that held all-night celebrations
when de Bruin won her Olympic gold medals, said he wanted to
establish a fund to help her appeal. John Hannon, a South Dublin
county councilor, said a new local park would still be named for
her.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don H. Catlin, the director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical
Laboratory, said FINA's ban of Smith ``is just another sad day for
sports.'' John Collins, who coaches Olympic swimmers at the Badger
Swim Club in New Rochelle, N.Y., called FINA's action against Smith
``somewhat gratifying because there have to be some standards you
go by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who train hard and do it for years,'' Collins said,
``it's difficult when people like Michelle Smith do this. It's good
they're catching people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Wales, a Cincinnati lawyer, 1968 Olympic bronze medalist in
swimming and vice president of FINA, said swimming was ``a very
clean sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a very small element may be using drugs,'' he said,
``and it's FINA's obligation to enforce its very strict rules.
Organizations like FINA have to conduct out-of-competition testing
to make sure that stays the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing of de Bruin's urine sample was done by the
laboratory in Barcelona, one of 25 in the world approved by the
IOC. There are two laboratories in the United States _ one in Los
Angeles run by Catlin and the other in Indianapolis run by Indiana
University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some drug tests are done after a competition and involve medal
winners and others selected at random. There is also random
out-of-competition testing. In each case, this is the procedure:
</P>
<P>
   One same-gender member of the testing team is present when the
sample is voided. The athlete places the sample into a collection
container, then divides the sample into two separate bottles
labeled A Sample and B Sample. The bottles are closed, caps are
screwed on tightly and a security tape is places atop each bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The bottles are placed in separate containers, typically plastic
bags with a security device. Those two bags are placed inside
another bag, which is shipped via a rapid-carrier service to an
IOC-approved laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There are many security checks. If a tape is pulled off a
bottle, it generally leaves a mark. Other tapes are broken if the
inner or outer bags are opened. When a sample is opened at a
laboratory, a note is made of any tampering. The laboratory has no
idea which athlete it is testing because the sample is not
identified by a name, but just a number.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory tests the A sample. If it finds no banned drugs
or masking agents, the B sample is thrown away. If the A sample is
positive, the B sample is later tested in the presence of the
athlete or his or her representative.
</P>
<P>
   Several people familiar with the process said the protocol is
not always followed to the letter. They said some testing officers,
concerned with invading privacy, do not always watch the sample
being produced.

RELATIVES FAN COMPLAINTS ABOUT OFFICIALS' RESPONSE TO HEAT
CONDITIONS IN TEXAS PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Relatives of Texas prisoners, fuming over
sweltering conditions in state prisons, on Friday portrayed the
official response to the summer heat wave as another form of inmate
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical, mental and medical abuses have been a constant
problem. This summer's extreme heat, combined with those ongoing
abuses, have subjected prisoners to even more inhumane
conditions,'' said Lois Robison. The north Texas woman is the
mother of two inmates and chairman of Texas Citizens United for the
Rehabilitation of Errants, an inmate advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do go to prison to be punished ... but they're not
really supposed to go to prison to be killed or to have their
health permanently impaired,'' Robison of Burleson said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that department policies intended to help overheated
inmates are being ignored at individual prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials recently disclosed the heat-related deaths of
two inmates. The housing areas of Texas prisons are not
air-conditioned, and officials have said temperatures inside some
of the older units have reached triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, prison officials said they view the inmates'
health and safety as ``paramount.'' Almost all of the complaints,
they said, are unfounded rumors, ``absurd'' falsehoods and inmate
``lore.''
</P>
<P>
   A prison spokesman categorically denied claims that water has
been withheld from prisoners; that windows are kept closed
unnecessarily; and that newly acquired fans benefit only guards.
</P>
<P>
   The prison officials also denied that inmates transferred
between units endure ``torturous'' rides in hot buses. While buses
aren't air-conditioned, most transfers are done between midnight
and noon to prevent overheating of inmates _ and their guards, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But before that change was made, one inmate suffered heat stroke
after his bus ride from Lubbock to Abilene on a hot June afternoon.
Archie White, 48, serving a sentence for burglary and drug
possession in Brazoria County, died June 29 after a bus ride that
ended around 4:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health, welfare and safety of the prisoners is of
paramount importance all the time, particularly in times of stress
like this heat wave. We have adequate safeguards,'' said Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen Castlebury.
</P>
<P>
   But Robison asserted that the official response to the heat
crisis has been inadequate. As an example, she said fans sold in
commissaries are too small to be of much relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have 10- or 12-inch fans to be available to the
prisoners. We also would like indigent prisoners to be provided
with fans,'' Robison said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials confirmed that inmates who can afford fans
can't always use them because some dorms don't have electricity at
each bedside. Nor did the officials dispute the relatives'
assertion that some inmates have lost the privilege of having a
bedside fan.
</P>
<P>
   But while Robison claimed the loss of fans was punishment for
rules infractions, prison officials said inmates lost their fans
only if they were transferred to areas where they weren't allowed
for security reasons _ and that edict was withdrawn earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said the prison system, with 143,000 inmates, has
taken numerous steps to alleviate overheated conditions _ short of
abandoning the long-standing ban on air conditioning in housing
areas. Fans have been added to recreational areas, and air
conditioning is already available in classrooms and some work
areas, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   He said water is ``never, never, never'' withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury acknowledged that some of the nearly 1,900 new fans
distributed among prison units are situated in hallways, where
guards patrol, but don't blow into cells. Robison said inmates who
complain about that arrangement are threatened with transfer to
areas ``where the gangs are and where people are being raped and
extorted and beaten repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robison said she's aware of the widespread public dislike for
``country-club'' conditions in prisons, but inmates ``have no
control over where they have to be. And it's the state's
responsibility to take care of their health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking them to air-condition the prisons. But
they've got to find some way to give these people relief,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to see the future of Los Angeles at play, put on
your dancing shoes and head for the Conga Room, a recently opened
Latin music club and restaurant, whose combination of top-notch
salsa bands and sizzling interior design has brought sophisticated
Hispanic style to an ethnically mixed audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called the House of Blues for Latin entertainment, the
Conga Room is rewriting the character of traditional Hollywood
night life. Unlike the look-but-don't-touch vibe of some other
clubs, the Conga Room, which conjures up the heat of the Caribbean
and Latin America, is about emotion as expressed in touch dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Sex roles are very much in force. Men ask women to dance, and
they'd better know how to lead.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday night, as a popular local salsa band, La
Combinacion, performed for the packed audience, the dance floor
filled with novices and veterans, all swinging elbows, swiveling
hips and quick shuffling feet, as blaring, brassy horns and frantic
congas thundered away.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was dressed to the nines, some men in suits and ties,
while others favored the traditional Hispanic garb of white cotton
guayaberas _ lightweight shirts hanging free _ and slacks. Women
wore velvet, lace and frills, and daringly high hemlines and heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sensuous,'' said Chris Gaylor, 31, a home
designer from Beverly Hills. ``You dance salsa _ it's the most
sensuous of the dances. It's the guys that manipulate the girls.
It's a very charismatic dance. It's a very masculine dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the popularity of the new club, which opened in
February, may be tied to the national revival of swing dancing, the
Conga Room is not nearly as much an exercise in nostalgia as
self-consciously retro swing clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa has had an uninterrupted place in the Hispanic night life
of Los Angeles, thriving in traditional clubs like El Floridita and
the Mayan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic men and women predominate in the largely upscale crowd,
but the Conga Room is one of the most mixed ethnically in the city.
It is on a section of Wilshire Boulevard that Ron Meyers, its
designer, calls the ``magical dividing line'' between Los Angeles'
major ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is far enough west to attract the largely white residents of
the Westside, but also far enough east to lure Hispanic, Asian and
black patrons from the city's eastern and southern neighborhoods.
The club may well mirror a future Los Angeles _ ethnically mixed
but predominantly, and confidently, Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   People come from all directions and all generations _ ``anyone
with salsa in their soul,'' said Brad Gluckstein, a real estate
developer and Latin music fan who founded the club and later
brought in Martin Fleischmann, a music promoter, as an active
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither is Hispanic, their passion for the music has
apparently given them all the credibility they need to draw
Hispanic patrons. And it hasn't hurt that the Conga Room's minority
investors include Hispanic stars like the actors Jennifer Lopez and
Jimmy Smits, and Bobby Bonilla of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been used for premiere parties for ``The Magic Hour,''
the television show starring Magic Johnson, and for the new movie
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' with Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   It is also something of a political clubhouse, a site for
fund-raisers for politicians like Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif.,
who is the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Democratic National Committee, scouting
cities for the next presidential convention, partied the night away
there in late July. There's a VIP entrance in back, which leads to
a VIP room thick with the smoke of expensive cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, who also designed the flamboyant Atlas Bar and Grill on
Wilshire Boulevard, created an interior for the Conga Room that
evokes, but does not parody, Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The main bar _ which serves mojitos, a Cuban rum drink, and
Jennifer's martini, a recipe from Ms. Lopez (Absolut with Madeira)
_ is bright and colorful, with orange stained walls, a sky blue
ceiling and a luxuriant red Corian bar, recalling 50s Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the discreet VIP lounge, with its magenta walls and
regal gilded armchairs, is aristocratic Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   And in the huge main room, Meyers hoped to achieve the feel of a
village party on a Caribbean island. The wood and brick walls are
simply and effectively transformed by a lame curtain behind the
stage, revolving chandeliers made of bamboo and, of course, by the
spotlighted, dressed-to-impress musicians.
</P>
<P>
   On any given night you might find Celia Cruz, Tito Nieves, Jose
Feliciano, or even Sheila E playing congas, timbales, bongos and
drums with her father, Pete Escovedo, and his orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Entry isn't cheap: $20 for general admission on a Saturday
night, $45 for a table with a view of the dance floor. The more
traditional dining room, with its classic Spanish-style mirror and
picture frames, serves a $25 prix-fixe menu of nuevo Latino cuisine
like grilled Chilean sea bass and roasted garlic chicken. Congas
are ubiquitous, in oversize versions painted on the wall and in the
guise of cocktail tables.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, Manuel Lopez, 34, a machine operator from
Orange County, drew a small ring of admirers while dancing with his
friend, Valeska Cruz. Lopez said he had been taught to dance by his
parents as a young boy, and Ms. Cruz said she had been at it at
least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been going to salsa clubs around Los Angeles for a
long while but came to the Conga Room for the first time with
friends who wanted to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstein, the co-owner, said, ``We want to have fun with the
club. It's not a serious place, but it has to have cultural
underpinnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Silvers, a lawyer from Santa Monica, and his companion,
Holly Aaron, an accountant, braved the dance floor despite never
having taken dance lessons. ``Rhythm, sexuality, passion, touch
dancing,'' Silvers said, ticking off the attractions. ``It gets you
in touch with the person you want to be in touch with.''

EAST HAMPTON HAILS THE CHIEF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BOB MORRIS 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His entourage never went past the front porch (we put
out the flag just in case), and I didn't happen by any of the
parties he was attending, the way some people did. But I finally
had a Clinton moment at the end of last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I was jogging to the East Hampton Gym on Sunday afternoon when I
noticed a police car with a flashing red light in the middle of
Newtown Lane. Traffic was stopped. A crowd was corralled in the
street behind barricades.
</P>
<P>
   There, outside a restaurant called Babette's, where Gwenyth
Paltrow and I have eaten from time to time, although not at the
same time, I was held back with a multitude of fashionably dressed
pedestrians as a security squad in blue blazers hovered.
</P>
<P>
   The president had just left, after stopping to acknowledge a
petition circulated by the restaurant owner (she got a hug)
opposing Kenneth W. Starr's grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't actually get to see them _ the Clintons, minus Chelsea,
and their hosts, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, with their two
children _ but I was able to hear comments of those who had, and
despite recent events that have done so much to diminish this
president's presidentiality, people were smitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a pesky creep,'' a middle-aged woman in jogging
shorts was telling a friend. ``I told the Secret Service guys they
could frisk me if they wanted to, and I was so relentless that they
let me through. And I just walked up to Hillary and thanked her for
working so hard and for supporting breast cancer research, and she
took my hand and told me, `You're so very welcome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A man _ tan, smoking a cigar, not necessarily the look of
someone you would trust in a real estate deal or divorce _ was
babbling like a child. ``He has such a soft handshake,'' he said.
``It's not the hard handshake of a businessman at all. And he
really looks at you when he talks!''
</P>
<P>
   All around me, people were atwitter. Someone had reminded the
president about a fund-raiser in New Jersey where they met. He said
it was a wonderful party. Someone else had reminded him about
another event. He said he remembered that, too.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of cell-phone-wielding, access-wanting, Gucci-wearing
tourists and summer people, who normally don't bother to say hello
or even smile at one another in passing, had gone gleeful and
turned into neighbors instead of competitors on the gourmet food
chain of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell that the people love him,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because he loves people,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Every village (like every family and every Bubba) is complicated
in its own way. But just for that moment, East Hampton (which gets
more attention than other villages over its complications) had
become Everyvillage.
</P>
<P>
   Under its big old trees, in the shadows of cedar-shingled
buildings with simple signage more fiercely regulated than any in
the world, the village stood still in time, as innocent as if it
were in a Preston Sturges movie.
</P>
<P>
   When the motorcade departed, the frame unfroze: the crowd
cheered and waved and then squinted at the bunting over the Village
Hardware store, the DKNY window and the white clapboard Odd Fellows
Hall, now an Eileen Fisher store. Corny as it sounds, it was as if
everyone were seeing this place for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I felt a burning in my throat. It was hard to know why.
Certainly, it wasn't about Anytown, U.S.A. Nor was it about
uplifting the poor or disfranchised. Somehow, this was about
community, Our Town, resort style. And for once, nobody was being
cynical. Nobody was even complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a once-in-a-lifetime inconvenience,'' I heard one
woman say as I jogged off.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a week has passed, and pedestrians in the village are
once again looking disgruntled, beleaguered or blase in the way
that only the exquisitely spoiled and high-strung can look on
vacation, I remember how, for a moment, this seen-it-all town was
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder _ when is he coming back?

ACTOR'S CONTEMPT FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CROPS UP IN DENVER
COURTROOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 9) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When a courtroom official admonished Woody Harrelson
and his two brothers for climbing over spectator benches in U.S.
District Court last week to get a front row seat in their father's
hearing, the actor tried to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just white trash,'' he said, barely concealing a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he can bankroll his father Charles Harrelson's
top-dollar bid for a new trial in the 1979 murder of a Texas
federal judge. Hollywood stardom aside, Woody Harrelson _ and
brothers Jordan and Brett _ come from modest folk.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first day of the three-day hearing, one of
the Harrelson sons casually pulled out a banana and began to peel
it before an agitated official mouthed the word, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else, however, might explain the brothers' behavior
and Woody's casual attire, which ranged from black jeans (albeit
Armani) to drawstring pants and never once included a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Like his 60-year-old father, Woody harbors a certain amount of
contempt for the federal government. At the root of his hostility
is the the fate of his dad, who Woody believes was used as a
scapegoat in the murder of Judge John Wood. So angry is Woody he
once acknowledged withholding some federal income tax payments to
protest ``the way this government does business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that there are a lot of people out there who
have experienced serious injustice,'' said the younger Harrelson
last week, arguing that his dad, for one, did not get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   As for Charles Harrelson, he spoke for himself. He portrayed
himself as a patriot fighting against a corrupt government, a
believer in the United States but not ``what it's become.'' Such
alienation brought to mind Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh,
who sat in the same courtroom only months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harrelson and McVeigh share the same address, a federal
maximum security prison in Florence, Colo., known as Supermax.
Among the other famous prisoners there who identify the government
as the enemy: Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to me is not important,'' said Harrelson. ``But
it matters a lot what happened in San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Harrelson received two life sentences for Wood's
murder. Federal prosecutors say the hustler and card player,
convicted in a murder-for-hire plot years before Wood's death, shot
the San Antonio judge on May 29, 1979, with a hunting rifle. They
relied on testimony from Joe Chagra, an El Paso lawyer who pleaded
guilty to conspiring to kill the judge with his brother Jimmy, a
drug lord who faced trial in Wood's court.
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern of Harrelson's legal team, a high-profile
bunch that includes defense attorneys from San Francisco,
Albuquerque, N.M., and Corpus Christi, is their client's legal
counsel. They say it was ineffective, and that he was represented
by a secondary lawyer who himself was a suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson goes further. He testified that his lawyer, Thomas
Sharpe, conspired with the government to convict him.
</P>

   Woody is determined to fight on for his dad, despite the fact
that Charles Harrelson deserted his family when his son was just 7.
He cast his father looks of empathy during the proceedings. On
Monday night, Woody met with his dad briefly and found him in good
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still knows how to laugh after all these years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson has no doubt rubbed off on Woody, the goofy
bartender on the television show ``Cheers'' who has since starred
in ``Natural Born Killers'' and was nominated for a best actor
Oscar for ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody delighted in his dad's testimony, which brought the elder
Harrelson face to face with the same federal prosecutor who 16
years ago sent him to prison. For that, Charles Harrelson told the
prosecutor more than once and with feeling, ``I despise you.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance met with rave reviews from the front row, where
Woody sat with his brothers and wife, Laura Louie. Indeed, when
Charles Harrelson left the stand Wednesday, Woody flashed him a
thumbs up.

<P>
   It was, to say the least, a case of odd timing: Last Monday,
after Franklin Resources announced that Michael F. Price was
surrendering his chief executive title and stock-picking duties at
its Mutual Series fund unit, the company increased the front-end
loads for small investors in the six Mutual Series funds.
</P>
<P>
   The load, or initial sales charge, was raised from 4.5 percent
to 5.75 percent for those with less than $50,000 invested. So not
only are investors left without the skills of Price, the vaunted
value investor, but many will have to pay more for the privilege of
buying shares.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the higher charges go against the industry trend.
Front-end loads have dropped over the past 10 years, according to
Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm in Boston. While 8.5 percent
loads were once common, a 4 to 5 percent sales load is more the
norm today.
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Analytical Services in
Summit, N.J. described Franklin's move as unusual and said it ``may
be addressing the recent stock price decline in shares of
Franklin.'' The increased sales load, he added, ``may get more
brokers who are looking for a higher-loaded fund to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales charges are used to compensate brokers and other fund
sellers; raising them can serve as a powerful incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper said the increased loads could be an effort to lift
Franklin's own stock price, but a spokeswoman for Franklin, Holly
Gibson, said the increased sales load had been in the works for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, however, that the mutual fund giant's
stock could use some extra juice right now.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Franklin Resources have fallen 27.6 percent, from a
high of $57.3125 on April 13 to $41.50 on Friday. That compares
with a falloff of 7.9 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's Financials
Index over the same period. But why the weakness in Franklin stock
to begin with? One reason may be that the company missed its
second-quarter earnings estimate of 54 cents a share by 2 cents on
June 23.
</P>
<P>
   But a more serious influence is likely to be the Asian economic
crisis. Some investors may be looking at Franklin's international
and emerging-markets exposure through its Templeton funds group,
which is focused on foreign stocks. Templeton funds account for 46
percent of Franklin's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long term, having Templeton is a great asset,'' said Henry H.
McVey, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``But short
term, it won't bring in as much cash as a complex which is
domestically focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Strauss, a brokerage and asset management analyst
with Goldman, Sachs, said the market had overreacted to Franklin's
exposure to Asia _ less than 5 percent of the company's total
assets. ``I think it will rebound when the market recognizes how
limited Franklin's exposure is to Asia and as overall market
conditions begin to pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of smaller issues may also be contributing to the stock's
weakness, according to McVey. He said Franklin's decision to
consolidate transfer agencies had contributed to higher costs, as
had rapid account growth and year-2000 compliance issues. Another
factor, he said, was the introduction of the European Monetary
Union, which requires a major revamping of Franklin's computers.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Johnson, president of Franklin-Templeton Distributors, a
subsidiary of Franklin Resources, said the loads were raised to
consolidate pricing policies after the company's acquisitions of
the Templeton and Mutual Series funds. Templeton already charges a
5.75 percent load; Franklin's other funds, which had charged 4.5
percent, increased their loads along with those of the Mutual
Series.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't Franklin lower the loads on the Templeton funds
instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``The representatives who sell our funds seem to favor the
schedule used by Templeton, not the schedule used by the Franklin
funds,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The higher charges apply only to people with less than $50,000
invested at the funds. Investors with $50,000 to $99,999 will keep
paying 4.5 percent and those with $100,000 to $249,999 will pay 3.5
percent, down from 3.75 percent. The charges decline to zero for
those with $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The new sales charges apply only to the company's class I
shares.

PATRIOTS OPERATING ON FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ From the start, the approach hasn't made
sense. Did the Patriots really think Tebucky Jones could be a
starting cornerback in the NFL right away when only the chosen few
(Hall of Famer Mike Haynes, for example) ever make such a quick
transition? Did they really believe Steve Israel would make a solid
return after an injury-filled 1997? And did they really believe
Chris Canty would suddenly be the prolific corner they thought they
drafted in the first round last year?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, how desperately did they want a third-round draft pick?
Desperately enough to trade their starting right corner even before
they knew the answers to the aforementioned questions?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have never been answered to anyone's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jones will make everyone forget his predecessor, Jimmy
Hitchcock. But, like many in Patriots Nation, Hitchcock can't
fathom the decision to let him go when they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped trying to figure it out,'' said Hitchcock from
Mankato, Minn., where he's preparing for his return to Foxboro
Stadium Sunday night as a Minnesota Viking. ``I thought about it a
lot while it was happening, but I never got any answers. I never
spoke to Pete (Carroll) about it, and really, it doesn't matter. I
play for the Minnesota Vikings now. That's where my allegiance is
now. I'm trying to impress Dennis Green, not Pete or (Bill)
Parcells or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he'd love to hear the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock won the job in training camp last year after he'd been
banished from Parcells's team in 1996. Parcells wouldn't even let
Hitchcock into the locker room following the Super Bowl loss to the
Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock never liked Parcells because of the way the coach
treated him. When Carroll gave him a second chance, he appreciated
it. But while Hitchcock proved to be a loyal soldier, always
willing to acknowledge his mistakes and shortcomings after a bad
play, he just wasn't what Carroll envisioned at right corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they expected,'' said Hitchcock. ``I thought
I played well overall. I thought I really helped to the point where
they didn't have to worry about that position.''
</P>
<P>
   True, he wasn't perfect. But on a defense that had come together
so well so fast, he seemed to be a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy did a good job for us,'' said safety Willie Clay. ``He
played hard all the time. You could never argue anything about
that. He came to play and he made some very good plays. He got
burned once or twice, but everyone does at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay knows that with Hitchcock back for another year, the
Patriots wouldn't have to answer questions about right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that's been the topic around here since I got here
four years ago,'' said left cornerback Ty Law. ``That spot has been
occupied by so many people, and now we're asking someone else to
take it when we had someone who could play it. I'm not the
personnel director or the coach, so I don't know what went into the
thinking. I thought Jimmy was getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing they didn't believe,'' said Hitchcock,
the Vikings' starting right corner. ``They didn't believe I could
get better. I think I got better every year. That's one thing I
pride myself in _ picking something I can be better at and
achieving that.''
</P>
<P>
   He made himself a good run-stopper and he also had a penchant
for making the big play, like a 100-yard interception return
against the Dolphins. But when he got burned, it always seemed to
stand out like a sore thumb. Rod Smith beat him for a 40-yard
touchdown in the Patriots' 34-13 loss to Denver, and in a 26-20 win
at Jacksonville, Hitchcock surrendered the majority of Keenan
McCardell's 11 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hitchcock was the guy the opposition always picked
on. That's because nobody would dare challenge Law. At least not on
a regular basis. So Hitchcock knew he was going to be thrown at.
Parcells did it in a 24-19 Jets win over the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that the Patriots will test him early tomorrow
because quarterback Drew Bledsoe used to go after Hitchcock in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll expect it and it should be fun,'' said Hitchcock. ``I
loved some of the battles I had in practice with Vincent (Brisby)
because he was always talking trash to you. It was fun. And Terry
(Glenn) is the ultimate challenge. When you go up against Terry and
shut him down, you've accomplished something.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of him would love to make a big play and show the Patriots
what they're missing. The other part doesn't care what they think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all I can do to come to Minnesota and get used to a new
team and a new system and a new coach,'' said Hitchcock. ``I'm
getting comfortable here. Denny Green is a great coach and he
commands so much respect. Guys would never think of missing a
meeting or not being on time. Everybody respects him. He's given me
the opportunity to be the starter, and I'm going to give it
everything I have.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he make of the Patriots' situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Hitchcock. ``I know if Steve Israel was
healthy, he'd be able to take the job because he's a very good
player. I'm sure they had a lot of faith in Tebucky Jones or they
wouldn't have drafted him. They may have to wait for him, and I
guess they're willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drive yourself crazy trying to figure that stuff
out,'' said Hitchcock. ``It just happened. I thought I'd be with
the Patriots for a long time. I enjoyed living there. I loved the
community and the fans. I thought we had a good thing going, and
they do have a very good team.''

REVOLUTION FACING A FIELD OF EXPLOITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ The field at Ohio Stadium is the smallest in
Major League Soccer. It measures 62 by 106 feet, the size of a
football field _ which is its main function at Ohio State. And it's
a field the Columbus Crew know how to take advantage of, as
evidenced by their 6-3 home record.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Crew exploit the field's dimensions: They put the
ball in play as quickly as possible, with midfielders Jason Farrell
and Brian Maisonneuve trying long tosses to forwards Stern John and
Brian McBride, the latter of whom excels on headers.
</P>
<P>
   McBride (10 goals, 2 assists) was the Most Valuable Player in
the league's All-Star Game, picking up a goal and two assists in
the US's 6-1 win over the World team. John also has 10 goals and
two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They score a lot of quick goals,'' said forward Paul Keegan,
who with his Revolution teammates will try to solve the Crew's home
advantage tonight. ``And Columbus, a hardworking team, plays well
on the small field, with everybody close to each other. In some
ways, it's good the field is so small. It's a more technical game,
with one or two touches. This will not be a game where you can take
the ball up the wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to play over there because the field is so very
small,'' said Revolution defender Edwin Gorter. ``It's going to be
a battle for 90 minutes. With nine games remaining, we know we're
going to have to win at least six or seven.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, fresh from a 3-0 decision over the San Jose
Clash Wednesday that ended their league-record eight-game home
losing streak, are last in the Eastern Conference with 19 points,
just 2 points behind fourth-place Tampa Bay for the final playoff
spot. Third-place Columbus has 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to pick up one game after another,'' Gorter said.
``Against who or where, we don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the Revolution haven't done well against the Crew
this season, losing both meetings. Overall, the Revolution are 2-8
against Columbus. And in road games this season, New England is
3-8.
</P>
<P>
   On the brighter side for the Revolution, the Crew have lost
their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus has had an up-and-down team, but they're getting
healthy,'' said Revolution coach Thomas Rongen, whose team will be
back in a 4-4-2 alignment. ``They're at full strength. It's always
tough playing there, regardless of what personnel they put on the
field. In our 3-2 loss there (April 11), we showed that we can have
success. If we defend well against them, we can create some
chances, and the team that converts on their chances will win this
game.''

BIG TEN MAY GET GIFT: ND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes poltics and college football create strange alliances.
Take the Big East, the Big Ten, and Notre Dame for example.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, much has been written, said, and
speculated regarding the Big Ten's courtship of Notre Dame, which
is a member of the Big East in all sports except football.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions are ongoing. But here's a new twist. Don't be
surprised if the Big East actually tries to help the Big Ten get
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. When Notre Dame joined the Big East in 1994, the
league was coming off one of its worst seasons ever in basketball.
Adding Notre Dame, the feeling went, would not only help the Irish
but it would help the Big East if ND could regain the status of
national power it had enjoyed under Digger Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for adding Notre Dame as the 13th team was that
should the Irish be happy with the basketball and nonrevenue aspect
of membership, if the time ever came to think about joining a
football conference, the Big East would be the logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   This was a plan which never really worked out. To many, Notre
Dame remains an outsider that does nothing to enhance the league in
basketball and, as the 13th team, creates a logistical and
scheduling nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the concern about the Big Ten's possible interest in
Syracuse _ a school with strong Big East ties _ and you have an
interesting scenario developing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way it would work. The Big Ten tells the Big East it
would like to take Notre Dame as its 12th member. The Big East says
fine because that would keep the Big Ten away from Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame goes back to a more natural Midwest base, works on
some financial deals with television contracts and bowl
arrangements, and says talks with the Big Ten will continue, with
the clear understanding that it is a matter of when this merger
will happen, not if.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, when all the current contracts will have expired, the
Irish will be the newest member of a 12-school Big Ten, the Big
East will remain intact with its original core group, and both
leagues will move into the next century with optimstic outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany says he expects a resolution to
the Notre Dame question before this year. ``My hope is that this
fall or winter, something will come of it or something will not,''
said Delany at the Big Ten football meetings in Chicago Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Count on it happening sooner than that. Like this month. What
most people familiar with the talks seem to think is that sometime
in the next few weeks, Notre Dame and Big Ten officials will come
to this decision: Either let's say we've decided to go our separate
ways or the talks will continue. If they continue, the odds of
Notre Dame joining the Big Ten go from 50-50 to about 90-10.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the Big Ten wants Notre Dame and the Big
East wants Syracuse to stay. If the price of that arrangement is
losing Notre Dame, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Double vision
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up Sept. 5 as one of the most important days in the
history of the Big East. On the first full weekend of the 1998
season, Ohio State will travel to West Virginia and Tennessee will
travel to Syracuse. A Big East sweep of those games would give the
conference an unprecedented national boost in prestige. Conversely,
a double loss would further tarnish the league's image ... If
Boston College decides to play Northeastern, it would make sense
from this standpoint. It would help Northeastern and it would help
college football in New England. Normally, Division 1-A and 1-AA
teams should keep their distance. But a game against Southern
Methodist, which wanted out of its contract with BC, does not
really excite anyone around here, and a game against Northeastern
is a no-harm, no-foul proposition. Look for that game to be played
in the opening week of either the 1999 or 2000 season. BC should do
this on a regular basis, scheduling one game every four years
against teams like Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Harvard ... Nice
to see that coaches continue to take their role as pollsters
seriously. Purdue coach Joe Tiller said he let his college-age son,
Michael, pick his preseason Top 25. Penn State coach Joe Paterno
said associate athletic director Budd Thalman fills out his ballot.
And these guys are going to have a say in who plays for the
national championship in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4. Please ... Tom
Osborne says he will keep a low profile this season in his first
year as Nebraska coach emeritus. Then he plans to get tapes of each
Nebraska game and analyze them _ for fun. Talk about good times.

VATICAN SNUBS ISRAELI PROTEST OVER PALESTINIAN ARCHBISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Vatican on Friday firmly rebuffed Israeli efforts to
block the appointment of a Palestinian archbishop in Galilee,
saying such nominations ``are the reserve of the pope in the
exercise of his supreme power.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first open confrontation between the Holy See and
Israel since they established diplomatic relations in 1994, a
historic step intended to end 2,000 years of hostility between
Catholics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
complained about the appointment of the Palestinian, Archbishop
Pierre Mouallem, to lead mainly Arabic-speaking Melkite Christians
in the northern Israeli region of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu charged that Mouallem, who until his appointment was a
bishop in Brazil, had been chosen under pressure from officials of
the Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian supporters in
the Catholic Church. `We think there should not be any
politicization of the choices of emissaries on the part of the
church,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican response was terse and uncompromising. ``In the
nomination of His Excellency Mouallem, the synod of the Greek
Catholic Church carried out its duties free from any external
pressures,'' a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said
in a written statement. ``The fundamental accord existing between
the Holy See and the state of Israel provides for the autonomy of
church and state, each in its own sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute was mainly the product of Israeli politics, it
could have repercussions on Israel's relations with the Vatican.
Pope John Paul II has long hoped to visit the Holy Land for the
millennium, and any serious dispute with the Israeli government
could jeopardize that.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the pope appointed Mouallem archbishop of Akko, a
diocese of 45,000 Melkite Christians in Galilee. Melkite Christians
follow an Eastern Rite liturgy of Roman Catholicism and accept the
authority of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said Mouallem, 70, an Arabic-speaker who was
born in Ailaboun near Nazareth and became a refugee during the 1948
Arab-Israeli war, harbors PLO sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said the archbishop was the choice of Farouk Kaddoumi,
a senior PLO official, and Hilarion Capucci, a former Melkite
archbishop of Jerusalem who was convicted of smuggling guns from
Lebanon to Israel in 1975 and spent two years in an Israeli prison.
Pope Paul VI won Capucci's release by promising that the prelate
would never return to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu acknowledged that he had met with leaders of the Greek
Catholic Church to discuss the appointment. Israeli newspapers
reported that he had suggested a different candidate, the Rev. Emil
Shufani, who is viewed by Israeli officials as more moderate.
Netanyahu's office confirmed that the prime minister had met with
Shufani.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Vatican had any intention of changing the
nomination to meet Israeli concerns, Benedettini replied, ``On the
contrary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope, who in March took the unprecedented step of issuing an
``act of repentance'' for the failure of Catholics to deter the
mass deportations and killings during the Holocaust, has devoted
much of his papacy to seeking reconciliation with the Jews. He met
with Netanyahu for the first time in February 1997 and accepted his
invitation to visit Jerusalem for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But one obstacle to a papal visit to Jerusalem is the debate
over the status of the city. Israel holds it to be its ``united and
eternal capital'' while the Vatican has pressed for recognition of
its special status as a city holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews
alike.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other signs of strain between the Vatican and
the Netanyahu government. In his last Easter message, the pope said
peace in Jerusalem ``is put at risk by dangerous political
decisions,'' apparently a reference to Israel's building of Jewish
settlements in largely Arab East Jerusalem.

BARNICLE STATUS STILL UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two days after The Boston Globe asked for Mike
Barnicle's resignation, the fate of the popular, 25-year Metro
columnist apparently remained unresolved after a meeting he had
with top Globe officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Following an hourlong off-site session with Barnicle, Globe
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor and Assistant to the Publisher Alfred
S. Larkin Jr. issued a short statement saying, ``We consider it a
private meeting between the parties, and have no further comment on
it at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe editor Matthew V. Storin requested Barnicle's resignation
after he acknowledged using a number of jokes in his column from
comic George Carlin's book ``BrainDroppings.'' Barnicle said he had
never read the book, but a film clip showed him recommending it on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, 54, has maintained that he will not resign. When asked
whether the Globe was still seeking his resignation after Friday's
meeting, public relations director Richard P. Gulla said, ``We
haven't said anything differently. Nothing has changed,'' other
than the fact that the meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin and Taylor declined to comment. In a brief interview
Friday evening, Barnicle _ who had made the rounds of media outlets
pleading his case before the meeting with Globe officials _ said he
had no additional comment and was ``sticking with the statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin sought the resignation after a WCVB-TV (Channel 5) clip
showed Barnicle recommending ``BrainDroppings'' on the June 22
``Chronicle'' program. That segment aired about six weeks before
Barnicle's August 2 column, which contained eight jokes similar to
some in the book.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about that column, Barnicle had told Globe
editors that he had never read Carlin's book and had received the
jokes from two friends. Managing Editor Thomas F. Mulvoy Jr. said
that he knows the friends cited by Barnicle, but the Globe has made
no effort to contact them.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Globe suspended Barnicle for a month without pay
for using ``poor judgment'' in writing the column. But after
learning about his televised endorsement of the book, Storin asked
for his resignation, saying Barnicle ``misrepresented himself
either to his television audience or his editors. This
contradiction is unacceptable.'' Globe editors say Barnicle did not
tell them about his endorsement of ``BrainDroppings'' when asked to
explain his Aug. 2 column.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle has said that he never read the book and that his
casual recommendation (he told viewers there was a ``yuk on every
page,'') aired for only ``four seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that, you know, maybe someone out there will
understand the mechanics of the TV business,'' he told Katie Couric
on the ``Today'' show Friday morning, adding that he promoted
``BrainDroppings'' because ``I think (Carlin's) a funny guy. ... I
would promote practically any book, as long as it got people
reading.''
</P>
<P>
   As the drama over Barnicle's status moved into its third day,
reports surfaced that the Globe was reviewing an Aug. 4 Barnicle
column in which he quoted a retired policeman discussing a series
of old murders committed by a well-known crime figure. Managing
Editor Gregory L. Moore said Friday that the paper is trying to
follow up on the column by locating the relatives of the purported
victims. ``We haven't finished the reporting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Globe readers continued to contact the
paper Friday to weigh in on the controversy, although the volume
slowed. On Wednesday, 1,620 calls came into the Globe's city desk,
with only 100 of them supporting the paper's decision to ask
Barnicle to resign. As of late afternoon Friday, 720 more calls had
come in, with the ratio running about 5 to 1 in Barnicle's favor.
In a development that may or may not have been connected to the
furor, the Globe received a bomb threat Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of pressure on the Globe surfaced Friday when
Staples chief executive and chairman Thomas G. Stemberg sent a
letter to publisher Taylor stating, ``I strongly urge you to make
every effort to resolve the differences between the Globe and Mr.
Barnicle ... As chairman and CEO of a major advertiser in The
Boston Globe, I strongly feel that Mike Barnicle's column is an
essential component of the Globe's editorial content and a key
element of the Globe's attractiveness as an advertising vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gulla, Taylor has ``responded personally by letter
to Mr. Stemberg, thanking him for his point of view.'' Gulla added
that the Stemberg letter will not affect the Globe's decision on
Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision will be made on the facts of the situation,'' he
said. When asked how much revenue the Globe derived from Staples
advertising, Gulla said simply: ``a substantial amount.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The market giveth and the market taketh away.
Investors learned that much last week. The question is: What will
the market do now?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows, of course. But parsing the week's trading,
which left the Dow Jones industrial average down 3.2 percent, does
reveal a few clues for investors trying to figure out what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's plunge in stocks, investors asked what had
changed to send the bull into hiding. Was it the economy? Nothing
really new there. Inflation and interest rates are still low,
consumer spending is robust and productivity is high. The wild
cards remain Asia and the strong dollar, which both roil financial
results at American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   There was one big change last week: the market's psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Investors drive stock prices, which makes the market emotional.
Sometimes investors are demanding of stocks; other times they are
not. Last week, they got a lot more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what had been an ``anything goes'' market suddenly
became a ``show me the earnings'' market. And that's what it likely
will stay for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from a period where the market could outperform
earnings growth to one where we really need earnings growth for
stocks to move appreciably higher,'' said Doug Cliggott, United
States equity strategist at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   He says corporate earnings growth for the rest of this year will
be only modestly better than the 1.2 percent in each of the first
two quarters. That's well below what many on Wall Street are
expecting. And he doesn't see a return to high single-digit
earnings growth on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks until mid-1999.
For that reason, Cliggott says he thinks the averages will stall
for the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   But some stocks can prosper even if overall earnings growth
slows. Cliggott thinks those are companies whose earnings prospects
are held to be so low by investors that exceeding them will be
relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   These include all the regional Bell operating companies and the
big, beaten-down oil companies like Amoco, Royal Dutch Petroleum,
British Petroleum and Exxon. He also picks Ford and General Motors,
because most investors aren't expecting much earnings growth there.
All have good dividend yields.
</P>
<P>
   If this truly is a show-me market, said Michael A. Berry,
portfolio manager of the Heartland Midcap Value fund, ``investors
should buy stocks with a margin of safety and some upside
potential.'' That means shares that are cheap relative to their
earnings, book value and cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   His picks include Southdown Inc., a cement maker that is down 16
percent from its April highs. The company has long-term earnings
growth of more than 20 percent annually, yet trades at 24 times
last year's earnings. Immune from Asia fever, it should benefit
from increased spending on highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also likes the oil drillers Ranger Oil, down almost 40
percent from its 52-week high, and Precision Drilling, which trades
at 9 times earnings and has fallen 60 percent from its high within
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil is by no means over. That the Dow and the S&AMP;P could
muster only muted gains after Tuesday is a clear sign that the
bulls are not yet back in control.
</P>
<P>
   No, the stampede last week was to Treasury securities, and
investors drove yields on two-year Treasury notes down 0.18
percent. Heavy demand for two-year notes usually means that the
market is expecting either an easing of interest rates by the
Federal Reserve or a financial upset as yet unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Since an easing in rates is almost out of the question,
investors would be wise to expect more stormy weather. &QL;

PRESS SPECIALIST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEWINSKY FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the media horde closes in for one of its group
interviews on the Monica S. Lewinsky affair, the reporters and
cameras these days are often pressed around a woman with an unusual
history of navigating the nation's most sensitive political
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   She is Judy A. Smith, a Boston University graduate whose
unlikely journey through Washington has made her something of a
press-relations specialist on sex and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Smith has been the spokeswoman for Lewinsky and her
mother, Marcia Lewis. After Lewinsky's grand jury testimony
Thursday, it fell to Smith to feed a statement to the press corps.
When reporters blocked Lewinsky's path to her lawyers' office last
week, it was Smith's job to cut a path to their door.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only the latest political contretemps for Smith, who
has become a noticeable figure in press photos and on TV news
reports. As a White House press aide during the Bush
administration, Smith helped guide Clarence Thomas past sexual
harassment accusations and onto the Supreme Court. She worked for
Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and for the investigators
pursuing Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who was caught on video
smoking crack in a hotel room with a female friend.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an unusual journey through national history for
Smith, 38, whose resume also includes a stint as one of the
highest-ranking African Americans in network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very poised woman who has handled some very tough
tasks,'' said James Wieghart, who worked with Smith on the
Iran-Contra team, where she was a press aide and associate counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who would not comment for this article, is a Washinton,
D.C., native who attended a local all-girls Catholic school, then
moved to Boston in 1976 to earn a communications degree from Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she had just earned a law degree from American
University in Washington when Walsh hired her to help with the
overwhelming media attention to the Iran-Contra investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her first job doing public relations work,'' Walsh
recalled, and it was a tough one. ``There were 25 or 30 reporters
who covered us pretty regularly.'' Much of the investigator's work
was secret, and Smith always showed good judgment in deciding what
she could reveal and what comments would land the office in
trouble, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith moved from Walsh's office to work for US Attorney Jay
Stephens, where she handled a press corps hungry for details of the
case against Barry. And when Smith joined President Bush's press
staff for the last two years of his term, she found herself in the
trenches promoting Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate grilled Thomas about Anita Hill's sexual
harassment complaint against him, the White House stationed Smith
outside the hearing room to make sure Thomas's opponents did not
have the field of TV cameras to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Her background as a lawyer and in press relations for
prosecutors proved valuable, former White House aides say, as did
her perspective as a black woman in an overwhelmingly white
administration. ``Judy was more sensitive to where different groups
opposing Judge Thomas, like the NAACP, were coming from than were
the white male Republicans at the White House,'' said Gary Foster,
another Bush press aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough political battle,'' said Andrew Card, who was
then Bush's deputy chief of staff. ``And then Judy is black, and
Clarence Thomas is a black man, and the black community was divided
in that debate. Personally, I think it was very hard for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House again tapped Smith to work on racially sensitive
matters after Los Angeles erupted in riots over the 1992 Rodney
King verdict. Smith was one of the first Bush aides dispatched to
Los Angeles to prepare for the president's eventual visit. She
helped make sure that White House comments would be seen as
sensitive both to black and white concerns, former colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush years also put Smith in the middle of other public
relations challenges, from the flap over personal travel by chief
of staff John Sununu to early dust-ups in Bush's 1992 reelection
effort. ``There is no better training ground than the White House
press office,'' Foster said. ``From 7:30 a.m. until you leave,
reporters are in your face, and you have to know what to say and
what not to say. Judy Smith evolved in her time there and learned a
tremendous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years after leaving the White House, Smith was senior
vice president for communications at NBC. She left to start her own
public relations firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Through a connection to Lewinsky's mother, Smith was asked to
handle public relations for the former intern, said Wieghart.
Before taking the job, Smith checked in with Wieghart, her old
friend from the Iran-Contra days.
</P>
<P>
   Wieghart said they talked about how Lewinsky's image had been
tattered by a Vanity Fair photo spread and by the constant
newspaper pictures of Lewinsky dining in Washington's finer
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   During the discussion, Smith said she would urge Lewinsky to
take a lower profile so she would not appear to be relishing her
celebrity-status while the nation was in crisis, Wieghart said.
``Her intention _ and I think she's done this _ is to basically put
Monica Lewinsky under wraps ... and remind the press that this was
a young woman, inexperienced in life,'' Wieghart said. Smith would
emphasize to reporters that Lewinsky ``has not been talking to the
press, not trying to hurt Bill Clinton's image, and she has not
been attacking (independent counsel) Ken Starr. And that's pretty
much what her focus is.''

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning toward the end of 2002, if all goes according to
plan, automatic teller machines all over Europe will begin
dispensing crisp new euro notes with their pictures of various
bridges, instead of German marks, French francs, Dutch guilders,
and Italian lira. Already the planning is well under way.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, therefore, the last time such a currency conversion
was undertaken. That was in June 1948, half a century ago. After
nine months of top-secret planning, the Allied occupation
authorities replaced a hodgepodge barter system based on cigarettes
by issuing new deutsche marks for old reich marks at a ratio of one
to 10 _ in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   That monetary reform contributed to a decisive change in the way
we understand the nature of money. It required massive organization
and sleight of hand. Most significant, it paved the way for the
post-World War II German Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle.
And like the saga of D-Day itself, the story of x-day presents a
number of morals.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, German authorities held ceremonies at the barracks,
now a museum, in which the details of the plan had been hammered
out half a century before. Hans Tietermeyer, president of the
Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said, ``June 20, 1948,
represented the economic turning point _ from misery and the
management of shortage to the `economic miracle.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bankers emphasized the story of the 11 German experts who
had been put aboard a bus, its windows taped over, and driven to a
tightly guarded compound at Rothwesten, a suburb of Kassel, not far
from Gottingen. There they worked for 16 hours a day writing rules
and regulations, buoyed by the urgency _ and the suddenly top-notch
cooking _ that was the clearest signal they were about to enter the
world of central banking.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily the monetary reform is associated these days with the
name of Ludwig Erhard. At the time he was head of the Special Unit
on Money and Credit, from which the experts were drawn. Later he
would become West Germany's longtime economics minister and
finally, for three years, its chancellor. Over the years, however,
the antecedents of the Wirtschaftswunder have blurred together.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Marshall Plan, the generous policy of US aid.
There was the liberalization, the removal of price controls and
rationing that was overseen by Erhard. And there was the monetary
reform that made it possible. This, in large part, was the work of
a nearly forgotten young genius named Edward A. Tenenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article on the monetary reform leaves little doubt that
it was the 26-year-old Tenenbaum who pushed the measure through.
Charles P. Kindleberger and F. Taylor Ostrander (a seasoned
historical economist and a well-traveled business executive
respectively, both of whom worked on European reconstruction as
young men in the years after World War II) write of Tenenbaum that
``he was not a particularily warm or outgoing man, but he was
bright, very bright, acknowledged widely to have been the leader of
the Allied team that pushed Allied monetary reform to its
completion.''
</P>
<P>
   The scion of a distinguished Polish family that fled to America
in the 1930s, Tenenbaum graduated from high school, then returned
to Europe for a time to sharpen his languages _ he spoke English,
German, and French fluently, Spanish, Italian, and some Russian. He
graduated summa cum laude from Yale in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up rapidly in the government economic and intelligence
arms, and by 1947 was the Allied military government's chief
liaison to the Special Unit on Money and Credit _ at less than half
the age of Erhard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Hitler had ordered that there be no postwar economic
planning for Germany; nevertheless various authorities (Erhard
among them) had been writing gingerly all along about how to deal
with the nation's exploding debt. The war ended and the pace
quickened in 1946 with the delivery (to military governor General
Lucius Clay) of the Colm-Dodge-Goldsmith report on the financial
rehabilitation of Germany. This was the map with which Tenenbaum
had to create his blueprint. Not surprisingly, it anticipated the
problems faced by suddenly liberalizing nations ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Of special interest in the fall of 1947, of course, were the
Russians. Would they agree to a single currency for both portions
of a divided Germany? An even larger issue than the nascent Cold
War had to do with whether the new currency had to be backed by
gold. Whether a purely paper currency would work was no more a
technological certainty than had been the atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later Tenenbaum wrote, ``We did nothing that would
have made it impossible for the Soviets to join us in using the new
currency. Nothing in the wording of the new currency was
inconsistent with any known attitude of the Soviets. There was no
indication of an issuing authority, no signature, nothing except
the demonination, the name `Deutsche Mark' (which had been used in
quadripartite discussion), and the word Banknote. These were
nobody's promise to pay anything, the ultimate conclusion of
Western monetary history and the final triumph of the nominalist
history of money,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There was opposition from the Germans, flak from the British
(who tried to engineer into the plan authorization for
Keynesian-style deficits,) interference from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum brooked none of it. ``Operation Bird Dog'' was
launched, beginning with the printing of the new currency in the
Unitted States. The Russians were told, but the rest was top
secret: 23,000 steel cases, shipped from New York marked for
``Barcelona'' via Bremen, then delivered to Frankfurt by 800 Army
trucks, pending their surprise delivery to individual banks. The
greatest logistical triumph since the Allied landing on the beaches
of Normandy, crowed Tenebaum. X-day went off almost without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it worked. The great German hyperinflation of the
1920s had led to Hitler. But the stabilization of June 20, 1948,
replaced in days the battered cigarette-based system and produced
only robust economic growth. The stability of the mark became a
symbol of the postwar German success, its stability a badge of
pride to Germans traveling abroad. Gradually the Germans who were
such successful stewards of the system began to take credit for its
design.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Kindleberger and Ostrander write, ``There is
something to be said for a form of benevolent despotism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of young Tenebaum, pushing to currency reform
through the German experts and politicians at Rothwestern and
earlier,'' they say, is reminiscent of accounts of the US
representative, Harry Dexter White, ramrodding through the Bretton
Woods Agreements almost singlehandedly in 1944, leaving little else
to do for John Maynard Keynes, Undersecretary of State Dean
Acheson, or the hundreds of self-important representatives of
states around the world who attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
   After brief further assignments in Paris and Athens, Edward
Tenenbaum returned to the United States. He worked quietly as a
consultant on economic matters, often for the International
Monetary Fund, arguing powerfully for burden-sharing in German
economic affairs, until he was killed in an automobile accident in
1975. He left behind an unfinished manuscript called ``The German
Mark'' that has lain unpublished in the archives ever since.
(Kindleberger and Ostrander say that it is brilliant on the nature
of repressed inflation.)
</P>
<P>
   It is Tenenbaum's widow who has had the last word. In a 1980
letter to The New York Review of Books criticizing Milton and Rose
Friedman's ``Free To Choose'' for its treatment of the German
monetary reform, she wrote, ``The Friedmans' whole book is a
diatribe against government interference and bureaucracy, yet in
Germany after World War II reconstruction of the economy could not
have occurred without a sound currency and massive aid from the
Marshall Plan, both accomplishments of the US bureaucracy so
despised by the Friedmans.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Two Lucky People,'' the Friedmans' joint memoir published
this year, there is a five-page entry on the autumn in Paris in
1950 that Friedman spent consulting to the agency. It contains much
information on their hotels, schools, nanny, luncheons, and tours.
There is also an interesting little problem about bartering
cigarettes for gas upon entering Germany without any deutsche
marks. But there is nothing at all about the origins of the
Wirtschaftswunder that was then taking root.

 GM SALES ARE STILL DAMAGED BY RECENT AUTOWORKERS' STRIKE  (js) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ The nearly eight-week-long strike this
summer at two General Motors parts factories will continue to hurt
the automaker's sales until October, and some customers have been
permanently lost, GM's top marketing executive said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the gloomiest assessment yet of the strike's damage, Ronald
Zarrella, the group vice president for North American sales,
service and marketing, said that GM dealerships would not be fully
restocked until mid-September. The introduction of some 1999 models
will also be delayed, he said, because GM has so many parts left
over for 1998 models that it is cheaper for the company to keep
building those models instead of discarding the parts.
</P>
<P>
   The company will run new advertisements this weekend that will
emphasize that the automaker is back in business and that 1998 cars
and trucks are available at discounts that reflect the end of the
model year, Zarrella said. But GM's market share, usually about 31
percent, will be below 25 percent in August and will not rebound
fully until October, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving a number, Zarrella said some longtime customers
had decided to buy cars and trucks from competitors and would be
hard to woo back. Each percentage point of market share is worth
150,000 cars and trucks a year, or $3 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jacobs, an automotive consultant in Rutherford, N.J., said
that General Motors' permanent loss might be as high as
one-and-a-half percentage points because the strike slowed its
introduction of several completely new car and truck models. But GM
executives may benefit from highlighting the strike's harm, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can refer to the long strike as derailing them from
staying over 30 percent, a convenient excuse for declining market
share,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's assessment of the strike's costs grew steadily
grimmer this week, and the company's share price drifted down
despite GM's announcement of several initiatives long sought by
institutional investors, including a spinoff of the autoparts
subsidiary and a consolidation of marketing operations. Shares
rebounded to $72.50 during the day Friday, from $70.25 on Thursday,
but then gave back some of the gain after Zarrella's disclosures at
a midday news conference on Friday at the University of Michigan's
annual auto industry conference here. The stock closed up 81.25
cents a share at $71.0625.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced on Wednesday that its sales dropped 37.7 percent in
July compared with July 1997. Its market share was just 21.1
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a typical year, many GM factories would be closed by now to
install new equipment for the production of the next model year's
cars and trucks. The new models would then go on sale in late
September and early October.
</P>
<P>
   But Zarrella said the company has continued to produce 1998
models since the strike ended on July 29. It still has
1998-model-year parts for 200,000 more cars and trucks, or about
two weeks of production. The company will use up these parts before
converting production to the 1999 model year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have traditionally introduced their new models at the
same time because of a belief that laggards could lose sales to
companies that move faster. But Zarrella said it was not clear
whether GM would suffer this autumn by offering a mix of 1998 and
1999 models even as other automakers have ample supplies of 1999
models.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts estimate that the strike cost GM $12
billion in lost production and $3 billion in lost after-tax
profits. Until this week, some analysts thought GM would be able to
recover most of the lost profits by running its factories around
the clock for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But John Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, said on
Wednesday that even with extra production through the rest of the
year, the automaker's permanent loss would be about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a buzz saw in the strike,'' Smith said.

THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Frances Bean Cobain, your limo is waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old daughter of Courtney Love and late Nirvana leader
Kurt Cobain probably isn't thinking about a music career yet, but
if she ever wants one you can bet the major labels will be waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Other kids of rock icons didn't wait long.
</P>
<P>
   They may not sound like their famous parents, but the offspring
of John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend, Loudon Wainwright III
and Stephen Stills have joined the family business.
</P>
<P>
   They've all released very different albums, but they have one
thing in common: Everyone thinks they got signed because of their
last name. This despite the fact that Jakob Dylan's band the
Wallflowers now outsells his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriting, however, doesn't ordinarily run in the family.
Think about novelists, for instance. There just aren't that many
parent/offspring teams who have both been successful. It's not like
learning a skill and asking your pop to help get you into the
union. You're not only going to be judged on your creativity _ and
then your sales _ but, inevitably how you stack up to Mom or Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Then think about what's its like being the offspring of revered
figures like Leonard Cohen and Richard Thompson, whose songs are
the subject of tribute albums. Talk about intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're the son of a Beatle or Dylan, music legends, how
do you deal with their legacies? Do you ignore it? Or do you
acknowledge it up front and simply hope everyone forgets at some
point?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a roundup of the new rock brat pack. They have one other
thing in common: They all deny they got their record deals because
of their famous last names. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEAN ONO LENNON
</P>
<P>
   Age: 22 &QL; 
Dad and mom: John Lennon and Yoko Ono _ nothing serious; dad's been
called the most influential figure in the history of pop music;
mom's an influential pop artist and experimental musician. After
Sean was born, Lennon stayed home with Ono to act as
``house-husband'' in New York's Dakota apartments until he was
killed Dec. 8, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``I was 5 when Dad died. As a kid, I was more
into my mom's music than my dad's. I know every song she ever
wrote. I'm an expert in Yoko Ono's music. Beyond her being my mom,
she's also a really good friend. The thing my mom showed me is that
all mediums are there for you to use and exploit _ from films to
visual art to music _ and that it is all really just expression. It
all boils down to creative ideas. If the concept is good, it
doesn't matter if you're making a painting, a sculpture or a pop
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: ``I feel real lucky because of the
name, but that's why I went with (Beastie Boys label) Grand Royal _
because they would never sign someone because of their last name.
To be honest, I don't think the reaction (to my last name) has been
totally good. If anyone asks me about my dad or my childhood, I'm
happy to talk about it. The shock (of his father's death) I got at
an early age created in me an intense distrust, and I reacted to
that mistrust by trying to be open with everybody. I've been really
friendly with people from a pretty early age. Now that I have all
this attention, I want to use it for a positive goal _ to get my
music out and to promote open-mindedness _ those things are
important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``Into the Sun'' (Grand Royal) _ Art-pop with fake
jazz and Beach Boys overtones. Sean has some nice instrumentation
but the songs seem half-formed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JAKOB DYLAN
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Bob Dylan _ An incalculable influence on popular music; as
a songwriter, he showed pop lyrics could mean something; as a
singer, he proved you didn't have to boast a conventionally good
voice to put your songs across; as a musician, he sparked such
genres as folk-rock and country-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: Jakob was born in New York, the youngest of
five children of Bob Dylan and Sara Lowndes. He was about 3 when
the family moved to Los Angeles; his parents divorced in 1977 after
12 years of marriage. In hundreds of interviews, Jakob, whose
popular band the Wallflowers won two Grammy Awards this year, has
respected his father's three-decade insistence on privacy and never
talked about his dad except in a June 1997 Rolling Stone interview.
At the time, he said, ``I get asked all the time, `What was your
dad like as a parent?' And I say, `I'm 27 years old; I'm not a
crackhead; I don't go on afternoon talk shows and spill.' I mean,
you can probably figure out for yourself that he did a decent
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: Jakob has said the Dylan name has
worked against him. ``And I actually found some kind of power in
that. I still do. I do not mope and I do not complain. I've driven
my own path here and I'm on it and it's fine. But if people think
it must be easy ...''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``Bringing Down the Horse'' (Interscope) _ Like his
dad, Jakob is no stranger to poetically ambiguous lyrics lots of
people can relate to. The Wallflowers' Grammy-winning ``One
Headlight,'' and ``6th Avenue Heartache'' were among rock radio's
biggest hits last year. The band, currently recording its third
album, boasts a rootsy Hammond B-3-driven sound reminiscent of such
classic Bob Dylan albums as ``Highway 61 Revisited.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EMMA TOWNSHEND
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Pete Townshend _ His furious guitar chords and windmill
strums powered the Who, considered one of the finest British
songwriters of his era on the basis of songs like ``The Kids Are
Alright,'' ``My Generation'' and the rock opera ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``My dad would never have a copy of his
records at home so I'm not familiar with much of his work,'' she
told the British music mag Mojo.
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: ``I'm quite happy to trade on the
family name because I'm proud of my dad,'' Townshend said. ``I feel
sorry for him because he's always been famous. To date there
haven't been that many people in rock 'n' roll who've had to cope
with having a famous parent so it's still a bit of a novelty. It
doesn't seem a problem in the movie industry. Look at Michael
Douglas. People appreciate Jamie Lee Curtis and Tony Curtis as
individuals. When people hear my music I think they forget about
who my dad is. My mum always kept my feet on the ground. If she
lends you a tenner. she always gets it back off you.''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``Winterland'' (Eastwest) _ Obviously influenced by
Kate Bush and Tori Amos, Emma writes lush confessionals like the
track ``Five a Side Football,'' which she says was partly inspired
by problems at home. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Age: 25
</P>
<P>
   Dad and mom: Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle _ Dad's a
singer-songwriter with a sardonic, witty confessional style that's
made him a concert favorite in the United States and England; mom
worked with sister Anna in the folk duo the McGarrigles, which
received international recognition in 1974 when Linda Ronstadt
covered their ``Heart Like a Wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``We were always the weird artists on the
block. For a long time I was resentful (of my dad) because he was
away for a long time touring and I thought he didn't love me. But
in a weird way, as I got older and realized how dedicated he was to
what he wanted to accomplish and how hard he was working, I
realized it wasn't his fault. I learned to admire his
perseverence.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: ``If the label is banking on the
Wainwright name, they're in trouble. No, they didn't sign me for my
name. (DreamWorks executive) Lenny Waronker doesn't sign anyone
because of their name. I know a lot of these children of famous
music people, and except for Teddy Thompson, I'm really at the
bottom of the barrel if you're gonna judge it on the fame of the
parents. And I'm thankful for that because I'm free of a lot of
things they have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``Rufus Wainwright'' (DreamWorks) _ Bears the
influence of opera and cabaret _ some call it popera _ Van Dyke
Parks did the string arrangements. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ADAM COHEN
</P>
<P>
   Age: 25
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Leonard Cohen _ Born nearly a decade earlier than the
Beatles or Rolling Stones and an intellectual and published
poet/novelist to boot, his classic albums _ such as ``The Songs of
Leonard Cohen,'' ``Songs From a Room'' and ``Songs of Love and
Hate'' _ are often breathtakingly perfect; he's also the subject of
two tribute albums in which his songs are covered by R.E.M. and
Bono, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``My dad has given me a very high standard by
which to live. I've definitely inherited his sensibility. He's
given me so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: ``You don't get a record deal until
the company feels it can make a buck off you. The fact that I am
who I am has definitely raised an eyebrow, but I've benefited from
that. By putting us all together (other sons and daughters of rock
icons) it almost sets up a tone of solidarity that I'm not averse
to at all. To resist is to fuel people's intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``Adam Cohen'' (Columbia) _ Bears the influence of
dad only in terms of people behind the scenes, such as longtime
Leonard Cohen producer Steve Lindsay, who produced here;
high-profile session musicians such as Dean Parks and Jim Keltner
helped out on this collection of catchy pop tunes and ballads. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHRIS STILLS
</P>
<P>
   Age: 23
</P>
<P>
   Dad and mom: Stephen Stills and Veronique Sanson _ Dad is famed
for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash,
two of pop's most enduring and successful groups; mom is a French
singer, pianist and composer.
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``When I heard `For What It's Worth' for the
first time in my life, I just sat there and played it over and over
again. That's when I realized that's what it's all about. It was a
big eye-opener. It touched something that all the other (nonsense)
didn't come close to.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: ``It makes perfect sense. There's no
denying it. I got some of my dad's guitar chops, I got some of my
mom's piano chops. I got really lucky on the gene pool. Super
lucky. And I'm not denying it. When you hear me or look at me, if
you have knowledge of my parents, you go, `Wow!' Everybody jumps on
it like it's contrived, but this is all natural. We (Stills and
second-generation rock pals such as Cohen, Wainwright and Teddy
Thompson) fell into this because we love it. This wasn't imposed on
us by our parents. In fact, our parents were more, `Try and avoid
it, kid. You don't want to go there because this business sucks.'
We just happen to be the sons of guys who were part of an era where
people were doing something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The album: ``100 Year Thing'' (Atlantic) _ Multilayered
harmonies, nice melodies and poetic lyrics show this apple didn't
fall far from the tree; produced by Ethan Johns, son of famed '60s
knob-twirler Glyn Johns (Rolling Stones, the Who). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TEDDY THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Age: 22
</P>
<P>
   Dad and mom: Richard Thompson and Linda Thompson _ Before
breaking up, the couple released six albums, including the British
folk-rock masterpiece ``I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight'';
dad is among the most admired and critically acclaimed songwriters
and guitarists in folk-rock music; he's also the subject of a
three-disc career retrospective and a tribute album in which the
likes of R.E.M., Bonnie Raitt, David Byrne and Los Lobos cover his
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the house: ``Me and my sister spent a lot of time in the
back of the Volvo station wagon at folk festivals and we hated folk
music,'' Thompson told Mojo. ``I'd watch my parents on stage and
cringe. Dad would close his eyes and and I thought that was so
stupid. Folk sounded horrible, droning away with no drums. I can't
describe how much I hated it. Only in the last couple of years has
that gone away and I'm listening to all the albums and furiously
trying to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it made a difference?: Teddy has a publishing deal but not a
record contract. He appeared with Richard Thompson on his British
tour last January. ``He wasn't obliged to ask me to sing with him.
He's done his fatherly duty. When I sign, I want to do a quick
record, not spend 18 months like Rufus.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Facing a mounting rebel threat, President
Laurent Kabila of the Congo sought Friday to persuade other African
leaders to press Rwanda to end its support of a 6-day old
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila left the capital, Kinshasa, on Friday to meet with a
senior South African delegation in the southern Congolese city of
Lubumbashi, and then flew to nearby Zimbabwe to confer Friday
evening with regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Lubumbashi meeting ended without comment from either side.
Before the South African delegation left for the Congo on Friday
morning, however, its leader, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo,
reaffirmed South Africa's support for Kabila's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping that they will be able to normalize the
situation,'' Nzo said. ``That will be our message.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African statement comes at a time when Kabila is
facing sharply eroded diplomatic support, both regionally and
internationally, and is under siege from a well-executed rebellion
that has seized control of much of eastern Congo and is now
mounting increasingly bold attacks in the west.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Kabila's
government, and although it is unlikely to provide any military
support, a strong diplomatic backing for Kabila could sway other
African countries to stand by him.
</P>
<P>
   At the Zimbabwe meeting, Kabila was expected to have his first
face-to-face encounter with leaders of Rwanda, which is widely
believed to be providing strong backing for the rebellion against
his government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rwanda has repeatedly denied any involvement in the
recent fighting, that country, which backed Kabila's own drive to
take power two years ago, has grown openly disenchanted with
Kabila's moves to weed ethnic Tutsi, whose ancestors originated in
Rwanda, from positions of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious, from the Rwandan perspective, was Kabila's
inability to stop attacks by anti-Rwandan rebels operating from
Congolese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's failure to clamp down on cross-border rebel activity
has also cost him the support of two other major African allies who
helped bring him to power, Uganda and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's diplomatic effort comes at a time when anti-government
guerrillas have dramatically broadened their campaign against him,
grabbing control of several towns in the country's southwest near
Congo's only seaport, Moanda.
</P>
<P>
   With the rebels in control of these towns, which lie only 300
miles from the capital, few experts expect Kabila's enemies to come
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``A political settlement would entail that we keep Kabila in his
position, and we are totally opposed to that,'' Commander Sylvain
Bikelenge, the officer in charge of the rebel-held eastern city of
Goma told Reuters. ``We believe that the Congo needs new leadership
working under a broad-based government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the rebel advances of the last week have stunned Kabila,
however, the insurgents have also suffered some setbacks. Reports
from international relief and church workers in the last two days
have confirmed the Congolese government's claim to have at least
temporarily beaten back a rebel attempt to capture the strategic
river port of Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   With Kabila leaving the country to meet with fellow heads of
state, there was diplomatic speculation in Kinshasa about whether
he would return there soon, or stay in the southern city of
Lubumbashi to rally fellow southerners to his government's war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, who was born nearby, used Lubumbashi, an important
mining town, as his headquarters for the second half of his
seven-month war to unseat his predecessor, the longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Kabila's best chance at holding onto
power now depended upon a force long exiled in Angola, known as the
Katangese Gendarmes, who fought in Angola's long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Katangese, southerners like Kabila, form one of the
principal components of the new national army that Kabila has been
attempting to build since defeating Mobutu's forces, but diplomats
say that many of their leaders have felt shunned by the new
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila's best shot at this point lies with the Katangese,''
said one Western diplomat. ``If he can get them to fight for him,
than maybe, just maybe, he'll be able to hold on.''

   BOEING-CONDIT (Seattle) What started out as just another rumor
that heads were about to roll at Boeing _ namely Chairman Phil
Condit's _ has taken on a life of its own, with some analysts
attributing the company's stock rise yesterday to the news. While
Boeing officials refused to dignify the rumors earlier in the week,
yesterday they categorically denied them. Boeing President Harry
Stonecipher even sent his own e-mail response to the ``Grape Vine
News'' that was sent directly to him. ``You better get yourself a
new grapevine because the one you have is seriously flawed and
useless,'' Stonecipher wrote. ``It is wrong on all counts.''

INSIDE THE PENSION, A GOLDEN PARACHUTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.C.)   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When is a pension plan more than just a pension plan?
</P>
<P>
   When it potentially offers a multimillion-dollar ``golden
parachute'' to a young chief executive who recently sold his
company in one of the decade's biggest merger deals.
</P>
<P>
   Read between the lines of the employment contract for David A.
Coulter, BankAmerica's chief executive, with the new company being
created from his bank's proposed $67 billion merger with
Nationsbank, and some interesting figures emerge.
</P>
<P>
   If Coulter, 50, retires from the new company, he is scheduled to
receive annual pension payments equal to 95 percent of his 1997
salary and bonus at BankAmerica. That amount is not spelled out in
the contract but can easily be tracked down using executive
salaries disclosed in BankAmerica's proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Coulter received a salary of $987,500 and a bonus of
$4.25 million _ or total compensation of about $5.24 million. His
new pension plan thus guarantees him annual payments of $4.98
million upon retirement until his death. This would be in addition
to tens of millions of dollars in stock options he could exercise
upon his departure.
</P>
<P>
   If his wife is alive upon his death, she would receive
survivor's benefits worth about $3.7 million annually until her own
death. Coulter's current pension is worth only a relatively paltry
$810,153 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Coulter may not choose to retire soon. He is going to
be president of the combined company. And when the merger was
announced in April, both boards said they intended for Coulter to
eventually succeed Nationsbank's chief executive, Hugh L. McColl
Jr., as chief of the merged bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger agreement did not guarantee Coulter the top spot.
McColl, 62, who engineered a deal that gives Nationsbank a more
prominent role than that of BankAmerica in the merged company, is
known to enjoy the perquisites and power that come with the chief
executive's job and has shown no signs that he plans to step down
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and bank advisers have speculated that when McColl
does depart, his job will go instead to a Nationsbank executive
loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Coulter does not get the big job, he may still stay at
the combined company. Indeed, Coulter, a San Francisco resident, is
now shopping for a new home in Charlotte, N.C., where Nationsbank
is based and where the headquarters of the merged company will be
situated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coulter's bountiful retirement package attracted the
attention of Graef Crystal, editor of the Crystal Report, a
newsletter on executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they artfully built it around a pension so people
wouldn't realize what was going on here,'' Crystal said. ``I find
it all very obfuscatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument in the early 1980s was that golden parachutes
were needed to create a level playing field so CEOs wouldn't get in
the way of sensible mergers,'' he added. ``But now it has tilted
too far the other way because there are untold riches to be reaped
from selling your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter was unavailable for comment. A BankAmerica spokesman
cited language in Coulter's employment agreement which said that
both banks determined ``it is in the best interests of their
respective shareholders to assure that'' Coulter continued to work
at the new company once the merger was completed.
</P>
<P>
   If Coulter does take advantage of his pension plan and retire
from the merged company in the near future, Crystal said, it would
be only the latest in a series of increasingly outsized payouts to
departing chief executives. He cited the $42 million payment
recently granted to William J. Catacosinos, former head of the Long
Island Lighting Co., as part of New York State's partial takeover
of the utility.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, is
scheduled to receive $24.4 million if he quits or is dismissed
during the two years after his company merges with Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter has had a brief tenure as BankAmerica's chief executive,
and Crystal finds it curious that he was ready to cede control so
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coulter had only been CEO for a few years, so why was he so
ready to step down?'' Crystal asked. ``He may have decided it's
time to clean up and go out and lie on the nearest beach to San
Francisco.''

FAMILY OF BOY ABUSED BY PRIEST LOOKS AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FARMINGTON, N.H. _ When Thomas Harding enters St. Peter's Church
Sunday morning, the emotional hurt may be as great as the physical
pain that dogs his every step.
</P>
<P>
   For tomorrow, at the 10:45 a.m. Mass, Harding will worship for
the first time since the parish priest's conviction last week for
sexually abusing his teenage son. Harding has clashed with
parishioners over the years, but the friction became more intense
once he sought the prosecution of Reverend Roger Fortier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared what's going to happen when I walk into church. I
really am,'' Harding, 52, said in an interview at his cramped home.
``In my mind, I see some frantic person saying, `You put him away
for life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harding will enter the plain brick church with his grandson,
walk toward the left-middle pew he always uses, and await the
reaction of neighbors and friends with whom he has worshipped and
socialized for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   What Harding will discover is whether the anger, the contempt,
and the telephone calls will give way to forgiveness. But despite
last week's verdict, Harding believes some people are still
unwilling to believe their pastor was a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize you're talking about a priest, someone you
were brought up to respect,'' Harding said. ``You don't mess with
the priest, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Harding's son Joseph, a former altar boy, accused Father Fortier
last October of sexually abusing him in 1994 and 1995. Since the
priest's arrest, feelings of anguish and betrayal have wracked a
large family devoted to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Father Fortier was Harding's close friend, a man who shared
coffee with Harding, a severely disabled machinist, nearly every
morning. He celebrated Thanksgiving, Christmas and children's
birthdays with the family. He confided deep secrets to Harding,
including the fact he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Harding turned from confidant, to victim. After
another family accused the priest of sexual assaulting a teenager,
Joseph Harding took his father aside last year and confided that
Father Fortier had also abused him.
</P>
<P>
   The priest had shown the boy pornographic videos in the rectory;
he had fondled his crotch; he had performed oral sex on him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Father Fortier was convicted of sexual abuse in both
cases. He could be sentenced to 20 years in prison on each of eight
counts and still faces trial involving a third youth. &UR;  &LR; Father
Fortier is expected to be sentenced in October.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal has tested the faith of a family whose home is filled
with religious images, and who trusted the priest to take Joseph on
the kind of outings Harding could not manage himself. For Harding,
the chance to have apriest take Joseph, the youngest of 11
children, to the mall and other destinations seemed a blessing for
a man who once thought he might never walk again. ``I felt good
that he could do that.'' said Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the feeling toward the priest is far different. ``I miss
Roger Fortier for the friend that I thought he was, but I hate
Roger Fortier today for the person he turned out to be,'' Harding
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although Harding can speak of hate for Father Fortier, that
emotion is not shared by many parishioners among the 300 families
who comprise St. Peter's Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardings' decision to press charges against the popular
priest was greeted with disdain by some friends and neighbors,
Harding said. People with whom he had worshipped for decades moved
away from him at church, and on the street, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the parish say Harding's longstanding difficulties
with churchmembers have more to do with his past involvement in
church administration than with the Father Fortier case.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, meanwhile, has stated he will not return to St. Peter's.
But his father is adamant that he will not be pushed away.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Young, whose son was the other victim of sexual abuse,
feels betrayed by Father Fortier but said the church is a
``loving'' one that will heal and become stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Harding recalls only three people who offered him encouragement
in the nine months from Father Fortier's arrest to conviction. The
priest did not apologize to the family after the verdict, said
Harding, who added that the Diocese of Manchester had not contacted
them directly.
</P>
<P>
   Harding resigned last week as grand knight of the local Knights
of Columbus, the Catholic men's group. His last official act was to
remove Father Fortier from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cilley, director of religious education at the church,
said he is not aware of any hard feelings. ``I feel that the people
of St. Peter's are good people who work very hard for their parish
community as well as the community of Farmington,'' Cilley added.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Eddy Bisson, the new pastor at St. Peter's, said he
will not have a chance to speak about the subject at Mass tomorrow
because a visiting missionary is scheduled to lead the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's just as well,'' Father Bisson said. ``This way,
we can see what people may be feeling and keep an eye out on the
church a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding stressed that his anger is directed at Father Fortier _
and not at his religion, or the church where he served as
administrative assistant from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someday I can forgive him, but I can never forget what
he did,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to pick myself up from this and become a better
person _ one with respect. I had it before, and I'll have it
again.''

   Editors, The New York Times is planning a package of stories in
connection with the terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam:
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-BOMBINGS (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Ledeall: Two massive bombs
exploded three minutes apart outside U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Friday morning, killing more than 80 other people,
including several Americans (figures to come), in what officials
said were coordinated terrorist attacks. In Washington, President
Clinton condemned the attacks as abhorrent and inhuman acts of
cowardice. He vowed to bring those responsible to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.'' By James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-U.S. (Washington) _ Clinton administration officials said
that while no one had claimed responsibility for the bombings, the
attacks had probably been carried out by one of a small number of
terrorist groups that had taken aim at American installations in
the past. The government has sent teams of FBI agents, military
medical officers and explosives experts to Kenya and Tanzania to
aid in the investigation. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-SCENE (Nairobi) _ The carnage and chaos at the site of
the Kenya bombing. By James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-SECURITY (Washington) _ The two bombed embassies did not
meet the security standards set for the State Department's overseas
posts by an independent review panel created following terrorist
attacks against the American embassy and marine barrack in Beirut.
The embassies had never been modified because the White House and
Congress had never provided enough money, officials said. By James

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shoved against a wall in a hallway at the Union
Avenue Elementary School here, and stacked as high as a fourth
grader, are two dozen unopened boxes of brand new text books.
</P>
<P>
   The sight is a teacher's dream come true. But the books inside
are in Spanish, so the boxes will soon be sent away.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with the beginning of a new term in 50 year-round
public schools in Los Angeles, the nation's most diverse and
populous state took its first shaky steps into the uncertain new
world of Proposition 227, the ballot measure that effectively
dismantles 30 years of bilingual education in California.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally watched initiative, which was approved by the
voters last June, will cause sweeping changes in public schools
like Union, where nearly 90 percent of its nearly 2,000 pupils were
enrolled in bilingual classes last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What 227 is doing is adding to the stress level of teachers,''
Rita Payan Caldera, the principal of Union, said on the first day
of school as she answered parents' questions in Spanish and
directed children to their classes in English. ``I think it was too
drastic of a change too quickly. But it's the law, and we're going
to do our best to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227 has forced school administrators and teachers to
act and think in ways they have not for decades. Under the new law,
the schools have to do in one year what sometimes took three, five
or seven years to do _ if ever, critics say _ and that is, to teach
children accustomed to another language to speak, write and read
English.
</P>
<P>
   If this first week is any indication, the schools of California
are in for a bumpy journey, at least for the next few weeks and
months.
</P>
<P>
   Classes began here with the Los Angeles Unified School District,
the second largest in the country (after New York City's),
scrambling to find enough appropriate English language books and
other educational material to comply with the new law and its tight
timetable for teaching the three Rs to immigrant children
``overwhelmingly'' in English instead of Spanish, Korean or any of
the other foreign languages that have filled California's
classrooms for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to deliver instruction on Day 1 like we
would normally be,'' conceded Victoria Castro, president of the
school district's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles was not the only California school district
caught with its supply closet bare and its lesson plan unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statewide problem,'' said Doug Stone, a spokesman
for Delaine Eastin, the State Superintendent of Schools. ``A lot of
these districts purchased material before the election, and now the
Superintendent is going to have ask the legislature for additional
money so new resources can be purchased.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools opened this week only after two failed court
challenges and promises of more legal maneuvering. There were
sleepless nights for Mrs. Caldera and other principals and
administrators, and nagging worries for immigrant parents like
Ruben Ramirez, 29, and Sylvia Garcia, 35, who share the same hope:
a better life for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want English for my son,'' Ramirez said as he walked his
little boy to his first day of kindergarten at Union. ``We use
English on my job, but I don't understand everything. That's why I
like it for my son.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Garcia, who has three children at Union, said she was
afraid that Proposition 227 would make life harder in her
neighborhood of immigrants. ``It's not good, only English,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one group of teachers vowing to defy the new law and
some districts and school officials in other cities searched for
loopholes to delay or ignore its implementation, arguing that it
would harm, not help, the 1.4 million public school children in
California for whom English is a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers were uncertain about who will even be in their
classrooms 30 days from now when, under the new law, parents can
sign waiver forms and seek to have their children put in what would
probably be a limited number of bilingual classes. There is some
talk around los Angeles by opponents of Proposition 227 of starting
a campaign to create a wave of waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a relatively easy first week, considering that
only a handful of schools opened. Implementation is going
``relatively well,'' said Ruben Zacarias, the Los Angeles
Superintendent of Schools. ``Everyone's dealing with this _
`coping' with this, I guess, is a better word.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other schools will begin classes in the next few
weeks, and by early September some 7,500 schools across the state
will open. ``That will be the real test,'' said Stone, the
spokesman for the state superintendent of schools. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ron K. Unz, a conservative Republican and Silicon Valley
millionaire who was the main sponsor and financial backer of the
ballot measure, said school districts throughout the state should
pass the test, and if they did not they would have only themselves
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The districts, Unz said, had ample time to develop contingency
plans to put the initiative into effect. It was leading in voter
opinion polls for months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Unified and others partially ignored the initiative in
the vain hope that a legal challenge would be successful,'' he
said. ``To the extent that some schools were not ready, I think
that's irresponsible on the part of elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Castro, the school board president, said the district
had done everything it could to prepare. ``We can't act on specter
or opinion polls,'' she said. ``What if we had made those purchases
and it didn't pass?''
</P>
<P>
   At Union, where 99 percent of the pupils are eligible for free
lunch programs, Mrs. Caldera, the principal, and her staff do not
have time to worry about finger pointing right now. They have
children to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to approach this kicking and screaming,'' said
Mrs. Caldera, who voted against Proposition 227 and has been
involved in bilingual education as a teacher or an administrator
for 25 years. ``I'm going to approach this as an opportunity, but
we're going to have a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, she said, is a lack of supplies, especially
English language textbooks for children with limited skills in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Montoya, 30, a bilingual teacher at Union for the last
three years, said he does not believe that one year is an adequate
time for most students to learn enough English to be sent to
mainstream classes, as the new law calls for. But he also said that
bilingual education had problems and that English was not stressed
enough in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teachers got lazy,'' he said. ``It was just easier to
speak Spanish to the kids.''

OLD VETS' FUNERALS CROWD MILITARY CEMETERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ At the Massachusetts National Cemetery here,
funeral processions queue up with military-like precision to keep
pace with a schedule that on some days dictates an interment every
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Military honors _ the firing of rifle volleys and the playing of
``Taps'' _ are provided far more often now by tape than by buglers
and service personnel. And because graves are dug and filled in
bunches, funeral parties are not allowed to hold graveside
services.
</P>
<P>
   As the World War II generation passes away in record numbers,
the national cemetery, the only one of its kind in New England, is
struggling to keep up. Set on 750 acres adjacent to the
Massachusetts Military Reservation, the cemetery is charged with
providing an honorable burial at no cost to the nation's veterans
and their spouses. But providing a personal touch at a very
difficult time is no easy task for a cemetery that averages 9 to 10
funerals a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for some people, but the cemetery has a system that
works,'' said Robert Studley, regional partner for the Loewen chain
of funeral homes. ``If you're not there at the proper time, you're
put way back in the line, and there can be a wait.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Veterans Administration, which runs the
cemetery here and 114 others around the country, the passing of the
World War II generation will result in a steady increase in veteran
burials over the coming years, peaking at 620,000 in 2008. The
national cemetery in Bourne handles 2,100 burials a year, and the
number is expected to increase to as high as 3,000 over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   All veterans with discharges other than dishonorable, their
spouses, and their dependent children are eligible for burial in a
national cemetery. The government covers the cost of the grave, the
grave opening, the grave liner, and the grave marker, all of which
would cost at least $2,000 at many private cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt W. Rotar, director of the Massachusetts National Cemetery,
says it has plenty of room and adds that his staff, increasing from
22 to 25 full-time personnel next year, should be able to keep pace
with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cemetery system is one of the few agencies in the Veterans
Administration that are expanding rather than consolidating,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rotar, a veteran himself, acknowledges that the
one-size-fits-all approach of the cemetery is not to everyone's
liking, although he said he does his best to accommodate everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Burials can be scheduled every 15 minutes from 9:30 a.m. to
11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. Most funerals queue up in front
of the administration building, where they are met by cemetery
staff. They are given a map showing the location of the gravesite
and then directed to one of two partially enclosed committal
shelters. After a brief service of no more than 20 minutes, the
family departs and cemetery personnel take the casket to the
gravesite for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Graveside services are not permitted because graves are dug and
filled in batches. ``It wouldn't be a safe or a dignified
environment,'' said Rotar, noting that there are backhoes, dump
trucks, and workers at the gravesites.
</P>
<P>
   Military honors, provided at the discretion of local military
commanders, are becoming less and less common, in part because of
recent base closings. Rotar estimates military honors are provided
about twice a month, and often the military personnel have to
travel from New York near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only 500 buglers in the whole military, but we seem
to have quite a few here in New England,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Mason, an ex-Marine who serves on an advisory committee
to the cemetery that is building a memorial to prisoners of war and
soldiers missing in action, said the cemetery does a great job.
``The dignity and integrity of the service is not sacrificed at
all,'' he said. ``I don't know how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   William Forbush, who served in the Army in New Guinea during
World War II, was at the cemetery recently checking it out with his
wife. They liked the manicured landscape, the stone walls, and the
tasteful Cape Cod-style administration building.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Why do you want to go down there, to save some
money?''' he said. ``But I feel it's an honor to be buried with my
comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, however, was a bit troubled by the cemetery's policy
against graveside services. ``To me, it's final to see the casket
interred,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William Green, a retired Marine Corps captain, said he attended
a service at the cemetery and was turned off by how sterile it was.
``You're not allowed to see the body interred, so there's no real
sense of finality,'' he said. ``They don't even play `Taps.' It's
on this scratchy recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Green also said he preferred a headstone or a cross to the
plaques used at the park-style Bourne cemetery. He said he thought
a long time about it before deciding not to be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   To ease some of the pressure on the National Cemetery,
Massachusetts, with the help of federal grants, is developing
veterans cemeteries in Agawam and Winchendon that should be open in
the next two years. An estimated 600,000 veterans live in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans who entered the service from Massachusetts, died while
a legal resident, or lived here at least five years will be
eligible for a free burial. Spouses, however, will have to pay
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Although the policies of the state veterans cemeteries will be
similar to the national one in Bourne, there are some key
differences. The state cemeteries will feature chapels instead of
committal shelters and upright white grave stones rather than
plaques. And state officials hope to enlist veterans groups to
provide military honors for nearly every burial.
</P>
<P>
   Bob McKean, director of state veterans cemeteries, said he sent
out applications for the new cemeteries just last week and has
already received 200 back. ``It's astounding, the response,'' he
said.

STOCKS GAIN, BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO CHEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rallied for a third day Friday as
investors bought stocks whose prices had been pummeled during, and
even before, the headline-grabbing sell-off that began in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the three-day rally, the major market measures
still ended the week down sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial
average off 3.2 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks down 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many concerns around this market,'' said
Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist with Salomon Smith Barney.
``The market is going to remain volatile until they are all worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The buying of battered stocks kept the technology-heavy Nasdaq
index and the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks well
above water, but still off their highs for the day. The Nasdaq
finished up 17.26 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 1,846.77,
while the Russell ended at 415.80, up 9.18, or 2.3 percent.
Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners 2 to 1, another positive
turn for the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Dow and the S&AMP;P gave up their gains in Friday
afternoon trading was a signal of continued volatility _ and
continuing investor concern. It seemed that after a turbulent week,
in which the Dow suffered its third- worst one-day point decline
ever, investors were just tired or wanted to take what profits they
could from the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is another sign that the blue chips have further to
decline,'' said Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at
Prudential Securities, whose sudden switch to bearishness on
Tuesday helped knock the Dow down 299.43 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the S&AMP;P index, which are dominated by the
bigger-company stocks that many investors now feel are overpriced,
sank into negative territory Friday afternoon. The Dow struggled
back to finish up 20.34 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at
8,598.02. It had been up 112 points. The S&AMP;P ended off 0.18 point
at 1,089.45, after hitting 1,102.54.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's early rally was helped by an apparently favorable July
employment report. Despite the distortions from the nearly
eight-week strike against General Motors, the data showed that the
domestic economy, especially the service sector, is still quite
robust.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still reminders of the worries that helped send
the Dow industrials down 9.1 percent before the end-of-the-week
rally. The drag on American exports and manufacturing from the
economic crisis in Asia was reflected in the generally weak
increase of 66,000 nonfarm jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   And as the stock market was rallying, the Japanese yen tumbled
and is now weaker than it was when the United States and Japan
intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the currency
in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed weakness in the yen is a result of the lack of
confidence in the new Japanese government's ability to turn the
nation's economy around, a necessary ingredient in any economic
rebound across Asia. The new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's first
policy statement to Parliament Friday just added to the
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has tried to shrug off Asia, but I think the
problems there are getting worse,'' said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. ``Japan is becoming a modern
macroeconomic policymakers' nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, was more confident about the economic outlook. ``When you
look at the core forces underlying the market they remain in good
working order,'' he said. ``So the sky is not falling.''

<P>
   The role battered stocks have played in the market rebound that
began on Wednesday can be seen in the performance of the
semiconductor industry, oil stocks and smaller-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about demand from Asia and climbing inventories had sent
semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices,
Motorola &UR;  &LR; and Teradyne tumbling. The Philadelphia semiconductor
index, which also includes Intel, had fallen 29.5 percent from its
February high to its low June 15. But in the last three days of the
trading week the index was up 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks had also been off sharply as the price of oil
plunged. The Philadelphia oil service index, which includes
Halliburton &UR;  &LR; and Schlumberger, dropped 48.5 percent from May 1 to
Wednesday. But on Thursday and Friday, the index jumped 7.8
percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of major oil companies,
including Exxon and Chevron, rose 3.3 percent Friday after falling
16.8 percent since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the Russell index of smaller company stocks had fallen
almost 19 percent from its high in April to a 1998 low on
Wednesday. But over the next two days it jumped 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the jobs and wage data in the July
employment report did not upset investors because it supported the
view that the Federal Reserve, whose policymaking committee meets
on Aug. 18, will leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 20/32, to 107 4/32, while the
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.63
percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday.

SCANDAL IS GOOD NEWS TO ALL-NEWS NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images hardly make for compelling television: mostly Monica
Lewinsky getting out of cars and Kenneth Starr getting into them.
The talking heads make up a largely over-exposed collection of
former prosecutors, defense attorneys and pundits. And often there
hasn't been a whole lot of hard news to headline.
</P>
<P>
   But for 24-hour cable news networks like MSNBC, CNBC, Fox News
and CNN, all that does not seem to matter. The questions that would
dominate dinner party conversation these days are apparently enough
to sustain what some have come to call ``All Monica All the Time'':
Will the dress test positive? Will the president submit his saliva?
What is Ms. Lewinsky's state of mind?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the talk show clatter, the Monica Lewinsky story is big
business, meaning more revenue and higher ratings to shows that
mostly struggle at the margins, looking for, at best, the
mysterious murder of a beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   Where initially this kind of round-the-clock coverage, ushered
in by the Gulf War, appeared to be dictated by news developments,
now it seems largely fueled by the bottom line. All-news channels
depend on events like the O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess
Diana and now the trials and tribulations of President Clinton for
their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs live or die on issues of this sort,'' said
Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ``Because talk is
the cheapest form of entertainment, it can fill hours of air time
at the lowest possible cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news executives say they are simply responding to the
demands of the marketplace. ``Do I think we're crisis-driven now?
No,'' said John Moody, vice president of news editorial at Fox
News. ``The nation's viewing habits are changing. There's always
someone who wants to find out what's going on. This is not a
country that's all at home at 6:30 to watch Dan or Peter or Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   But media experts say cable news networks are not yet
established enough to eat into the networks in the absence of a big
breaking story. ``The worst thing that can happen to a CNN is for
there not to be a Monica Lewinsky or an O.J. Simpson or a war,
because you don't get any of these peaks and surges in viewing,''
said Gerbrandt. ``No news is bad news for these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the cable universe is so much smaller than the broadcast
universe, media experts say _ 66 million households vs. 100
million, according to one estimate _ a little lift goes a long way.
A story like this one, for example, can boost a program's rating
from a 0.1 or 0.3 to a 0.3 or a 0.6. ``In broadcast terms, that's
nothing,'' said John P. Ellis, a marketing and advertising
consultant who has advised CNBC. ``But in cable terms, it's called
doubling your audience. To cable news people, Monica is a huge
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a story like the Lewinsky scandal not only helps
fledgling all-news cable shows build ratings and get noticed,
television experts say, it goes straight to the bottom line,
particularly because these programs have fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case like this, for cable news shows over the coming year,
is probably worth in the tens of millions of dollars,'' said Larry
Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc. a
Carmel, Calif.-based media research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how long it drags out, maybe even in the
hundreds,'' Gerbrandt continued, ``because future ad time is based
on historic viewing patterns. So the benefit really comes over the
next year to 18 months.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For what are called spot advertising buys _ time that has not
been purchased in advance _ for example, cable news channels can
adjust their prices upwards depending on the daily Nielsen ratings
data, Ellis explained. ``Cable news is very spot market heavy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cable shows may reach a relatively small audience
compared with the networks, media experts say, their influence is
considerably broader. Networks and print organizations, cable news
executives note, are fueled by the constant scandal updates
available from their cable competitors. ``When the soap opera on
the news channels is better than the soap opera on the networks,
then I think it does provide a certain amount of pressure,'' Moody
said. ``Despite protestations that we're saturating America's
living rooms with tawdry detail, that same detail is exactly what's
being demanded by our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this means people like Geraldo Rivera are having a very
good time. Prime time ratings for his program, ``Rivera Live'' on
CNBC, which has devoted its hour to the Lewinsky-Clinton story
night after night, are up nearly 30 percent for the month of July
compared with the same period last year, from 438,000 households to
567,000.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rivera Live' has clearly found its niche,'' Rivera said.
``It's by seeking the nuance and promising your audience that
you'll report every significant development that you build an
expectation that, when push comes to shove, there's only one show
to turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' which started a
year and a half ago and appears just before Rivera's program on
CNBC, saw its prime-time ratings increase 57 percent for July
compared with last year and 147 percent in the program's midnight
time slot, when it is rebroadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cable news anchors are quite so proud. Keith Olbermann,
whose program ``White House in Crisis'' on MSNBC was started in
February in response to the Lewinsky story, has done some public
chest-thumping about his own coverage. In a May 23 speech to his
alma mater, Cornell University, he said: ``There are days now when
my line of work makes me ashamed, makes me depressed, makes me cry
... . About three weeks ago, I awakened from my stupor on this
subject and told my employers that I simply could not continue
doing this show about the endless investigation and the
investigation of the investigation, and the investigation of the
investigation of the investigation. I had to choose what I felt in
my heart was right, over what I felt in my wallet was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olbermann, who declined to comment, is still on the air
every night, discussing the latest Lewinsky speculation on MSNBC's
``The Big Show.'' Erik Sorensen, the executive vice president in
charge of programming at MSNBC who only started at the network last
week, said this kind of ambivalence comes with the territory.
``There is a lot about this story that a lot of us covering it
aren't particularly crazy about,'' he said. ``But that's what we do
for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news shows have been criticized on the Lewinsky story,
along with the mainstream press, for vamping without substance and
for vague attribution. Indeed, Gerbrandt suggested that the report
about nerve gas in Vietnam, which got CNN into trouble recently,
was an example of an ill-fated effort to generate excitement in a
slow news period. ``That story on nerve gas is the result of a CNN
trying to make sure they have an ongoing series of reports that can
attract viewers,'' Gerbrandt said, ``realizing that you can't count
on a scandal or a disaster or a trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, correspondents say their information is no less
reliable because they have so much time to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, for example, made a point of saying on the air last week
that he stood by his report of Aug. 4 alleging that the infamous
dress had tested positive for ``human genetic material,'' which he
attributed to ``one source very close to the president.'' NBC last
week sent out a message warning its other reporters not to pick up
Rivera's report and saying the network had not confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been wrong yet,'' Rivera said. ``In that sense, I'm
still living as queen for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is viewing newscasters like Rivera as
royalty. ``For me, I am finding _ as there is this explosion of
talk, talk, talk _ that I cannot listen to the din,'' said Kalb of
Harvard. ``I'm not learning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton story shows few signs of receding, cable
news executives acknowledge that there will come a time when Ms.
Lewinsky will be old news. ``I'm already losing sleep over it,''
said Sorensen of MSNBC. ``Inevitably, this story is going to end
and, as an all-news channel, we rely on reality _ and we need
reality to cooperate.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The refrain on foreign exchange trading desks these days is:
``Volatility is being very good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most currency traders don't miss what was for them the dull,
trendless and not very profitable trading that dominated the
mid-1990s. It has given way to big daily movements and strong
trends in many currencies, especially those at the heart of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The forces that are causing the volatility have helped to
unsettle other financial markets, and the atmosphere of higher risk
played a role in Wall Street's big drop in the last few weeks. But
trends are favorable for the international bankers, traders and
investors who make part of their living from movements in
currencies, whether up or down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nice time to be a foreign exchange dealer,'' said
Robert White, the treasurer of Standard Chartered Bank. ``That
volatility provides opportunities for risk-taking and brings in
customer business'' as investors and financial managers try to
hedge against adverse moves or buy currencies to help them enter or
exit fast-moving investments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Craig A. Puffenberger, the head of global foreign exchange
options at Credit Suisse First Boston, put it another way: ``The
volatility gives us opportunities to find things to buy cheaply and
to sell them expensively.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is good for money traders and banks, of course, is not
necessarily good for everyone. The increased volatility and sharp
strengthening of the dollar against many currencies have caused
some problems.
</P>
<P>
   For American companies, a stronger dollar makes their products
more expensive and less competitive abroad. It makes imports
cheaper and more competitive in this country. Big-name companies
like Coca-Cola, Dow Corning, Union Carbide and 3M all said the
strong dollar had contributed to the weakness in their latest
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Currency volatility increases the uncertainty for companies
doing business abroad and for investors who put their money to work
in overseas markets. This uncertainty raises their costs as they
hedges to protect themselves against unexpected plunges or
increases in a currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-rate doubts also can reach into the pocketbooks of the
average tourist, abruptly raising or lowering costs for hotels and
plane tickets from one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the revived volatility are many, including the
collapse of economies in Asia, the inability of Japan to overcome
its economic malaise and the threat of a financial crisis in Russia
that could spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Fand, the senior foreign exchange strategist at
BankBoston, thinks the market has taken its eye off the economic
fundamentals that moved currencies in the past, like differences
between interest rates and inflation rates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the market is moved by themes _ the presumed
inadequacies of the new Japanese government, for example. ``The
market attaches much more significance to these themes,'' he said,
adding that traders could fixate on one as quickly as they could
forget another.
</P>
<P>
   The gyrations in Asian and emerging-markets currencies have
helped offset the loss of profit opportunities in Europe, where
volatility has evaporated ahead of the Jan. 1, 1999 introduction of
Europe's single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   From its high to its low this year, the dollar has moved just
5.5 percent against the German mark. In contrast, the Japanese yen
has had three big moves _ 3.8 percent, 4.5 percent and 6.9 percent
_ against the dollar in just the last eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some beneficiaries of currency volatility have been the big
banks that are the major players in the foreign exchange market,
with its activity of $1.4 trillion a day.
</P>
<P>
   At Chase Manhattan Bank, for example, revenue from foreign
exchange trading jumped 70 percent in the first quarter of this
year and 58 percent in the second quarter. Foreign exchange revenue
at Citibank rose 17 percent in the first quarter and 50 percent in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While these returns are not a major source of revenue, they have
contributed to the strong performance of these banks' stocks this
year. Chase is up 26.4 percent for the year, and Citicorp, the
parent of Citibank, is up 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies may or may not stay volatile. A rebound in Asia or a
turnaround in the financial outlook for Russia could make them more
stable.
</P>
<P>
   But banks that trade currencies have been lifted for now, at
least, out of the doldrums of a few years ago. Back then, low
volatility, the broadening use of electronic trading and concerns
about the arrival of the single currency in Europe led to layoffs
and closures of trading desks _ as well as a decline in revenue
from currency trading.
</P>
<P>
   Donald H. Layton, vice chairman of global markets-international
at Chase Manhattan, said the higher revenue was coming from three
sources: proprietary trading, in which the bank bets its own money
on the direction of currencies; higher volumes of trading from
customers, which these days are predominantly money managers, hedge
funds and others moving money around the the world; and the bigger
spreads, or differences between the buying and selling prices of
currencies that come with higher volatility. The larger spreads add
to the revenue and profits from trading.
</P>
<P>
   Layton acknowledged that trading in more volatile markets
``means there is more risk.'' But he said the banks could handle
that partly because more of their foreign exchange revenue comes
from customer dealings than from proprietary trading.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of this, he said, is the inconsequential fallout
from the surprising intervention on June 17 by the United States
and Japan to support the yen, which moved 4.7 percent higher in one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intervention for the market was a major event, but it was
not a major profit- and-loss event to the banks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Peabody, the bank analyst at Mitchell Securities, is
more concerned about bank reliance on currency volatility.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report to clients, Peabody said the rise in
volatility was one reason that bank activities like underwriting,
mergers and acquisitions, trading, and handling of international
capital flows have done so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reversal of a strong U.S. dollar and low long-term interest
rates should prove disruptive to market-sensitive sources of
revenues, the mainstay of the current double-digit
earnings-per-share growth in the banking industry,'' he wrote.

BELL ATLANTIC, UNION, TRY TO BEAT STRIKE DEADLINE

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic Corp. and a union representing 3,500 New England
telephone service employees inched closer to easing mandatory
overtime requirements and inflexible work schedules at the
bargaining table this week, but remained far apart on the use of
outside contractors, a union official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications giant the Communications Workers of
America negotiated throughout the day and into the evening in an
attempt to reach an accord before a strike deadline of midnight
Saturday. The company is also bargaining with the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 15,000
telephone operators and technicians in New England, while a third
set of talks are being held with the CWA representing workers from
southern New York to Virigina.
</P>
<P>
   All three sides seemed hopeful of averting a strike, which would
affect customer, directory, and repair services to an estimated 3
million customers in Massachusetts with 4.5 million customer
telephone lines. New York-based Bell Atlantic serves about 40
million telephone lines from Maine to Virginia, and overall has
some 83,000 workers represented by the CWA and IBEW.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company is preparing for the possibility of a
walkout, Bell Atlantic spokesman in Boston, Jack Hoey, said: ``Our
objective is to get an agreement. Therefore, we are focusing all
our efforts on the collective bargaining process.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the CWA and IBEW have authorized strikes against Bell
Atlantic, as well as against Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp., which
provides service in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut Friday, Southern New England Telecommunications
Inc. hammered out a contract with a local branch of the CWA,
averting a potentially costly strike. Under the agreement, 6,300
union workers will get wage increases of 11 percent over the next
32 months. The new contract also calls for improved health care and
pension benefits, according to the company and the Communications
Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   CWA officials dealing with Bell Atlantic, while frustrated over
the company's use of outsourcing, seemed hopeful that a new
contract would include such changes in mandatory overtime as
advanced scheduling notice and exemptions for parents with
inflexible childcare arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making some progress in terms of scheduling and the
amount of short-term leave an employee will be allowed to take for
emergencies such as taking a child to the doctor, but we are
getting down to the wire with the contracting issue,'' Kathy
McGreevey, secretary-treasurer of CWA Local 1400 in Portsmouth,
N.H., said Friday. ``There is no movement on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said it would not comment on details of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service employees now work an average of 7.5 hours a
day, with overtime ranging from two to 15 hours per week, McGreevey
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said workers are allowed five days for personal time, but
are required to take a full day off when they need to be away from
the job for two or three hours, and they are discouraged from
taking vacations. Even so, the two sides seemed to be moving toward
language permitting more scheduling flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are at the point where they don't care about the
money,'' McGreevey said. ``The issue for them is remembering what
their family looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if agreements are reached on quality of life issues,
CWA's key demand _ that the company limit its use of outside
contractors _ is not one Bell Atlantic is likely to yield on to
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key sticking point for us is the work they want to move to
Bell Atlantic subsidiaries staffed with contractors who make $7 per
hour with no benefits,'' Melissa Morin, president of Local 1400,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, almost all of the work our service
representatives do would be affected. In Massachusetts, that means
1,800 service representatives could lose jobs during a gradual
moveout over a year or two. In New England, about 3,500 jobs are at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Morin added that the average customer service representative
earns $21 per hour, with full benefits. She said about 50 different
new contractors have started doing marketing work for the company
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step will be to eliminate the full-time technicians
and repair people,'' she said.

<P>
   The steep drop in equity prices over the last two weeks may have
surprised many people, particularly those whose portfolios contain
little more than blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts known as market technicians, who use performance
charts to find price trends and cyclical movements in stocks, had
been seeing cracks for weeks, if not months.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the seemingly arcane indicators they watch _ 10-day
advance/decline ratios, upside volume versus downside volume, the
30-day moving average of the New York Stock Exchange composite
index _ were sounding alarm bells even as narrower market measures
like the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index marched to new records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in the market over the past 13 sessions as opposed
to the past three months is the weakening of the major stocks,''
Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said after the major indexes tumbled more than 3 percent
last Tuesday. ``Many stocks have been acting poorly for some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Mamis, publisher of the Mamis Letter, a weekly letter for
institutional clients, said: ``Tuesday's decline in the Dow, the
S&AMP;P 500 and the NASDAQ composite are the chickens coming home to
roost. My charts show that stocks I follow began to have problems
back in late February.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify a market as healthy, technicians like to see more
stocks rising in value than declining. They like to see trading
volume in advancing issues outweigh the volume in stocks sold. In
short, they like to see breadth _ rising stocks across a wide range
of industries. They have not seen that in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a severe internal implosion,'' said Alan Shaw,
director of technical research at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Some
weeks ago, we were thinking this looked like 1994, when a lot of
stocks got severely beaten down but the major averages held up. But
then we saw that this was not only like 1994, but 1990 as well,''
when there was a broad downturn in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how stocks in the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 had been
shielded from the broader universe of equities, Roth noted that as
of Tuesday, 64 percent of the stocks that make up the Russell 2000
index, which tracks small companies, had declined more than 20
percent from their highs; 40 percent of those issues have fallen by
more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charts show that the Russell 2000 is down to levels seen last
October,'' he said. ``That would equate to a level of 860 for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.'' That is 20.5 percent below the
current level, 1,082
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the technicians said they saw few signs that
the selloff had ended, particularly for the stocks that have long
been market leaders, like General Electric, Coca-Cola, Pfizer and
Wal-Mart. A rally is possible, they added, but is not likely to be
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sellers are still in the market,'' Mamis said. ``We have not
yet had a selling climax, a time when everybody who wanted to sell
can't stand it any more and then sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth of Morgan Stanley disagreed, but only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market looks like it is climaxing,'' he said, noting that
4 of the 10 heaviest-trading days were in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we have seen the final low. I think it could
build a weak base, stage a recovery and then be vulnerable in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he would like to see a slowing, and then a reversal,
of the number of declining stocks compared with the number of
rising stocks before he would be confident that the selloff was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is trying to get a grip here,'' he said. ``But that
could take a matter of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking signs that the selloff is ending, Mamis said
several stocks could be barometers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at issues like Coke, General Electric or Wal-Mart to see
if they rally with any vigor,'' in the event of a general rise in
stock prices, he said, ``or if their rallies are mediocre or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the old leadership fails on the rallies, then I have a real
problem, because they are so vulnerable,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he advised focusing on issues that have been beaten
up in recent months _ basic commodity companies like International
Paper, Georgia Pacific and Alcoa; manufacturers like Deere, or
technology companies like Micron Technology or Motorola. ``I want
to see them not go down if the market goes down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Dow fell further and the Deeres of the world don't go
down any more, the value investor is going to start buying them,''
Mamis said. ``That is the change that has to take place. But in
order for that to happen, the big averages have to make lower
lows.''

BOMBS KILL MORE THAN 80 AT US EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Terrorist car bombs exploded outside US embassies
in Nairboi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania just minutes apart
Friday morning, ripping apart buildings, incinerating passengers in
buses and flinging cars across crowded streets. More than 80
people, including eight Americans, were killed in the two blasts,
and more than 1,700 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in both cities were overwhelmed treating people
injured in the explosions, and pandemonium spread through bustling
neighborhoods as parents tried to find lost children. The death
toll is expected to rise over the weekend as search teams look for
missing people in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in Nairobi, like the ruins of the Marine barracks in
Beirut in 1983, resembled a war zone. An office building behind the
embassy was destroyed, and the embassy itself was shattered.
Hospitals issued an urgent appeal for blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   The tableau in Dar es Salaam was almost as appalling, with the
embassy entrance in ruins. Seven people were killed, including
three Tanzanian guards.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the US government sent a Foreign Emergency Support
Team to Nairobi from Andrews Air Force Base, Va., with FBI agents,
communications specialists and anti-terrorism experts. A C-141
cargo plane with surgeons and medical supplies also flew from
Ramstein, Germany and a security team of Marines was dispatched to
Nairobi, while another FBI investigation team was sent to Tanzania.
Also at the request of the United States, Israel sent a rescue team
to Nairobi and the South African Air Force sent a Boeing 707,
equiped to handle up to 60 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the region took immediate responsibility for the
bombings _ the first time two embassies in different countries have
been bombed simultaneously. But officials said that US intelligence
agencies quickly narrowed the suspects to well-known radical
Islamic groups and splinter organizations unknown even to most
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suspect is Egypt's outlawed Islamic Jihad, a radical
terrorist group which earlier this week decried the help given by
Washington to extradite Islamists to Cairo from Albania, and warned
of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials also took seriously a report that an
Arabic speaker called the London offices of Egypt's Al-Hayat
newspaper and claimed that the bombings had been carried out by a
group called The Army for the Liberation of Holy Places.
</P>
<P>
   There were also rumors that Nairobi police were seen taking an
Arabic-speaking man into custody after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton promised a strong response to the killings.
``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhuman,'' Clinton said. ``We will use all the means at our
disposal to bring those responsible to justice, no matter what or
how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, about 450 miles apart, clearly were the result of
careful planning. The car bomb in Nairobi was located in an alley
in the rear of the embassy building in the center of the city. The
bomb in Dar Es Salaam is thought to have been located on a street
in front of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam may
have been chosen because both buildings are `soft'' targets with
security that would not meet today's tougher State Department
standards. Also, both countries have porous borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear there is no security failure,'' said Barry Rubin,
senior resident scholar at Israel's Bar Illan University. ``The
irony is that precisely because there was no security failure many
were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosions were especially chilling because they occurred in
two countries where American business executives and tourists are
generally well-received, and with whom the US government enjoys
good relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's particularly surprising it would happen in Kenya and
Tanzania because both are the most stable countries on the
continent,'' said the Rev. Charles Stith of Boston, newly named US
ambassador to Tanzania. Stith was vacationing with his family in
Saint Maarten, in the Caribbean, and will start his assignment in
Tanzania next month.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had difficulty piecing together details of
Friday's blasts because communications centers at both embassies
were completely destroyed, and security officers were busy rescuing
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that a car bomb rocked the
embassy in a residential neighborhood of Dar es Salaam at 10:40
a.m., local time. Four or five minutes later, another huge
explosion tore apart the embassy in the heart of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the region heard that the US embassy
in Nairobi had been warned that a terrorist attack was possible.
But in an afternoon press conference Friday, Under Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering said, ``We had no telephone ringing before
it happened.'' He added that the US receives 30,000 tips about
terrorism every year.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and independent experts suggested a wide range of
possible suspects, including extremists from Pakistan and
terrorists sponsored by Iran or Iraq. Some suggested that troubles
in Congo or Sudan could have spilled over. But at this point, no
one knows who to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, analysts point toward Sudan, an Islamic state whose
relationship with the United States is openly hostile. Washington
accuses the Khartoum government of sponsoring terrorism and
maintaining links with other rogue states such as Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if there wasn't a link,'' said Jan
van Eck, a senior analyst at the University of Cape Town, who
specializes in conflict resolution in East Africa. ``Nothing else
can explain a chain of bombing attacks against the United States in
that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Another leading suspect is Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian
dissident living in Afghanistan. In June he told ABC News that
American soldiers and civilians alike would be targets of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Bin Laden is a likely suspect in a 1995 car
bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that killed five Americans and a
June 1996 attack on a military housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, that killed 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   That 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers complex, which is still
officially unsolved, haunts the Clinton administration. An unsolved
double bombing would encourage other terrorists, an official said.
``Clearly it's not going to happen overnight, but there's a
definite determination right now to make it a counter-Khobar
Towers, for our own peace of mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East security expert at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
cautioned against too much uninformed speculation about the
mastermind of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial attempts to identify these groups have about a
hundred-percent failure rate,'' he said. For instance, pinning down
the Libyan role in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland took
nearly two years.

NAIROBI RESCUE WORKERS ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-SECURITY,

(lh) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Floodlights lit the 60-foot-high pile of rubble
and metal that once was a three-story building, while Red Cross
workers and soldiers crawled over it like ants, hammering
feverishly with picks and shovels and stopping only once in a while
to listen for signs of life: a muffled voice, a whimper or a cry.
</P>
<P>
   A crane donated by a local construction firm was being used to
lift the heavy slabs from the top of the rubble mountain of the
Ufundi Co-op Building. Bulldozers loaded up dump trucks, as crowds
of people watched in dark silence from the blackened street.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and welding teams climbed up the mass of broken
concrete and tried to cut through the building's metal beams and
twisted innards. The building was nearly leveled by the blast that
devastated the rear of the U.S. Embassy next door.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few moments of triumph. At 9 p.m., rescuers said,
three people were found alive in a partially collapsed room. An
hour later, another four were recovered from an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   But there were far more moments of tragedy. Scores of people
were found crushed under tons of concrete. The rescue workers
fought off fatigue after more than 14 hours of laboring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team has brought out more than 30,'' said Farid Abdul Kadir
of the Kenyan Red Cross, as he came down for a break. ``I have been
the unluckiest. All of them have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Another volunteer, Caleb Kilande, 29, worked for four hours and
found four people. Three had been crushed to death, their heads
mashed beyond recognition. But the fourth, a man pinned under a
slab of concrete, was still breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was still conscious and breathing, the chest coming up,
slowly, slowly and his eyes were seeing,'' Kilande said. ``It took
us a long time to get him out because he was trapped under heavy
slabs. It was almost an hour. I do not know if he will live. He was
in critical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers are volunteers, or members of the Kenyan
armed forces. Many said they have had little training to prepare
them for a disaster like this one. In fact, Kenya's emergency
system has never seen a disaster on this scale before, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Many wondered aloud how a violent act of this magnitude could be
committed in their country, which is better known for wildlife and
beaches than for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's fighting who or what they are fighting
for,'' Kadir said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As always in disasters like this one, the rescuers were racing
against time. The building housed a secretarial school, as well as
several businesses. No one knows how many people were inside when
the bomb exploded at 10:35 a.m. Most of the rescue workers said
they believed some of the victims trapped in the rubble were still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Arfan Tufail, a 30-year-old businessman who is part of the
Citizens Neighborhood network, said he and his colleagues heard two
voices earlier in the day coming from deep in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a couple of people but they did not manage to get
them out,'' he said. ``We asked them if there was anyone inside.
Someone said yes. He gave his name. He said there were two other
people with him. We said we'd try our level best to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   After hours of work, however, the rescuers had still had not
managed to reach them. The voices stopped, Tufail said. ``We don't
know if they are still alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers worked on a street littered with wreckage, a
building turned inside out. A boiler ripped from the building,
electric wiring, pipes, air ducts. The charred skeletons of cars
destroyed by the blast had been piled up to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Armed U.S. Marines stood guard over what was left of the back of
the U.S. Embassy, grimly watching the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   The digging was painfully slow given the precarious state of the
people inside. But it could not go any faster, several rescue
workers said, without risking doing more harm to the people the
rescuers were trying to save.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to save lives, you can't go in with much heavier
equipment,'' said one Swiss Red Cross official, who asked not to be
identified. ``But the longer they are trapped in there the less
chance they will come out alive.''

NEW PRESIDENT PROMISES `A COLOMBIA AT PEACE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Addressing a nation still in shock from one
of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives ever, new Colombian President
Andres Pastrana pledged Friday that ending the 34-year-old civil
war will be his top mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume the permanent leadership to build the peace,''
Pastrana told about 4,000 guests at Bolivar Plaza in downtown
Bogota moments after he was sworn in for a four-year term as
president. ``That's the promised land that we desire: a Colombia at
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark blue suit and smiling on a cloudy afternoon,
Pastrana received the same yellow, blue and red presidential sash
that his father _ Misael Pastrana, Colombia's president from 1970
to 1974 _ once wore.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old former mayor of Bogota, who lost the 1994
presidential election to outgoing President Ernesto Samper,
defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a June 21 runoff
election.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana now heads Colombia's first Conservative government in
12 years. He inherits a nation racked by political violence,
corruption, drug trafficking and economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   In surprise attacks across the nation this week, leftist rebels
killed more than 100 police and soldiers. The offensive came just
one month after Pastrana met with top guerrilla leaders in the
mountains of Colombia and promised to initiate peace talks within
the first 90 days of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Many Colombians had expected Pastrana to elaborate on his plans
to end the war in his inaugural address. But he offered few details
in his 25-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   The only concrete proposal that Pastrana offered Friday was to
invest in social programs and infrastructure in war zones through a
special fund backed by the government, international donations and
``peace bonds'' that will be sold to affluent Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana claimed that the nation was ``at the dawn of a new
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned, however, that the new president faces
monumental tasks. Peace negotiations, they say, will be
problematic, because rebel forces are growing in size and
territorial strength.
</P>
<P>
   The country's two main rebel groups _ the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, and the National Liberation
Army, or ELN _ number between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulties are enormous,'' said Alfredo Molano, a
Colombian sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas ``talk about peace, then they go out and launch
attacks throughout the country,'' said Peter Romero, the U.S.
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, who was in
Bogota for the inauguration. ``I think there is an emerging
credibility gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Pastrana can at least count on strong
backing from the United States, which is providing Colombia with
about $100 million in military aid this year to fight drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the nations were strained during the Samper
administration, because the former president was elected in 1994
with the help of $6.1 million in donations from the Cali drug
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal crippled his administration, which was
``decertified'' by Washington for two straight years as an
unreliable ally in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Pastrana vowed to lead ``the cleanest government in
Colombian history'' and to vigorously prosecute public officials
accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to say that our relationship now has an opportunity
to turn the page,'' said Thomas ``Mac'' McLarty, President
Clinton's former chief of staff, who led the U.S. delegation at the
inauguration ceremonies.

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Ten years ago Saturday, on the auspicious
date of 8/8/88, Burma erupted in gunfire, the start of a crackdown
on pro-democracy demonstrators that over the next six weeks took
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the country now known as Myanmar was tense Friday
in advance of the anniversary, as the pro-democracy leader, Daw
Aung San Suu Kyi, stepped up pressure on the ruling military junta.
</P>
<P>
   Following a highly publicized six-day sit-in in her car when
authorities would not allow her to travel to meet her supporters in
the countryside, her party, the National League for Democracy,
refused an invitation Friday to meet with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of worsening relations, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi
demanded Friday that the military remove a guard detail that has
been stationed for years just within the gate of her compound.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets have reportedly been distributed calling for
demonstrations on the anniversary and the military has announced
that it would meet street protests with force.
</P>
<P>
   But more than an anniversary is involved. With the economy and
political stature of the ruling junta worsening, Suu Kyi appeared
to be pushing for a confrontation. Few analysts could offer a
scenario under which the junta would willingly surrender power,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we hear suggests they are heading toward a showdown
one way or another,'' said a Bangkok-based diplomat who is an
expert on Burma. ``It's fairly clear that both sides are not giving
in. Obviously, we don't know which way it's heading, whether it's a
showdown towards dialogue or a showdown towards crackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The past decade has been a demonstration of the decisive power
of force, and of its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, government offices emptied onto the streets and even
the police marching band joined jubilant pro-democracy
demonstrations. It seemed that an unfocused mass uprising had taken
over a country that for 26 years had suffered under the repressive
one-man rule of U Ne Win.
</P>
<P>
   But the army _ virtually alone in Myanmar _ remained loyal, and
was willing to shoot into crowds. The uprising was quelled and
power remained in the hands of a group of generals loyal to Ne Win,
who formally resigned just before the crackdown but who, according
to many analysts, may still remain a power behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the uprising, though, the ruling clique can
point to few successes other than its continuing grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Though the generals liberalized the country's closed economy and
invited foreign investment, the economy is near collapse today,
both as a result of international sanctions and government
mismanagement. Inflation is rising, commerce is stagnant and
industries dependent on foreign investment, like tourism and
garment manufacture, are moribund. The government is struggling to
prevent a second year of rice shortages _ an economic burden that
was one of the catalysts of the 1988 uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are bad in Burma, really bad,'' said Josef Silverstein,
a scholar of Myanmar at Rutgers University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politically, the government has failed to win the hearts of the
people. Far from shunting Suu Kyi aside and ignoring her in the
state-controlled press, the junta seems obsessed with her,
attacking her regularly in vituperative and colorful prose. The
government so mistrusts its population that it has closed
universities since December 1996 for fear of a student-led uprising
like the one in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrust seems to have affected the leadership itself: for
months, unconfirmed reports have emerged of splits within the
ruling group.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, the junta has found itself increasingly isolated because
of its human-rights record and its suppression of political
dissent. Western nations led by the United States have instituted a
variety of embargoes, and Washington has barred members of the
leadership from visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a brief victory, Myanmar was inducted into the
influential regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which turns a blind eye, on principle, on the ``internal
affairs'' of its members.
</P>
<P>
   But when this caused the European Union to cancel two meetings
with the association, and when the junta failed to modify its
behavior, even its Asian neighbors began to distance themselves
from it.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a decade of suppression, Suu Kyi and her followers
remain a potent political force. Through peaceful pressure, a
willingness to be arrested and jailed, and deft public relations,
they have kept the allegiance of many Burmese and have won wide
support abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One source of this support is the compelling personality of Suu
Kyi herself _ confident, unbending, articulate and radiating a
sense of mission and morality.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has raised the stakes, demanding that the National
Assembly convene by Aug. 21, although she has not said what she
would do if that does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to convene Parliament is an even more potent symbol
for pro-democracy advocates than is the crackdown 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Myanmar's leaders allowed the opposition to contest free
elections in 1990, the National League for Democracy won in a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no transfer of power. The military said it had all
been a misunderstanding, that voters had elected not a government
but a constitutional assembly. Repression of the opposition was
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can see there has been no improvement at all,''
Suu Kyi said in a recent statement. ``In fact I could say that I am
inclined think that things have even got worse.''

 &HT;    AGL users face higher gas bills
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hundreds of natural gas customers have complained to
the Public Service Commission about higher bills resulting from a
new Atlanta Gas Light billing system.
</P>
<P>
   The company is using the system to prepare for more competition
this fall, when consumer prices for natural gas are no longer
regulated by the PSC and more companies will be allowed compete to
provide the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``My base bill (for July) went from $9.94 to $22.88 and we don't
even use any gas in the summer,'' said Charles Woodliff, a retiree
from Alpharetta. ``We only use it to heat in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   PSC spokesman Shawn Davis explained Atlanta Gas Light has
started annualizing the amount its residential customers pay for
its gas delivery system _ though not for the cost of the gas
itself. Previously, delivery costs rose or fell each month in
relation to the volume of gas each customer used. Now they remain
flat each month.
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, Atlanta Gas Light will only deliver gas to
homes and businesses, while marketing companies will be responsible
for selling the gas. AGL Resources, the parent of Atlanta Gas
Light, has created a separate marketing unit to also compete in gas
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly bills from Atlanta Gas Light will still vary depending
on how much gas a customer uses. But summer bills will now tend to
be higher than last year, while bills this winter will tend to be
lower than a year ago, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light calculates its average residential customers
will pay $39.70 more each year under the new billing system. That's
a 6.76 percent increase. Davis said the PSC may take action in the
near future to reduce that increase to the 3 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   The increases are going to a universal service fund, which will
help protect the new marketing companies from uncollectable
accounts.

 &HT;    BellSouth, union report progress
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With the contract for most BellSouth employees set to
expire at 11:59 tonight negotiators for the union and company kept
talking, claiming progress toward a last-minute agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers aim to nail down deals on contracts for six units
that represent 48,000 union workers. The teams for BellSouth and
the Communications Workers of America met most of the night and
will likely spend most of today at the table as the clock ticks
toward the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, the spin from the talks at the Ramada Plaza near
Northlake was turning optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is moving fast, but it's slow progress in getting
to where we need to get to,'' said Jimmy Smith, vice president of
the CWA for the Southeast. ``Both sides are working hard at it. I
am very hopeful that we can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up in a small South Carolina town, the son of a
grocery store owner who hated unions. This is the first contract
confrontation with BellSouth he has managed since succeeding to the
top of the CWA's Southeast office. Early in the talks, he expressed
concern about the BellSouth bargaining team, which includes Tom
Posey, an executive who came from Anheuser-Busch, where labor
relations are especially rocky.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety has eased somewhat, he said. ``We have a working
relationship,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokeswoman Deborah Spicer agreed the two sides have
made progress and pronounced the company pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that we can reach an agreement by the time
the current contract expires.''
</P>
<P>
   Key issues on the table include pensions and medical benefits
for retirees, BellSouth's penchant for sending work to nonunion
contractors and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kaufman, economics professor at Georgia State University,
said the union is virtually forced to make those issues priorities.
The union, whose average member has been with BellSouth for 22
years, is not making it a priority to compel BellSouth to bring
more positions under the union umbrella, nor is it focused on
higher pay. Instead, the CWA is using its leverage to win benefits
for its current members, especially longtime workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake are dwindling job opportunities,'' Kaufman
said. ``BellSouth is expanding some nonunion parts of the company,
and the union is feeling some organizational insecurity. And
anytime an organization feels insecure, they can be defensive and
protective.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's total work force has shrunk from a 1990 peak of
103,152 to about 86,188 now. The phone unit, which accounts for
most of the union's members, has been trimmed from 79,453 in 1992
to about 59,700, although that includes a slight uptick in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta and its booming economy, the impact of a strike
would be marginal _ at least if it is a short walkout. BellSouth
may be one of the region's largest employers with about 21,000
employees in Georgia, most in metro Atlanta. But that is a tiny
fraction of a vibrant and growing job market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company has also taken pains to prepare managers
to run the phone system, which is already highly automated, so a
strike would not likely mean more than minor nuisances to customers
_ unless it drags on.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, customers could find it hard to get a new line
installed or to even get needed repairs. And with a dozen companies
offering phone services to businesses and consumers being courted
by MediaOne and MGC Communications, BellSouth doesn't want
customers looking elsewhere for help.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks enter what could be the last lap, the union
benefits from that strong economy, since skilled workers are in
high demand. The CWA also could benefit from having a company that
is flush, that has reported quarter after quarter of record sales
and profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sustained expansion of the economy, there is the
desire of unions to catch up,'' said Robert McKersie, professor of
management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``We are
seeing more militancy and willingness to bring negotiations right
up to the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the union and company extended talks past the
deadline. They reached a pact several days later, and that could
happen again, McKersie said. ``They may stop the clock and keep
negotiating. But these don't sound like the kind of issues to have
a strike over.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the recent strike against General Motors, the company is
not pushing the union into a corner. Unlike last summer's bitter
walkout against United Parcel Service, the union is not bitter,
angry and ready to flex its muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In negotiations, it's never all one side or the other,'' said
Larry Michel, economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ``But
with a booming economy and the expanded need for communications, it
would be a very tough time for BellSouth to take a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased competition
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is moving into a new era, where it expects increased
competition with rivals. There are big players like WorldCom/MCI
and Sprint, smaller competitors like Allegiance Telecom and IGC
Communications. The only other union companies are AT&AMP;T _ which is
struggling to find a strategy _ and the other regional Bell
companies. BellSouth can argue that it is at a disadvantage because
those nonunion rivals need not consider labor agreements when they
plot business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company can argue that a sweetened deal puts BellSouth at a
disadvantage in the market _ and any chance for a healthy union
depends on a healthy company. The union can respond that is makes
the company stronger by guaranteeing skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides depend on each other, and the results
of today's last-minute talks are likely to reflect that fact.

 &HT;    IBM taking off its Olympic ring
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- IBM is pulling the plug on its Olympic sponsorship
after 38 years of tying its marketing efforts to the five famous
rings.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which suffered a well-publicized black eye because
of technical glitches during the 1996 Atlanta Games, is bailing out
in a dispute with Olympic officials over the high cost of the
worldwide sponsorship program.
</P>
<P>
   After spending more than $100 million to sponsor the 1998 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan _ and providing much of the technology for
free _ Big Blue wanted future local organizing committees to bear
some of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the negotiations over a new eight-year deal broke down
because Olympic officials want to create a separate sponsorship for
the Games' Internet services and Web sites. In Atlanta and Nagano,
that was part of IBM's overall sponsorship package.
</P>
<P>
   But Olympic officials are likely to be successful in creating
this new sponsorship category _ and the money that goes along with
it _ because of the enormous growth of the Internet, sports
marketing experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As e-commerce continues to increase, it's a category that
almost certainly justifies its own sponsorship,'' said John
Bevilaqua, an Atlanta sports marketing consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But Bevilaqua said he understands IBM's cost concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic committee can't have it both ways,'' he said.
``You can't continue to ask one company for an escalating price,
while taking away elements of their sponsorship category.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM spokeswoman Debbie Gottheimer said the International Olympic
Committee asked for a ``significant increase'' in the company's
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that was not commensurate with the marketing benefits
we would receive in return,'' Gottheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's global sponsorship will end in 2000 with the Summer Games
in Sydney, Australia. That means officials in Salt Lake City must
work quickly to find new technology sponsors and suppliers for the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is likely several IBM rivals will bid on pieces of
the Olympic technology pie now that Big Blue no longer wants to
swallow it whole. Among the potential replacements are computer
maker Hewlett-Packard and software company Novell Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said they held firm in their negotiations with
IBM because of the feedback from other high-tech companies
interested in becoming sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   As companies expand to more and more markets, the Olympic rings
_ one of the most recognized symbols in the world _ can be a
valuable sales tool.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy also can be risky.
</P>
<P>
   During the Atlanta Games, IBM's image took a big hit when
computer problems were reported around the world just as the
company was pinning its marketing efforts on a flawless
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Nagano, IBM's performance improved dramatically.

 &HT;    Lawyer: Safe house operator doesn't know where boy is
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Faye Yager can't be forced to tell a Connecticut man
where his son is, because there is no evidence that she or her
husband know where the child is, her attorney argued in federal
court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has been offered showing Faye Yager was with Bonnie and
Randy Rubenstein late last year, but there is no evidence the
Yagers ``have current information about the whereabouts,'' said
Brian Spears, Faye Yager's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rubenstein, who had custody of his son, Randy, when the
boy was kidnapped by his ex-wife in September 1997, has filed an
$80 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court here against Faye and
Howard Yager.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Yager is the controversial operator of a network of safe
houses that hides children, and generally their mothers, from
allegedly abusive fathers. Rubenstein is asking the judge to force
the Yagers to provide information on the boy's whereabouts. On
Friday, Spears argued there is a risk the child would be harmed if
he were returned.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Connolly, the court-appointed guardian ad litem for Randy
Rubenstein, said there were no allegations of sexual or physical
abuse during divorce and custody proceedings in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling by U.S. District Judge Willis B. Hunt Jr. or a
resumption of hearings isn't expected for at least 10 days.

while taking away elements of their sponsorship category.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM spokeswoman Debbie Gottheimer said the International Olympic
Committee asked for a ``significant increase'' in the company's
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that was not commensurate with the marketing benefits
we would receive in return,'' Gottheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's global sponsorship will end in 2000 with the Summer Games
in Sydney, Australia. That means officials in Salt Lake City must
work quickly to find new technology sponsors and suppliers for the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is likely several IBM rivals will bid on pieces of
the Olympic technology pie now that Big Blue no longer wants to
swallow it whole. Among the potential replacements are computer
maker Hewlett-Packard and software company Novell Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said they held firm in their negotiations with
IBM because of the feedback from other high-tech companies
interested in becoming sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   As companies expand to more and more markets, the Olympic rings
_ one of the most recognized symbols in the world _ can be a
valuable sales tool.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy also can be risky.
</P>
<P>
   During the Atlanta Games, IBM's image took a big hit when
computer problems were reported around the world just as the
company was pinning its marketing efforts on a flawless
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Nagano, IBM's performance improved dramatically.

 &HT;    BellSouth, union report progress
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With the contract for most BellSouth employees set to
expire at 11:59 tonight negotiators for the union and company kept
talking, claiming progress toward a last-minute agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers aim to nail down deals on contracts for six units
that represent 48,000 union workers. The teams for BellSouth and
the Communications Workers of America met most of the night and
will likely spend most of today at the table as the clock ticks
toward the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, the spin from the talks at the Ramada Plaza near
Northlake was turning optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is moving fast, but it's slow progress in getting
to where we need to get to,'' said Jimmy Smith, vice president of
the CWA for the Southeast. ``Both sides are working hard at it. I
am very hopeful that we can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up in a small South Carolina town, the son of a
grocery store owner who hated unions. This is the first contract
confrontation with BellSouth he has managed since succeeding to the
top of the CWA's Southeast office. Early in the talks, he expressed
concern about the BellSouth bargaining team, which includes Tom
Posey, an executive who came from Anheuser-Busch, where labor
relations are especially rocky.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety has eased somewhat, he said. ``We have a working
relationship,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokeswoman Deborah Spicer agreed the two sides have
made progress and pronounced the company pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that we can reach an agreement by the time
the current contract expires.''
</P>
<P>
   Key issues on the table include pensions and medical benefits
for retirees, BellSouth's penchant for sending work to nonunion
contractors and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kaufman, economics professor at Georgia State University,
said the union is virtually forced to make those issues priorities.
The union, whose average member has been with BellSouth for 22
years, is not making it a priority to compel BellSouth to bring
more positions under the union umbrella, nor is it focused on
higher pay. Instead, the CWA is using its leverage to win benefits
for its current members, especially longtime workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake are dwindling job opportunities,'' Kaufman
said. ``BellSouth is expanding some nonunion parts of the company,
and the union is feeling some organizational insecurity. And
anytime an organization feels insecure, they can be defensive and
protective.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's total work force has shrunk from a 1990 peak of
103,152 to about 86,188 now. The phone unit, which accounts for
most of the union's members, has been trimmed from 79,453 in 1992
to about 59,700, although that includes a slight uptick in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta and its booming economy, the impact of a strike
would be marginal _ at least if it is a short walkout. BellSouth
may be one of the region's largest employers with about 21,000
employees in Georgia, most in metro Atlanta. But that is a tiny
fraction of a vibrant and growing job market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company has also taken pains to prepare managers
to run the phone system, which is already highly automated, so a
strike would not likely mean more than minor nuisances to customers
_ unless it drags on.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, customers could find it hard to get a new line
installed or to even get needed repairs. And with a dozen companies
offering phone services to businesses and consumers being courted
by MediaOne and MGC Communications, BellSouth doesn't want
customers looking elsewhere for help.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks enter what could be the last lap, the union
benefits from that strong economy, since skilled workers are in
high demand. The CWA also could benefit from having a company that
is flush, that has reported quarter after quarter of record sales
and profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sustained expansion of the economy, there is the
desire of unions to catch up,'' said Robert McKersie, professor of
management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``We are
seeing more militancy and willingness to bring negotiations right
up to the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the union and company extended talks past the
deadline. They reached a pact several days later, and that could
happen again, McKersie said. ``They may stop the clock and keep
negotiating. But these don't sound like the kind of issues to have
a strike over.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the recent strike against General Motors, the company is
not pushing the union into a corner. Unlike last summer's bitter
walkout against United Parcel Service, the union is not bitter,
angry and ready to flex its muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In negotiations, it's never all one side or the other,'' said
Larry Michel, economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ``But
with a booming economy and the expanded need for communications, it
would be a very tough time for BellSouth to take a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased competition
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is moving into a new era, where it expects increased
competition with rivals. There are big players like WorldCom/MCI
and Sprint, smaller competitors like Allegiance Telecom and IGC
Communications. The only other union companies are AT&AMP;T _ which is
struggling to find a strategy _ and the other regional Bell
companies. BellSouth can argue that it is at a disadvantage because
those nonunion rivals need not consider labor agreements when they
plot business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company can argue that a sweetened deal puts BellSouth at a
disadvantage in the market _ and any chance for a healthy union
depends on a healthy company. The union can respond that is makes
the company stronger by guaranteeing skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides depend on each other, and the results
of today's last-minute talks are likely to reflect that fact.

   Rudy T again gets &QL; 
most out of a team
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Italy's Carlton Myers launched his last-ditch
3-point try to win the game, and Rudy Tomjanovich was over there on
the near sideline, lifting off like a, well, rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flying,'' he said. ``Going for that rebound, man. That's
definitely the highest I've jumped in years. I think I could have
dunked if I had the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Kiwane Garris, the backup point guard, had the ball
wrapped up in his mitts tighter than a politician holding on to a
dollar, and the United States finally had another win in its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   After 39 grueling minutes and 57 hair-pulling seconds, Garris
made one of two free throws and Rudy T's Dreamers survived with an
80-77 win in the World Championship of Basketball quarterfinals
that was as fraught with significance as it was filled with drama.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Clutchopolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' Tomjanovich said. ``On nights like this, I
wish I was still drinking. Because I'd love to go out and have a
couple beers.''
</P>
<P>
   There surely were celebratory toasts raised Friday night in
Athens tavernas by other members of the small U.S. contingent of
supporters after this win. Not because it was much different from
the way the Dreamers have had to tiptoe through the minefields in
the tournament. But for what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   That is, another measure of validation and vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Now a tough matchup with Russia in the semifinals, and it will
take two more improbable wins to get gold.
</P>
<P>
   Always high U.S. expectations
</P>
<P>
   But they all knew a loss to Italy in the quarterfinals would
have meant their efforts of the past month would have gone to
waste. Back at home, the boycotting Dream Teamers likely would have
chuckled at the inability of their minor-league cousins to fill
their shoes and the majority of fans would have treated their work
with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   When the letters across the front of the uniform jersey say
``USA,'' there is an unspoken expectation that you do not come to
one of these international basketball affairs _ Dream Team or no
Dream Team _ and spend the final weekend slugging it out in the
consolation round to determine whether you finish fifth, sixth,
seventh or eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went 5-1 in the early rounds, and none of that would have
meant anything,'' Rudy T said. ``We lose here, and we go back home
and have people say, `Oh, yeah, we heard you were over there
somewhere and did OK.' You lose, and everything we have
accomplished goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   This game had that potential to go over the edge, filled as it
was with all of the expected perils of a Chevy Chase European
vacation. The Dreamers were playing before a mostly hostile crowd,
in a game where Myers was on fire offensively and being helped down
the stretch by what we will, in an attempt not to sound parochial,
describe as generous officiating. That is, if you were Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Italy did not score a field goal in the final 7:22 of the game
but stayed in it to the end thanks to 13 free-throw attempts, all
of which were successful and all but two by Myers, who was
15-for-15 from the line en route to 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamers keep their heads
</P>
<P>
   This game appeared to be lost when the Italians took a 73-66
lead with 4:57 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only natural at that point for guys to do something
crazy, to try to get it all back at once,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Then, you miss a play and they score and a six-point hole becomes
nine or 10. It's like a boulder.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dreamers pushed the boulder back up the hill. They've
been together a month, but in that short time they have taken on
the traits of Rudy T's teams. They don't panic, and they don't
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Against Italy, Tomjanovich used the ``Pasta Plate Plan'' _ throw
it against the wall, and see what sticks. He used Garris and
Michael Hawkins, his two point guards, together down the stretch
with his tall forward Wendell Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   They got a 3-pointer, then a runner from Garris, a steal by
Hawkins and a driving banker from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel something special about this group of guys,''
Tomjanovich said. ``They have been open to our coaching and willing
to listen. They stay together and get things done. That's a sign of
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a basketball fan, that's the kind of stuff you love.
A team is down and pulls off a tough win like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is something special happening around Rudy T again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Spain game,'' he said, ``a coach here told me a
Greek saying: It's like falling off a building and landing on your
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've landed on our feet twice now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clutchopolis. Where not everything is ruins.

COMMENTARY: WHO CHOSE `THE MAGUS'? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If further proof were needed that publicity can sell anything in
America, here it is: ``Ulysses,'' a novel that is to beach reading
what the Ring Cycle is to shock-jock radio, has now made the
best-seller list, clocking in, as of Friday, at No. 3 among
paperbacks at amazon.com, where it has leaped ahead of the novelist
laureate of Oprahland, Wally Lamb. On Amazon's ``hot 100'' list of
paperbacks and hardcovers, it is even beating ``The Seven Habits of
Highly Effective People'' (reading ``Ulysses'' is not among them)
and that ever-popular anti-Joycean screed, ``Don't Sweat the Small
Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beanie-Babies-like popularity of ``Ulysses'' is the most
recent, but hardly the only, fallout of Modern Library's release,
less than three weeks ago, of its list of the century's 100 best
English-language novels. The list has spawned 1,000 newspaper
columns (this is No. 1,001) in which journalists advertise their
own erudition by decrying the omission of a pet writer (Steven
Millhauser, Djuna Barnes, Frederick Exley) who should have made the
list before the roundly deplored Booth Tarkington. (My candidate:
Max Allan Collins, author of the novelization of ``Saving Private
Ryan.'')
</P>
<P>
   The list has also spawned counter-lists throughout the land (and
cyberland) in which readers champion Ayn Rand, Frank Herbert, L.
Ron Hubbard (in the plebiscite at the Modern Library Web site) or
the unlikely duo of Alice Walker and Margaret Mitchell (among the
best 100 voted by students at the Radcliffe Publishing Course). The
Washington Times has retorted with a ``100 worst English-language
books of the 20th century'' in which ``Ulysses'' appears along with
recent titles by Charles Frazier, David Halberstam and Susan
Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   What's most amusing, though, is the extent to which the Modern
Library list has become a political football, a Frisbee-weight
summer plaything of the eternal culture wars. When its top 100 was
first announced, Random House, which owns Modern Library, was
decried for fomenting a cynical gimmick to push its own books.
(Full disclosure: I am a Random House author desperately praying
that there are more cynical gimmicks where this one came from.)
</P>
<P>
   The PR controversy was quickly drowned out by the PC
controversy. Since the 10-member Modern Library board is composed
almost entirely of nearly dead white men (median age, 69; median
race, liver-spotted white), its top 100 was dominated by dead white
men. A writer in The Los Angeles Times mocked the board for its
``obviously tokenistic inclusion'' of James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison
and Richard Wright while ignoring, among others, Toni Morrison. (It
is, in fact, a federal offense in America to omit Toni Morrison
from any list of authors, no matter what its purpose.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the PC controversy has given way to Huxleygate. On the front
page of Wednesday's Washington Post, David Streitfeld broke the
story that Modern Library had converted its board's lists into
rankings in a manner so sub-Price-Waterhouse that it might have
been more scientific had Gore Vidal and Daniel Boorstin simply
thrown darts at the shelves at the Century Club. The lax procedure
may explain why Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New World'' ended up, even
to the shock of some of the board members, as No. 5. By Friday, USA
Today was decrying the ``rank rankings'' in an editorial, but I
must say I feel kind of sorry for Huxley, a guy who just can't
catch a break. His last bid for an international spotlight, his
death, was the most haplessly timed of the century, occurring as it
did on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the Modern Library controversy to end anytime too
soon. Board members from Edmund Morris (in the Times Book Review)
to William Styron (in The New Yorker) will soon be publishing their
own spin. Christopher Cerf, the board chairman, has already been
heard from, calling the process of making the list ``to some degree
a scam,'' but ``a good scam,'' since it is promoting a spirited
national debate about literature at a time when we might otherwise
only be thinking about ``the latest scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear whether the debate is so much about
literature as it is about electoral politics, hype, race and gender
_ in other words, the same topics every other national debate is
about. But if Americans really do return from summer vacation
having actually read ``Ulysses,'' Modern Library will have at last
plunged a stake into the heart of its ruthless competitor, Cliff
Notes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Massive car bombs rocked U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Friday in unprecedented simultaneous attacks by
terrorists that killed at least 81 people, including eight
Americans, and injured more than 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pledged to track down the unknown killers and
dispatched teams of medical and security personnel to the two East
African nations to help with the injured and to begin the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhuman. We will use all means at our disposal to bring those
responsible to justice, no matter what or how long it takes,'' the
president said, addressing the attack during a Rose Garden ceremony
to sign legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to get answers and justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, located 450
miles apart, suffered extensive damage, but the loss of life and
injuries were far greater in Kenya where office and apartment
buildings around the downtown embassy bore the brunt of the
explosion. The embassy in Dar es Salaam is in a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported 74 dead and 1,643 wounded in
Nairobi and seven killed and 72 hurt in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, assistant secretary for African Affairs, said there
were eight Americans among the dead in Kenya, six U.S. citizens
missing and 14 Americans hospitalized. No Americans died in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ordered all its embassies and government
buildings overseas on heightened alert and beefed-up security.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, said the first bomb exploded in Dar es Salaam about
11: 40 a.m., EDT, and the second in Nairobi three or four minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said there were no warnings to either embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported that Kenyans crawled over the twisted and broken
concrete of the embassy to look for victims, laboring under studio
lights as darkness fell in Nairobi. ``We fear the worst. By the
time the rubble is cleared, we expect to find more dead,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe told the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the bomb collapsed a four-story building and badly
damaged the nearby Cooperative Bank House where government and
private offices are housed. Windows were shattered as far as 10
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Dar es Salaam killed embassy employees, all
Tanzanians, destroyed cars and uprooted trees.
</P>
<P>
   No organization claimed responsibility for the bombings, but the
list of suspects could be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   One suspected terrorist whose activities were being examined in
the wake of the explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in
his homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas, AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts around the
world, including the 1996 Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia that
claimed the lives of 19 U.S. airmen.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and White House also declined comment on
reports that Islamic Jihad called last week for attacks on U.S.
property after the United States helped engineer the arrests of
some of its members in Albania and their return to Egypt. The group
has ties to the assassins of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Neither African country has a history of terrorist activity, and
the United States bolstered its standing in sub-Saharan Africa
after President Clinton's 11-day visit there this spring. The
United States has cordial relations with both nations, prompting
speculations the terrorists were from outside the region. Still,
the State Department cautioned against any assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe at this stage that we are reading anything
special into the choice of these (countries) until we get further
down the investigative process,'' Undersecretary Thomas Pickering
said. ``Terrorists tend to be unpredictable, and there may be some
of that in this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was the first dual terrorist attack against U.S.
targets in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said a U.S. military C-141, the largest transport,
left Germany with members of a disaster response team to help
provide medical assistance. Nairobi hospitals reportedly were
overwhelmed by the injured.
</P>
<P>
   He said a second transport left Andrews Air Force Base in the
afternoon carrying medical supplies and U.S. personnel to help with
recovery efforts. A 44-member special Marine team also was
dispatched to help secure the embassy grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate priority is to assist the casualties and their
families, and at the same time, we are taking steps to ensure
embassy security,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said a team of federal agents will conduct the
criminal investigation in both countries. Embassies' grounds are
considered the sovereign territory of the foreign nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering dismissed questions of whether the United States could
bring the terrorists to justice. For instance, the Khobar Tower
attack remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you we will be relentless and persevering. So I
don't believe that anyone should assume that the U.S. government
will ever give up on these cases or that, in fact, the failure to
make immediate progress in some is an indication somehow that we
are not going to bring the appropriate result,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a National Security Council spokesman, said, ``We
don't forgive; we don't forget; and ultimately whoever's
responsible for the attack will be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said President Clinton was awakened about 5:30 a.m.,
EDT, and informed of the bombings by national security adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to John Lange, the charge d'affairs in Tanzania,
and to Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya who suffered
a cut lip in the explosion. ``He expressed again, on behalf of the
American people, our thoughts and prayers to the American community
during this difficult day,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls also were placed to the presidents of Kenya and Tanzania
``to express our condolences to each country, because, while it's
clear that this attack was directed at our facilities in each city,
the death toll and the injuries have primarily been borne by the
citizens of Kenya and Tanzania,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Italy to attend the
wedding of her spokesman, James Rubin, cut short her trip to return
to the United States. A delegation of members of Congress on its
way to Africa also was diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered all U.S. flags flown at half-staff. The State
Department later issued travel advisories to U.S. citizens planning
trips to either country. It also allowed all non-essential U.S.
personnel there to leave the countries.

<P>
   MARKET-REVIEW _ The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg
quandary is no longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the
barnyard, the groundlings know that they are expected to play a big
part in determining the future of the stock market. And last week,
on cue, individual investors reacted to the market's swoon with
predictable bleatings about buying opportunities and impending
rebounds. By Edward Wyatt. &QL; 
 &QL;

   MONICA-TV-REVIEW _ It has been a They-Shoot-Lawyers-Don't-They?
marathon for viewers of the legal analysts who fog up the TV
screens with talk about the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation. By
Jill Abramson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

recent strife in Central Africa, few opening lines could be more

Howard W. French. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR-REVIEW _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons. By John F. Burns. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW _ Once again, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
thumbing his nose at the world community. Last week, he said he is
through cooperating with international weapons inspectors and wants
the crippling economic sanctions on his country lifted. The United
Nations Security Council berated Iraq for its intransigence, and
demanded that Baghdad change its decision. By Eric Schmitt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO-REVIEW _ The high point of Fidel Castro's state visit to
this 133-square-mile ``Spice Isle'' last week was the speech he
delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple
grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand
people listened patiently, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for
an hour and a half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and
assorted other topics. By Larry Rohter. &QL;

 &HT;    Security: Drive to upgrade is slow, difficult
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Upgrading security at U.S. embassies overseas to
protect them from terrorist attacks has been a work-in-progress for
nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Iranian radicals invaded the U.S. embassy in Tehran
in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, State
Department officials have been trying to make those foreign
outposts more secure.
</P>
<P>
   But the security has not always come quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Lebanon, terrorists struck twice at the U.S. embassy
with deadly consequences in 1983 and 1984. In addition, a truck
bomb exploded at a military barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a terrorist truck bomb that blew up outside an
American military housing high-rise in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
killing 19 military personnel, prompted yet another security review
and upgrade of embassies and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the level of security at any embassy is usually dependent on
the level of threat perceived. The U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, hit Friday by deadly car bomb blasts less than five
minutes apart, apparently were not perceived as high-risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were soft targets,'' said Bob Heibel, director of the
Research/Intelligence Analyst Program at Mercyhurst College in
Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Heibel, formerly the FBI's No. 2 man in counter-terrorism, said
terrorists generally look for targets that are easy to attack and
where they will can get the maximum amount of damage for a minimum
amount of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bombings in Beirut, there was a real hardening of
State Department targets overseas. I would imagine they had a
priority list for doing that and it would be interesting to see
where these two embassies were on the list,'' Heibel said.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Brown, a president of Chesley Brown Associates of
Marietta, who specializes in building security, said there are
several components of security at U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent of U.S. Marine guards, which varies in number
from embassy to embassy, is the most visible line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has its own security specialists that
design, review and implement security for individual embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA provides security by monitoring local and regional
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence network plays a huge factor in determining
what level of security is implemented,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies also usually have local police or military
personnel as the first line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be seamless, but as with any organization, it's not
always seamless,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardening security at foreign embassies can sometimes be
difficult because of their location. Some, like the embassy in
Nairobi, are located in the center of downtown and cannot extend
their protective perimeters because of streets and other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot protect people against bombs of this size in a
downtown area,'' said Vincent Farley, a retired top State
Department official who has accompanied former President Jimmy
Carter to East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb that devastated that embassy reportedly exploded in a
van parked just behind it. The bomb in Tanzania reportedly was in
the embassy parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dhahran bombing two years ago, U.S. officials
recommended extending the defensive perimeters of many at-risk
overseas facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't control the perimeter, you're very limited in
what type of security you can have,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Finke, a senior security consultant for IPSA International
of Atlanta, said the State Department will have to reevaluate its
security procedures at all embassies, particularly how far the
defensive perimeters should be extended.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how distant the perimeter, the attacks are likely
to continue, Finke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can envision this happening more and more as long as we
remain the policeman of the world,'' Finke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any site can be a target,'' said Farley, who now lives in
Atlanta. ``But a U.S. embassy is symbolic. It is an attack on the
U.S. government.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said the attacks
on two U.S. embassies in East Africa only minutes apart Friday
probably were carried out by one of a small number of sophisticated
terrorist groups that had targeted U.S. installations in the past.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered teams of FBI agents, medical military
specialists and explosives experts to leave immediately for Africa
to track down the bombers and aid the victims. While few terrorism
investigations overseas have ever borne fruit, Clinton vowed to
bring the bombers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the United States, the governments of Israel
and South Africa said that they would also participate in the
rescue effort. The South African air force said it would send a
Boeing 707, capable of carrying up to 60 casualties, to transport
some of the injured from Kenya to a military hospital in Pretoria,
the South African capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said it was sending a search-and-rescue team to Kenya to
help free victims trapped in the rubble of the embassy building in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary William Cohen had
spoken Friday with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel,
about the bombings in East Africa and other issues. Defense
Department officials said the conversation was routine and that
Israel would play no special role in the investigation of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that based on early circumstantial evidence, the
investigators were focusing on followers of Osama bin Laden, a
multimillionaire Saudi-born financier who has sworn to wage a holy
war on the United States and its interests abroad. The U.S.
official declined to describe the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Laden and a group of extremist Muslim clerics
called on their followers to kill Americans. He is considered a
prime suspect in a 1996 terrorist bombing of an American apartment
complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19 American airmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said there were also suspicions
that the attacks in East Africa may have been carried out by the
Jihad, or Holy War, organization in Egypt, an Islamic extremist
group that warned earlier this week of ``reprisals'' against the
United States over its purported involvement in the extradition to
Egypt of three of its members who were arrested in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the early hours of this, and it's too early to finger
anybody,'' said another senior administration official, cautioning
against speculation about the identity of the bombers. ``We're
looking at the usual suspects. And this time, the usual suspects
may be to blame.''

</P>
<P>
   The United States said that within hours of the bombings Friday,
two teams of FBI agents and other government anti-terrorist experts
had been been gathered in Washington and ordered to fly from
Andrews Air Force Base to East Africa _ one team bound for Nairobi,
the Kenyan capital, the other for Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon sent a C-141 cargo plane with a surgical team and
medical supplies from the American air base in Ramstein, Germany,
to Nairobi. A separate anti-terrorism squad of 40 Marines was being
flown to Nairobi from Saudi Arabia, where they are temporarily
based.
</P>
<P>
   As the first teams of U.S. investigators were leaving for East
Africa, President Clinton, who was awakened at 5:30 Friday morning
with news of the bombings, condemned them as ``cowardly acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhuman,'' the president said, interrupting a bill-signing ceremony
in the Rose Garden to comment on the bombings. ``We will use all
the means at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice, no
matter what or how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ordered a tightening of security at U.S.
embassies and other diplomatic installations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Police hurriedly erected barricades in front of several U.S.
embassies elsewhere in Africa, out of fear that terrorists might
strike again on the continent. The Ugandan government ordered
traffic police in Kampala, the capital, to move vehicles from the
building that houses the U.S. Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that there was no specific threat to
the embassies in Kenya or Tanzania immediately before the bombings.
``There was no telephone call to the embassies minutes before,
saying something was going to happen, no,'' said Patrick Kennedy,
assistant secretary of state for administration.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion fell on Laden in part because of the location of
Friday's terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Laden, who has been described by the State Department as ``one
of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist
activities in the world,'' has close ties to Muslim extremists
groups in Sudan, which borders Kenya to the north. He lived in
Sudan before relocating to Afghanistan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long had strained ties with the Sudanese
government, which it has accused of harboring terrorist groups, and
has moved most of its embassy employees out of Sudan to Nairobi,
where they work out of the embassy building that was bombed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Laden sends tens of millions of dollars through Islamic banks
and charities to terrorist organizations, militant groups and
extremists political movements based in Sudan, Algeria, Egypt,
Lebanon and the Philippines, as well as providing support for
Jihad, which is also suspected of involvement in the attacks in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a newspaper in Kuwait quoted the leader of Jihad,
Ayman Zawahri, as renewing his call for a holy war against American
interests. The newspaper said that Zawahri was then living in
Afghanistan with Laden, who has been stripped of his Saudi
citizenship by the government in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Even if strong evidence emerged linking Laden, Jihad or any
other group to the bombings in East Africa, experience suggests
that the investigation of the case by the FBI will be long,
complicated and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI has jurisdiction under American law for crimes
against Americans abroad, few of the major terrorism investigations
of the last decade have resulted in arrests. Terrorists responsible
for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland and the 1995
murder of two American diplomats in Pakistan were never caught.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the State Department, Undersecretary
Thomas Pickering said that it was too early to single out suspects
in the bombing or to speculate about why they had chosen to carry
out the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find them, we'll ask them,'' he said. ``I don't
believe at this stage that we are reading anything special into the
choice of these until we get further down the investigative
process. I don't have an answer. Terrorists tend to be
unpredictable, and there may be some of that in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was reported to be rushing
back to Washington from Italy, where she was to have attended the
weekend wedding of her chief spokesman, James Rubin. She said in a
statement that the administration ``will spare no effort to use all
means at our disposal to track down and punish the perpetrators of
these outrageous acts.''

EMBASSIES BUILT BEFORE TOUGHER BUILDING CODES ENACTED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two U.S. embassies bombed by terrorists in
eastern Africa on Friday were constructed before the federal
government initiated a strict building code to protect its foreign
ambassadors from such explosions, a senior State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But even the stricter construction standards might not have
protected embassy personnel from what appears to have been highly
organized terrorists with large quantities of explosives, said
Thomas Pickering, undersecretary of state for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of U.S. investigators are scouring debris from the massive
midmorning bombings of the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, which were built before the 1986 Diplomatic
Security Act called for new embassies to be better fortified to
withstand an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bomb-proof is a relative term,'' Pickering said. ``Tell me
what size bomb, and I'll tell you what the proof is .... Obviously
a bigger bomb makes a bigger problem, and smaller bombs are less of
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers, quoting U.S. intelligence sources,
reported that the blast in Tanzania was caused by a car bomb. The
source said the Kenya bomb, while yet not traced to a car,
apparently was placed next to a parked gasoline tanker truck
outside the embassy, boosting the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Nairobi and Dar es Salaam facilities were built more than 17
years ago, before the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983
led to a security review worldwide, heightened restrictions at U.S.
embassies and enactment of the 1986 law. Metal detectors and
concrete barriers are some of the more visible results of the
tighter measures at many embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Williams, director of overseas diplomatic security for
the State Department until retiring in 1995, told reporters Friday
the older U.S. embassies still are most vulnerable since they're
often located on busy city streets and lack reinforced walls.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Kenyan and Tanzanian sites did not maintain
the sizable vehicle setbacks routinely found at newer embassies in
more risky areas of the world. The Nairobi embassy is at a busy
downtown intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The only protection from a bomb blast is ``distance, not much
else,'' Williams told reporters. ``Even if our buildings are
tremendously strong, they have to be far enough from a road.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive bombs used Friday were detonated outside the
embassies but close enough to badly damage the buildings and many
nearby automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   British security expert Michael Yardley told The Associated
Press that terrorists will seek out such weaknesses. ``If you
harden one target ... terrorism merely deserts to a softer target.
That seems to be exactly what's happened here,'' he said. ``It's
almost impossible to protect yourself globally from this sort of
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the explosions in Kenya and Tanzania, Pickering
expressed confidence in the strict building code and security at
the 260 U.S. embassies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a set of standards which we believe deals with most of
the difficulties, if not all, that we could expect to face,'' he
said. ``And we have taken the whole series of steps ... putting our
embassies on alert, cautioning Americans, issuing specific notices
with respect to Kenya and Tanzania in the light of these events.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams and others told reporters Friday that there has not
been enough money spent since 1986 to upgrade a majority of U.S.
embassies to the stricter standards.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which receives about 30,000 threats of
terrorist attacks annually, established a special task force
immediately after the bombings Friday to tighten embassy security
worldwide and to coordinate the delivery of medical supplies to the
two facilities, where a total of 804 Americans are stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always in a state of alert,'' Pickering said.
``Terrorists tend to want to be unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday the two African
embassies weren't on high alert before the blasts because there had
been no warnings of a possible terrorist act.

MAYOR RESPONDS TO DETECTIVE'S CLAIMS ON RAMSEY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Boulder's mayor on Friday demanded an
investigation into complaints by a city police detective that the
district attorney's office had ``effectively crippled'' the
20-month-old investigation into the killing of JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``These charges should not be left unchallenged, Mayor Bob
Greenlee said of an explosive 8-page letter of resignation that
Steve Thomas, the police detective, tendered here on Thursday. ``It
is confusing and unacceptable to me that people are unaccountable,
or not responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, which would have been the little girl's eighth birthday,
found official Colorado in turmoil over the detective's farewell
blast. Calling for the nomination of a special prosecutor in the
case, Thomas wrote that Boulder police detectives view some members
of the Boulder County district attorney's office as potential
defense witnesses, adding: ``I believe the district attorney's
office is thoroughly compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Laurion, a spokeswoman for Alex Hunter, Boulder's
district attorney, said in response: ``The letter is outrageous and
is substantially false and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Boulder police and prosecutors said
Friday: ``Our primary responsibility is to gather sufficient
evidence to prosecute the JonBenet Ramsey homicide, and to further
address these charges would only sidetrack the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer conferred with other district attorneys about the
letter's call for a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, first obtained by ABC News on Thursday night, cut
through some of the fog that has surrounded the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While officials last fall reassured residents of cooperation
between police and prosecutors, Thomas wrote that the two
institutions at times ``weren't even on speaking terms.'' He wrote
of sessions with prosecutors where ``detectives protested in
frustration, where fists hit the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never offered true prosecutorial support,'' said
Thomas, one of five lead detectives in the murder case. ``We were
trying to deliver a murder case with hands tied behind our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the detective faulted the prosecutor's office for
failing to obtain the Ramseys' telephone and credit-card reports,
for failing to quickly call for a grand jury to compel reluctant
witnesses to testify, for failing to demand that all witnesses be
subjected to polygraph tests, for leaving evidence untested, and
for ``mistreating'' prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the district attorney's office shared
``police reports, physical evidence and investigative information''
with the Ramseys' defense lawyers and repeatedly reminded police
detectives ``just how powerful and talented and resourceful
particular defense attorneys were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics seemed to trump justice,'' Thomas, a 13-year veteran
of the force, concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Haddon, Ramsey's lead defense lawyer, has been a major
figure in Colorado's Democratic Party. Hunter, the prosecutor, is a
Democrat. Romer is general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. Greenlee is a Republican and a House candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the detective is implying that there has been any kind of
collusion between prosecutors and defense because of political
influence _ that's patently absurd,'' Bob Grant, district attorney
for Adams County, said Friday after conferring with the governor
over the detective's resignation letter. Grant, a Democrat, said
that it was ``more likely than not'' that the Boulder prosecutor
would take the case before a grand jury this fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ten weeks after the Boulder police briefed the district attorney
on the case, regional police departments appear to be losing
patience with an investigation that has involved interviews with
590 people and investigations of 122 suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Denver and Broomfield have recalled
investigators who were on loan to Boulder prosecutors. Last week
the Boulder County sheriff lent a replacement detective only after
considerable cajoling.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter, Thomas wrote that he feared
prosecutors would doom the case by not aggressively presenting it
to a grand jury. ``District Attorney Hunter's continued reference
to a `runaway' grand jury is puzzling,'' he wrote. ``Is he afraid
that he cannot control the outcome?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor and a Republican,
said after reading the letter Friday: ``He has substantial fears
that the DA may tank the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have said that they had nothing to do with the
murder of their daughter on Dec. 26, 1996. After spending $1
million, Boulder police have not declared any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary aired here on Wednesday, Ramsey said, ``I would
have given my life for JonBenet, and I regret _ I will regret for
the rest of my life _ that I wasn't able to do that that night.
JonBenet was the spark plug of our family.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If actions speak louder than words, the person many consider the
nation's most astute stock-market investor _ and surely its most
influential _ seems, at least, to be whispering ``sell.''
</P>
<P>
   While Warren E. Buffett, the decabillionaire ``Oracle of
Omaha,'' has always argued that long-term investors should welcome
market drops as chances to scoop up bargains, his proposed
acquisition of General Re, America's biggest reinsurance company,
involves a major, largely unrecognized, portfolio shift from stocks
to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was announced, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
holding company had $40 billion of its $50 billion in assets
allocated to the stock market. But the addition of General Re,
which is laden with bonds, changes that share to $45 billion out of
$74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one fell swoop, Berkshire reduces its stock holdings as a
percentage of investment assets from 80 percent to roughly 61
percent,'' said Daniel S. Pecaut, proprietor of a family brokerage
firm in Sioux City, Iowa, and a close student of his Corn Belt
neighbor. ``Clearly he is selling stocks, and there is something
important going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, who has said almost nothing publicly of late, denied
when the deal was announced in June that it reflected any belief
that stocks might be peaking. ``It is not a market call
whatsoever,'' he stated.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of General Re does offer Berkshire some tax
advantages and other benefits. But it is difficult to conclude that
the purchase is anything but a reallocation of Berkshire's assets
on a scale befitting an investment behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other clues that Buffett has grown wary of
stocks. One is that Berkshire has lately been venturing outside its
traditional realm of blue-chip companies (200 million shares of
Coca-Cola being the largest position); Geico and other insurance
companies, and ownership of an assortment of small operating
subsidiaries in businesses like candy, jewelry, shoes, furniture
and vacuum cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Berkshire took a large position in oil futures,
of which contracts for 14 million barrels remained at the end of
1997. And the company stunned the metals market last year by buying
111 million ounces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of change is that Berkshire shed 5 percent of its
stock portfolio last year, trimming stalwarts like Walt Disney,
McDonald's, Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac in what Buffett in his
annual letter to shareholders called part of an effort ``aimed at
changing our bond-stock ratio moderately'' to reflect a shift in
their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely if ever, according to Buffett watchers, has this master
of spotting undervalued, growth-oriented businesses referred to the
relative attractiveness of bonds and stocks. ``Though we don't
attempt to predict the movements of the stock market,'' Buffett
allowed in his letter, dated Feb. 27, ``we do try, in a very rough
way, to value it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even last winter, good value was getting hard to find, in
Buffett's view. ``We are not pleased with our prospects for
committing incoming funds,'' Buffett cautioned shareholders.
``Prices are high for both businesses and stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   For General Re's shares, however, Buffett offered a big, though
not outlandish, 28.5 percent premium. And he agreed to pay with
Berkshire stock even though less than four months earlier he had
put a sharp pencil to all his previous stock-only acquisitions over
the years and found that they had actually lost money.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Berkshire's spectacular performance _ a 24.1
percent average compounded annual gain since 1964 _ would have been
even better had he not done deals for stock, which in effect reduce
stockholders' stakes in all of the holding company's investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure that Charlie and I, will be very reluctant to
issue shares in the future,'' Buffett said, referring to Charles T.
Munger, his long-time sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Buffett's earlier merger discussions with General Re had come
to naught, but he wanted the company so badly that he was willing
to pay an above-market price in Berkshire common stock even though
this meant sharply shrinking his exposure to future stock profits,
at least in the foreseeable future. Conceivably, in fact, Buffett
considered his stock overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he appear particularly sanguine about prospects for the
bond market. Last week, Berkshire reported that it had sold all its
$4.6 billion in zero-coupon bonds _ another unusual holding for the
company. The sale proved a hugely profitable bet. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Zeroes, which pay no cash interest, are more sensitive to
changes in interest rates than other types of bonds. Buffett's sale
of the bonds indicated that he believed interest rates were
unlikely to fall much further and perhaps could start rising.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Berkshire has long and highly profitable experience
in the insurance business. The deal for General Re _ Buffett's
biggest &UR;  &LR; by far _ will create for the combined company a float of
$22 billion. (In insurance, float refers to the free use of money
collected as premiums but not yet paid to settle expected
claims. &UR;  &LR; In the interim, that money is available for investment.)
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has stressed the transaction's attributes as a corporate
marriage _ the two companies presumably are worth more together
than separately. But others are also impressed with its ingenuity
in diluting the stock portion of his company's portfolio. That
avoids both a horrendous tax bite from an outright sale of
immensely appreciated stock, and the likely market havoc from
``Buffett Turns Bearish!'' headlines about such a sale.
</P>
<P>
   A disruption like that, which perhaps only Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chairman, could match, is a constant concern at
Berkshire. ``They're very careful about it,'' Pecaut said,
``because they don't want people to jump off cliffs.'' (His
analysis first received attention in last week's issue of Grant's
Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter published in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, little mention has been made of Buffett as a possible
contributor to the recent market swoon. The clever &UR;  &LR; deal allows him
to lighten up on stocks while enhancing a business juggernaut that
will have even more buying power when the climate for stocks
improves. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  For now, Buffett, a baseball fan and a co-owner of Omaha's
minor league team, can simply keep the bat on his shoulder because,
as he is fond of observing, there are no called strikes in
investing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pecaut, meanwhile, concluded this about the General Re deal:
``By doing a stock merger, Berkshire is trading away 18 percent of
its holdings in Coca-Cola, American Express, Gillette, etc., but
doing so in a way that Berkshire pays no taxes,'' he said. ``As my
kids would put it, `way cool.' ''

COMMENTARY: MOTIVES FOR THE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-SCENE,
AFRICA-SECURITY, AFRICA-VICTIMS)  
(js) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is still unclear who is behind the evil bombing attacks
against two U.S. embassies in Africa, but if you want to speculate
here are some things to consider:
</P>
<P>
   First, the targets _ Nairobi and Dar es Salaam _ were most
likely chosen because these were soft locations, with open borders
and lax police, where perpetrators could easily smuggle in
explosives, assemble car bombs and detonate them without fear of
detection. To pull off nearly simultaneous bombings, outside U.S.
embassies in two different African countries, is not something your
local terrorists are likely to be capable of. This usually requires
at least the help of a state intelligence service, with access to
safe houses, bomb-making techniques and diplomatic pouches.
</P>
<P>
   Which countries or groups might have the capabilities and
intentions to pull off such a twin attack?
</P>
<P>
   Iran: Anyone who is following Iranian politics can see that
there is a civil war going on inside Iran, between hard-line
fundamentalists associated with Iran's spiritual guide, Ali
Khamenei, and moderates aligned with President Mohammad Khatami.
Although Khatami is president, Iran's intelligence services _which
are suspected of involvement in previous bombings against Jewish
targets in Argentina and U.S. targets in the Middle East _ are
still under the control of Khamenei and the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has recently made important overtures to Khatami
and the moderates to see if it is possible to forge a new
relationship, which Khatami himself has encouraged. The Iranian
hardliners are not pleased with this, and they are trying to
undermine Khatami and his allies every way they can. The Iranian
hardliners may believe that the best way to kill any budding
rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. is by killing Americans.
Indeed, you can be sure that the closer the U.S. and Iran inch
toward better relations, the more the hard-core, anti-American
Iranian forces will do things to rupture them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq: Iraq too would have the capabilities and intentions to hit
U.S. targets. It's hard to see why Iraq, when it's desperate to get
the U.N. economic sanctions lifted, would undertake such an
egregious attack on the U.S., which could only set back the lifting
of sanctions indefinitely. But when it comes to Saddam Hussein, any
perverse logic is possible.
</P>
<P>
   A new Ramzi Yousef: Ramzi Yousef and his gang were sophisticated
enough to pull off the 1993 truck bomb attack on the World Trade
Center in Manhattan, which killed six people and injured more than
1,000. Yousef, a native of Pakistan, was not a country or a
superpower. He was a super-empowered angry man. He had no
particular ideology or political goals. He just hated America. He
felt the U.S. was hostile to Muslims, and his goal was simply to
kill as many Americans as possible.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a few Ramzi Yousefs still out there. They
hate America because it is the most powerful country in the world,
because they feel it throws its economic weight around with great
arrogance and because its cultural exports uproot their traditional
societies. They use the best of today's modern technology for the
most evil of deeds. One reason Ramzi Yousef was caught was because
police found his Toshiba laptop computer in his Manila apartment
where all his plots were filed on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   For now one can draw only a couple of conclusions. One is that
the U.S. pays a price for letting things like the Khobar Towers
bombing go without retaliation. Khobar Towers was the U.S. military
apartment building in Saudi Arabia where a huge truck bomb exploded
June 25, 1996, killing 19 Americans. The Saudis have never turned
over all the evidence because some of it reveals links to Iran. The
Saudis didn't want the U.S. retaliating against Iran and then
leaving Saudi Arabia to absorb the counterstrike. The White House
basically bowed to Saudi wishes. But when people think they can
attack the U.S. with impunity, they will be tempted to try again.
</P>
<P>
   The other conclusion is that if the U.S. is compelled to
retaliate, the Monica Lewinsky affair can only complicate matters.
Every foreign or domestic actor who is looking for excuses to
oppose any U.S. retaliation in this case will claim that President
Clinton is only acting to distract attention from his embarrassing
entanglements, and that will make building diplomatic support more
difficult. Just one more reason why it was so reckless for the
commander-in-chief to be involved in any sort of improper
relationship in the Oval Office.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Massive car bombs rocked U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Friday in unprecedented simultaneous attacks by
terrorists that killed at least 81 people, including eight
Americans, and injured more than 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pledged to track down the unknown killers and
dispatched teams of medical and security personnel to the two East
African nations to help with the injured and to begin the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhuman. We will use all means at our disposal to bring those
responsible to justice, no matter what or how long it takes,'' the
president said, addressing the attack during a Rose Garden ceremony
to sign legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to get answers and justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, located 450
miles apart, suffered extensive damage, but the loss of life and
injuries were far greater in Kenya where office and apartment
buildings around the downtown embassy bore the brunt of the
explosion. The embassy in Dar es Salaam is in a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported 74 dead and 1,643 wounded in
Nairobi and seven killed and 72 hurt in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, assistant secretary for African Affairs, said there
were eight Americans among the dead in Kenya, six U.S. citizens
missing and 14 Americans hospitalized. No Americans died in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ordered all its embassies and government
buildings overseas on heightened alert and beefed-up security.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, said the first bomb exploded in Dar es Salaam about
10:40 a.m. African time (3:40 a.m., EDT), and the second in Nairobi
three or four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said there were no warnings to either embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported that Kenyans crawled over the twisted and broken
concrete of the embassy to look for victims, laboring under studio
lights as darkness fell in Nairobi. ``We fear the worst. By the
time the rubble is cleared, we expect to find more dead,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe told the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the bomb collapsed a four-story building and badly
damaged the nearby Cooperative Bank House where government and
private offices are housed. Windows were shattered as far as 10
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Dar es Salaam killed embassy employees, all
Tanzanians, destroyed cars and uprooted trees.
</P>
<P>
   No organization claimed responsibility for the bombings, but the
list of suspects could be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   One suspected terrorist whose activities were being examined in
the wake of the explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S. troops in
his homeland and Americans elsewhere overseas, AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts around the
world, including the 1996 Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia that
claimed the lives of 19 U.S. airmen.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and White House also declined comment on
reports that Islamic Jihad called last week for attacks on U.S.
property after the United States helped engineer the arrests of
some of its members in Albania and their return to Egypt. The group
has ties to the assassins of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Neither African country has a history of terrorist activity, and
the United States bolstered its standing in sub-Saharan Africa
after President Clinton's 11-day visit there this spring. The
United States has cordial relations with both nations, prompting
speculations the terrorists were from outside the region. Still,
the State Department cautioned against any assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe at this stage that we are reading anything
special into the choice of these (countries) until we get further
down the investigative process,'' Undersecretary Thomas Pickering
said. ``Terrorists tend to be unpredictable, and there may be some
of that in this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was the first dual terrorist attack against U.S.
targets in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said a U.S. military C-141, the largest transport,
left Germany with members of a disaster response team to help
provide medical assistance. Nairobi hospitals reportedly were
overwhelmed by the injured.
</P>
<P>
   He said a second transport left Andrews Air Force Base in the
afternoon carrying medical supplies and U.S. personnel to help with
recovery efforts. A 44-member special Marine team also was
dispatched to help secure the embassy grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate priority is to assist the casualties and their
families, and at the same time, we are taking steps to ensure
embassy security,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said a team of federal agents will conduct the
criminal investigation in both countries. Embassies' grounds are
considered the sovereign territory of the foreign nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering dismissed questions of whether the United States could
bring the terrorists to justice. For instance, the Khobar Tower
attack remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you we will be relentless and persevering. So I
don't believe that anyone should assume that the U.S. government
will ever give up on these cases or that, in fact, the failure to
make immediate progress in some is an indication somehow that we
are not going to bring the appropriate result,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a National Security Council spokesman, said, ``We
don't forgive; we don't forget; and ultimately whoever's
responsible for the attack will be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said President Clinton was awakened about 5:30 a.m.,
EDT, and informed of the bombings by national security adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to John Lange, the charge d'affairs in Tanzania,
and to Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya who suffered
a cut lip in the explosion. ``He expressed again, on behalf of the
American people, our thoughts and prayers to the American community
during this difficult day,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls also were placed to the presidents of Kenya and Tanzania
``to express our condolences to each country, because, while it's
clear that this attack was directed at our facilities in each city,
the death toll and the injuries have primarily been borne by the
citizens of Kenya and Tanzania,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Italy to attend the
wedding of her spokesman, James Rubin, cut short her trip to return
to the United States. A delegation of members of Congress on its
way to Africa also was diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered all U.S. flags flown at half-staff. The State
Department later issued travel advisories to U.S. citizens planning
trips to either country. It also allowed all non-essential U.S.
personnel there to leave the countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rallied for a third day Friday as
investors bought stocks whose prices had been pummeled during, and
even before, the headline-grabbing sell-off that began in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the three-day rally, the major market measures
still ended the week down sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial
average off 3.2 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks down 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many concerns around this market,'' said
Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist with Salomon Smith Barney.
``The market is going to remain volatile until they are all worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The buying of battered stocks kept the technology-heavy Nasdaq
index and the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks well
above water, but still off their highs for the day. The Nasdaq
finished up 17.26 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 1,846.77,
while the Russell ended at 415.80, up 9.18, or 2.3 percent.
Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners 2 to 1, another positive
turn for the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Dow and the S&AMP;P gave up their gains in Friday
afternoon trading was a signal of continued volatility _ and
continuing investor concern. It seemed that after a turbulent week,
in which the Dow suffered its third- worst one-day point decline
ever, investors were just tired or wanted to take what profits they
could from the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is another sign that the blue chips have further to
decline,'' said Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at
Prudential Securities, whose sudden switch to bearishness on
Tuesday helped knock the Dow down 299.43 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the S&AMP;P index, which are dominated by the
bigger-company stocks that many investors now feel are overpriced,
sank into negative territory Friday afternoon. The Dow struggled
back to finish up 20.34 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at
8,598.02. It had been up 112 points. The S&AMP;P ended off 0.18 point
at 1,089.45, after hitting 1,102.54.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's early rally was helped by an apparently favorable July
employment report. Despite the distortions from the nearly
eight-week strike against General Motors, the data showed that the
domestic economy, especially the service sector, is still quite
robust.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still reminders of the worries that helped send
the Dow industrials down 9.1 percent before the end-of-the-week
rally. The drag on American exports and manufacturing from the
economic crisis in Asia was reflected in the generally weak
increase of 66,000 nonfarm jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   And as the stock market was rallying, the Japanese yen tumbled
and is now weaker than it was when the United States and Japan
intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the currency
in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed weakness in the yen is a result of the lack of
confidence in the new Japanese government's ability to turn the
nation's economy around, a necessary ingredient in any economic
rebound across Asia. The new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's first
policy statement to Parliament Friday just added to the
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has tried to shrug off Asia, but I think the
problems there are getting worse,'' said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. ``Japan is becoming a modern
macroeconomic policymakers' nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, was more confident about the economic outlook. ``When you
look at the core forces underlying the market they remain in good
working order,'' he said. ``So the sky is not falling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The role battered stocks have played in the market rebound that
began on Wednesday can be seen in the performance of the
semiconductor industry, oil stocks and smaller-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about demand from Asia and climbing inventories had sent
semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices,
Motorola &UR;  &LR; and Teradyne tumbling. The Philadelphia semiconductor
index, which also includes Intel, had fallen 29.5 percent from its
February high to its low June 15. But in the last three days of the
trading week the index was up 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks had also been off sharply as the price of oil
plunged. The Philadelphia oil service index, which includes
Halliburton &UR;  &LR; and Schlumberger, dropped 48.5 percent from May 1 to
Wednesday. But on Thursday and Friday, the index jumped 7.8
percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of major oil companies,
including Exxon and Chevron, rose 3.3 percent Friday after falling
16.8 percent since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the Russell index of smaller company stocks had fallen
almost 19 percent from its high in April to a 1998 low on
Wednesday. But over the next two days it jumped 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the jobs and wage data in the July
employment report did not upset investors because it supported the
view that the Federal Reserve, whose policymaking committee meets
on Aug. 18, will leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 20/32, to 107 4/32, while the
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.63
percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday.

NEITHER EMBASSY MET CURRENT SECURITY GUIDELINES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two U.S. embassies in East Africa that were
bombed Friday did not meet security standards that were ordered for
the State Department's overseas posts following separate terrorist
attacks against the U.S. Embassy and marine barracks in Beirut,
Lebanon, in the early 1980s, State Department officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
had never been modified to fully comply with the tougher security
standards called for in 1985 by a panel headed by retired Adm.
Bobby Inman, largely because the White House and Congress have
never provided enough money to fund a worldwide conversion of all
U.S. embassies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the State Department was given less than
one-third of the money that would have been required to modify or
build new facilities to meet the standards, which were imposed to
prevent a repeat of the 1984 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut,
which killed 16 people, and the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine
barracks in Beirut, which killed 241.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1981, before the Inman standards went into effect, the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi was scheduled to undergo a $3 million
rehabilitation and security upgrade in January 1999, its first
major security modification since its original construction, a
State Department official said Friday. The planned alterations to
the embassy in Nairobi were to include new construction to
completely separate the embassy's business and operations areas
from the more public counselor section, the State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dar es Salaam, the State Department spent $750,000 in 1988 to
modify the embassy, which is located in a 44-year-old, three-story
office building that previously housed a Tanzanian government
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, it was the Israeli chancellory until it was
expropriated by the Tanzanian government in 1973 after Tanzania and
Israel broke relations. In 1980, the United States leased the
building for its embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither embassy complied with the Inman standards, which,
among other things, called for 9-foot walls to be constructed
around all embassies and for the embassies to be set back at least
100 feet from streets and neighboring buildings. In Dar es Salaam,
a 9-foot wall was constructed in 1988, but it is as close as 25
feet to 75 feet to nearby streets and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Nairobi is only set back 30 feet from the street,
on a busy intersection in the downtown district. A large building
of over 65,000 square feet, the embassy has five stories above
ground and two below and sits on a half-acre site. It was one of
the last embassies built before the Inman standards were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a set of standards which we believe deals with most of
the difficulties, if not all of the difficulties, that we expect to
face, and it is clear that these two buildings did not meet our
current standards,'' Thomas Pickering, under secretary of state for
political affairs, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombings Friday, the United States placed embassies
around the world on a heightened security alert. Yet Pickering also
said that no public building can ever be completely bomb-proof.
Asked about the two installations' vulnerability to attack,
Pickering said: ``Bomb-proof is a relative term. Tell me what size
bomb, and I'll tell you what the proof is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The State Department estimated in 1986 that converting or
replacing all embassies to meet the Inman standards would have cost
approximately $3.5 billion. Between 1986 and 1990, the State
Department requested $2.7 billion to upgrade its embassies, but
Congress only appropriated about $880 million during that period.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the prohibitive costs, as well as a growing belief that
compliance with the security standards directly conflicts with the
public diplomatic functions of U.S. overseas posts, have led both
Congress and the administration to quietly drop the idea of
modifying all U.S. embassies to comply with the Inman standards.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials came to believe that the security
recommendations of the Inman panel were Draconian, and would
transform many embassies into nearly inaccessible fortresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible to implement the Inman standards
worldwide,'' observed Jane Loeffler, the author of a new book on
the history of embassy design. ``Both because of the cost, and
because it would have brought into question the very meaning of
American diplomacy. Every American embassy would have become a
walled compound out in isolated suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the State Department established a priority list of
embassies that most needed protection. Those in nations like
Kuwait, where the State Department believed there was a high risk
of a terrorist attack, were the first to undergo redesign or to be
moved to new and more secure buildings. But State Department
officials said that both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were considered
low-threat posts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, gates, metal detectors and extra security personnel have
been added to embassies in every country, but not even all new
embassies comply with the Inman standards.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through the new fiscal 1999 budget, Congress has
provided a total of $112 million to increase embassy security, said
a Republican staffer on the House appropriations subcommittee that
deals with the matter. The aide said that State Department
officials have told lawmakers that they are no longer wedded to
trying to achieve full compliance with the Inman security standards
at all U.S. embassies. ``State has told us they have been satisfied
with the level of funding on security measures,'' the aide said.

TROOPS TO LEAVE RESTIVE REGION OF SUMATRA AFTER ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The armed forces promised Friday to begin
removing troops from Aceh province, where the military has been
accused of killing thousands of people suspected of being
separatists in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister and armed forces commander, Gen. Wiranto,
made a half-day visit to Aceh, the country's westernmost province,
1,000 miles from the capital, in an bid to calm public outrage over
decades of military repression under the former government of
President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give one month at the latest for all troops that are not
based in the region to be withdrawn and returned to their
respective bases,'' Wiranto was quoted as saying on the state
television from the town of Lhokseumawe on the northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say how many troops were stationed in the province of
170,000 people, on the northern tip of Sumatra, Indonesia's largest
island.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto apologized on behalf of the military for the actions of
any soldiers whose ``excesses may have caused any harm to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The province was declared a ``military operational region'' in
1990 after intensified activity by rebels hoping to form a separate
country with an Islamic government. More than 85 percent of the 200
million people of Indonesia are Muslims, making it the world's
largest Muslim country, but the government is secular.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of torture and mass graves in the staunchly Muslim
province have surfaced almost daily in the local press in the last
month, prompting parliamentary and non-governmental investigations
of reports that more than 30,000 people in the province have
disappeared since 1989 at the hands of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The military's special forces unit, Kopassus, has been
implicated in many of the disappearances by widows and other
relatives who have broken their silence since the resignation of
Suharto on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Three high-ranking Kopassus officers, including a Suharto
son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, were suspended this week and
are being questioned about the disappearance of dozens of
anti-Suharto activists in the capital, 14 of whom are still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Committee for Missing Persons and Victims of
Violence, welcomed the military's apology but said it smacked of
politics more than progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too fast to judge if this attitude is anything more than
political,'' said Munir, the head of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troop withdrawal is important, but the status of the
province as a military operational region has to be changed,''
added Munir, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. He plans
to visit the province next week, ahead of plans by human rights
groups to begin digging at the suspected burial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a parliamentary fact-finding team sent to the area
earlier in the week to investigate the reports of mass graves were
moved to tears by the account of a 70-year-old man who was arrested
earlier in the year on charges of concealing arms in his home.
</P>
<P>
   A local daily reported that the man, a father of seven, said his
captors had stripped him naked, gave him electric shocks and tried
to bury him alive during three days and nights of military
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Under President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto after 32
years of highly authortarian rule, the military has taken an
increasingly public approach to redressing the atrocities committed
by soldiers in several Indonesian provinces.

JUDGE SAW STARR MEDIA LEAKS, UNSEALED RECORDS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has ruled that independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr probably violated grand jury secrecy laws by
repeatedly leaking information to the news media about his
investigation of President Clinton, according to court documents
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing complication for Starr at a crucial stage of
his inquiry, a federal appeals court unsealed records showing that
US District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson found credible evidence in
June &UR;  &LR; that Starr and his associates breached the secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr and his staff are unable to disprove the allegations,
they could be cited for criminal contempt of court, and their
investigation could be severely compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was ordered by the US Court of Appeals on Monday to
further investigate the alleged violations, cited numerous news
leaks by prosecutors, including statements she said Starr was ``in
no way authorized'' to make.
</P>
<P>
   The development occurred a day after former White House intern
Monica S. Lewinsky testified before the federal grand jury about
numerous sexual encounters she saidshe had with Clinton over an
18-month period beginning in November 1995, according to a source
familiar with her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has denied under oath having a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky, is scheduled to be questioned by Starr's staff and
the grand jury on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement Friday saying Johnson's ruling was
based on ``minimal'' legal standards. He denied any wrongdoing by
him or his staff. ``We welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that
fact to the district court,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   To Clinton's lawyers and White House operatives, who have
complained for months about alleged grand jury leaks, the documents
released Friday were seen as vindication. The appeals court
released the material under a public access motion filed by 11 news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counsel's office said in a statement that ``for
the first time in the 20-year history of the Independent Counsel
Act, a federal court has found prima facie evidence of potential
criminal wrongdoing by an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, called the alleged
leaks ``highly unprofessional and utterly indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall had sought the investigation, submitting dozens of news
reports and transcripts for Johnson's review.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the material was an NBC Nightly News report, aired
on Feb. 4, that Johnson said ``directly identifies `sources in
Starr's office' and discloses information regarding a subpoenaed
witness's potential testimony before the grand jury, evaluations of
such potential testimony, and the strategy and direction'' of the
Office of Independent Counsel's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in her June 19 decision, also cited reports in the New
York Times and New York Daily News that ``identify OIC prosecutors
as the sources of the reports and improperly disclose what a
subpoenaed witness has told the OIC during investigative
interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Johnson chastised Starr for telling reporters she
had made ``a magnificent ruling'' in denying Clinton's
executive-privilege request in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comment not only confirmed for the press that the court
had indeed made a decision but also revealed that the substance of
the decision was favorable to the OIC,'' Johnson stated. ``The fact
that information about the opinion had already been leaked at time
of Mr. Starr's comment in no way authorized him to make statements
confirming or denying such leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Johnson said Starr's ``admission'' to journalist
Steven Brill in Content magazine that he briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity ``bolstered the court's findings of prima
facie violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, after determining the reports probably violated the
secrecy laws, granted Kendall permission in June to participate in
her formal inquiry into the allegations. Starr appealed the ruling,
arguing that his investigation of Clinton could be ruined if he
were forced to reveal details of the grand jury proceedings to
Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, in its decision Monday, generally agreed,
saying Clinton's lawyers should be allowed to participate ``only in
extraordinary circumstances and as a last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Proceedings to ferret out violations of the grand jury secrecy
rule should not themselves present an undue risk of compromising
that very secrecy,'' the appellate court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the risks included potentially exposing ``grand
jury members, government lawyers and agents, and witnesses to
outside pressures and possible danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he was ``gratified'' by the ruling, which he said
would protect ``the integrity of the ongoing grand jury
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals judges ordered Johnson to investigate the
allegations privately, with a special investigator if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges also said the burden was on Starr to prove that
he and his staff did not act illegally in their dealings with
reporters. Starr ``must now come forward with evidence in whatever
form the district court requires ... to rebut the inferences made
from the news articles,'' the appellate court stated.
</P>
<P>
   The legal proceeding is known as a ``show cause hearing,'' in
which individuals who allegedly have violated the secrecy rules are
required to show why they should not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were released Friday as Clinton conducted business
as usual, maintaining his silence on the investigation. He
participated in a Rose Garden ceremony on job training, expressed
outrage at the fatal bombings at US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
and spent the rest of the day beyond sight of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Lewinsky, who appeared pale and drawn after the
grand jury session on Thursday, was in better spirits Friday.
``She's doing fine,'' a source close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewinsky harbored unpleasant memories of the grand jury
experience. ``It's just hard,'' the source said, referring to
testifying about private details of alleged sexual liaisons. ``It
wasn't like she was Linda Tripp, chomping at the bit to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Senator Frank Murkowski, an Alaska
Republican who is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, asked
Clinton to delay swearing-in UN Ambassador Bill Richardson as
energy secretary amid questions involving the Lewinsky episode.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski cited a report in Friday's Washington Times that said
Richardson may have contradicted himself when he testified before
the energy committee about a job he offered Lewinsky at the US
mission in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Richardson had no openings on his staff when
he made the offer last October, contrary to his sworn testimony
during a nomination hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   The committee unanimously recommended Richardson's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee hired a former
ethics committee lawyer, Abbe Lowell, to head their staff if
Starr's investigation leads to an impeachment inquiry.

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Two massive bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania late Friday
morning, killing at least 80 people, eight of them American, in
what U.S. officials said were coordinated terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, an enormous explosion ripped through downtown at
about 10:35 a.m., turning the busy Haile Selassie Avenue into a
scene of carnage and destruction that left more than 1,600 people
injured and dozens still missing long after night fell.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which leveled a three-story building containing a
secretarial school and gutted the rear half of the U.S. Embassy
next door, dismembered more than a dozen people passing on foot and
incinerated dozens of others in their seats in three nearby buses.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before, a bomb reportedly planted in a gasoline
tanker detonated near the front entrance of the U.S. Embassy in the
Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam. The blast destroyed the front
of the building and toppled a side wall, throwing charred debris
down the street, setting cars on fire and toppling trees. At least
seven people were killed and 72 injured, none of them American,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they believed the bombings were a terrorist
attack. Although officials did not identify any suspects, the
newspaper Al-Hayat _ based in Cairo, Egypt _ reported in its
Saturday editions that it had received a call claiming
responsibility for the bombings from a previously unknown group
called the Liberation Army of the Islamic Sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton condemned the attacks as
abhorrent and inhuman acts of cowardice. He vowed to bring those
responsible to justice ``no matter what or how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombings underscored how vulnerable American officials and
diplomats remain in some Third World capitals in this age of global
terrorism, where borders are porous and security is not as tight as
in the industrialized world. The blasts seemed to be coordinated
attacks against the United States, and appeared unconnected to any
local grievances or political currents in the two capitals, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight Americans and an unknown number of Kenyan embassy
employees died in the explosion in Nairobi, which left embassy
offices a honeycomb of burned-out rubble with bodies buried inside.
``It's going to take a couple of days to find out what's in
there,'' Bill Barr, an embassy spokesman, said. Barr said 15 U.S.
officials were hospitalized and six others were still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the explosion, which shattered windows for
several blocks and blew the roof off a building across the street,
was preceded by a smaller blast, perhaps a grenade. Both appeared
to emanate from a parking lot just behind the embassy, the police
said. Hundreds of people were cut by falling glass and ran bleeding
from the area, flooding local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real national disaster and we highly suspect it is a
terrorist attack,'' Otieno Osur, the director of police operations
in Nairobi, said.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, rescue workers and soldiers in Nairobi toiled
under floodlights with backhoes to extricate dozens of bodies still
buried in the rubble of the Ufundi House behind the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In Dar es Salaam, embassy officials said they did not know who
was behind the bombing. ``At this point only several hours after
the bombing we have no idea what the motives of the bombers were,''
John Lange, the deputy chief of mission at the embassy, told
Reuters. `` All we know is that an explosion occurred right in
front of our embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been threatened by at least two terrorist
groups in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Egypt's banned Jihad group warned that it
would retaliate against U.S. targets because of Washington's role
in pressing for the extradition of three suspected terrorists from
Albania to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a Saudi Arabian fundamentalist, Osama bin Laden,
identified by the U.S. State Department as a sponsor of terrorism,
also urged his followers to wage an Islamic holy war against the
United States. Bin Laden, who is believed to be in exile in
Afghanistan, is not only a suspect in the 1996 attack at Khobar but
also in the 1995 car bombing in Riyadh that killed five Americans.
He is also believed to have links to the Jihad movement in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But no firm evidence has yet emerged linking either group to
Friday's bombings, the Kenyan police and U.S. officials said.
Washington has dispatched a special team from the FBI to assist the
local police with the investigation. Kenyan investigators said late
Friday night on state-run television that they suspect that a van
full of explosives was parked behind the embassy in front of the
Ufundi House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the injured in Nairobi was the U.S. ambassador, Prudence
Bushnell, who suffered cuts from falling glass. She was meeting
with a Kenyan minister in a building adjacent to the embassy when
the explosion occurred, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of scenes of horror and confusion in the Kenyan
capital after the bomb exploded. A thick plume of smoke rose
hundreds of feet into the air, followed by a rain of glass and
metal, several witnesses said. The blast left a black crater in the
parking lot between the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ufundi Co-op House, which houses a secretarial college and
offices, collapsed inward on itself, trapping scores of people. The
reinforced embassy building remained standing and most of the 200
people inside walked out, but its rear offices were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Three buses on the avenue outside were destroyed and several
cars were left twisted hunks of blackened metal. The dismembered
bodies of at least fifteen people were found on the street near the
blast site. People began crawling over the mountain of cement and
steel that had been the Ufundi House, clawing at the debris to free
people trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, hundreds of office workers poured out of nearby
buildings, many of them lacerated by rubble and glass. More than
1,000 people were treated at local hospitals, hospital officials
said.

 &HT;    Ethnic issues haunt Miami fraud cases
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He is young, handsome and charming to many constituents,
some of whom are fanatically loyal to him. But that loyalty may not
save the career of Humberto Hernandez, the one-time chairman of the
Miami City Commission, now facing back-to-back trials that could
send him to prison for years.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 36, is on trial in state court on charges of election
fraud stemming from last fall's tainted city elections. This
winter, a judge found massive absentee ballot fraud, much of it
centered in Hernandez's Little Havana district, and tossed out the
returns in the mayor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Hernandez faces federal mortgage fraud charges from
his work in the real estate field. Those charges predate the ballot
fraud charges and led to Hernandez being removed from office by
Gov. Lawton Chiles last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Hernandez went to his loyal Cuban-American
constituents last fall, telling them it was all a plot by the Anglo
establishment to keep Cubans out of power.
</P>
<P>
   He won election anew to the City Commission in November's
tainted contest, despite the mortgage fraud indictment. He was
removed from office again in May when he was arrested on the voter
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the trial is crucial to Miami's efforts to clean
up its scandal-plagued image.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is extremely important,'' said Marsha Silverman, a
political scientist at the University of Miami. ``The message needs
to be sent that we take voter fraud seriously here.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a veteran of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, when
American-backed Cuban commandos tried to take the island back from
Fidel Castro, Hernandez was born in Miami and earned a law degree
from Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as an assistant city of Miami attorney, but was fired
from that job when it was found that he was also running a private
law practice on city time.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't his only brush with questionable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1996 ValuJet crash in the Everglades, Hernandez
was accused of ``brazen misconduct'' by the Florida Bar Association
after some of his employees were caught handing out business cards
to the families of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   But he still won election as a city commissioner from Little
Havana in 1996. Observers said he carefully cultivated the votes of
older Cuban immigrants, most of whom don't speak English and are
mistrustful of the Anglo world, holding close to their Cuban
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is someone who won't be `out-Cubaned,''' said Dario Moreno,
a Florida International University political scientist and himself
a Cuban-American. ``He has astutely played the ethnic card by
appealing to the worst aspects of our nature here in Dade County.''
</P>
<P>
   In last fall's election, investigators found hundreds of
questionable absentee ballots, most signed by Cuban immigrants. One
was signed by a dead man. Some ballots were signed by people who
lived outside the district in which they voted. One of those was
Hernandez's own secretary, Evelyn Herbello. Hernandez is charged
with helping orchestrate a cover up of the illegal ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Herbello, however, went to authorities and secretly wore a tape
recorder to help build the case against her boss. After they were
arrested and were riding to jail in a police van, Herbello's
recorder captured Hernandez making defiant, profane remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no jury that will find us guilty,'' Hernandez boasted
on the tape, which may be introduced as evidence in his trial.
Hernandez could face up to five years in prison if convicted on the
vote fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   His federal trial on mortgage fraud charges is set to begin
Sept. 8. That case centers around what prosecutors say was a
complex scheme by Hernandez and others to defraud banks of $8
million earned from the sale of luxury condos. Hernandez has
adamantly declared his innocence in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been the only politician charged with corruption in
Miami-Dade County. In the past two years, the sprawling county has
been hit by a string of such cases, most recently involving two
county commissioners and a high-ranking state senator.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals have brought embarrassment to the city and could be
hurting its efforts to attract new industry, many observers
believe. Worried Latin business leaders held an ethics summit this
summer, while the Chamber of Commerce has drawn up ethical
guidelines for public officials to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreno fears those efforts will founder if prosecutors
aren't successful in jailing some of the allegedly corrupt leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes in this trial are pretty high,'' he said. ``If he
is found innocent, it will be portrayed on Cuban radio as a set-up,
an Anglo conspiracy. If he is found guilty, it will add momentum to
the idea that we need to get away from this corruption and ethnic
pandering.''

 &HT;    A father's voice ends a daughter frantic wait
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For several tense hours Friday morning, Emma Mwangi
paced the floor of a friend's Roswell apartment and nervously
dialed her father's office number in Nairobi. She hoped for the
best, but feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Flavian Mwangi, 69, works in an office building near the U.S.
Embassy. When his daughter saw the bomb's aftermath on TV, she knew
he had been close to ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly called his office and got no answer. Her attempts
to reach him at home were unsuccessful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, shortly after noon, he answered the phone at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, you're alive!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my darling. I'm alive,'' he replied. ``It's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 20-year-old niece, Salome Wanjiru, was injured during the
blast and is in the hospital, Emma Mwangi said: ``She was working
in my father's office. She's usually in the computer room, which is
right next to where he works. When the bomb went off, he was
talking on the phone. All this debris fell through the windows and
partitions in his office started falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives, including her brother, are missing, but she
thinks they are probably OK. They all work for her father, who owns
a coffee company.
</P>
<P>
   The blast left Mwangi with many questions and fears for her own
safety. She is visiting a friend in Roswell and plans to return to
Nairobi Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine the American Embassy in Nairobi being
bombed out, because of the security,'' she said. ``It was really,
really scary for me.''
</P>
<P>
   During her vigil Friday, she was joined by several other Kenyans
who listened to radio updates, watched TV news reports and tried to
reach their own relatives in Nairobi. A few are here to visit
friends, but most are studying at metro area colleges and
universities. The students all plan to return home when they finish
college.
</P>
<P>
   All lamented the fact that terrorism had touched their homeland,
and all agreed that no Kenyan could have been responsible for such
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyans are peace-loving people,'' said Hilary Motoku, 24, who
is studying civil engineering at DeKalb College. ``Bombs.
Terrorism. That's not the way we do it. That's an outside source
that did this.''
</P>
<P>
   He worried that Kenya's reputation would be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unfortunate that they would do such a thing. They
killed so many innocent bypassers, bystanders, people on buses,
ladies selling vegetables across the street, women and children,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political demonstrations are not uncommon, they said, and some
escalate into violence once the police arrive. But it rarely goes
beyond stone-throwing. ``Bombing? That's too much,'' said James
Nguru.
</P>
<P>
   The group speculated that Islamic militants may be responsible,
but even that would be unusual for Kenya. ``There are Muslims in
Kenya, but they are not militant,'' said Emma Mwangi.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick Thige Mwangi, who is not related to Emma Mwangi,
worried that his wife, Julia, may have gone to the U.S. Embassy to
apply for a visa to visit Atlanta. He still had not been able to
reach her by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was trying to join me here,'' said Fredrick Mwangi,
39, who studies at Beulah Heights Bible College near Grant Park.
``I don't want to imagine that she went to that place. She was
supposed to go get a visa application.''
</P>
<P>
   Motoku worried about other students who may have been standing
in line at the U.S. Embassy to get a visa. ``We all stood there on
line starting at 6 o'clock in the morning. If you're coming to
American you have to line up there,'' he said. ``Many students
might be there now getting ready to come to school here in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wanyange described Nairobi as a modern, growing city with
skyscrapers, office buildings, banks, restaurants and hotels. He
worried, though, about whether Nairobi officials would be able to
adequately respond to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've ever had to deal with something like
this before,'' said Wanyange, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Nguru said an area across the street from the U.S. Embassy has
an open air market where women sell vegetables and other street
vendors peddle T-shirts, music and other trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she rejoiced in the news that her father was alive, Emma
Mwangi worried about what Nairobi will be like when she returns
home next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Embassy was a fortress,'' she said. `` ... After
something like this, you ask yourself, what's the next target?

NEW U.N. PUSH TO URGE IRAQ TO COOPERATE WITH INSPECTORS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Diplomats from Security Council member
countries said Friday that countries friendly to Iraq were being
asked to try to persuade the government of President Saddam Hussein
to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors again in return for a new
hearing of the Iraqi case in New York.

<P>
   Both the Iraqis and the U.N. Special Commission, charged with
disarming Iraq and destroying its means of making weapons of mass
destruction, were operating in a low key Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance of long-term monitoring equipment by the commission,
known as Unscom, continued unimpeded in Iraq. No intrusive searches
were scheduled. There were reports Friday that the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for the nuclear weapons
file, may attempt an inspection on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Danilo Turk, representative of Slovenia and the
Security Council's president for August, told reporters that there
was no call in the council for action against Iraq as long as the
threat to end all cooperation with Unscom remained a threat. He
said a new look at sanctions was not out of the question if Iraq
reversed course and made real progress in arms inspections in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been situations when sanctions regimes have
changed,'' he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and
chief arms negotiator, could be invited to meet informally with the
Security Council to present Iraq's case.
</P>
<P>
   Council members agreed, however, that for the moment Iraq is in
violation of its agreements with the council and with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In March the council had warned of
``the severest consequences'' if Iraq broke the pledge made to
Annan in February to cooperate fully with Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's call on Thursday for a comprehensive
review of relations with Iraq came as a surprise to Security
Council members, diplomats who were at the meeting with Annan said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the last year has been spent reviewing various aspects
of the Iraqi situation and adjusting programs in the hope that
Saddam could be persuaded to be more cooperative with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have provided the weapons inspectors with virtually
no new material or answers to outstanding questions in that time.
They have only repeated their contention that there are no more
requirements to meet and that sanctions should be lifted
immediately. A complete embargo on trade with Iraq was imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several council members tried to elicit more information from
Annan before he left on a trip to Portugal. Diplomats said Friday
that he did not want to take the diplomatic initiative with Iraq
but hoped that the Security Council would give the Iraqis a hearing
soon .
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, who is completing his tenure as U.S.
representative to the United Nations before moving to Washington
next month as energy secretary, met with the secretary-general on
Thursday and was assured that Annan wanted to leave the Iraqi
problem in Security Council hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased that the secretary-general was so forceful in
his statement claiming that Iraq had repudiated its agreement with
the Security Council,'' Richardson said Friday in an interview.
``Our interpretation of the Security Council review that he called
for is for finding ways to make Iraq comply with the disarmament
and inspection provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say sanctions are killing Iraqis, especially
children, by depriving people of food and medicine. That contention
is gradually becoming less easy to defend as the United Nations
steps up aid.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions fuel protests, however. Volunteers from an
American group, Voices in the Wilderness, have been on a hunger
strike for more than a week outside the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations in New York. The group argues that continuing sanctions
indefinitely amounts to an American ``weapon of mass destruction''
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Bagdad Friday, a spokesman for the ``oil for food'' program
said that for the first time a full ration of basic food supplies
is available to every Iraqi. The spokesman, Eric Falt, also said
the program would be further expanded in September, when new money
comes in from a greatly expanded fund.
</P>
<P>
   The program began a year ago when Iraq was permitted to sell $2
billion in oil every six months to pay for urgent civilian needs.
The figure was raised to $5.2 billion by the Security Council in
February. Money to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait and other deductions are made from the fund,
leaving until now about $900 million available for food, medicines
and other goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   As of August, every Iraqi is eligible for a free monthly ration
of goods that includes 20 pounds of flour, 5.5 pounds of rice, 4.4
pounds of sugar, 2.2 pounds of legumes, about 6 pounds of baby
formula, several pounds of tea, cooking oil, salt, soap and
detergent. In September, Falt said, cereal, cheese and powdered
milk will be added to raise the protein level.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam resisted Security Council offers of an ``oil for food''
program for more than five years, before agreeing to the deal late
in 1996.

<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. _ A federal court that is hearing a challenge to
the Clinton administration's plans to use statistical sampling in
the next census homed in less on constitutional questions during
oral arguments Friday than on interpretation of a federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   The court, a special three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit, is
considering a case brought by a Republican congressman from
Georgia, a conservative law firm in Atlanta and several suburban
counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The plaintiffs say
sampling would defy both Article I of the Constitution, which
requires that the census be an ``actual enumeration,'' and the
federal statute that was debated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is similar to one brought by Speaker Newt Gingrich
before a special panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. That case was heard on June 11, and a
decision is imminent. Lawyers on both sides of the issue say they
expect that each case will ultimately be appealed to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes are large. Sampling should result in a
larger count of minority groups, many of whose members were missed
in the 1990 census. Because the census is used to apportion House
seats, and because minorities as a whole tend to vmte Democratic,
sampling could affect the power balance in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges typically prefer to resolve cases on a statutory
rather than constitutional basis, and at the hearing Friday the
panel focused its questions on interpretation of a 1976 law
governing how the decennial census should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that statute, federal law said that except for purposes
of apportionment, the secretary of commerce ``may'' use sampling to
help conduct the census. The 1976 law said that except for
apportionment, the secretary ``shall'' use sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and lawyers for congressional Democrats argue
that by changing sampling from an option to a mandate, Congress in
effect made it optional for apportionment purposes rather than
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that except for federal holidays, workers must
work from 9 to 5,'' said Paul Smith, who argued on behalf of the
House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri. ``That
doesn't mean you can't come into work on holidays if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Michael Carvin, the lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said a prohibition was nothing other than a
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that except for the wedding dress, you may take
all the clothes in the closet to the cleaners,'' Carvin told the
court. ``If you then change it to say except for the wedding dress
you must take all the clothes to the cleaners, you still can't take
the wedding dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans say that if the courts allow the
Census Bureau to use sampling under current law, they will move to
adopt legislation limiting it or altogether prohibiting it.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Census Bureau's proposal to count everyone in 90
percent of the households in each of the country's census tracts _
neighborhoods consisting of roughly 1,700 households each _ and
using the results of that count to determine the number and
characteristics of people living in the remaining 10 percent. The
bureau then wants to check its work, and possibly adjust its
counts, by conducting a nationwide survey of 750,000 households.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
(af) 
By SANA SIWOLOP  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the money poured into the shares of glossy new cyberspace
ventures lately, it is easy to overlook companies that are
exploiting more down-to-earth technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the companies that build or own transmission towers for
the rapidly expanding wireless communications business.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they may lack the new-kid-in-town sizzle of an Internet
software concern. But besides building or owning wireless
transmission towers, these companies often perform valuable
maintenance services for phone, cellular, paging and data
transmission companies. Investors have taken note.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the largest tower company, American Tower, went public
at $21 a share. Even in the face of the market's big drop last
week, the company's class A stock closed at $23 on Friday after
having traded as high as $28 on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Two other tower companies, Crown Castle International and
Pinnacle Tower, are expected to go public soon. At the end of July,
Crown nearly doubled the size of its offering; if it goes through
at its expected price of $18 a share, the offering would be one of
the largest of the year, with a market value of $1.76 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to see how antennae towers are showing up on
investors' radar.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices for wireless communications are attracting vast
numbers of consumers, which means that the wireless companies are
expanding their networks for sending and receiving data.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless industry has also turned far more competitive, and
wireless carriers have started improving their efficiency by either
selling their networks _ and then leasing them back _ or
establishing joint ventures with companies that will manage them.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of digital television is also benefiting the
antenna-tower industry, by increasing demand for new towers to
accommodate new digital transmission equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Miller, a broadcasting analyst at Bear, Stearns, which
helped take American Tower public, said the wireless industry
already was using 40,000 to 50,000 transmission towers in the
United States. Demand for towers to accommodate cellular and
personal communications services alone could raise that number
close to 100,000 by 2001, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, like several other analysts, said he expected the tower
industry to keep consolidating. The main reason is that no single
company owns more than 3 percent of the towers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American Tower owns or operates only about 1,900 towers,
while Crown Castle has 1,219. Specialty Teleconstructors, which
went public in 1994, has 801, and Pinnacle Holdings has 646.
</P>
<P>
   To some investors, so-called tower economics look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the towers are relatively inexpensive to build,
usually costing no more than $200,000 each. After the towers are
up, they tend to generate steady revenue, much of it from blue-chip
companies that often sign long-term contracts. These pacts usually
require payment in advance and contain built-in rent increases.
</P>
<P>
   Some tower management companies have amassed impressive lists of
customers. Crown Castle's clients, for example, include AT&AMP;T
Wireless, Bell Atlantic Mobile, Motorola, Pagenet and Sprint PCS.
Last year, the company acquired the domestic broadcast transmission
network of the British Broadcasting Corp. It is also pursuing
acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of early foothold in the international wireless market
distinguishes Crown Castle from American Tower, its nearest
competitor. But Crown is also carrying more debt than its rival
because of acquisitions over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 31, it had $437 million in debt, more than three
times as much as American Tower, although Crown's planned initial
offering could erase much of that debt.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Roth, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, an
initial-offering research firm in Greenwich, Conn., said Crown
Castle had enough cash flow to service the debt. But he said the
stock carried other risks. Because of the company's rapid
expansion, he said, ``it's hard to determine where their internal
growth ends and where their acquisition growth begins.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the company's ability to generate enough
cash flow will depend on how well it can compete with other bidders
for tower rights _ and on how customers rate the quality and
breadth of the company's network.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to breadth, American Tower may have a two-year
lead on its rivals, analysts said. It also appears to have a more
diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting for
more than 10 percent of the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, during the first three months of this year, BBC
accounted for about 46 percent of Crown Castle's revenue, while
Nextel Communications, its second-largest customer, accounted for
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of quick expansion is perhaps best seen in a
strategy change by Specialty Teleconstructors. It has been focused
on building and managing towers for other companies while others
were busy buying. Now the company is racing to catch up but has
found that the price of existing towers has become so expensive
that it is cheaper to build them.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in Specialty's business plan contributed to a 12
percent decline in revenue and a 53 percent decline in profits for
the nine months ended March 31, compared with the period a year
earlier. But the shift from just managing to owning could
eventually mean a stronger revenue stream for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty also expects to derive advantages from its acquisition
in April of another tower company, Omni-America Inc., which has
amassed marketing power with several wireless carriers, like
BellSouth, and which also recently received an investment windfall
from Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, the venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business is a great economic model on paper, but it's
very complex _ it's not as simple as `build a tower and they will
come,' '' said Carl E. Hirsch, the chief executive of OmniAmerica.
``It's about building carrier relationships. It's not just about
real estate.''

</P>
<P>
   INSTALLATION-ART (Undated) _ I still recall Gary Hill's
installation at Documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany, with pleasure, even
if it was a little hokey: in the middle of the show, his work was a
sanctuary behind blackout curtains, a long room of videotaped
images of people who seemed to emerge from the darkness like
ghosts, looking out at us, smiling, frowning or whatever, then
retreating as if in a dream. That was six years ago. Since then,
what was no longer uncommon even at that time has become so
commonplace that very often it has passed beyond cliche to parody:
installation art is in the late 90s roughly what Abstract
Expressionism was by the late 50s. By Michael Kimmelman. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROBBINS-FANCY-FREE (subslug) (Undated) _ Jerome Robbins was an
everyday presence in my dancegoing life from early on. I saw his
three sailors on the town in ``Fancy Free'' as a child shortly
after he created this ballet, his first, in 1944. It appealed to
children and grown-ups alike. Ballet had already seduced me with
Act II of ``Swan Lake.'' But ``Fancy Free,'' like all Robbins
works, opened a door. It let me know at a very young age that
ballet had a wide horizon and was not limited to a single type of
theatrical experience. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JEROME-ROBBINS-APPRAISAL (Undated) _ Celebrities from dance and
theater industry offer their assessment and stories of Jerome
Robbins, dancer and choreographer extraordinaire of ballets and
Broadway shows, who died  &QL; 
12 days ago. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HENSLEY-OKLAHOMA-MUSICAL (London) _ In a New York theater
climate that regularly welcomes Britons, famous or otherwise _
whether Ralph Fiennes or Eddie Izzard _ there is something
particularly gratifying about an American unknown causing a stir in
London. And a Georgia-born baritone named Shuler Hensley most
definitely is doing just that as the menacing Jud Fry in the Royal
National Theater's current revival of ``Oklahoma!'' By Matt Wolf.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER (subslug) (London) _ Any theater historian will
tell you that the 1943 ``Oklahoma!'' was crucial to the evolution
of the Broadway musical and, doing so, leave you wondering if you
honestly wish to see it revived. Trevor Nunn, the Royal National
Theater's director, is staging the Rodgers and Hammerstein's
musical in the Olivier auditorium this summer. By Benedict
Nightingale. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER-DESIGNERS (London) _ Anthony Ward and Mark
Thompson often have designed shows that opened during the same
season, and sometimes _ at the Royal Shakespeare Company in
Stratford-on-Avon, for instance _ even in the same week. But the
two men, who live together, concede that they found themselves in
an unusual situation last month: separately employed on competing
musicals, two of the season's biggest shows, and with back-to-back
opening nights. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AVENGERS-FILM (Undated) _ The great tragedy in the lives of men
of a certain age and outlook is that there is one, and only one,
Emma Peel. As embodied, quite literally and quite luminously, by
Diana Rigg in the arch 1960s spy-fi show ``The Avengers,'' she was
the first and arguably the last woman on television to combine
sensuality with ironic intellect. With the jury already Rigged, Uma
Thurman faces an impossible task portraying Emma Peel in the film
version of ``The Avengers'' opening on Friday. By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-CARTOONS (Prague, Czech Republic) _ At the height of the
cold war, hundreds of cartoons distributed in the United States
were actually made in Communist Czechoslovakia. Throughout the
1960s, episodes of ``Tom and Jerry,'' ``Popeye'' and ``Krazy Kat,''
as well as animated versions of classic children's books like
``Madeline'' and ``In the Night Kitchen,'' came into American
theaters, homes, schools and libraries straight from the animation
studios of Prague. By Jen Nessel.
</P>
<P>
   BEVERLY-HILLS-FILM (Los Angeles) _``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a
film that Ms. Tamara Jenkins wrote and directed, is a 70s-era tale
about the coming of age of 15-year-old Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha
Lyonne). In it, Vivian and her two brothers are being schlepped by
their 60-something father (Alan Arkin) from one thin-walled,
furniture-deprived domicile to the next, each barely within the
90210 ZIP code so as to afford them access to superior public
schools. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD-HEART-FILM (subslug) (Undated) _ When ``Dead Heart'' played
in Australia in 1996, Nicholas Parsons's film, about a highly
charged confrontation between white and aboriginal cultures at Wala
Wala, a remote settlement in the desert 50 miles west of Alice
Springs, was about to fade away from art houses when discussion of
it on a Sydney talk show helped extend its run to 20 weeks. In this
country, ``Dead Heart'' received favorable reviews but disappeared
quickly, in the manner of many good little films. Now it is back on
a videotape from Fox Lorber. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MCKAYLE-DANCE (Undated) _ The choreographer Donald McKayle can
be as difficult to locate as he is to classify. Instead of staying
in one place, he shuttles between New York and California. Rather
than create dances for just one medium, he regularly invents them
for Broadway, television, film and the concert stage. By Valerie
Gladstone. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PHRYGIAN-GATES-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may disturb the composer
John Adams that his operas have not been revived, as reported in
these pages, but there is a grain of consolation: ``Phrygian
Gates,'' a 20-year-old piano work by Adams, is apparently becoming
a favorite of new-music pianists. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FUTURISM-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Russian Futurism,'' five compact
disks in three packages from Arte Nova, appropriates a title to
which it may not be entitled. Futurism had a distinct time, place
and description, and none of the music offered here fits the last
two of these. The visual arts were futurism's focus; the musical
arm survives in accounts of it. Aside from an all but
undecipherable shellac record, this brief, brave movement came and
went, leaving only its ideas behind. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KARAJAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ In his heyday around 1960, Herbert von
Karajan seemed omnipresent in opera as well as concert, often
dubbed Generalmusikdirektor of Europe. Yet his postwar career
included the artistic direction of only one major opera house: the
Vienna State Opera, from 1957 to 1964. His tenure there became
legendary for artistic high points and equally for contentiousness,
an attribute long native to the institution and to its gossipy home
city. Until now, the sound of Karajan's Vienna performances has
been limited to pirate labels. But to commemorate the conductor's
90th birthday, last April, Deutsche Grammophon recently licensed
and issued four live recordings from those years, available in the
United States as special imports. By David Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   LATE-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ A short while ago I suggested
that an orchestra could operate for 10 years playing only music
written during the last three decades. That claim was meant to
indicate how much excellent music has been composed during this
time, not to put forward a real proposal for orchestral planning.
For one thing, homogeneous programs are generally less interesting
than mixed ones, which can put a new or recent piece into a useful
perspective. To hear Elliott Carter in the company of Bach, say, or
Steve Reich alongside Stravinsky, will shed light not only on the
newer music but also on the older. By Paul Griffith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of classical CDs:
Mozart: Piano Works.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE-STYLE-MUSIC (New York) _ The expression ``keeping it
real'' has become something of a mantra among the hip-hop set,
intended as an affirmation of one's cultural integrity. But this
notion of authenticity in contemporary popular music is hardly
restricted to hip-hop. Since the late 1980s, reality in music _
whether expressed through lyrical journalism, true-life confession
or strict stylistic adherence to one's heritage _ has become the
standard against which one's artistic integrity is measured. By
Mark Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONICA-MUSIC (Undated) _ Electronica makes use of samplers,
drum machine and synthesizers to make music that have little to do
with dancing and more to do with texture and patterns. Two new
albums, Plastikman's ``Consumed'' and Lithops' ``Uni Umit,'' hew to
electronica's definition. Both are hard to describe but remarkable,
proving that electronica is not as alienating or superficial as its
naysayers claim. By Sasha Frere-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ZAHA-HADID-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Zaha Hadid's design for the
Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati won't be officially unveiled
until this October, but surely I'm not the only one impatient for a
preview. And in fact the design is already far enough along to
praise Cincinnati for giving this remarkable architect her first
commission in the United States. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLATION-ART-COLLECTORS (subslug) (Undated) _ Some
contemporary art collectors are so unfazed by installation-size
works that they would very likely buy Uranus if they could get God

STARR TO FACE HEARING OVER `SERIOUS AND REPETITIVE' LEAKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has found enough ``serious and
repetitive'' leaks of secret grand jury information about the White
House sex scandal to warrant a hearing that could lead to penalties
against independent counsel Kenneth Starr or his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers made public Friday, U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson cites Starr's own comments in a magazine and in
television interviews, plus dozens of news articles and broadcasts
relying on anonymous sources, as evidence that prosecutors probably
violated grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were released by a three-judge federal appeals
panel that rejected Starr's effort to block an inquiry by Johnson
into the source of the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his staff must ``now come forward with evidence ... to
rebut inferences'' that his office was the source of dozens of news
articles and broadcasts containing grand jury information, said the
panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutors fail to satisfy Johnson that they were not
the sources of leaked grand jury information, they face penalties
ranging from civil contempt of court to referral to the Justice
Department for possible criminal charges. Federal law prohibits
prosecutors and grand jurors from disclosing matters before grand
juries.
</P>
<P>
   Starr downplayed the significance of Johnson's ruling saying
that leaks might have come from grand jury witnesses or their
lawyers, who are not bound by the secrecy rules that govern
prosecutors. Starr said his office did not violate the rules and
``we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact'' to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attorney David Kendall, who filed the initial complaint
accusing Starr of leaking information, hailed the appeals court
ruling. ``The endemic and casual disclosures of grand jury
information, which have characterized the past seven months of the
(Starr) investigation, are highly unprofessional and utterly
indefensible,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   While upholding Johnson's decision to investigate the leaks, the
appeals court ruled that she should conduct the review without
Clinton's attorneys present to avoid compromising Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which included sealed rulings by Johnson in late
June, were made public a day after Monica Lewinsky testified before
Starr's grand jury about a dozen sexual encounters with President
Clinton, many of them in his private office at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's account of an 18-month affair contradicts the
president's sworn denial that he and the former White House intern
ever engaged in sex. Clinton is scheduled to testify before the
grand jury by closed-circuit television Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The president avoided reporters' questions Friday about
Lewinsky's grand jury appearance, and a spokesman declined comment.
``The president, as he said last Friday, is not going to have any
comment on this situation between now and the 17th,'' said White
House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the president was asked Friday to delay the
swearing-in of U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson as Energy Secretary
until the Senate Energy Committee can clear up allegations that he
lied under oath regarding a job he offered Lewinsky a few weeks
before initial reports about the sex-and-perjury scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote Clinton
asking for the delay because of a published report that Richardson
misled committee members when he said during his confirmation
hearing that he was ready to hire Lewinsky for an opening on his
staff in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting documents and unidentified sources, the Washington Times
reported that Richardson did not have an opening in his New York
office in October when he offered Lewinsky the job. The offer was
made following an interview that was arranged at the behest of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Richardson was trying to accommodate
Lewinsky's desire to move to New York from Washington, where she
was working in a low-level public relations job at the Pentagon.
When the scandal broke in January, Richardson ``panicked,'' the
newspaper said, describing how he then ``scrambled to find a slot
that he could claim existed long before'' the interview with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say whether Ambassador Richardson lied under oath, as
this story asserts, but it is my responsibility to find out,''
Murkowski said in explaining why he wants to delay Richardson
taking the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has scheduled Richardson's swearing-in for early
September and Friday said there were no plans to delay the
ceremony. ``We know Bill Richardson will be a great Secretary of
Energy and we look forward to his swearing-in,'' said Jim Kennedy,
a spokesman for the White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson issued a statement standing by his July 22 testimony
and accused the newspaper of distorting facts. ``The position we
offered her was on the books before I became ambassador,''
Richardson said, adding that the opening was transferred from his
Washington office to New York ``before Ms. Lewinsky came on the
scene.''

COLOMBIA INSTALLS NEW PRESIDENT WHO PLANS TALKS WITH REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Andres Pastrana, a Conservative planning to
begin peace talks with increasingly aggressive rebels, took office
as president Friday, ending the scandal-ridden presidency of
Ernesto Samper by declaring, ``Change begins today.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's inauguration took place in a city fortified to
protect his 4,000 guests by as many police and military guards. He
was sworn in as the 60th president of Colombia 28 years after his
father, Misael Pastrana, now dead, took the same oath.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured by the pomp of the inauguration was the violence that
has been roiling the countryside in recent days, where explosions
and gunfights created a shattering soundtrack to the change of
power.
</P>
<P>
   With the country reeling financially, politically and socially,
the new president's first message pledged a complete turnaround in
government. He is taking over from a leader preoccupied with
holding on to power amid accusations from Washington that drug
dealers had bankrolled his election with $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's swearing in represented a vindication for Pastrana, 43,
who lost the election to Samper four years ago, and also for
Washington. Colombia supplies more than 70 percent of the cocaine
sold in the United States, and most of the heroin along the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana swept into office with the largest margin in his
country's history. A former senator and mayor of Bogota, he will
govern without a majority in Congress for his Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the country's finances in tatters, as his predecessor
carved up the government budget to buy allies to stay in office,
Pastrana promised an end to corruption, and said his administration
would be remembered as ``one of the cleanest in the history of
Colombia.'' It was Pastrana who blew the whistle on the Samper
campaign's ties to drug dealers, and on Friday he said, ``We cannot
go on tolerating the systematic theft of goods that belong to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the inauguration, guerrilla offensives
razed the main military and police bases for counter-narcotics
operations at Miraflores, killing and wounding scores of
Colombians, and bringing to 210 the number of security forces that
the rebels claim to hold captive.
</P>
<P>
   Though counter-drug operations out of Miraflores are heavily
financed by Washington, a State Department official said there were
no Americans at the bases. A newspaper report said the damage was
so bad after 13 hours of fighting that bodies were being recovered
by tractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked
the military and police installations with a force estimated at
1,200 men and women, and the smaller National Liberation Army
attacked petroleum installations and other targets this week. In
the city of La Uribe, fighting continued Friday, with bodies
scattered on sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning this week's violence directly, Pastrana
called on Colombians to support the peace efforts. He insisted that
only when the state quells the violence of drug gangs, right-wing
paramilitaries and leftist rebels can society begin to rebuild
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his election in June, Pastrana broke precedent by
meeting with FARC leaders, who represent the country's largest
insurgent group. After the secret encounter, he accepted rebel
demands that security forces temporarily evacuate five cities,
covering an area the size of Switzerland. The rebels had demanded
the evacuation as a condition of peace talks, which Pastrana
promised to begin in the first 90 days of his administration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though this week's rebel offensive was striking in several ways
_ in coordination, the weapons involved and the casualties _ it did
not prompt Colombians to back away from a prospective dialogue with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Few Colombians support the rebels, according to polls, and many
have concluded that government forces cannot defeat them. So they
have adopted the view that only a political solution can end the
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Rangel, a former security adviser to Samper, said the
rebels were flexing their muscles to improve their position at the
bargaining table. In an essay in the daily newspaper Tiempo, which
the FARC took the unusual step of putting on the Internet, Rangel
said that the insurgent group planned to grow from 65 to 100 combat
cells in the next five years, with 30,000 combatants, and that the
meeting with Pastrana raised them to a new level of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not stop their strategic plans because of a talk
with the president,'' Rangel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC rebels themselves, in a statement to the Columbian
station Radionet, said they had staged the offensive as a parting
shot at Samper. ``The violent and corrupt government of Samper is
responsible for this,'' said Alfonso Cano, a FARC leader.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We reiterate our willingness to begin talks once
areas have been demilitarized in order to reach an accord on
reconciliation and national reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, final address as president on Thursday night,
Samper reminded Colombians that he had once said he would leave the
Presidential Palace only with his ``head held high or dead.'' He
said, ``Tomorrow, I will do it in broad daylight with my conscience
calm. Seldom, in the history of this country, have so many
obstacles, internal and external, blocked the job of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Samper asked forgiveness ``for my mistakes and understanding for
the deficiencies of the government,'' but said he was ``always
inspired by the greater desire to serve my country.''

 &HT;    With one victory in hand, Dewine seeks Clinton signature on
second bill
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one bill signed by President Clinton and
another waiting in the wings, it's safe to say U.S. Sen. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, had a good week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Friday signed DeWine's Workforce Investment Act of
1998, a detailed restructuring of the country's job training
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The law lets states, local governments and individuals tailor
programs to fit their needs, and to make one-stop job centers like
Dayton's the gateway to training.
</P>
<P>
   The other bill, awaiting Clinton's signature, would speed the
release of U.S. government records of the Holocaust during World
War II and reveal just how much officials here knew about the Nazi
attempt to exterminate Jews, Gypsies and others.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, DeWine heard Clinton praise his workforce efforts.
``Today, we celebrate a big step forward in making sure every adult
can keep on learning for a lifetime,'' Clinton said at the White
House Rose Garden ceremony
</P>
<P>
   ``To invest in our people, we have to give all of our people
access to world class education and training. We have to do more
than we are already doing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine has called the bill a needed companion to the 1996
welfare reform, giving welfare recipients the training they need to
find jobs that pay well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, everyone must be given the competitive skills that
are necessary to prosper in the new global economy,'' DeWine said
at the ceremony. ``This is the crucial second stage of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, communities and local businesses will
develop a three-year job training strategy. Local governments can
pick programs that train workers for jobs in local industries and
businesses, and use local resources, such as a community college or
vocational school, to provide the training.
</P>
<P>
   A state's governor will review the plan, then send it to the
U.S. Secretary of Labor for final approval. States will get block
grants to pay for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also lets workers decide which training program they
want to use.
</P>
<P>
   Programs now will have to be accredited by the Labor Department
and give prospective students access to statistics showing how many
of the program's graduates have jobs and how much they earn.
</P>
<P>
   Job training programs will be linked to courses that provide
training for people with disabilities, allowing students to
transfer between the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each trainee will have an individual training account to use for
training programs. After the trainee and a job counselor decide on
a program, the trainee will get a voucher to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Harshaw, a spokesman for Montgomery County Department of
Human Services, said Dayton is one step ahead of the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we've been there, done that, bought the tee-shirt,''
Harshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton already has a one-stop job center and began working with
local businesses several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Harshaw said, the county's caseloads dropped and
fewer people are returning for a second or third round of training.

JUDGE SAYS STARR'S LEAKS MAY HAVE VIOLATED RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has found that prosecutors
investigating President Clinton's relationship with a former intern
may have violated federal rules by providing protected grand jury
testimony to journalists, according to court papers that were
unsealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare ray of good news for the White House, Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson declared that the independent prosecutor, Kenneth
Starr, may have broken the ethical code governing criminal
investigations, in his remarks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that Clinton's lawyers had compiled a persuasive list of
potential violations by Starr's office, she said in her ruling on
June 19 that the prosecutors now carry the burden of proof and must
demonstrate their innocence in a hearing to avoid contempt
citations and possible penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Starr appealed aspects of the ruling, delaying the hearing. On
Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals dealt a setback to Clinton. It
ruled that to prevent the disclosure of more secret information,
the president's lawyers could not question prosecutors themselves
during the hearing, nor subpoena documents, as Judge Johnson had
decreed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not address the substance of the
accusations against Starr. All the court motions and decisions
related to the appeal of Judge Johnson's ruling were released
Friday by the appeals court, the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has repeatedly denied that his office illegally slipped
grand jury secrets to reporters. Dozens of members of his office
submitted affidavits to the judge declaring that they had not
disclosed any protected information cited in a laundry list of news
articles and broadcasts compiled in February by David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But in an opinion crackling with anger, Judge Johnson swatted
aside the affidavits as defining the secrecy rules ``too
narrowly,'' and complained of ``the serious and repetitive nature''
of the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   She cited comments by Starr quoted in the magazine ``Brill's
Content'' that he and his deputy, Jackie Bennett, spoke anonymously
with reporters. She challenged his quoted assertion that it did not
violate federal rules to disclose what witnesses had told
prosecutors or federal agents before they testified.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson also wrote that in May, Starr publicly praised as
``magnificent'' a ruling by her against a White House claim of
executive privilege. The ruling was sealed, Judge Johnson said with
unmistakable scorn, so Starr's comment both confirmed its existence
and revealed that it was favorable to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confirming the existence and substance of a sealed court
ruling presents a prima facie violation'' of the rules, she wrote,
and ``a violation of the court order not to discuss the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Friday, Starr said that he would provide the
court with evidence to assure it ``that we are committed to an
investigation that is conducted thoroughly, fairly, professionally,
and in full compliance with the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when Starr began looking into whether Clinton
lied under oath in denying a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and tried to cover it up, the White House has complained
bitterly about press reports on the investigation's progress that
were based on anonymous sources. Fanning public suspicion of the
prosecutors, Clinton's advisers and lawyers have repeatedly accused
them of violating federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded by accusing the White House itself of
leaking the information to discredit the prosecutors. Under the
federal rules, witnesses before a grand jury may describe their
testimony, but prosecutors and others with direct access to it are
bound to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has put news organizations in a paradoxical
position. Besides the leakers themselves, reporters covering the
Lewinsky investigation are the only ones in Washington who know the
truth of the accusations against Starr. Yet because they have
guaranteed their sources anonymity in exchange for information,
they are unable to inform their readers, listeners or viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Judge Johnson cited news reports by several
organizations, including CBS News, the New York Daily News, and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson's June 19 ruling was sealed, so White House
lawyers and advisers say they have stayed silent about it to avoid
committing the very transgression that so irritated her. They were
as delighted on Friday at the unsealing of the documents as fidgety
children for whom the recess bell has finally rung.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the 20-year history of the Independent
Counsel Act, a federal court has found prima facie evidence of
potential criminal wrongdoing by an independent counsel,'' said
James Kennedy, a spokesman. It is unlikely but possible that a
judge who finds that prosecutors deliberately leaked grand jury
secrets could refer them for disbarment or perhaps even criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, the president's private lawyer, said in a statement:
``The endemic and casual disclosures of grand jury information
which have characterized the past seven months'' of the
investigation ``are highly unprofessional and utterly
indefensible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House was particularly pleased with Judge Johnson's
ruling because she has been widely perceived as favoring Starr,
having rejected repeated efforts by Clinton's lawyers to assert
various forms of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the documents followed by one day Ms. Lewinsky's
appearance before a grand jury, in which she contradicted a
previous sworn account and testified that she and the president had
had a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statement, Starr said that in prompting a hearing
Kendall had faced a ``minimal'' burden of proof of illegal leaks.
All he had to do was put together a list of articles and broadcasts
that referred to ``sources in Starr's office'' and made similar
attributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper articles and media reports supporting the allegation
may be capable of various interpretations,'' Starr said. ``They may
even be erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals on July 10, Clinton's
lawyers went so far to as to argue that the investigation of the
prosecutors was at least as important as the investigation of the
president. The prosecutors, they wrote, ``are public servants
endowed with extraordinary power to conduct a grand jury
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson had given permission to Clinton's lawyers to
question members of Starr's office about their contacts with the
press, with the discovery process to begin on July 11. But the
appeals court, which had previously blocked the discovery while it
weighed the case, found that this approach would improperly impede
Starr's investigation into the president ``at a crucial juncture,''
and also risk the same sort of disclosure of grand jury secrets
that started the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it ruled, Judge Johnson must conduct the hearing
herself. If she is not satisfied with Starr's argument for his
innocence, she may then take further steps, including appointing a
``special master or other individual'' to conduct a further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court wrote in its decision that charges of
violating grand jury secrecy were ``not to be taken lightly.'' It
quoted Justice Felix Frankfurter as saying that to have a
prosecutor feed reporters information is to turn the state ``into a
conscious participant in trial by newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr took no testimony Friday. But in a further sign that
Capitol Hill is girding for the eventual delivery of his report on
the Lewinsky matter, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee announced
that they had hired three more lawyers to serve on their
investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   They include Abbe Lowell, a Washington litigator and lecturer,
who will serve as chief investigative counsel; Lis Wiehl, a
prosecutor from Washington state; and Deborah Rhode, a professor of
law at Stanford University and legal columnist.

A BROTHER'S DEATH SHAPED TODD STOTTLEMYRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Todd Stottlemyre could pitch the Rangers to a
World Series championship, but he wouldn't consider that his most
fulfilling moment. If he someday won a Cy Young Award, threw a
perfect game, or was voted league most valuable player, those
wouldn't top his list, either.
</P>
<P>
   He will always reserve that spot for a more significant memory.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 years ago, Stottlemyre's attitude about life changed
forever when his 11-year-old brother, Jason, died of leukemia in a
Seattle hospital. Eight days before Jason died, Todd, then 15,
attempted to save his brother's life by undergoing a painful
bone-marrow transplant operation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the operation didn't succeed, Stottlemyre for years
partially blamed himself for Jason's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a hurt for a lot of years,'' he said. ``But I got
through that. As I look back on it now, it's my greatest
achievement in life, thinking that I laid it all on the line to try
to save my brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my biggest accomplishment, and it always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who joined the Rangers last week as part of a trade
with St. Louis that sent Darren Oliver and Fernando Tatis to the
Cardinals, has a reputation as a fierce competitor who doesn't know
how to quit. And at least part of that psychological makeup, he
says, is the result of lessons he learned while watching his
brother deal with a terminal illness. Stottlemyre's father, Mel,
won 164 games in a successful career as a pitcher for the New York
Yankees and is now the Yankees' pitching coach. Todd, who has a
career record of 119-106 with a 4.22 earned-run average, is part of
the only father-son combination to record more than 100
major-league victories each.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Mel Sr., also was a professional pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Todd says Jason might have been the best natural athlete of all
the Stottlemyres. But shortly after his seventh birthday, Jason
became ill over the holidays at the family home in Yakima, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas present we got was that he had leukemia,'' Todd
recalls. ``At the time, none of us knew what the heck leukemia was.
But we knew he was real sick.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next four years, the closely knit Stottlemyre clan
gained an unwelcome insight into the trauma that blood cancer can
cause an innocent child.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Jason went in and out of remission. Each time,
chemotherapy and radiation treatments made him sick and caused his
hair to fall out.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young guy, that was tough, but that was on a much lesser
note,'' Todd said. ``He would seem to be doing good, and all of a
sudden it would hit him again. We all researched it. I think even
Jason knew what was going on. They used to have these leukemia
cards in the restaurants, and he'd never pass one without filling
it up with quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   As the disease advanced, doctors advised that a bone-marrow
transplant would be Jason's only hope for a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were tested, and Todd's blood was found to be
nearly a perfect match. During the operation in February 1981,
surgeons made 500 injections into Todd's hips to remove marrow for
the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the transplant appeared to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running around the hospital and everything,'' Todd
said. ``But about seven or eight days after the transplant, he went
into a coma and he never made it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has replayed one scene thousands of times over in
his mind. He didn't have a driver's license, but with Jason's
heartbeat slowing and the end near, his parents asked him to drive
down the street to pick up his older brother and bring him to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As they hurried together down the hospital corridor toward
Jason's room, they were stopped by a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Did you hear?' And I said, `Yeah, his heartbeat has
slowed down.' And she said, `No, we lost him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, that's tough to think about. I mean, that was it.
That was the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he remembers ``verbally attacking'' the
attending physician, questioning him heatedly about what had gone
wrong with the transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of the loss of Jason, I carried with me for so long
that my blood wasn't good enough to save him. I almost felt
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day or so before he went into a coma, he wanted me to stay
overnight with him at the hospital. It was like he knew it was
coming. And yet he probably took it better than any of us. He just
took it all on. All the spinal taps and everything, his attitude
was, just bring it on. It was like he understood he was dying and
he was trying to make it better for everyone else. Watching an
11-year-old kid understand that is kind of hard to explain. How
could he be so grown up and so accepting of everything? It was
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Todd Stottlemyre has contributed greatly to medical
research seeking a cure for leukemia. He is host to a charity golf
tournament that has raised about $750,000 over six years.
</P>
<P>
   His father also is host to a benefit golf tournament in New
York. His mother, Jean, is active in the cause, as is his wife,
Sheri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy for a long time,'' Stottlemyre said. ``But
now the whole event is an inspiration on how to lead my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved everything that God gave him, the animals, the
outdoors. Every time I see a butterfly, I think of Jason running
with a net trying to chase it down and going back and looking at
his book to see exactly what kind of butterfly it was. I know it
sounds corny, but every time I see a frog, I think of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so full of life, and yet knowing everything. He never
felt sorry for himself that he had leukemia. He never asked why. He
just battled it. To courageously take on a devastating disease that
is the No. 1 child killer in this country, and to be so positive,
to me that's everything to learn from.
</P>
<P>
   ``For being here such a short time, he was such an inspiration.
My greatest teacher in life has been my little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who was the popular ace of the St. Louis staff and
previously played in Toronto and Oakland, was brought in as a
``hired gun'' of sorts, to help shore up the struggling Texas
pitching rotation for a late-summer playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   He takes baseball and his role seriously, he said, because he is
competitive by nature, but also because he feels a debt to
management and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do everything I can to prepare for the game, and to accept
my role and live up to it,'' he said. ``But when I think about
Jason and I think about baseball and look at it on the grand scope
of events, it's kind of meaningless, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try and teach my daughter (3-year-old Rachel)
those things that I've gone through and learned. That's a huge
responsibility. But I think it's good sometimes that people are
aware there are other things more important than throwing a 3-2
slider out there trying to get somebody out. There are other things
to fight for.''

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Two massive bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania late Friday
morning, killing at least 80 people, eight of them American, in
what U.S. officials said were coordinated terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, an enormous explosion ripped through downtown at
about 10:35 a.m., turning the busy Haile Selassie Avenue into a
scene of carnage and destruction that left more than 1,600 people
injured and dozens still missing long after night fell.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which leveled a three-story building containing a
secretarial school and gutted the rear half of the U.S. Embassy
next door, dismembered more than a dozen people passing on foot and
incinerated dozens of others in their seats in three nearby buses.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before, a bomb reportedly planted in a gasoline
tanker detonated near the front entrance of the U.S. Embassy in the
Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam. The blast destroyed the front
of the building and toppled a side wall, throwing charred debris
down the street, setting cars on fire and toppling trees. At least
seven people were killed and 72 injured, none of them American,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they believed the bombings were a terrorist
attack. Although officials did not identify any suspects, the
newspaper Al-Hayat _ based in Cairo, Egypt _ reported in its
Saturday editions that it had received a call claiming
responsibility for the bombings from a previously unknown group
called the Liberation Army of the Islamic Sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton condemned the attacks as
abhorrent and inhuman acts of cowardice. He vowed to bring those
responsible to justice ``no matter what or how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombings underscored how vulnerable American officials and
diplomats remain in some Third World capitals in this age of global
terrorism, where borders are porous and security is not as tight as
in the industrialized world. The blasts seemed to be coordinated
attacks against the United States, and appeared unconnected to any
local grievances or political currents in the two capitals, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight Americans and an unknown number of Kenyan embassy
employees died in the explosion in Nairobi, which left embassy
offices a honeycomb of burned-out rubble with bodies buried inside.
``It's going to take a couple of days to find out what's in
there,'' Bill Barr, an embassy spokesman, said. Barr said 15 U.S.
officials were hospitalized and six others were still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the explosion, which shattered windows for
several blocks and blew the roof off a building across the street,
was preceded by a smaller blast, perhaps a grenade. Both appeared
to emanate from a parking lot just behind the embassy, the police
said. Hundreds of people were cut by falling glass and ran bleeding
from the area, flooding local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real national disaster and we highly suspect it is a
terrorist attack,'' Otieno Osur, the director of police operations
in Nairobi, said.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, rescue workers and soldiers in Nairobi toiled
under floodlights with backhoes to extricate dozens of bodies still
buried in the rubble of the Ufundi House behind the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In Dar es Salaam, embassy officials said they did not know who
was behind the bombing. ``At this point only several hours after
the bombing we have no idea what the motives of the bombers were,''
John Lange, the deputy chief of mission at the embassy, told
Reuters. `` All we know is that an explosion occurred right in
front of our embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been threatened by at least two terrorist
groups in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Egypt's banned Jihad group warned that it
would retaliate against U.S. targets because of Washington's role
in pressing for the extradition of three suspected terrorists from
Albania to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a Saudi Arabian fundamentalist, Osama bin Laden,
identified by the U.S. State Department as a sponsor of terrorism,
also urged his followers to wage an Islamic holy war against the
United States. Bin Laden, who is believed to be in exile in
Afghanistan, is not only a suspect in the 1996 attack at Khobar but
also in the 1995 car bombing in Riyadh that killed five Americans.
He is also believed to have links to the Jihad movement in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But no firm evidence has yet emerged linking either group to
Friday's bombings, the Kenyan police and U.S. officials said.
Washington has dispatched a special team from the FBI to assist the
local police with the investigation. Kenyan investigators said late
Friday night on state-run television that they suspect that a van
full of explosives was parked behind the embassy in front of the
Ufundi House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the injured in Nairobi was the U.S. ambassador, Prudence
Bushnell, who suffered cuts from falling glass. She was meeting
with a Kenyan minister in a building adjacent to the embassy when
the explosion occurred, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of scenes of horror and confusion in the Kenyan
capital after the bomb exploded. A thick plume of smoke rose
hundreds of feet into the air, followed by a rain of glass and
metal, several witnesses said. The blast left a black crater in the
parking lot between the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ufundi Co-op House, which houses a secretarial college and
offices, collapsed inward on itself, trapping scores of people. The
reinforced embassy building remained standing and most of the 200
people inside walked out, but its rear offices were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Three buses on the avenue outside were destroyed and several
cars were left twisted hunks of blackened metal. The dismembered
bodies of at least fifteen people were found on the street near the
blast site. People began crawling over the mountain of cement and
steel that had been the Ufundi House, clawing at the debris to free
people trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, hundreds of office workers poured out of nearby
buildings, many of them lacerated by rubble and glass. More than
1,000 people were treated at local hospitals, hospital officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most witnesses said they heard two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a small blast and I thought something had just dropped
on the roof,'' said Zachariah Chianda, a 44-year-old banker, who
was next door in the Cooperative Bank Building. ``Then the next
thing we heard was a big blast. Everything was falling down. I
found myself on the floor. People were screaming and some people
were trapped in the elevators. We tried to get people out. There
was glass and metal all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Kiiru, a 31-year-old bank employee, was in a
second-floor computer room of the Cooperative Bank Building when
the explosion rocked the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw things flying all over the place and computers blowing
up,'' he said. ``We made our way outside. It was horrific. There
was a lot of smoke. It was like a fog. We couldn't see beyond 2
feet. Then we saw there was blood all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency room at The Nairobi Hospital, the walking
wounded sat in dazed rows, trying to come to terms with what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice Ngeru, a 23-year-old secretary, said she had gone to
her window after she heard the first explosion, which sounded like
a gunshot. Her window in the Solar Building looked across the
street at the U.S. Embassy. Seconds later, the window exploded,
raking her arms, face and chest with glass. ``There was a loud bang
and there was smoke all over,'' she said. ``The glass hit me. It
shattered all the glass in our building.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's three main hospitals were overwhelmed with a flood of
patients, the authorities said. Blood was in short supply, and the
authorities issued an urgent appeal for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people in blood-soaked clothes, their faces raked with
cuts, sat in hospital corridors, while overworked physicians tried
to treat the most seriously injured. Nurses and volunteers stitched
wounds of others in hallways and in the open air.
</P>
<P>
   Outside The Nairobi Hospital, crowds of people looking for
friends and relatives gathered around the lists taped to the walls
showing those who had been admitted with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Vincent Mengo, a 27-year-old street vendor, sat in the
emergency room, his left hand and arm bandaged in bloody gauze. He
had narrowly escaped death, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mengo said he was walking along the avenue near the Ufundi
building when he heard the first explosion in the parking lot
behind the U.S. Embassy. He ducked into the Cooperative Bank
Building, thinking it was a gunshot. Then the world outside
exploded in smoke and fire.
</P>
<P>
   With local hospitals stretched to their limit, the United States
dispatched military cargo planes from Germany with loads of
medicine and hospital equipment, including mobile operating
theaters, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The special FBI team also departed Washington for Africa. The
bureau has been involved for two years with the Saudi Arabian
authorities in the investigation of the June 1996 car-bomb blast
that killed 19 U.S. soldiers in their barracks in the town of
Khobar.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, rescue workers continued to attack the
mountain of debris with pickaxes, searching for survivors. At 10
p.m., four people were discovered alive in an elevator, but they
had yet to be pulled to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes of finding others alive in the wreckage were dimming.
``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under the
rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' a Red
Cross spokeswoman, Nina Galbe, told The Associated Press. ``The
longer they're trapped, the less their chances for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers used backhoes and bulldozers to move the mountain
of debris. Two rescue workers carried out the shredded body of a
young woman on a stretcher and laid her in the back of a pickup.
Stretchers were laid out in rows for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a school here, a college for girls,'' said Paul
Harrison, a 33-year-old Red Cross volunteer who had pulled three
bodies from the rubble. ``It's horrible. I've never seen anything
like it. This reminds me of Beirut, or the Oklahoma bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the darkened embassy, U.S. marines in full battle
gear stood guard, wide-eyed and battle-bright, guns in combat
position, as night fell. They were guarding a disaster site, but
there were still several bodies of American officials and embassy
employees inside, waiting to be transported to a mortuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two explosions, that's all I know,'' said Gunnery
Sgt. Gary Cross, who was in a stairwell when the bomb went off.
``The whole building started shaking and stuff started falling.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant looked above him at the shattered windows of the
embassy. Someone had propped an American flag out of one of them,
presumably to replace the one that usually flies above the
building. The banner hung limp in the dimming light _ forlorn,
soiled, defiant.

SERGEANT PLANNED TO MAKE THE ARMY HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 27-year-old career Army sergeant who grew up partly in the
small Missouri town where President Harry S. Truman was born and
who served in the Persian Gulf War, was identified by the Defense
Department late Friday as one of the eight Americans killed in the
terrorist explosion that tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   While State Department officials declined to release the names
of any of the dead pending the notification of their families, the
Pentagon said that one of the victims _ the only military service
member killed in the blast _ was Sgt. Kenneth R. Hobson II, a
clerical aide to the embassy's defense attache.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who grew up mostly in Nevada, Mo., but who spent time in
nearby Lamar, the Truman birthplace near Missouri's western border
where his parents and a great aunt reside, had been in the Army
since 1989, and was posted to Nairobi last winter for a two-year
tour of duty. He took along his wife, Deborah, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Meghan.
</P>
<P>
   In Lamar, a community of 4,000 people, the sergeant's father,
Kenneth Hobson Sr., a Vietnam War veteran, and mother, Bonnie,
declined a request for a telephone interview Friday night. Hazel
Hicks, the sergeant's great aunt, said the parents had been swamped
and exhausted by the local news media and would say no more before
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But a neighbor and family friend, Leona Doyle, 72, said she had
known the sergeant since he was a boy, and she recalled a strong,
popular youth.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Tahoe, Calif., on May 1, 1971, he was brought to
Missouri at an early age by his family and attended schools in
Lamar and Nevada, towns about 25 miles apart near Missouri's
western border with Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to friends as Kenny Ray, Mrs. Doyle said, and he
grew into a strapping 6-foot athlete with close-cropped dark blond
hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes. She said he played
basketball at high school in Nevada, graduating in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff William Griffitt of Barton County also knew Hobson
through his father, a communications officer for the Sheriff's
Department, and the sergeant's wife, a former secretary for the
department. Griffitt said the youth had enlisted in the Army in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   After basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., he spent time in
a variety of posts, including stations in Germany, in the Persian
Gulf during the 1991 conflict with Iraq, at Fort Campbell, Ky., and
in Monterrey, Calif., where he was trained in the Arabic language
for translation work. He also completed military intelligence
training at Ft. Gordon, Ga., and in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, a native of Maine, who was also an Army
enlisted woman. After their daughter was born, Hobson was posted to
Washington to complete his military intelligence training, and his
wife and child moved in with the sergeant's parents until the
posting to Kenya last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Doyle, who lives two doors from the Hobson family, said the
sergeant loved the Army, and spoke often of being ``proud to be an
American.'' She said he had intended to make a career of military
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loving boy, a very caring boy and such a family
man,'' Mrs. Doyle said in a voice that broke with emotion. ``He
loved his country and his home, and we are all shocked that he's
not coming home. It's a complete shock to the community that
something like this has happened to a Lamar boy.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The deadly terrorism that struck U.S. embassies in Africa on
Friday stunned Americans. It came as an unwelcome reminder that, in
a terrorist's eyes, the world's most powerful country remains the
world's No. 1 target. American embassies everywhere will need to be
provided with the highest possible standards of physical security.
</P>
<P>
   The car-bomb attacks in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, some 450 miles apart, killed about 80 people and injured
more than 1,000. At least seven of those killed in Nairobi were
American Foreign Service officials, while several other Americans
there are still missing. The largest number of victims were Kenyans
who had been working in an office building next to the American
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   These were the worst attacks on American government
installations since a truck bomb tore apart the Khobar Towers
military apartments in Saudi Arabia more than two years ago. But
100 or so less spectacular acts of international terrorism were
directed against Americans last year, killing seven and injuring
21.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing certain is yet known about who planted the bombs that
exploded on Friday. But the fact that the two embassies were
attacked almost simultaneously, with powerful explosives, in
countries that are not known for popular hostility to the United
States suggests a coordinated assault, possibly with the direction
and assistance of a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sent criminal investigators and counterterrorism
specialists from the State and Defense departments and the FBI to
learn more about how the blasts occurred and to aid in the search
for evidence and suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They will need to determine whether the two embassy buildings,
both built before the wave of terrorism against American embassies
in the early 1980s, had been hardened against attack by reinforcing
the building facades, coating the glass with plastic film to
prevent shattering, and extending perimeter security as far as
practical in a crowded urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   America and other countries have made modest progress in curbing
international terrorism, in part by putting pressure on nations
like Libya, Syria and Iran that have supported terrorist activity
in the past. But as Friday's attacks make uncomfortably clear,
terrorism, both freelance and government-supported, is far from
defeated, and American embassies remain vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic outposts of a democracy cannot be made into
indestructible fortresses. But Washington is obliged to make them
as secure as possible for those who work and do business there and
for their neighbors as well.

FAA ORDERS INSPECTION OF 747 CENTER FUEL TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration Friday ordered the immediate
inspection of the center fuel tanks of all Boeing 747s after the
agency received reports that worn tank parts found recently in two
jumbo jets could result in fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,100 of the planes operating throughout the world are
affected, but only 300 U.S.-registered 747s would have to be
inspected as part of the FAA's airworthinesses directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not corrected, the condition could result in fire or
explosion in the fuel tank during dry operation,'' the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The directive is another in a series involving the safety of the
747's fuel system that have been issued since TWA Flight 800 blew
up in the evening sky off Long Island, N.Y., in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the center tank of the TWA 747-400 was empty, the parts
involved in the FAA directive were recovered from the ocean after
the crash and were not found to be in a worn condition, the safety
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The center fuel tank parts in question are the inlet check
values and the jettison fuel pumps, which remove fuel from tanks.
The check valve has a flap which opens and closes as fuel is
removed. A part called an adapter goes into the pump and opens that
flap.
</P>
<P>
   Until inspections can be performed, the FAA ordered 747
operators to keep about 7,000 pounds of fuel in the tanks, which
would be enough to cover the parts in question.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said all the actions ordered Friday by the
FAA had been previously recommended this year by the company in the
form of service alert bulletins to 747 operators. The FAA directive
makes action mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent inspection of the fuel system on a 747, the
operator discovered that the inlet adapters of the jettison pumps
in the center tank were worn, the FAA said. Two of the adapters had
worn down enough to cause damage to another metal part. The inlet
check valves also had significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   Another 747 operator reported damage to the inlet adapter that
was so severe contact had occurred between the steel disk of the
inlet check value and the steel screw that holds another metal part
in place, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The worn and damaged conditions, which probably were caused by
vibration, could spark an explosion if the tank were empty and
contained vapors, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of 747s in the U.S. fleet must perform the fuel tank
inspections before planes accumulate 10,000 hours of time in
service or within 90 days, whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FAA ordered that within two weeks certain 747
flight manuals must be revised to alert flightcrews about the
dangers of operating jettison pumps without the 7,000 pounds of
fuel in the center tank, pending inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost to comply with the directive would be about
$216,000 for the entire U.S. fleet, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action stems from the investigation into the TWA crash,
which killed all 230 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have
determined that the center fuel tank exploded but they still do not
know what triggered the blast. One theory being investigated is
that electricity from wiring around the Boeing 747's center fuel
tank could have sparked the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, both Boeing and the FAA have issued service
bulletins and airworthiness directives to conduct inspections, or
to eliminate potential ignition sources in other Boeing aircraft
such as the 737 that have fuel systems similar to the 747.

GALAXY SEEKS FIRST WIN OVER FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With one skid finally over, the Los Angeles Galaxy will look to
end another this afternoon when it visits the Chicago Fire in a
battle of the top two teams in Major League Soccer's Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (17-6, 49 points) -- which made a trade Friday to
bolster its defensive depth -- halted a three-game slide and broke
out of an offensive slump with a 6-1 romp Wednesday night at
Colorado; they seek their first win in three tries against Chicago,
which used stingy defense to shut down L.A.'s freewheeling attack
twice in May, the Galaxy's first two losses this season.
</P>
<P>
   It could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   The last defeat, a 2-1 shootout decision on May 30, led to L.A.
coach Octavio Zambrano's complaint that Chicago (13-9, 37) employed
an overly defensive style and played ``not to lose.'' The Fire
wasn't amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players read the comments he made after the game and were
very angry ...,'' Chicago coach Bob Bradley said at the time. ``I
could care less what Octavio says or thinks, but our players were
very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it on Friday, Bradley carefully considered his
words. ``We are proud of the team we have, proud of the way we play
...,'' he said. ``I think there are probably a lot of players that
haven't forgotten what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   How many of them will be on the field is another matter. Three
players, including MLS MVP candidate Peter Nowak and starting
defender Andrew Lewis, are out with injuries, another half-dozen
are ailing, and another (defender Diego Gutierrez) is suspended.
The Fire is 0-5 this season without Nowak and has lost its last
four MLS matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, who on Wednesday regained the fluidity that drove
their attack earlier this season, gets defender Robin Fraser back
from a one-game red-card suspension. It will be L.A.'s first game
against Jorge Campos, its former goalkeeper now with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. helped its depth Friday by trading reserve forward Harut
Karapetyan to San Jose for injured utility player Lawrence Lozzano,
a scrappy forward equally at ease in midfield or defense.
</P>
<P>
   Karapetyan, who had requested a trade, started 45 games and
totaled 14 goals and 10 assists in his first two seasons with the
Galaxy but has made only three starts in 1998. He's played in 15
games and scored four goals, three on a five-minute hat trick --
the fastest in MLS history -- June 4 at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Lozzano, a Cerritos native who will join L.A. on Monday, started
31 games primarily as a defender with Dallas in 1996, then had 10
goals and 10 assists in 29 games as a forward with San Jose last
season. A hamstring injury has limited his time with the Clash this
season: He's played in only 12 games, none since June 11, and has
four goals.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once the envy of fund-raisers of all faiths, the United Jewish
Appeal and the Council of Jewish Federations were unrivaled
philanthropic powerhouses among American and Canadian Jews, many of
whom viewed them as central to any charitable work done on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing about Jewish life is so simple today. Jews are
sharply divided over questions as basic as who can call themselves
Jewish. And these days, Israel, the historic focus of the groups'
charity, is as often a divisive force as a galvanizing one.
</P>
<P>
   So splits have developed in how big donors want their money to
be spent. On a blank check to Israel? On strengthening Jewish
commitment in the United States? Sometimes, it seems that the only
thing the big givers have in common is an intense desire for
hands-on control of their charitable dollars.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that while the UJA and the Jewish
federations still raise well over $1 billion each year, they now
struggle to persuade Jews _ younger ones, especially _ that the
organizations are as relevant today as they were during the
Holocaust or Israel's pioneer days.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, leaders of the groups have stumbled in
their efforts to address these challenges. But now they say they
have a plan.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last month outside Chicago, the UJA and the
federations that make up the council reached an agreement in
principle to merge. The terms of the deal shift power over spending
abroad to the grass roots. Donors in local communities will have
more say over where the dollars sent to Israel should be spent and
whether a bigger share of funds should go to Jewish
community-building at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The groups already have close links and recently combined
offices in New York. But while they still must work out many of the
crucial details and while they have failed to merge in the past,
leaders at both the national and local levels say there is a fresh
commitment to join forces.
</P>
<P>
   Their hope is that the new group will be able to raise more
money and appeal to more donors because it ``will cast a broader
net and engage more people,'' said Carole A. Solomon, the national
volunteer chairwoman of the United Jewish Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the system is owned by these various communities, they
should feel very comfortable at the end of the day,'' Ms. Solomon
added, emphasizing that the merged entity ``will be leaner and
meaner and more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders also say they cannot afford to fail. ``There is
too much at stake for it not to work,'' said Bennett L. Aaron, the
chairman of the United Israel Appeal, which oversees the money that
the United Jewish Appeal raises for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The local federations have been pushing hardest for change.
``The system requires an influx of new energy,'' said Barry Shrage,
the full-time president of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies in
Boston, one of the 187 community organizations in the United States
and Canada that make up the Council of Jewish Federations and that
are responsible for local charity and for raising money to send
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Shrage told his fellow federation leaders in December that he
believed ``our current system is in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving to the groups' combined annual campaign, which raises
funds that are not designated for specific projects, has fallen to
around $800 million in 1996 from a peak of $825 million in 1990. In
that period, Americans' individual charitable donations over all
climbed 26 percent, according to ``Giving USA,'' an annual report
on philanthropy by an arm of the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reinvent the North American system of Jewish
philanthropy was reached in early July, at a meeting of more than
140 Jewish leaders in Oakbrook, Ill. The leaders say they intend to
hammer out details of the merger in coming months, with a goal of
creating the new organization by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is considerable. The debate about how Jews should
undertake their religious obligation of tikkun olam, Hebrew for the
repair of the world, has caused big divisions. The new organization
will need to develop a message that resonates broadly enough to
overcome such differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its success will depend not only on its ability to restructure
and streamline and coordinate, but depend on its ability to lead
American Jews to greater consensus,'' said Jack Wertheimer, the
provost of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Conservative
movement's rabbinical academy in New York, and an expert on Jewish
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, powerful philanthropists with very strong views on
Jewish communal life are dubious that much can be gained by simply
merging the United Jewish Appeal and the federations. ``The problem
is that they are both sick, and bringing them together will not
make them better,'' said Edgar M. Bronfman, the chairman of the
Seagram Co. and a prominent Jewish philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, who as president of the World Jewish Congress has been
a leader in efforts to seek compensation from Switzerland for
Holocaust survivors, said the United Jewish Appeal-federation
system should concentrate more on stopping the ``outflow of Jews''
from Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real agenda of Jewish life is to stop or curb
assimilation,'' Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   Created nearly 60 years ago in response to Kristallnacht, the
1938 Nazi rampage, the United Jewish Appeal enjoyed tremendous
support from American Jews, who rallied together to rescue Jews
around the world and to help build a new Jewish state. But as the
number of Jews seeking asylum falls and as Israel celebrates its
50th anniversary as a stronger and more controversial country, many
American Jews find these goals less compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The federation movement, which grew out of the communal needs of
North American Jews in the late 19th century, has traditionally
balanced the desire to give locally with support for overseas
causes. That dual purpose has always been somewhat in conflict with
the aim of the United Jewish Appeal, an advocate for Israel and
Jews abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has sharpened as the federations search for new
ways to persuade their communities to give. It is becoming ``less
meaningful to wrap Jewish philanthropy around certain flag-waving
issues,'' said Stephen H. Hoffman, executive vice president of the
Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the UJA and the federations conduct a
unified fund-raising campaign for both local and overseas needs.
Indeed, many Jews _ their contact with the groups limited to
receiving fund-raising appeals _ would be surprised to learn that
they were not already a single organization.
</P>
<P>
   The federations have always had complete say over how the local
money is spent and what portion of locally raised funds will go to
programs outside North America. That money is divided under a fixed
formula between the Jewish Agency for Israel, an Israeli group that
has an annual budget of about $350 million, and the American Jewish
Joint Distribution Committee, with a budget of about $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Donors still respond to emergencies. Operation Exodus, for
example, the campaign in the early 1990s to help relocate Jews from
the former Soviet Union, raised roughly $1 billion. But the general
campaign seems less compelling to a new generation of Jewish
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents and their generation were genetically coded to give
to the United Jewish Appeal and federation,'' said James S. Tisch,
the president of the Loews Corp. ``It was lost in my generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisch now heads the UJA-Federation of New York. His father,
Laurence, Loews's co-chief executive, and his mother, Wilma, have
long been powers in Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving to the annual joint campaign, Jews are giving
to competing Jewish charities and their synagogues as well as to
secular causes, which are courting Jewish philanthropists more
aggressively than they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this shift reflects a widespread desire by donors to
give less to umbrella organizations, whether to the United Way or
the UJA. Donors want to be able to follow their gifts more closely
by giving to specific causes or creating their own private
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Money to donor-advised funds and foundations represented about a
third of the $1.6 billion raised by the federations in 1996,
according to the Council of Jewish Federations. The remaining money
was for the federations' own endowments or for special campaigns
like Operation Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline also reflects a growing perception that the UJA
and the federations are not keeping up with the times.
</P>
<P>
   Among liberal Jews, organizations like the New Israel Fund, a
Washington group created in 1979 to focus on issues like religious
pluralism and democracy in Israel, are increasingly popular, though
they are still tiny compared with the Jewish Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tradition-minded, money is flowing to Orthodox
yeshivas and hospitals as well as directly to religious parties in
Israel, according to Wertheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Giving donors more say, through the federations, is at the heart
of the push for change. ``Federations have had to recognize the
pressure they feel from their own donors,'' said Bernard C.
Moscovitz, executive vice president of the UJA. ``They want more
control of the goings-on of the national organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the national groups and the local
federations _ which clearly disagree about how much the current
system needs to change _ can reach an agreement. ``I hope the
cynics and optimists can get together,'' said Richard L. Wexler, a
Chicago lawyer who serves as the volunteer president of the United
Jewish Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Central to their disagreement is whether the emphasis on
providing funds for Israel ignores other needs, like Jewish
education in America.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Daniel R. Allen, the executive vice chairman of the United
Israel Appeal, said that if the system did not keep Israel ``front
and center,'' it would be a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Rukin, the volunteer chairman of the Boston
federation, wants the new group to address issues in North America,
especially the development of Jewish community. ``We need to build
a new set of relationships with Israel,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others question the role of the Jewish Agency for Israel, which
recently underwent a big reorganization in response to criticisms
that it had a bloated bureaucracy that was addled by cronyism. Some
officials of the federations say the agency is still too
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   To help reach some consensus, the federations and the national
groups will very likely conduct a formal review of the work now
being done overseas. But exactly how much say the federations _ and
their big local givers _ should have in determining the new group's
priorities is also the subject of vigorous debate.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, for one, does not want the system to become ``donor
driven,'' arguing that would not be ``in the best interest of the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the federations have already refused to guarantee that
they will continue to finance overseas programs at a certain level.
In fact, earlier merger talks ended two years ago because the local
groups would not make that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, some national leaders say they are willing
to move ahead. ``I think it is time we trusted the federations,''
said Wexler of the UJA. ``Let's have the debate and let's see it
play out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little to lose. Despite the existing system's goal of
having the federations act in concert, many local groups are
already going their own ways because they feel excluded from the
process. They are undertaking overseas projects that they think
will more closely tie their communities to others in Israel or the
former Soviet Union, and many are giving small sums to
organizations like the New Israel Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland federation, for example, last year withheld $3
million of the money it normally sends to the UJA to pursue its own
ideas about how to help Jews around the world, despite vehement
protests from national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the real work _ convincing Jews that they should
give to help Jews in Prague as well as in Brooklyn _ remains to be
done at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   ``These machinations, among these national organizations, are
the interest of insiders,'' said James Tisch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people say the plan to join forces is an
unparalleled opportunity for American and Canadian Jews to
collaborate on encouraging Judaism to flourish here as well as
abroad. ``The future is going to be created no matter what,'' said
Shrage of Boston, who is fond of telling the Purim story of Queen
Esther, who must decide whether to risk angering the king in order
to save the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have choices to make,'' he said. ``This is a time for
potential renaissance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenya and Tanzania are more often the stuff of TV travelogues. A
lure for tourists from around the world, both can boast spectacular
scenery, abundant wildlife and friendly people.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist attacks are virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted experts on East Africa to suggest Friday that the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam,
the Tanzanian capital, were attacked because they were easy
targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with Tanzania are considered excellent, the
specialists noted. U.S.-Kenyan ties have been strained in recent
years because of endemic corruption and a reluctance of President
Daniel arap Moi to ease his tight grip on power. But both the
government and opposition groups curry favor with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can eat my words tomorrow, but I would be willing to predict
with 99 percent certainty that the only association these attacks
have to Kenya and Tanzania is that these embassies were vulnerable
targets,'' said Africa historian Tim Burke of Swarthmore College in
Swarthmore, Pa. Burke visited Nairobi in March.
</P>
<P>
   Cited as factors that would make it easier for terrorists to
carry out attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam:
</P>
<P>
   Direct air links from both capitals with Europe, the Middle
East, South Asia and other major African cities.
</P>
<P>
   Good communications between Nairobi, on a mile-high African
plateau, and Dar es Salaam, a port city on the Indian Ocean, 450
miles to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The relative ease with which explosives could be smuggled across
borders by bribing customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nairobi and Dar es Salaam are the crossroads of the West and
the Middle East _ just three or four hours by air to Tehran,
Baghdad, or Saudi Arabia,'' said political scientist Michael Chege,
Kenya-born director of the African Studies Center at the University
of Florida at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenya and Tanzania are the soft underbelly of Western
influence in the region, and that makes them very, very
vulnerable,'' Chege said. When a terrorist can no longer slip
easily into ``Europe, Israel or New York's World Trade Center,
where does he go?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenya is not a country without problems. It has a high crime
rate, is notorious for official corruption and has seen some civil
unrest. Nevertheless, the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, as well as the
one in Dar es Salaam, were considered to be at little risk from the
local populations.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies were less fortified than those in such African
capitals as Lagos, Nigeria, and Harare, Zimbabwe, said Joel Barkan,
a political scientist at the University of Iowa and a senior fellow
at the U.S. Peace Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's blast in Nairobi is the first major bombing in the
Kenyan capital since New Year's Eve 1980, when a bomb exploded in
the landmark Norfolk Hotel, killing 15 and wounding 80. At the
time, Kenyan authorities identified as a suspect a Moroccan aligned
with a Palestinian liberation group, theorizing that he targeted
the hotel because it was owned by a locally prominent Jewish
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there's never been an incident like this in
Tanzania, and it's been only the second in Nairobi after nearly a
two-decade hiatus,'' Barkan said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive device detonated after Nairobi's morning rush
hour, but the sidewalks were clogged with people lining up for
visas outside the U.S. Embassy and to enter nearby banks, one by
one, because of a bank workers' strike that began Monday, said
Chege, who returned from the Kenyan capital this week.
</P>
<P>
   There were far fewer casualties in the Dar es Salaam blast,
apparently because the embassy is not downtown, but in a less
congested, suburban area called Oyster Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Like other specialists, Barkan said he doubts that the
terrorists came from Kenya or Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   If another country in the region is suspect, he said, Sudan is
the most likely. Sudan, which borders Kenya on the northwest, has
butted heads with the United States by supporting Ugandan rebels,
by launching incursions into Eritrea and Ethiopia, and because of
its human-rights abuses against the southern Sudanese Christian
minority, Barkan said.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are neighbors and were both once ruled by the
British, Tanzania and Kenya had radically different colonial
experiences and took different paths after independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In colonial Kenya, the British encouraged European settlement.
The mainly pastoral, indigenous African population was transformed
into a work force through a ``hut'' tax, loss of ancestral lands
and a lack of educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mau Mau uprising, dominated by the Kikuyu tribe that lived
in the ``white'' highlands, helped pressure London to relinquish
the colony, although African fatalities far outnumbered those of
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania was called Tanganyika before a 1964 merger with the
island nation of Zanzibar. The mainland portion was colonized as
German East Africa in the late 19th century but was not
``pacified'' until German troops brutally crushed a grassroots
uprising known as the Maji Maji rebellion. The colony became a
British mandate after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Both neighbors began independent rule with single-party
political systems, which, however, veered in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya charted a capitalist course and aligned itself with the
West. U.S. naval ships were allowed use of Kenya's Indian Ocean
port at Mombasa, and the nation received a considerable amount of
foreign aid in return.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Tanzania embraced what its first leader, Julius
Nyerere, called ``African socialism.'' This entailed nationalizing
industry and large agricultural estates while pursuing a nonaligned
foreign policy. Nyerere's socialist economics led to disaster,
although his social and educational programs are generally seen as
successful.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cold War, the United States began pressuring Moi, the
Kenyan president, to democratize the political system, free
political prisoners, curb corruption and end government connivance
behind ethnic violence. Moi, Kenya's president for 20 years, is
considered one of the continent's most oppressive leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has become symbolic of Kenyans'
democratic aspirations since a former ambassador, Smith Hempstone,
publicly condemned corruption and human rights abuses by Moi early
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the Kenyan people would be the last to want to see that
building blown up,'' Chege said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight years, American aid has dropped by two-thirds,
from roughly $60 million to $20 million. The IMF suspended $200
million in aid a year ago, and other major donors have frozen their
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition sees the United States as a force to pressure
Moi to hold free elections,'' said Thomas R. Gregori, a University
of Houston economist who returned from Africa last week. ``Moi is
not happy with the pressure, but his lifeline is to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Nyerere's successors, Tanzania has embraced sweeping
economic reforms and encouraged multiparty politics. But experts
fear that the new material successes, however modest at present,
are beginning to fuel corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tanzania's economy is not as large as Kenya's, it has
been growing faster under its new reformist president, Benjamin
Mkapa. Moreover, Tanzania has never experienced the bloody ethnic
clashes that have recently shaken Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Amnesty International called Kenya a ``powder keg
waiting to explode,'' although the description has been used by
others for years. (Editor's note: Star-Telegram writer Barry
Shlachter covered Kenya and Tanzania as an Associated Press
correspondent from 1982 to 1985.}

MIXING RELIGION AND POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 BY PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, the newly selected Democratic standard-bearer
in the Michigan governor's race, is the latest candidate to portray
himself as an ``anti-politician.'' In some respects that claim may
be debatable, but when it comes to his statements about religion,
it is certainly true.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians generally avoid religious controversy. But in his
role as lawyer and champion of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the advocate and
practitioner of assisted suicide, Fieger has called Adam Cardinal
Maida, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Detroit, a ``nut,''
compared the Council of Orthodox Rabbis of Greater Detroit to
Nazis, described the pope with mocking vulgarities, said that he
would rather take advice from ``Joe the wino,'' and that Jesus was
``just some goofball that got nailed to the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Are those flip comments from a vigorous advocate or obnoxious
bigotry _ and a serious problem for the Michigan Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   And does it make any difference that Fieger is, in fact, an
equal-opportunity insulter, who has been throwing his
expletive-laden, scorched-earth denunciations in every direction
for years? (He has repeatedly described Gov. John Engler, a
Republican, as ``the product of miscegenation between barnyard
animals and human beings'' and said of the governor's children that
``unless they have corkscrew tails, those kids are not his.'')
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to his office Friday brought a promise to relay
a request for comment to Fieger, who was on a trip to Washington,
and at least a response from an aide. There was no response.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger has said that a report in The Washington Post about the
Jesus remark was ``a lie'' and that Engler used it ``to inspire a
little religious bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a tape made by the reporter, Richard Leiby, shows that while
speculating on how religious beliefs emerge, Fieger compared the
belief that Jesus is divine to the cult of Elvis Presley. ``In 2000
years we've probably made somebody who is the equivalent of Elvis
into God, so I see no reason why not to believe that in 2000 years
Elvis will be God'' Fieger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably if we went back 2000 years,'' he continued, ``and
they said, you know, we think Jesus is God, and Jesus is just some
goofball that got nailed to the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The context includes a Lenny Bruce-like riff on how weird it is
for Christians to wear crosses, preceded by a bitter reflection on
humanity: ``You couldn't develop a virus that kills as many people
as we do and destroys as many things as we do. We're just a
pestilence with appendages.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments about the archbishop came two year ago, when Fieger
was asked why Kevorkian had sought a permit to carry a concealed
weapon. One reason, the lawyer quipped, ``was to protect himself
from nuts like Cardinal Maida.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger compared the Orthodox rabbis to Nazis in early 1996 when
they issued a statement condemning assisted suicide as a violation
of Jewish teaching. ``They're closer to Nazis than they think they
are,'' he told The Detroit News. ``Orthodox Jews are not different
than the right-wing Christian nuts. If you're a religious nut,
you're a religious nut.''
</P>
<P>
   George Cantor, a columnist and editorial writer at The Detroit
News, responded in a column that confessed personal ambivalence
about the assisted suicide question but not about Fieger's
evocation of Nazism, which Rabbi Elimelech Silberberg, of
Congregation Bais Chabad in West Bloomfield, said this week had
never been retracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Louis Farrakhan or a Pat Buchanan had said something even
approaching this degree of calumny,'' Cantor wrote, ``Jewish
organizations would be hopping up and down in outrage. And
deservedly so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rabbis,'' he wrote, ``were doing what is their right,
their duty, in a pluralistic democracy. They presented their side
of a highly controversial and politicized issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger says he is not a member of any religious group, but is
ready to ``keep all my options open.'' On his Web site, he says ``I
have no difficulty with the unfettered practice of religious
beliefs,'' but do not want them incorporated into law.
</P>
<P>
   He does not explain why he admires the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s religiously based political activity, but calls
Catholic, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Muslim and
Jewish opponents of assisted suicide in Michigan ``religious
fanatics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the giants of American politics fell well outside
conventional beliefs. Abraham Lincoln belonged to no church and
held troubled and uncertain religious views that are still debated
by historians, but he has also been called one of the nation's most
profound religious thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson was a deist who deeply distrusted religious
leaders, was denounced as an atheist by his political enemies and
yet attended religious services regularly and treasured his own
rationalist version of Jesus as a sublime ethical teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Mark Brewer, the chairman of the state Democratic
Party, said, ``I don't pretend to be an expert about everything
Fieger has said about religion, but my sense is that voters here
are mainly concerned about bread-and-butter issues of state
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Michigan, Fieger has not usually been described as
``hard-line'' or ``extremist'' _ adjectives generally reserved for
public figures associated with the religious right _ but as
``flamboyant'' and ``populist.'' Of the flamboyance, there can be
no doubt, and if a genius for invective qualifies a
multimillionaire lawyer from one of Detroit's wealthiest suburban
areas as a populist, then that is accurate, also _ as it must be
for Farrakhan and Buchanan as well.
</P>
<P>
   But populism or not, a lot of Democrats who feel that their
religious traditions demand at least a minimum of respect are going
to be pondering Fieger's candidacy long and hard _ and not just in
Michigan.

EMBASSIES MAY HAVE BEEN THE EASIEST TARGETS
</HEADLINE>
 THERE?-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenya and Tanzania are more often the stuff of TV travelogues. A
lure for tourists from around the world, both can boast spectacular
scenery, abundant wildlife and friendly people.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist attacks are virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted experts on East Africa to suggest Friday that the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam,
the Tanzanian capital, were attacked because they were easy
targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with Tanzania are considered excellent, the
specialists noted. U.S.-Kenyan ties have been strained in recent
years because of endemic corruption and a reluctance of President
Daniel arap Moi to ease his tight grip on power. But both the
government and opposition groups curry favor with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can eat my words tomorrow, but I would be willing to predict
with 99 percent certainty that the only association these attacks
have to Kenya and Tanzania is that these embassies were vulnerable
targets,'' said Africa historian Tim Burke of Swarthmore College in
Swarthmore, Pa. Burke visited Nairobi in March.
</P>
<P>
   Cited as factors that would make it easier for terrorists to
carry out attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam:
</P>
<P>
   Direct air links from both capitals with Europe, the Middle
East, South Asia and other major African cities.
</P>
<P>
   Good communications between Nairobi, on a mile-high African
plateau, and Dar es Salaam, a port city on the Indian Ocean, 450
miles to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The relative ease with which explosives could be smuggled across
borders by bribing customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nairobi and Dar es Salaam are the crossroads of the West and
the Middle East _ just three or four hours by air to Tehran,
Baghdad, or Saudi Arabia,'' said political scientist Michael Chege,
Kenya-born director of the African Studies Center at the University
of Florida at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenya and Tanzania are the soft underbelly of Western
influence in the region, and that makes them very, very
vulnerable,'' Chege said. When a terrorist can no longer slip
easily into ``Europe, Israel or New York's World Trade Center,
where does he go?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenya is not a country without problems. It has a high crime
rate, is notorious for official corruption and has seen some civil
unrest. Nevertheless, the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, as well as the
one in Dar es Salaam, were considered to be at little risk from the
local populations.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies were less fortified than those in such African
capitals as Lagos, Nigeria, and Harare, Zimbabwe, said Joel Barkan,
a political scientist at the University of Iowa and a senior fellow
at the U.S. Peace Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's blast in Nairobi is the first major bombing in the
Kenyan capital since New Year's Eve 1980, when a bomb exploded in
the landmark Norfolk Hotel, killing 15 and wounding 80. At the
time, Kenyan authorities identified as a suspect a Moroccan aligned
with a Palestinian liberation group, theorizing that he targeted
the hotel because it was owned by a locally prominent Jewish
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there's never been an incident like this in
Tanzania, and it's been only the second in Nairobi after nearly a
two-decade hiatus,'' Barkan said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive device detonated after Nairobi's morning rush
hour, but the sidewalks were clogged with people lining up for
visas outside the U.S. Embassy and to enter nearby banks, one by
one, because of a bank workers' strike that began Monday, said
Chege, who returned from the Kenyan capital this week.
</P>
<P>
   There were far fewer casualties in the Dar es Salaam blast,
apparently because the embassy is not downtown, but in a less
congested, suburban area called Oyster Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Like other specialists, Barkan said he doubts that the
terrorists came from Kenya or Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   If another country in the region is suspect, he said, Sudan is
the most likely. Sudan, which borders Kenya on the northwest, has
butted heads with the United States by supporting Ugandan rebels,
by launching incursions into Eritrea and Ethiopia, and because of
its human-rights abuses against the southern Sudanese Christian
minority, Barkan said.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are neighbors and were both once ruled by the
British, Tanzania and Kenya had radically different colonial
experiences and took different paths after independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In colonial Kenya, the British encouraged European settlement.
The mainly pastoral, indigenous African population was transformed
into a work force through a ``hut'' tax, loss of ancestral lands
and a lack of educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mau Mau uprising, dominated by the Kikuyu tribe that lived
in the ``white'' highlands, helped pressure London to relinquish
the colony, although African fatalities far outnumbered those of
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania was called Tanganyika before a 1964 merger with the
island nation of Zanzibar. The mainland portion was colonized as
German East Africa in the late 19th century but was not
``pacified'' until German troops brutally crushed a grassroots
uprising known as the Maji Maji rebellion. The colony became a
British mandate after World War I.
</P>

   Both neighbors began independent rule with single-party
political systems, which, however, veered in different directions.

from roughly $60 million to $20 million. The IMF suspended $200

RUMOR ABOUT CONDIT TAKES ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What started out as a rumor that heads are about to
roll at Boeing _ namely Chairman Phil Condit's _ has taken on a
life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boeing's corporate telephone lines were ringing off the hook
Friday with people from all across the country _ everyone from the
news media to shareholders to factory workers _ asking: Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   _ Some Wall Street analysts even suggested the news contributed
to yesterday's sharp rise in Boeing stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boeing factory workers from Wichita, Kan., to Everett were
placing bets on which executive would be first out the door and how
much the stock would rise after they left.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday an e-mail called ``Grape Vine News'' began
circulating throughout Boeing. By Thursday, it had made the rounds
from Boeing factories in Wichita to St. Louis to Renton and landed
on the Internet where analysts and shareholders caught wind of it.
By Friday, it reached the computers of Condit and Boeing President
Harry Stonecipher.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing officials refused to acknowledge the rumors earlier
in the week, Friday they flatly denied them. Stonecipher even sent
his own electronic-mail response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better get yourself a new grapevine because the one you
have is seriously flawed and useless,'' Stonecipher wrote. ``It is
wrong on all counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the ``Grape Vine News'' read: ``Phil Condit will be
stepping down and Harry Stonecipher will be taking over the company
... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron Woodard (president of Boeing's commercial division) is
fired and Alan Mulally (head of the company's defense and space
operations) will be coming back from the military division to take
Ron's spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing usually doesn't comment on rumors but the company made an
exception Friday because they had created such a frenzy across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all silliness that started on the Internet,'' Boeing
spokesman Larry McCracken said. ``It is completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The management shuffle _ which if true, would be among the
biggest corporate shakeups in history _ reportedly is to be
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all should help the stock price,'' the e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching its lowest level in more than two years this
week, Boeing's stock rose $2.19 a share in heavy trading Friday to
close at $39.25. But analysts were split as to whether the Boeing
rumor mill created the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rumor were confirmed, there's a chance the stock would
go up,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet with JSA Research. ``The company
has not performed well and if Stonecipher were to take over, it
would be well received because everywhere he's gone it's been good
for stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Campbell with Lehman Brothers in New York said the rumors
could have contributed to the stock rise but said that doesn't
necessarily mean investors want Condit out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said shareholders could have been reacting to what
they think is a proactive Boeing board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the supposed departure of someone but more
that it would be neat to know they (board of directors) are on the
ball and doing something,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts have been calling for management changes at
Boeing, many say the recent rumors don't appear to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't image the board is upset enough with Condit at this
point to force him out,'' Campbell said. ``It's highly unlikely
that he would step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been struggling with commercial aircraft production
problems and has paid the price with more than $3 billion in
writeoffs. In addition, the company reported its first annual
operational loss in 50 years last year and has shown weak quarterly
results since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the senior executives at Boeing have taken their
spears,'' Campbell said. ``The company needs these guys to fix this
stuff.''

VIRUS RESEARCH LAB MAY BE BUILT IN GALVESTON

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Plans for a laboratory to study some of the
most deadly viruses in the world have been laid at the University
of Texas Medical Branch campus in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the University of Texas Regents in November and
built on schedule, the ultra-secure ``Biosafety Level 4 Facility''
would be one of only about a dozen such laboratories in the world.
Unlike others, however, it would specialize in research on viruses
in the Southern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean basin and
Central and South America, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed laboratory, which scientists say would be similar
to that depicted in the 1995 movie ``Outbreak,'' would be the first
of its kind at a U.S. medical university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really put us way out in front, not just on the
edge,'' said Dr. Adrian S. Perachio, UTMB's new associate vice
president for basic research. ``We would be the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who expect to work in the lab say they believe the
long-term study of known and yet-to-be discovered viruses will save
many lives and could prevent an epidemic like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time, maybe around mid-century, that there was
this sort of implicit notion that the age of the plagues was behind
us,'' Perachio said. ``Then came AIDS. We don't want to be behind
the curve like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the laboratory, expected to open in 2002, were
announced Friday by UTMB President Dr. John Stobo. He said a
world-renowned team of tropical-disease research experts has been
recruited since UTMB became home to the World Health Organization's
Center for Tropical Diseases in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for that group to remain on the cutting edge of what
they do, it's necessary for us to build a new facility which allows
them to work with these new and emerging infections in an
environment that is safe and protective for them as well as the
rest of the community,'' Stobo said.
</P>
<P>
   While fewer than a dozen researchers would have direct access to
the laboratory core, where dangerous viruses would be stored,
scientists said work there would open the way for collaborative
work with scientists on campuses throughout Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After only four years in operation, the Center for Tropical
Diseases is bringing $7 million in research money to the campus
annually. Grant money is expected to increase greatly if the
virulent-virus research lab opens.
</P>
<P>
   Among the researchers who would use the facility are Dr. Robert
Tesch and Dr. Robert Shope, who came from Yale University and
brought one of the most extensive collections of virus cultures in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers would study known viruses and look for unknown
ones, mainly in tropical and subtropical environments and in animal
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope of the project, from the beginning, is to describe
that a bug is there, to decide whether it affects humans, what kind
of disease to expect, and then, obviously, to move into therapy and
prevention,'' said Dr. Charles F. ``Chuck'' Fulhorst, another
virologist who would use the proposed lab.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of the proposed lab is pegged at $5 million to $7.5
million, much of which is expected to come from grants and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a May 1999 request for construction authorization
from the UT Board of Regents and a July 1999 review of the medical
school's application for construction by the Texas Higher Education
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory would be just blocks from homes in the city's
East End Historical District, an area of restored Victorian-era
homes where Stobo himself lives.
</P>
<P>
   But planners said they believe the facility's virus storage
areas will be as secure as those at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta and in two other Biosafety Level 4
laboratories operated by the Department of Defense and the National
Institutes of Health, in Frederick and Bethesda, Md., respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a submarine locked within a vault,'' Dr. David H.
Walker, UTMB pathology department chairman and Center for Tropical
Diseases director, told several hundred people who attended a
campus ``town meeting'' Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is designed with containment within
containment,'' Perachio said. ``For human entry, there are multiple
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a hurricane threatens,'' he said, ``you're talking about an
hour to an hour and a half in order to be able to shut down the
laboratory and harness everything in there that possibly could be
infectious in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for researchers to see or treat people
suffering from exotic or highly contagious deadly diseases at the
facility, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB executives also said researchers at the planned laboratory
would not duplicate work at the federal labs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than conduct long-term research, the CDC spends much of
its resources reacting to emergency situations such as the 1993
outbreak of deadly hantavirus in the southwestern United States,
Fulhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't commit to a long-term research program,'' he said.
``They did a great job in identifying the population at risk and
things like that. But, essentially, there have been no advances
made in therapy, and a regional institution like ours can fill in
that gap.''

 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard D. Nanula is not in the middle of changing jobs and
moving, he likes to unwind by watching five television sets at
once, using a customized touch pad to change chan- nels quickly and
adjust the sound. Oh, and he some- times reads at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a multiprocessor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And listening to Mr. Nanula, 38, talk about his life is also
like watching several channels at once.
</P>
<P>
   There he is at the  &UR; Walt Disney  &LR; Company &UR; ,  &LR; which hired him out
of Harvard Business School 12 years ago and named him chief
financial officer at the age of 31. He quickly made his mark,
negotiating long and hard to get the troubled Euro Disney theme
park on firmer financial footing, handling more than $1 bil- lion
of financing for Disney films and issuing rare 100-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is pursuing his second career as one of the world's
greatest sports fans. He once moved intensive business negotiations
to the Super Bowl so he wouldn't miss the game. When he learned
that Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers cen-
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  ter, had moved into his Beverly Hills
neighborhood last summer, Mr. Nanula got his wish for a pick-up
game with him.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is again, in a T-shirt, sunglasses and a baseball
cap, on the back cover of the menu at the recently opened ESPN Zone
restaurant in Balti- more. The restaurant is a Disney property, and
executives who knew of Mr. Nanula's passion for sports agreed that
he should be the poster boy for serious fandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite things I've ever done,'' Mr. Nanula
said of the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mr. Nanula (pronounced na-NOO-lah) faces perhaps the hardest
thing he's ever done, taking over as chief executive of  &UR; Starwood
Hotels  &LR;   &UR; and Resorts Worldwide,  &LR; the world's largest hotel
company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his challenge. By acquiring Westin Hotels and ITT,
Starwood has become, in a way, a $16 billion start-up. And Mr.
Nanula, who became its chief on June 1, must now assemble a team to
run Starwood's many distinct parts _ including the Caesars World
casinos and the company's Sheraton and luxury hotels _ and assemble
three companies  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  into one at its new
headquarters in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs, he is using the compa- ny's size to renegotiate
contracts for its 650 hotels on everything from mattresses to
shrimp to long-dis- tance service. He hopes to raise reve- nues by,
among other things, stitch- ing together reservation systems and
frequent-guest programs.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Starwood is growing, with 125,000 employees and
$1 billion of projects in the pipeline, and it is starting a new
brand, W Hotels, to compete in the so-called boutique hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   Lest Mr. Nanula's job grow too dull, he must also develop a new
corporate structure for Starwood, which recently lost a battle with
Con- gress and the White House to extend the tax advantages of its
unusual corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price, mean- while, has sagged, along with
others in the lodging industry; Starwood shares have fallen 5.7
percent over the last year, better than the 6.4 percent drop in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange index of real es- tate investment
trusts but well below the 16.7 percent gain in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anyone has tried to pull off what we're doing
here,'' Mr. Nanula said during three hours of interviews squeezed
into his sched- ule. ``It is a big and interesting chal- lenge.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; gfda,3 &LR;  LSO at stake is the reputation of Barry S. Sternlicht, a
long- time friend of Mr. Nanula. Mr. Sternlicht, who is 37, built
Star-H wood at breakneck speed and is now its chairman, but he
acknowledges that he lacks the operational skills to make it all
work. Mr. Nanula's ef- forts will go a long way toward deter-
mining whether Mr. Sternlicht will be regarded in coming years as a
savvy deal maker or as someone who paid too much to create an
unwieldy corporate giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see today is a company operating on 2 of its 12
cylinders,'' Mr. Sternlicht said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people on Wall Street are betting that Mr. Nanula can make
Starwood hum, though no one mini- mizes the enormity of his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Richard Nanula to have left his job at Disney says a lot
about what he believes is the potential for Starwood,'' said Jason
N. Ader, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. ``But he's got to focus to
manage the assimila- tion process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula's route to Starwood can be traced, in part, to his
pen- chant for juggling several tasks.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day at Harvard, in 1984, he took a seat in the
lecture hall at the end of the last row _ or ``skydeck,'' as the
students called it _ so he could read newspapers and magazines or
do course work when class discussions bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Two seats away sat Mr. Sternlicht, another multitasker. ``I'm
really good at doodling and listening at the same time, which
drives people cra- zy because they don't think I'm lis- tening,''
he explained recently.
</P>
<P>
   The two had pursued different aca- demic interests. Mr.
Sternlicht was a liberal arts major at Brown Univer- sity in a
program called Law and Society (or ``Lost in Society,'' as he
called it). Mr. Nanula studied eco- nomics at the University of
Califor- nia at Santa Barbara and was a certified public
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; gfdb,3 &LR;  UT the men soon found com- mon ground. They spent L many
Sunday afternoons L watching football together. During intramural
basketball games, Mr. Sternlicht played point guard, often setting
up Mr. Nanula, who is said to have a pretty good outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sternlicht also helped Mr. Nanula land his first job. In
their second year, Mr. Sternlicht organ- ized a field study project
at Disney, in part because he had a good contact there, but also
because Disney was far away from the chilly Northeast. He recruited
four classmates, includ- ing Mr. Nanula, to study the feasibil- ity
of a new theme-park attraction of mini-factories showing how things
like bread and cheese are made.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula made a quick impres- sion on Disney executives and
was hired into the strategic planning de- partment even before the
students made their final presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sternlicht was not jealous, he said, because he preferred to
work in a smaller company. ``I didn't like hierarchy,'' he said.
``My goal was to do deals, to learn to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula, though, was drawn to the breadth and complexity of a
large corporation. He was also fol- lowing in the footsteps of his
father, who had run companies that made products ranging from
cooling tow- ers to automatic sprinkler systems (and, on occasion,
was known to read a book in front of the TV).
</P>
<P>
   Though fast friends, Mr. Nanula and Mr. Sternlicht assumed that
they would never work together. But they soon found themselves
sitting across from each other at a negotiating table. Mr.
Sternlicht landed a job at  &UR; -------------------- &LR;   &UR; JMB Realty  &LR; in
Chicago, and he and Mr. Nanula haggled over the sale to JMB of the
real estate assets of Disney's Arvida subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed in touch _ Mr. Nan-H ula sometimes called Mr.
Sternlicht to needle him about the California weather _ and they
often went on vacations and attended the N.C.A.A. Final Four
together. But their career paths were very different.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sternlicht's trajectory dipped sharply early on. He led a
team that analyzed the finances of Randsworth Trust P.L.C., a
British real estate company, before JMB and some American pension
funds bought it in 1989. Randsworth collapsed two L years later,
for a loss of more than $425 million. Mr. Sternlicht has said he
was made the scapegoat for the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But failure, he said, ``teaches you intellectual discipline and
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after he left JMB, Mr. Sternlicht started Starwood
Capital with investments from the Ziff pub- lishing family and
others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Starwood, named for the community near Aspen, Colo.,
where it was assembled, bought its first hotels. The company took
off in 1995, when it acquired Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate
investment trust and standard operating company that traded as a
single stock _ a so- called paired-share or stapled REIT.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with its special structure, Starwood stormed the industry,
ac- quiring properties and companies that today give it hotels or
casinos in 70 countries. For most of that time, Starwood's stock
has performed well, far surpassing the average for hotel companies
and REIT's. It has risen 284 percent in the last three and a half
years, despite its recent drop.
</P>
<P>
   At Disney, meanwhile, Mr. Nanula rose quickly. As chief
financial offi- cer, he not only handled the negotia- tions over
Euro Disney, now known as Disneyland Paris, but also re- vamped the
way Disney financed its films, making the terms not quite so
favorable to outside investors. He learned Disney's businesses,
from theme parks to films to retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula also picked up a few things that would come in handy
at Starwood. For one thing, Disney has about 25,000 hotel rooms.
And Mr. Nanula has some familiarity with casinos, having made
regular trips with friends to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; gfda,3 &LR;  S chief financial officer, Mr. Nanula was known to push
colleagues time and again for more analysis to back up recommen-
dations to invest in new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good in a company where risk is part of the
culture, but where you have to manage risk in a conservative
fashion,'' Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said in a recent
interview. ``He has pretty good antennae for spotting problems in
advance of everyone else.''
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Mr. Eisner made Mr. Nanula pres- ident of the
company's Disney Store Worldwide unit in November 1994 to give him
operating experience. With- out it, Mr. Eisner said, ``he wouldn't
have been able to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Nanula's replacement as chief financial officer,
Stephen P. Bollenbach, left in early 1996 to be- come chief
executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, Mr. Eisner L named Mr.
Nanula to the job again, to help integrate Disney's $19 billion
acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula's accounting for the purchase was questioned in a
lengthy article in Barron's in March of this year; it said Disney
had created an undisclosed reserve of as much as $2.5 billion to
absorb expenses relat- ed to the merger without reducing its
reported earnings. When asked L about this, Mr. Nanula said,
``Nobody who was up on accounting standards ever questioned the
accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Mr. Nanula im- mersed himself in the life of a
Disney executive. He stared down the diffi- cult decision of which
character's costume to wear for a stroll through Disney World as
part of a theme- park orientation. (He chose Tigger,
Winnie-the-Pooh's sidekick). He met his future wife at Disney _
Tracey Hart, an executive assistant in stra- tegic planning.
</P>
<P>
   And his wealth rose. The 1997 Dis- ney proxy said Mr. Nanula was
paid a salary of $632,692, plus a $1.3 mil- lion bonus. His
exercisable options had gained about $15 million in value. Options
that he lost upon leaving the company were worth an additional
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  $30 million or so.
</P>
<P>
   (Starwood has not released details of Mr. Nanula's pay package,
includ- ing the degree to which he was com- pensated for what he
gave up, though he has invested about $500,000 in Starwood stock.
Besides nurturing his own holdings, Mr. Nanula will now play an
important role in sus- taining his friend's wealth; Mr. Sternlicht
owns Starwood stock L worth about $400 million, plus op- tions
worth $80 million at the end of last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives grew to rely on Mr. Nanula to add levity to
meetings. If someone proposed an idea that no one liked, Mr. Nanula
might break the silence by saying: ``That's a great idea. It would
put us out of business in three days. But that's a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the C.F.O., or the C.E.O., you've got to say `no' a lot
without having everybody hate your guts,'' Mr. Nanula said. ``You
want them to keep coming up with good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula built a collection of 50 Disney neckties and appeared
to be settling in for the long haul. He was often mentioned as an
eventual suc- cessor to Mr. Eisner. ``I never thought a minute
about leaving Dis- ney,'' Mr. Nanula said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ever multitasking, Mr. Nanula often offered Mr. Sternlicht
advice _ on everything from takeover tactics to dismissing
executives. ``I'm not good at firing people,'' Mr. Sternlicht said.
``When I had to let somebody go, Richard and I would rehearse what
I was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   They also helped each other L  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  through
difficult personal times. Last year, Mr. Sternlicht learned that
his youngest son had juvenile diabetes, and Mr. Nanula's twin
daughter and son were born 15 weeks early, weighing only one and a
quar- ter pounds each. (Mr. Nanula's chil- dren are now fine, and
Mr. Sternlicht has joined the board of the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation.)
</P>
<P>
   As Starwood grew, Mr. Sternlicht mentioned the possibility of
turning his friendship with Mr. Nanula into a business partnership.
But Mr. Nan-H ula politely waved off the idea. When Mr. Sternlicht
closed in on the $13.3 billion deal to acquire ITT, however, he
raised the issue again. This time, Mr. Nanula had a different
answer: He would consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sternlicht was certain that his friend would be the best
candidate, even though working so closely to- gether would put
their friendship at risk. But the decision to hire a chief
executive would have to be made by Starwood's directors.
</P>
<P>
   There were other candidates. Buy- ing some of them out of
option-laden contracts, however, would have been too costly. One
even demanded that he be given the chairman's title after a year.
``That's a little overreaching, I'm afraid,'' Mr. Sternlicht told
him.
</P>
<P>
   The board settled on Mr. Nanula, in part because of his skills,
which complemented Mr. Sternlicht's, and in part because of the
chemistry between them.
</P>
<P>
   Though they walk into each other's offices at least a dozen
times a day to run through decisions, in the kind of shorthand that
develops between friends, Mr. Nanula and Mr. Stern-H licht are
still adjusting. ``It's just very different having him next to
me,'' Mr. Sternlicht said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Nanula is often on the road, flying in a Gulfstream IV
jet to visit the company's many opera- tions, refining goals for
managers and setting a tone for the company.
</P>
<P>
   He likes meetings with free-wheel- ing discussions, like those
he had at Harvard and Disney. ``There's no teacher,'' he said,
``just a bunch of us in the room figuring out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Nanula has little patience for people who are
unprepared, and he will direct a manager to do more homework before
setting up another meeting or phone call with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Wells was that way,'' he said, speaking of Disney's late
presi- dent. ``He would simply say, `Go get the answers, and we'll
make the deci- sion when you get them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Mr. Nanula calls managers far down the ladder to
get front-line perspective. And he often sends managers handwritten
notes with a simple happy face or frowning face sketched in the
corner, for a quick take on his mood.
</P>
<P>
   This approach, he said, ``takes the edge off a little bit'' _ an
edge that is likely to exist when older executives find themselves
reporting to a thirty-  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  something boss. But
former ITT ex- ecutives who are the resident gray- beards at
Starwood say that, after the first few weeks, they like working for
Mr. Nanula.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell by the way he asks questions that he wants to
gather all the facts,'' said Daniel P. Weadock, 59, a special
assistant to the chair- man after working for ITT, in one stint as
president of its hotels, for all but one of the years that Mr.
Nanula has been alive. ``They do take the input I give them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; gfdm,3 &LR;  R. NANULA grew up in Pas- adena and Santa Rosa, Calif. He
held a number of jobs as a teen-ager, waiting on tables many a
summer _ ``good, general people training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said they were at times concerned that Richard had
too many irons in the fire, his school- work competing with jobs,
sports and dating.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Nanula grew into a serious student at Santa Barbara.
With many fellow students pursuing ma- jors in partying, Mr. Nanula
saw an opportunity. ``If I was the only one studying,'' he said,
``I could probably get A-pluses and get into any busi- ness school
I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did, though Harvard deferred his acceptance, so he
went to Deloitte, Haskins &AMP; Sells in Atlan- ta for two years,
becoming a C.P.A.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nanula, whose father is white and mother black, said he
rarely encountered racism growing up in mainly white neighborhoods,
per- haps in part because his light skin color made many people
think he was Hawaiian or Egyptian. ``Thank- fully, nobody really
cared,'' he add- ed.
</P>
<P>
   And today, he said, he does not often think about being one of
the few blacks in the highest ranks of corpo- rate America. ``I do
believe in being a good role model,'' he said. ``But I've generally
just operated on doing my job, and race and age and back- ground
has never really played into it very much, so I've just not focused
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, as he waits for his new house in Greenwich, Conn.,
to be ren- ovated, he is focusing on Starwood during long workdays,
though he tries to be at home to help put his children to bed and
spend time with his wife, as well as to see his two golden
retrievers. He generally L brings home a briefcase of work for the
weekend. There is not much time to watch even one television set.
</P>
<P>
   He and Mr. Sternlicht have talked about working out together
again, playing basketball or taking a ``spin- ning'' class _ Mr.
Nanula said he is a ``gigantic fanatic'' about riding an exercise
bike to pounding music for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found time to do ei- ther one of them yet,'' he
said. ``But we'll do that.'' &UR; ws &LR; (BOX) &QR;

   UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STEADY AS CREATION OF JOBS SLOWS
</P>
<P>
   The economy created jobs at a slower but still robust pace last
month, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent, the
Labor Department reported. Continued strong employment growth in
service industries more than offset the damage that Asia's woes are
inflicting on manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after a sharp selloff in stocks earlier in the week and
several subsequent days of sweaty palms on Wall Street, the report
reassured investors that the economy remains stable despite the
confusing and sometimes conflicting forces, from Asia's downturn to
the buoyancy of consumer spending.

   EX-EDS CHIEF TO GET $38.6 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Data Systems in Plano, Texas, said that the
retirement of Lester M. Alberthal Jr. as chairman and chief
executive would cost the company $38.6 million in benefits. Shares
of EDS rose 14 percent. Alberthal announced his retirement after
the stock market closed on Thursday under pressure from board
members and shareholders dismayed by the company's loss of its
former leadership in the computer services industry.

   Worldcom expects to take charges of $6 billion to $7 billion in

<P>
   DRUG WHOLESALERS END DEALS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's four biggest drug wholesalers abandoned plans to
merge into two companies. The collapse of the deals _ Cardinal
Health's $2.8 billion acquisition of Bergen Brunswig and McKesson's
$2.3 billion purchase of Amerisource Health _ had been expected
since regulators opposed the mergers, saying that they would hurt
competition.

<P>
   HOTEL-CASINO DEAL CALLED OFF
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Real Estate Equities, the real estate investment trust
controlled by Richard Rainwater, has canceled a planned $1.7
billion acquisition of Station Casinos.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM DEVALUES ITS CURRENCY
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, as expected, devalued its currency, the third such move
since the Asian financial crisis took hold more than a year ago.
The government has been under pressure to open its markets and to
devalue the currency, the dong, to bolster export-dependent
industries, especially after nine months of bad weather hit crops
especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   PHONE WORKERS STAGE BRIEF STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of unionized telephone workers shut down directory
assistance in New York as they staged a two-and-a-half-hour wildcat
walkout aimed at pressuring Bell Atlantic to help avoid a strike at
12:01 a.m. Sunday, when their contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS FLAT FOR UNILEVER
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the British-Dutch household products conglomerate that
makes Lipton tea, Q-Tips and Wisk laundry detergent, said that its
second-quarter profit was little changed from a year earlier as the
Asia crisis continued to weigh on its business.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY GOOD FOR CABLE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   For 24-hour cable news programming like MSNBC, CNBC, Fox News
and CNN, the Monica Lewinsky story is big business, meaning more
revenue and higher ratings to shows that mostly struggle at the
margins, looking for _ at best _ the mysterious murder of a beauty
queen.

FORT WORTH HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE CAPTURES AJGA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ERIC ZARATE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ Adam Rubinson couldn't look.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Paschal High School graduate was 14 under par
yesterday and had the lead of the AJGA Lucent Technologies Boys
Championship at the Dallas Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, if Nick Manthey of Mesa, Ariz., could make a
20-foot chip shot for birdie on the 18th hole, there would be a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hear it'' if Manthey makes the shot, said Rubinson,
sitting at the scorer's table with his back to the green. ``I think
you get more nervous if you watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Manthey's shot rolled five feet past the pin _ he went
on to make bogey _ and Rubinson had his first American Junior Golf
Association victory in one of the organization's major events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Rubinson, whose 72-hole score of 274 on the
DAC's blue course was a stroke better than Russell Wrentz of Cabot,
Ark., and two ahead of Manthey. ``I'm 45-50 minutes from my home.
This feels good, really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Manthey's 9-iron shot on 18 left him five feet short of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had plenty of club, I just didn't hit it well,'' Manthey
said. ``I normally take the putter out on that chip shot. I didn't
really expect to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Past winners of this tournament include PGA Tour players Tiger
Woods (1992), David Duval (1989) and Jim Furyk (1987).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge for me,'' said Rubinson, who is scheduled to play
in Monday's U.S. Amateur qualifier in Garland. ``Now my name is on
the wall with a lot of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubinson, the 1998 Star-Telegram player of the year who will
play for TCU in the fall, started the day three shots behind the
lead but crafted his second consecutive 6-under 66 to win the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Third-round leaders Patrick Norris of Orlando, Fla., and John
Merrick of Long Beach, Calif., faltered in the final round. Norris'
72 left him at 277 and in a tie for fourth place. Merrick's 74 put
him at 279.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinson's championship also earned him the 17-18 age-division
title. Norris, 16, won the 13-16 division.
</P>
<P>
   Among local golfers, Mansfield's Matt Brost was 4 over for the
day and finished at 284, while Arlington's J.R. Zatarain was at
292.
</P>
<P>
   Staying at the home of some DAC members during the tournament,
Rubinson was told that back-to-back 67s might give him a chance at
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I did better,'' Rubinson said.
</P>
<P>
   His final round was bogey-free, and included a 4-under 32 on the
back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rolled my putter very well on the back nine,'' Rubinson
said. ``I putted very relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the putts were gimme shots. He made a 30-footer to
save par on No. 16, and rolled in a 10-footer in No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing the leaders, ``you have to make the birdies,'' Rubinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norris had tied Rubinson at 13 under after 15 holes, but bogeyed
16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam was making everything inside 10 feet,'' Norris said. ``He
might have hit every fairway. I never saw him miss.''

EXCERPTS FROM ORDER ON LEAKED GRAND JURY INFORMATION

   (With CLINTON-STARR)  
(Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets. The word

(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a ruling by Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court, ordering hearings on
whether the office of the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, had disclosed grand jury information about the Lewinsky
matter. Judge Johnson said she found preliminary evidence that
Starr's office had violated federal Rule 6(e) that prohibits
prosecutors, grand jurors and certain individuals other than
witnesses from disclosing ``matters occurring before the grand
jury.'' The ruling, made on June 19, was unsealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the three motions for order to show cause, the
O.I.C.'s response to opposition to such motions, and the oral
argument of counsel at the sealed hearing held on March 12, 1998,
the court finds that movants have established prima facie
violations of Rule 6(e)(2). Although the court finds that several
articles establish prima facie violations, the court notes that a
prima facie case may be established by only one article.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from the first show cause motion that establish prima
facie violations of Rule 6(e)(2) include Tabs ((as in file folder
tabs)) 1, 2, and 5. Tab 1 is an ``NBC Nightly News'' report aired
on Feb. 4, 1998, that directly identifies ``sources in Starr's
office'' and discloses information regarding a subpoenaed witness's
potential testimony before the grand jury, evaluations of such
potential testimony and the strategy and direction of the O.I.C.'s
investigation. Tab 2, a New York Daily News article published on
Jan. 23, 1998, ((describing Monica Lewinsky and why Vernon Jordan,
a friend of President Clinton, helped her seek a job)) and Tab 5, a
New York Times article published on Feb. 2, 1998, ((describing
immunity negotiations between Starr's office and Ms. Lewinsky))
also identify O.I.C. prosecutors as the sources of the reports and
also improperly disclose what a subpoenaed witness has told the
O.I.C. during the investigative interviews.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the second show cause motion, the court finds
that CBS News White House correspondent Scott Pelley's report that
``investigators have spent months checking out Tripp's story and
now claim she is, quote `completely reliable''' establishes a prima
facie violation of Rule 6(e)(2). Although the report does not
explicitly identify the O.I.C. as the source, it does identify
``investigators.'' The attribution to ``investigators'' strongly
implies that the source was investigators from the O.I.C.,
particularly given that the ``nature of the information disclosed
furnishes the connection'' to the O.I.C. O.I.C. investigators are
the most likely ``investigators'' to ``have spent months checking
out Tripp's story'' and have the greatest interest in suggesting to
the public that Linda Tripp is a reliable source of information.
Given that Mrs. Tripp is virtually certain to testify before the
grand jury, discussing the nature and credibility of her potential
testimony violates Rule 6(e)(2).
</P>
<P>
   The court also finds that the Fox News report aired on May 6,
1998, regarding Mr. Starr's comment to the press about the court's
opinion on executive privilege establishes a prima facie violation
of Rule 6(e)(2) and a violation of the court's order that the
parties receiving the opinion not discuss it with the press. Within
a day of the court's releasing the opinion on May 4, 1998, the
press began reporting that the court had issued a ruling with
regard to President Clinton's executive privilege claim and that
the court had denied the claim. The day after the leaks, Mr. Starr
told reporters in front of his home that he believed the opinion
was a ``magnificent ruling.'' This comment not only confirmed for
the press that the court had indeed made a decision but also
revealed that the substance of that decision was favorable to the
O.I.C. The fact that information about the opinion had already been
leaked at the time of Mr. Starr's comment in no way authorized him
to make statements confirming or denying such leaks. (``Rule 6(e)
does not create a type of secrecy which is waived once public
disclosure occurs.'' ... (``The Government is obligated to stand
silent regardless of what is reported, accurate or not, by the
press.'') Confirming the existence and substance of a sealed court
ruling presents a prima facie violation of Rule 6(e)(2) and a
violation of a court order not to discuss the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the third motion, the court finds that it
provides further support for the prima facie violations of Rule
6(e)(2) established by the first and second motions. The
independent counsel's admission to journalist Steven Brill that he
and deputy independent counsel Jackie Bennett speak to reporters on
condition of anonymity and his statement to Mr. Brill that Rule
6(e) does not apply to ``what witnesses tell F.B.I. agents or us
((the O.I.C.)) before they testify before the grand jury'' bolster
the court's findings of prima facie violations of Rule 6(e)(2) by
the O.I.C.(ASTERISK)(ASTERISK) See Steven Brill, ``Pressgate,''
Brill's Content. Mr. Brill's assertions that he has ``personally
seen internal memos from inside three news organizations that cite
Starr's office as a source'' and that ``six different people who
work at mainstream news organizations have told ((him)) about
specific leaks'' also support the court's findings of prima facie
violations.
</P>
<P>
   (ASTERISK)(ASTERISK)Although the independent counsel has
responded to Mr. Brill's article, he has not disputed that he made
these statements in his interview with Mr. Brill.

Hitler and his politics too big a place in it. Insuring that this

history but also for the modern era in its totality.'' (Michael

<P>
   Sujat Jamil works in a high-tech global village. Together with
co-workers from India, China, Europe, the Middle East and South
America, he designs microprocessors inside Intel's computer chip
factory in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very international and cosmopolitan work environment,''
says the 28-year-old electrical engineer from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the high-tech industry is relying on the
brainpower of highly trained foreign employees, like Jamil and his
colleagues, to fill what they say is a critical shortage of
qualified American workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the employment spectrum, the nation's
farmers say they have a growing need to import field hands for the
harvesting jobs Americans don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Both these powerful industries _ which bring $17 billion to the
Arizona economy annually _ say immigration laws must be changed to
allow greater numbers of foreign workers. If not, they warn, labor
needs could drive their businesses out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns from summer recess in September, votes are
expected on bills that would create a farm guest worker program and
another measure to raise the annual cap on visas for professional,
college-educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   Labor advocates are among the opponents to increasing foreign
hires. They argue that allowing more foreign workers into the labor
poor would displace American workers and drive down wages.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has also threatened to veto a bill increasing
the visas for high-tech workers unless the law provides for
training of Americans for these jobs and companies using the visas
assure they will not lay off American workers to hire lower-paid
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has been bolstered by a General Accounting Office
report and U.S. Department of Labor criticism that disputes claims
of national labor shortfalls for both categories of workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix-area employers and immigration advocates say the
labor needs are very real.
</P>
<P>
   Coeta Chambers, a human resources attorney for Intel, says the
high-tech industry has boomed in recent years, generating thousands
of new jobs each year and strengthening the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel alone hired 24,000 employees in 1997 for it's operations
worldwide, she said. Of those, only 500 were foreign nationals.
``It's very few people in this category, but they are for very
critical positions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each October, 65,000 visas are made available for hiring
high-tech and other college-educated, professionals. Universities,
computer makers and the medical field are among the employers that
compete for this visa pool.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the allotment was used up in 10 months. This year, the
visas ran out in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the cap many months ago, in May, and we have been
unable to hire any new (foreign high-tech workers) or we've had to
take employees of the payroll... leaving projects unfinished,''
says Jenifer Eisen, a Washington attorney and officer with the
American Business for Legal Immigration group, which represents
many high-tech employers.
</P>
<P>
   At Arizona State University in Tempe, Donald McTaggert, director
of the international programs office, says universities looking to
hire new faculty are caught in the same bind. ``There will be quite
a number of cases of people that won't be eligible to be hired,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, farmers say that without the ability to import more
workers, they'll go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One of Arizona's largest fruit and vegetable growers, Eagle
Produce owned by the Phoenix-based Martori family for three
generations, has scaled back it's operations due to lack of legal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had periods this year when we weren't able to get
everything harvested in a timely fashion,'' said Steve Martori. He
didn't lose any of his crops but knows of other farmers who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to create more jobs if we have trouble filling
the jobs we already have,'' Martori said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation for expanding the foreign professional
guest worker quota, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), would
raise the quota of professional visas to 85,000 this year and add
an additional 10,000 visas each year through 2002. In 2003, the
visa ceiling would drop back down to the current 65,000, to ensure
the increases are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The farm guest worker program, sponsored by Oregon Sens. Gordon
Smith (R) and Ron Wyden (D), would create a computerized registry
that employers could tap to find legal workers.
</P>
<P>
   If they were unable to meet their labor demands by recruiting
from the registry, farmers would be allowed to import an unlimited
number of temporary foreign farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Boyd of the National Association of Manufacturers, a
national organization representing 14,000 technology companies,
says if employment needs continue to go unmet, companies may have
to move certain operations outside the borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``One solution to this is for employers to move more work to
other places and we don't want to see that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``By providing temporary visas for foreign nationals and
addressing the education and training of American workers, we can
keep American jobs in America.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 6:30 already, half an hour after the matches
were supposed to have started, and the fans were getting antsy.
They itched to see behind the blue curtain, into the cordoned-off
area of the Amsterdam Billiard Club, where the Black Widow, the
Duchess of Doom and the rest of the best female pool players in the
world warmed up for the first evening session of the 1998 Brunswick
Billiards New York Classic. Hearing the boom of the break, the
collisions coming like sporadic cannon fire, was almost too much to
take.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the velvet rope was whisked aside, and they scurried
in, beer-bellied men in Harley-Davidson shirts, junior high school
girls with metallic nail polish, Wall Street bankers and senior
citizens, all eager to secure seats where they could watch their
favorites play nine ball for a slice of a $50,000 pie.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the East 86th Street billiard club Friday evening
showed that women's professional pool has arrived. While the men's
game has recently fallen off fans' radar screens, women's pool has
taken off like a cue ball on the break. Since 1991, the men's tour
has splintered into squabbling factions while the women have
unified, secured corporate sponsors and garnered a television
contract with ESPN. This has left pool in an unusual position among
sports _ its women's league is more widely followed than its men's.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Esposito, a 50-year-old Newark, N.J., police officer who
attended Thursday night's pretournament charity fund-raiser for
literacy at the billiard hall, offered his theory on the women's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring a lot of class to it, elegance,'' Esposito said.
``With guys, you get a lot more rough-edged, hustler style, like
they're still in the pool halls and bars.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's new image is no accident. It has been carefully
cultivated by the Women's Pro Billiard Association. The
organization, formed in 1976, became more important in 1991, when
the women split from the men's tour over marketing and sponsorship
conflicts. At that time, the word ``pool'' often brought to mind
drunken hustlers shooting stick and comparing tattoos in dingy,
smoke-filled bars.
</P>
<P>
   Ewa Mataya Laurance, the former president of the women's
association, said the players decided that if the sport was to
succeed, it needed a makeover. Drinking, smoking and gambling were
outlawed at tournament sites. By the time the New York Classic
started in 1993, the dress code demanded silky gowns and evening
wear for televised matches. Players were counseled to make
themselves accessible to the media and to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, events like the New York Classic are held in
well-lighted, air-conditioned halls with bleachers for fans and
fine oak tables for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   These pros inspired Bill and Mary Haas to come from the Bronx
and pay $75 for weekend passes to the tournament, even though Haas,
a repairman for Bell Atlantic, may soon be out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last thing we can afford ...'' began Mrs. Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we like to see the best, and these are the major-leaguers
of this sport,'' finished Haas.
</P>
<P>
   These major-leaguers are more than just fancy dresses and
nicknames. Each player has a story, and Friday night, the fans
spoke about them as if they were close friends.
</P>
<P>
   They marveled at Alison Fisher, the Duchess of Doom, who came to
America from England in 1995 as a snooker champion and has used
careful strategy and superior shooting to dominate the American
game, which is similar.
</P>
<P>
   They praised Mary Guarino, who returned to the table after
undergoing neurosurgery in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And naturally, they gushed about Jeanette Lee, the Black Widow,
whose dramatic play and elegant style have made her the most
recognizable player in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans know that Ms. Lee, a 27-year-old native of Bayside,
Queens, went from being a waitress at the Amsterdam Billiard Club
in 1993 to the No. 1 female player in the world in 1994. They know
that she likes to dress all in black, and they know that she has
run afoul of the dress code more than once with her sleeveless
gowns.
</P>
<P>
   But few of them know that Ms. Lee, who now lives in
Indianapolis, was born with scoliosis and has a 28-inch rod
supporting her spine. When she started shooting pool at 14, doctors
warned her not to play, because she would have to bend excessively.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee ignored that warning. Hooked on pool, she wrapped her
hand in electrical tape at night and slept with it bound in the
bridge position. On the subway she drew stares as she practiced her
follow-through with an imaginary cue. She played marathon matches,
often hustling unwitting men who could not imagine that a woman
could beat them. ``I got caught up in the beauty of the game,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Die-hard fans have enabled the women's tour to become a staple
of ESPN and ESPN2's programming. According to ESPN, the telecasts
consistently draw more than 740,000 viewers, regardless of what
time they are aired or what sports they are up against.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, fans mingled with the players, collected
autographs and asked for tips on how to sink long shots against the
rail. They watched Ms. Lee execute a trick shot in which she used
two cues like chopsticks and still sank a ball into the corner
pocket. Some of them ponied up $50 to play against the pros.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Goryeb, chief executive officer of Champion Mortgage of
Manhattan, went head-to-head against the real champion, Alison
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Goryeb has been playing pool for 53 years. He owns 12 cues.
Still, Ms. Fisher beat him with a flurry of shots to close out the
match.
</P>
<P>
   As Goryeb slipped his stick back into its velvet case, he shook
his head and smiled. ``It was worth it,'' he said. ``It's like
playing golf with Jack Nicklaus.''

   LA-MURDER-SUICIDE (Los Angeles) _ A man and his wife were found
dead Friday morning in their home in a suburban Los Angeles
neighborhood in an apparent murder-suicide. Neighbors and relatives
said David Schenk and Heather Fredette had a tumultuous
relationship that often drew authorities to the home. A week ago
Schenk held Fredette down, put a gun to her head and threatened to
kill her. The ordeal, which authorities described as terrifying,
prompted Fredette to obtain a restraining order. But, despite the
report she made of the gun terrorism, sheriff's deputies failed to
arrest Schenk. By Jesse Hiestand. (Will run in the ``n'' California

 By ADAM GERSHENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 6:30 already, half an hour after the matches
were supposed to have started, and the fans were getting antsy.
They itched to see behind the blue curtain, into the cordoned-off
area of the Amsterdam Billiard Club, where the Black Widow, the
Duchess of Doom and the rest of the best female pool players in the
world warmed up for the first evening session of the 1998 Brunswick
Billiards New York Classic. Hearing the boom of the break, the
collisions coming like sporadic cannon fire, was almost too much to
take.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the velvet rope was whisked aside, and they scurried
in, beer-bellied men in Harley-Davidson shirts, junior high school
girls with metallic nail polish, Wall Street bankers and senior
citizens, all eager to secure seats where they could watch their
favorites play nine ball for a slice of a $50,000 pie.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the East 86th Street billiard club Friday evening
showed that women's professional pool has arrived. While the men's
game has recently fallen off fans' radar screens, women's pool has
taken off like a cue ball on the break. Since 1991, the men's tour
has splintered into squabbling factions while the women have
unified, secured corporate sponsors and garnered a television
contract with ESPN. This has left pool in an unusual position among
sports _ its women's league is more widely followed than its men's.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Esposito, a 50-year-old Newark, N.J., police officer who
attended Thursday night's pretournament charity fund-raiser for
literacy at the billiard hall, offered his theory on the women's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring a lot of class to it, elegance,'' Esposito said.
``With guys, you get a lot more rough-edged, hustler style, like
they're still in the pool halls and bars.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's new image is no accident. It has been carefully
cultivated by the Women's Pro Billiard Association. The
organization, formed in 1976, became more important in 1991, when
the women split from the men's tour over marketing and sponsorship
conflicts. At that time, the word ``pool'' often brought to mind
drunken hustlers shooting stick and comparing tattoos in dingy,
smoke-filled bars.
</P>
<P>
   Ewa Mataya Laurance, the former president of the women's
association, said the players decided that if the sport was to
succeed, it needed a makeover. Drinking, smoking and gambling were
outlawed at tournament sites. By the time the New York Classic
started in 1993, the dress code demanded silky gowns and evening
wear for televised matches. Players were counseled to make
themselves accessible to the media and to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, events like the New York Classic are held in
well-lighted, air-conditioned halls with bleachers for fans and
fine oak tables for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   These pros inspired Bill and Mary Haas to come from the Bronx
and pay $75 for weekend passes to the tournament, even though Haas,
a repairman for Bell Atlantic, may soon be out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last thing we can afford ...'' began Mrs. Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we like to see the best, and these are the major-leaguers
of this sport,'' finished Haas.
</P>
<P>
   These major-leaguers are more than just fancy dresses and
nicknames. Each player has a story, and Friday night, the fans
spoke about them as if they were close friends.
</P>
<P>
   They marveled at Alison Fisher, the Duchess of Doom, who came to
America from England in 1995 as a snooker champion and has used
careful strategy and superior shooting to dominate the American
game, which is similar.
</P>
<P>
   They praised Mary Guarino, who returned to the table after
undergoing neurosurgery in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And naturally, they gushed about Jeanette Lee, the Black Widow,
whose dramatic play and elegant style have made her the most
recognizable player in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans know that Ms. Lee, a 27-year-old native of Bayside,
Queens, went from being a waitress at the Amsterdam Billiard Club
in 1993 to the No. 1 female player in the world in 1994. They know
that she likes to dress all in black, and they know that she has
run afoul of the dress code more than once with her sleeveless
gowns.
</P>
<P>
   But few of them know that Ms. Lee, who now lives in
Indianapolis, was born with scoliosis and has a 28-inch rod
supporting her spine. When she started shooting pool at 14, doctors
warned her not to play, because she would have to bend excessively.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee ignored that warning. Hooked on pool, she wrapped her
hand in electrical tape at night and slept with it bound in the
bridge position. On the subway she drew stares as she practiced her
follow-through with an imaginary cue. She played marathon matches,
often hustling unwitting men who could not imagine that a woman
could beat them. ``I got caught up in the beauty of the game,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Die-hard fans have enabled the women's tour to become a staple
of ESPN and ESPN2's programming. According to ESPN, the telecasts
consistently draw more than 740,000 viewers, regardless of what
time they are aired or what sports they are up against.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, fans mingled with the players, collected
autographs and asked for tips on how to sink long shots against the
rail. They watched Ms. Lee execute a trick shot in which she used
two cues like chopsticks and still sank a ball into the corner
pocket. Some of them ponied up $50 to play against the pros.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Goryeb, chief executive officer of Champion Mortgage of
Manhattan, went head-to-head against the real champion, Alison
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Goryeb has been playing pool for 53 years. He owns 12 cues.
Still, Ms. Fisher beat him with a flurry of shots to close out the
match.
</P>
<P>
   As Goryeb slipped his stick back into its velvet case, he shook
his head and smiled. ``It was worth it,'' he said. ``It's like
playing golf with Jack Nicklaus.''

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, July 19,
about problems consumers face when seeking to determine if food has
been genetically modified misstated the practices of one
supermarket chain, Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Tex. It does
not require suppliers to guarantee that products they sell to the
company are free of gene-altered ingredients. The chain asked
suppliers for such a restriction, but the suppliers said they were
unable to comply.

exhibition is called ``Art Performs Life,'' not ``Life Performs
Art.'' The article also misstated the date of a Merce Cunningham

HOUSE VOTES ANOTHER ANTI-GAY MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Va.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one of its last acts before recessing for an
August vacation, the House on Friday approved a measure that would
bar adoptions by gay couples in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the measure was an unacceptable intrusion
into local control by the district, and senior advisers have
recommended that he veto any bill that includes it. There is little
prospect that the Senate will go along with the House anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But passage of the provision was another demonstration of House
Republicans' effort, particularly in recent weeks as the election
season nears, to adopt a number of policies circumscribing the
rights of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said this measure, an amendment to a $491 million
bill financing district operations in the coming fiscal year, was
needed because it would help ensure that adopted children had
stable lives. The amendment would prohibit adoptions in the
district by ``individuals who are not related by blood or
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., who introduced the measure, said it
would not bar single people, whether homosexual or heterosexual,
from adopting. But he did say he was opposed to homosexuals'
adopting children, because he believed they were using adoption as
one way of acting like married heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might give some gay-rights activist a warm feeling to see
gay couples treated just as if they were married,'' he said in an
emotional floor debate that ran past midnight into Friday morning.
But, Largent said, adoptees have already had a rough start in life,
and ``it is simply wrong to turn them into trophies from the
culture war, to exploit them in order to make some political
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., called the measure mean-spirited and
said House Republicans wanted to have ``one last bash before we go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that the measure would deny good homes to some
of the 3,600 children in foster care in the district and would also
have additional unintended consequences, for instance preventing
two nuns from adopting a child but allowing married alcoholics to
do so. Current law in the district allows local judges to determine
adoptions on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Largent was supported by Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who is the
father of two adopted children. He said that unless parents had a
marriage contract, an adopted child had no legal protection. If an
unmarried couple decide to part, ``what happens to the child?'' he
said. ``What rights does the child have?''
</P>
<P>
   Largent's measure passed by a vote of 227-192, with the support
of 190 Republicans and 37 Democrats. Thirty Republicans voted
against it, as did 161 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   The broader district financing bill, which passed on a vote of
214-206, also includes a provision that would provide vouchers to
low-income parents in the district to help pay for sending their
children to private or parochial schools, another provision opposed
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have frequently used the spending bill for the
district, which has no vote in Congress, to make social points.
They passed a similar measure providing for school vouchers last
year, but the efforts to bar gay adoptions and prevent the use of
local money for needle-exchange programs, which was also attached
to the district spending bill, are new.

U.S. JUDGE ORDERS A RWANDAN TO SURRENDER FOR TRIAL ON GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A U.S. District Court judge in Texas this week
ordered a Rwandan who has been indicted for genocide in Africa but
who is living in the United States to surrender to an international
war crimes tribunal for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a former Seventh-day
Adventist pastor who was accused of encouraging the massacre of
ethnic Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, has been living in Texas with a
son.
</P>
<P>
   He has 30 days to appeal the order.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling had been sought by the State Department, which
supports international tribunals and was embarrassed by the release
of Ntakirutimana by a Texas magistrate late in December 1996. While
some African nations were turning suspects over to the tribunal,
which is based in Arusha, Tanzania, the United States in effect had
freed the only suspect in U.S. custody.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, 73, was living with his son Eliel, a well-known
anesthesiologist in Laredo, when he was arrested in September 1996.
Another son has been charged with war crimes and is in custody in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ntakirutimana was accused of leading an ethnic Hutu
militia to his church and hospital compound in Mugonero, where
frightened Tutsi had fled for safety. Hundreds were reportedly
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania, the registrar of the Rwanda war crimes tribunal,
Agwu Ukiwe Okali, welcomed the new judicial order, handed down on
Wednesday in Laredo by Judge John Rainey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribunal hopes that this decision will accelerate the
process of bringing Ntakirutimana, accused of genocide and crimes
against humanity, to face trial before the tribunal,'' Okali said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Stefanie Grant, program and policy director for the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, applauded the judge's ruling,
saying, ``We welcome the lead which the U.S. is giving to other
countries in this decision in cooperating with international
criminal justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana is expected to appeal. His lawyer, Ramsey Clark, a
former U.S. attorney general, has argued that the International War
Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda has no legal standing as a U.N. body.
</P>
<P>
   The international tribunals cannot ask for extradition, only the
voluntary handover of people indicted for crimes under its
jurisdiction. The harshest sentence the tribunals can impose is
life imprisonment.

A SMASHING SUCCESS AT SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry was a 15-year-old schoolboy in Los Angeles in
1977 when Reggie Jackson joined the Yankees and announced: ``I'm
the straw that stirs the drink.'' He was oblivious then to being a
pro player, much less a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing ball, basketball, football and I was enjoying
being a kid, and I wasn't thinking about anything important,''
Strawberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years later, the name Strawberry is one of the most
recognized and resilient in baseball _ as much for the dazzling
heights as for the desperate lows and, finally, for the
exhilarating comeback that his name represents. Now, at age 36,
Strawberry has not so much matured as he has evolved. He is one of
several straws that stir the drink.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his 21st home run Friday in an 8-2 romp over the Kansas
City Royals in the first game of a day-night doubleheader. Three
nights earlier, in Oakland, Strawberry's dramatic ninth-inning,
pinch-hit grand slam catapulted the Yankees to one of their most
enthralling victories in an enthralling season.
</P>
<P>
   He simply grabbed the bat off the rack, walked to the plate and
hit the ball. Not a lot of warm-up swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more simple now,'' he said. ``About playing, whatever I do
as far as helping the team, it's a simple thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge for Strawberry is answering questions about
his surgically repaired left knee. Chili Davis is expected to
return from ankle surgery this month, and manager Joe Torre plans
to use him as the designated hitter, in place of Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, if he wants to play regularly during this period,
will have to compete for playing time in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave it all up to Joe, let him make the decision,''
Strawberry said. ``I've been able to live with just about
everything. Everybody wants to be on the same page. In '96 and '97
we had bad apples griping about playing time. We haven't had that
this year. There's no need for it.'' Few of Strawberry's teammates
can appreciate the Yankees' success more than he can. Few have as
keen a perspective about the fragility of success, the thin line
that separates success from failure. Strawberry was left for dead
last year in the baseball sense. He has far exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I'm alive, I'm healthy,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm
back with the ball club. They gave me another opportunity and
that's all that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day when so many professional athletes have been coddled
and catered to since their teen-age years, few actually have known
struggle beyond the confines of the court or field: making the
team, not making the team, suffering injury, coming back from
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Few know the feeling of actually having a life turned inside
out, upside down, having the feeling of being lost, in a
wilderness. Strawberry knows.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Mets in 1980, he was signed to a $210,000
contract by Frank Cashen, who initially vowed not to bring the
young player to New York. Bowing to pressure, the Mets called up
Strawberry in 1983 at the age of 21. There was adulation, and a
World Series championship in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But after a glorious season, there would be domestic violence,
tax problems, drug and alcohol abuse. A career and a life seemed in
ruin. He has come full circle, back to the same city, but a
different team, again in the limelight but neither seeking it nor
reveling in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is a combination of everything; what you've been
through,'' Strawberry said. ``Everything's not going to be as good
as you'd like for it to be. Things happen in people's lives. I was
one of those people and I learned to deal with it. Didn't blame
anyone for what I did. I've accepted who I am and what I've done
and I'm trying to make the best out of who I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is after a third World Series championship, the
culminating accomplishment of a 15-year career. He leads the team
in home runs; he leads the team. Not the way Paul O'Neill leads.
Strawberry shakes it up.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years after he first heard Reggie make the claim, he
is a different sort of straw, and the Yankees are a different kind
of drink. But Strawberry stirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys around here know that I know how to play the
game, I understand the game, and that's basically what it's all
about,'' he said. ``And going out and having a winning attitude and
understanding what winning is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about numbers; this is not a numbers game. It's about
what we do together, how far we go.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Texas lawmakers dispute economists' drought views
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Comptroller John Sharp told lawmakers
Friday that the state should call out the National Guard to deliver
hay to bail out Texas farmers suffering through a crippling
drought.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George W. Bush and Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry
said they may have a better, cheaper way. Bush and Perry said
private companies might be willing to deliver hay for free.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas were offered up as the House Appropriations and Senate
Finance committees met in joint session to hear what the drought
has done to the state and what the state can do to help.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread agreement that economists who say the
drought is something less than a big, statewide crisis are
clueless.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pete Laney, Senate Finance Chairman Bill Ratliff
and other legislators with agricultural interests in their
districts said the economists' assessments don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp agreed, noting that the $1.8 billion in lost agriculture
income has the same impact as shutting down the state's $1.4
billion hotel-motel industry and putting all of its employees out
of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists aren't talking to families,'' said Sharp. ``They
are not talking to bankers that lost huge loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Texas economists, noting that agriculture accounts for
only 1 percent of the state's gross product, said last week that
the drought will not have significant statewide impact unless it
drags on for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this drought ripples through the economy it is serious,
and you cannot look at it just from a point of view of what the
gross state product is,'' said Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Perry agreed, telling the committees that urban Texans may see
short-term benefits but will see long-term problems as a result of
hard times down on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Beef prices will come down as a result of forced liquidation of
herds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at this time next year, if, God forbid, this continues on,
your constituents can expect to see increased prices at
supermarkets for beef'' and other farm products, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp pitched his hay idea as a result of a similar plan that
has worked well in Oklahoma, another state hit by the summer
drought. About 80 percent of Texas' ranges and pastures are rated
poor or very poor this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Perry, Sharp's GOP opponent in this year's lieutenant
governor's race, said his ``Hay Hotline,'' which began as a way to
match up people selling hay with people needing it, is now getting
calls from people offering free hay and free transportation of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard times like these that can bring out the best in
people,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, ranchers Jack and Leslie Hale heard about the Texas
woes and organized a drive that, so far, has collected nine
truckloads of hay. The Kansas National Guard will haul the hay to
Texas on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor believes the
use of National Guard troops to deliver hay in Texas is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But private companies are starting to express interest in the
transportation of hay, and we want to see first if that will
provide the solution,'' she said.

IMMIGRATION AGENCY SPURS PROCESS FOR NATURALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under pressure to reduce an unprecedented backlog of
citizenship applications, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service Friday announced measures that agency officials said would
cut in half the time immigrants must wait to become U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The measures range from creating a national customer service
office to help improve the agency's performance to asking Congress
for $171 million to hire 200 new employees and increase overtime
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials also said they would more than double the
filing fee for citizenship applications _ to $225 from $95 _ and
create a national telephone line, staffed by 500 people, to answer
routine questions about immigration services.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, which was detailed by INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner, much of the money would be used to send teams of
experts to work in the five cities that have the highest number of
pending citizenship cases. They are Los Angeles (420,000 cases),
New York (more than 300,000), San Francisco (220,000), Miami
(185,000) and Chicago (100,000).
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said the current backlog of 1.9 million
cases nationwide was the result of an inefficient, antiquated
system and a soaring number of applications prompted by recent laws
that threaten to reduce benefits to noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the country, applicants must wait more than two
years to become citizens, said an INS spokesman in Washington,
Russell Bergeron. Just two years ago, the waiting time was six
months. With the new plan, immigration officials expect that a year
from now, immigrants will have to wait only 10 months to a year to
become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the request for money, which would require
congressional approval, the measures would begin to be implemented
immediately. Immigration officials said the request was likely to
be approved because the money was already part of the budget for
the Justice Department, which oversees the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's lawyers and advocates for immigrants reacted to the
announcement with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not going to help the situation,'' said Jesus Pena,
an immigration lawyer in Queens. ``Immigration has already lost
sight of its mission, and you can't bring that back by throwing
money at an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena pointed to his most recent experience with the immigration
agency as the reason for his lack of optimism. He said he went to
the immigration office in Garden City, N.J., Friday morning to find
out why his client, Luz Galindo, had not heard from the agency
since she applied for citizenship two years ago. He was told that,
inexplicably, her file was in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money, how much sophistication, does it take to bring
a file from Detroit to New Jersey?'' Pena asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The backlog of applications _ the largest since the federal
government began keeping naturalization records at the turn of the
century _ has further embarrassed an agency that cannot seem to
please anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have criticized the INS for rushing to
naturalize people without proper background checks, while advocates
for immigrants criticize it for taking too long to process
applications.

 &HT;    Brauer vaults into lead in Classic
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Denny Brauer was sounding more like a rookie
than one of the greatest bass tournament anglers of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   After he turned in the heaviest catch and biggest bass of the
tournament Friday, Brauer, a member of the sport's exclusive
millionaire's club, seemed to be holding back the giggles as he
tried to explain how he vaulted into first place with one round to
go in the 28th BASS Masters Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer caught five bass weighing 17 pounds, 14 ounces _ the
largest one 7-6 _ to take a 14-ounce lead over first-round leader
George Cochran. Brauer has a two-day total weight of 29-15, placing
him in the pole position to win his first Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fish was my first bite,'' said Brauer, adding the fish
was in his live well inside the first 10 minutes. ``When a day
starts out like that you know it's going to be a magical day.''
</P>
<P>
   And considering that many in the 46-competitor field were still
struggling to find keepable fish (14 inches is the minimum) willing
to bite, the Camdenton, Mo., angler's day was almost miraculous. He
caught his limit of five bass by 8:25 a.m. and ended up tossing
back four others that were keepers and three more that weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer's bass-fishing resume is impressive no matter what
happens today. He was the BASS Angler of the Year in 1987, has won
10 BASS events, and is one of the top moneywinners on the
Wal-Mart/FLW Tour, considered by some the biggest competitor BASS
has.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he lacks a Classic title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the chance to win three Classics and this one is no
exception,'' he said. ``I don't even know if I will catch anything
(today). But I can promise you that I'll do my best ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling out of the lead, Cochran, from Hot Springs,
Ark., still had a productive Day 2. He had four fish weighing 11-14
to give him a 29-1 total. In third at 26-11 is Mike Reynolds of
Modesto, Calif., a Classic first-timer who had 15-12 total Friday
to moved up from 12th place. Zell Rowland of Montgomery, Texas, was
fourth with 25-2, moving up from eighth with a 13-10 performance,
and Tom Biffle of Wagoner, Okla., fell from fourth to fifth, but
was still within striking distance at 24-4. Randall Romig of Barto,
Penn., and Randy Blaukat of Joplin, Mo., were tied for sixth at
23-11.
</P>
<P>
   The two Georgians _ Stanley Mitchell of Fitzgerald and Danny
Kirk of Jasper _ look out of contention. Mitchell, who caught
Thursday's big bass, was 13th with a 16-3 total, while Kirk was
25th at 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell managed only three fish that weighed 6-6 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so tough out there, but that's the way the fishing
is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk caught three weighing 6-15, but was less than an inch away
from a five-fish limit after throwing back two fish that were each
within about a quarter-inch of being keepers. If they had been
keepers, he likely would have been in the top 20 entering the final
round.

 &HT;    HR hype tougher than fastballs
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Mark McGwire didn't get a hit in three games here yet
was the story of the weekend. Mark McGwire didn't play Wednesday in
Milwaukee yet was the story of the night. And it is barely August.
</P>
<P>
   The Maris Record should _ as opposed to could _ fall soon. Guys
are bigger and stronger and have creatine to sustain them. There
are more bad pitchers than ever. Add McGwire's May to Sammy Sosa's
June to Albert Belle's July and you've 52 home runs in the span of
three months. The problem isn't so much hitting the ball. The
problem is everything that accrues from hitting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of Maris standing in his locker briefing the
media after he hit No. 61 on Oct. 1, 1961. (Sal Durante, the truck
driver who caught the historic ball, stands behind Maris, looking
bemused.) Eight reporters are seen in the photo, all of them
placidly taking notes. (Meaning: No jostling.) There's not a TV
camera visible, and therein is your difference.
</P>
<P>
   Maris hit 61 in the days before ESPN and live cut-ins. Maris hit
61 at a time when print coverage meant the hometown papers _ no USA
Today, no national baseball writers, no columnists jetting in to
hop on the next big story. Even as the weight was pressing down on
Maris, whose hair infamously fell out in clumps, we look upon the
media crush of '61 and say, ``You call that a crush?''
</P>
<P>
   Already McGwire's routine has been so stretched that he has
none. He has mass press conferences _ plenty of TV cameras on hand
_ on the first day of every road series. (This weekend he's home,
but Sosa comes calling. Hype-o-rama!) In them, he has been mostly
agreeable but has shown the occasional sign of irritability. And
remember, it's barely August. The longer this goes, the less
patient he'll be. Human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Maris caught some breaks in '61. For the season's first half it
was Mickey Mantle who seemed most apt to catch Babe Ruth. (Mantle
finished with 54 homers.) The Yankees were their imperial selves,
headed toward the AL pennant. McGwire has none of that. He was the
designated record-smasher from spring training on, and to his
credit he has put himself in position to do it. But his team is
going nowhere, meaning that he's the only reason to watch the
Cardinals. (Indeed, when John Mabry started in McGwire's stead
Wednesday, the Milwaukee crowd booed.)
</P>
<P>
   Strength isn't the issue. Temperament is. The man who catches
Maris must do as Michael Jordan has done this entire decade, must
absorb the attention and then put it aside long enough to do his
job. He must be able to stand above his team, above his entire
sport, and not be distracted. Trouble is, Jordan wasn't much good
at hitting baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   That McGwire went a week without a homer has been described as a
colossal failure. (A week? Rafael Belliard went a decade without
one.) From coast to coast, nobody asks who won last night, only if
McGwire got his. When he does, it's a headline. When he doesn't,
that's a headline, too. And remember, it's barely August. Imagine
how September will be. Me, I'm betting the Maris record holds.

 &HT;    Butler learned from failures
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adam Butler is getting a second chance. As bad
as it was, he never wants to forget the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have been a little overwhelmed the first time up
here,'' he said before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Butler arrived from the Class AAA Richmond Braves _ from Buffalo
through Pittsburgh _ nearly four months after Atlanta sent him
down. A spring training sensation (0.93 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 9
2/3 innings), Butler had been a disaster come April (0-1, 33.75
ERA, four hits two walks in 1 2/3 innings). He has often thought
about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was pitching inside like I needed to,'' said
Butler, who takes Russ Springer's spot on the roster (15-day
disabled list with bone spurs in his right elbow). ``I don't
remember shaking off Javy (Lopez) one time. Not to say he wasn't
calling a good game but if I'd disagree with something, I might
have just thrown it anyway. He's been in the major leagues, what,
five years?''
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky start once he returned to the minors, Butler was
3-7 with 12 saves and a 3.31 ERA (83 hits and 79 strikeouts in 89
2/3 innings) while sharing closing duties. It is not inconceivable
he could make a place for himself in Atlanta the second time
around. John Rocker did and the Braves are still looking for a
second left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get him in there,'' said manager Bobby Cox, ``as quick
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned to pace myself a lot better,'' Butler said.
``I was up 12 times in the 14 games I was up here. I was getting
worn out. So I'm going to take it easy when I'm warming up and not
leaving it all down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Door No. 2
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cather might have rejoined the club instead of Butler, if
his elbow was sound. Optioned to Richmond July 16 to make a place
for Mark Wohlers when he returned from his first optional
assignment, Cather has encountered a tendon problem in his right
elbow. He had accumulated a 6.14 ERA in his six appearances before
his elbow flared up. A product of Cal-Berkeley (Cather appeared for
the Bears in the 1992 College World Series), he was actually a
drawing card here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have called him right back,'' said Cox. ``I just ran
into about 50 of his friends outside. They all bought their tickets
way in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire one
</P>
<P>
   Cox was incredulous over a report circulating in Detroit that
the Braves were close to dealing center fielder Andruw Jones. A
Detroit newspaper reported Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz
had agreed with Tigers GM Randy Smith to swap Jones for Tigers
closer Todd Jones and center fielder Brian Hunter, until Cox shot
down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made that up,'' Cox said. ``That's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange power
</P>
<P>
   With three home runs within 10 at-bats entering Friday night,
Andruw Jones declined that his power surge is a result of his new _
and vacillating _ hair color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said Jones, ``just good luck against Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   His double-HR performance against the Reds Thursday night meant
12 of his 42 career homers have come against the Reds. He is on
pace to reach 27 homers this year, the most by Braves center
fielder since Ron Gant hit 32 in 1991. For the record, the hair
tone Friday remained a shade of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's prematurely orange,'' said broadcaster Don Sutton.

 &HT;    Fight night fright night for local investors
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The ring will be surrounded by more than 40,000 seats
and seemingly as many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one: Which Atlanta carries more weight _ the one that can
claim participation in one of the most noteworthy nights in boxing
history, Muhammad Ali's return to the ring in 1970 at the old City
Auditorium? Or the one that consistently has failed to support not
only local club shows but a resident who happens to be the greatest
heavyweight of this era?
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks from today, Evander Holyfield will defend his
heavyweight title against Vaughn Bean in the Georgia Dome. The
Sept. 19 fight, which will be announced officially in a Tuesday
news conference, will be only the third heavyweight title fight
held in the city and the fourth bout for Holyfield in his hometown.
It also represents perhaps the greatest test for the city's
affection for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Georgia Boxing Commission, Thomas
Mishou, views the fight as ``an excellent opportunity for Atlanta
to recognize the economic potential boxing can bring to the city
and state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Morrison believes he already has a fix on the
economics. Morrison, who has funded four successful monthly shows
at the Roxy Theater in Buckhead, was approached by Holyfield
attorney Jim Thomas about bankrolling a $3 million site fee for the
September show. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that Evander wants to fight here, and I feel the
city really should support him,'' Morrison said. ``But he's never
been able to sell tickets. Why, I don't know. ... They wanted to
give me the honor of underwriting this fight. But there's no honor
in losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as he has disproved people in the ring, Holyfield aims to
disprove Morrison and others who are convinced that Atlanta is not
a boxing town. Holyfield will take the majority of the financial
risk, in effect drawing his purse from the gate. But he says a
combination of factors will fill the Dome:
</P>
<P>
   Moderately priced tickets, expected to start at about $25.
</P>
<P>
   Belated corporate participation; Holyfield and Thomas are trying
to persuadecompanies to buy blocks of tickets to distribute to
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And the rare opportunity to see a heavyweight title fight here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the only chance a lot of people get to see me
fight in person before I retire,'' said Holyfield, who would follow
a win with bouts against Henry Akinwande in Las Vegas or Atlantic
City and Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas. ``Think of all the kids who
would have the chance to tell their kids, 'I saw Holyfield fight.'
I'm doing this for Atlanta. I think the support will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotional push will be strong. Promoter Don King is fresh
off being cleared of insurance fraud charges and already has
described the fight as ``a celebration of freedom.'' Holyfield
plans to train in Atlanta rather than Houston for the four weeks
leading up to the fight and probably will hold some open workouts
and speak to a number of youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bean's promoter, Butch Lewis, he of the bow tie without the
shirt, is one of the sport's more colorful figures and also will be
visible.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's boxing history is mixed: Ali's return against
Jerry Quarry in 1970 sold out, albeit in a weathered 5,000-seat
auditorium. Tim Witherspoon vs. Tony Tubbs, the first heavyweight
title fight in Atlanta, in 1986, drew 6,500 in the Omni. A
gathering of 7,500 was announced for Holyfield's cruiserweight
championship against Dwight Muhammad Qawi in the Omni the same
year, but 4,000 seemed more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In Holyfield's most recent Atlanta appearance, a 1991
heavyweight defense against Bert Cooper, also in the Omni, 12,996
were announced. That was well short of a sellout but not bad
considering that Cooper was a last-minute replacement for Francesco
Damiani, who had been a replacement for Mike Tyson, who had backed
out of a November fight after suffering a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Boorman is a spokesman for Main Events, Holyfield's
promoter at the time of the Cooper fight. ``We thought the response
was pretty good, especially considering all the changes,'' Boorman
said. ``The strange thing was we actually had to give some people
refunds when Damiani backed out. We tried to explain to everyone
that Cooper actually was a tougher fighter, but nobody believed us.
That's the problem with being a promoter. When you tell the truth,
nobody believes you. It's like the boy who cried wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper nearly stunned Holyfield in his homecoming, knocking the
champion into the ropes in the third round. Referee Mills Lane
called it a knockdown, the first of Holyfield's career. Cooper
finally fell to a series of punches in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman expects the Holyfield-Bean fight to draw more than
20,000. ``Remember, the Holyfield who fought Cooper hadn't beaten
up Tyson yet,'' he said. ``Because of who Evander is and what he
does to promote Atlanta, he should sell the place out. But I'm just
naturally a pessimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about the turnout could affect broadcast decisions
by the Showtime cable network, which has not staged a boxing show
in Atlanta. Executive Jay Larkin said the company generally does
not black out fights in the host city but is considering doing so
for this one. ``We want to have a full house for Evander's sake,''
Larkin said. ``All I have to go on is the adage in our business
that Atlanta is not a good boxing town,'' Larkin said. ``I'd like
to disprove that Sept. 19 with Evander. The guy has a highway named
after him. He's a local hero. I watched him carry the torch into
the stadium during the Olympics, and the crowd went nuts. I have to
believe that will translate into ticket sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishou, who has seen increased interest in club shows around the
state in recent months, agrees. ``There is no reason why Atlanta
can't become a significant market for pro boxing,'' he said. ``We
have the infrastructure and the right demographics. I understand
the conditions to get a Holyfield fight or one like that have to be
incredibly favorable. But for this fight, they are. The ticket
prices will be low.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Atlanta hasn't developed into a strong boxing town,
despite Holyfield's presence, Mishou said, ``Part of it is the
image of the sport itself. That's not just a problem here; that's
all over the country. Also, Atlanta is a major-league sports town,
but it hasn't gotten there easily. Every sport has had to struggle
before it succeeded. I'm convinced boxing can do the same.''

 &HT;    Bengals seek turnaround for defense
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ The Cincinnati Bengals coaching staff is
documenting and deliberating every move in the much-ballyhooed
quarterback battle here between struggling incumbent Jeff Blake and
challenger Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bengals defense, which ranked 28th in 1997, might be
under even closer scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the playmakers we have (on offense), it almost seems
like we're going to put up points no matter who's playing
(quarterback),'' strong safety Sam Shade said. ``But if we don't
hold up our end of the deal. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Blake suffered through a 1997 season so miserable that coach
Bruce Coslet played aging Boomer Esiason for the final month. But
Cincinnati still managed to rank 10th in the NFL in both scoring
and total yards, because wide receivers Carl Pickens and Darnay
Scott are among the league's most talented and tailback Corey
Dillon is an emerging star.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bengals are to challenge Pittsburgh and Jacksonville in
the AFC Central, however, they must master defensive coordinator
Dick LeBeau's exotic zone-blitz scheme. The excitement about
LeBeau's return last year to Cincinnati, where he was coordinator
from 1984-91, did not match the results. Never before had a unit
led by LeBeau, 60, ranked so low _ the Bengals surrendered the most
first downs in the league (351) and the fourth-most points (405).
</P>
<P>
   A defense designed to pressure from unusual angles generated
only 35 sacks, 13 interceptions and 23 takeaways, while allowing
opponents a gaudy third-down conversion rate of 44.9 percent. The
7-9 Bengals lost three games in which their offense scored 20
points or more, including a 44-42 defeat at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply had too many players who didn't understand the
defense early on,'' LeBeau said. ``There was a painful transition
period, and it wasn't until the second half of the year when we
really started playing on the same page. We have to come together a
lot quicker this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   That feat could be difficult for a defense that figures to start
as many as eight players with four years or less of NFL experience.
The zone-blitz scheme, debuted by LeBeau in the late '80s and
originally designed to take advantage of the hybrid abilities of
strong safety David Fulcher, has evolved into a linebacker-driven
defense. At some point this year, LeBeau probably will be starting
three linebackers selected in the first round of the past two
drafts _ Reinard Wilson in 1997 and Takeo Spikes and Brian Simmons
in '98.
</P>
<P>
   That Spikes, the former Auburn and Washington County High School
star, will start in tonight's preseason opener against the New York
Giants is almost as significant as the fact Blake will open the
game at quarterback. As was the case with Wilson a year ago, Spikes
already has been somewhat overwhelmed by the complexities of the
zone-blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you learn everything, this defense is a linebacker's
dream, because it puts you in position to make a ton of big
plays,'' said Spikes, who will replace injured veteran Jerry
Olsavsky (dislocated wrist). ``But there's a lot of responsibility.
There are nights where you're studying the playbook and end up
giving yourself a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsavsky, an unheralded backup for the Steelers last year, was
injured during a Saturday scrimmage and will not play for eight
weeks. He is expected to be a steadying influence for the younger
linebackers. The annual battle of the bulge for James Francis, an
eight-year pro, might end in a pink slip and force LeBeau to play
natural inside linebacker Steve Tovar at an outside spot in the
Bengals' 3-4 front. Journeyman Gerald Dixon, who notched a
team-best 8 1/2 sacks, departed in free-agency.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before the regular season begins, third-year
inside linebacker Tom Tumulty appears to be the only established
starter. Still, there is optimism that the influx of athletic
defenders and the continuing growth of young veterans such as
Shade, Wilson, free safety Greg Myers and corner Ashley Ambrose
will bring improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more talent and definitely more understanding than
last year,'' said Wilson, a former Florida State defensive end who
collected three sacks in '97. ``Now we've got to turn that into
more results.''

 &HT;    Inmates denied cooling water, fans, group says
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A prisoner-advocacy group charged Friday that
some convicts in Texas' sweltering prisons are being denied water
and fans and others have been shackled on uncooled buses for as
long as 44 hours without adequate water or restroom breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials immediately rejected the allegations as untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lois Robison, chairwoman of Texas Citizens United
for Rehabilitation of Errants, said the group believes complaints
from convicts, guards and former prison workers about what she
called ``a growing problem'' with the way convicts are treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical, mental and medical abuses have been a constant
problem,'' Robison said at a Capitol news conference. ``This
summer's extreme heat combined with those ongoing abuses have
subjected prisoners to even more inhumane conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The group charged that water has been withheld from convicts at
some prisons on 100-degree days, that small fans have been
confiscated from convicts for rules infractions and that guards at
some prisons have closed doors and windows _ making it even hotter
inside convicts' cells.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Robison said prisoners with medical conditions or
who are on medications that impair the body's ability to cope with
the extreme heat have ``been forced into working or living
conditions that are injurious to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Other convicts have reported being prevented from lying on the
concrete floors of their cells to stay cool, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are prisoners just now at this late date getting fans?''
Robison said. ``Why are physically and mentally ill prisoners, many
of whom are on medications, subjected to torturous bus rides? Why
is (the prison agency) unable to control the behavior of its
staff?''
</P>
<P>
   Robison provided few details to bolster the group's allegations,
which she said are partly based on complaints from convicts or
guards who fear retaliation from prison officials if their
identities are made public.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice who sat in on the news conference, criticized the
allegations. ``It's not happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Convicts are bused between prisons only during the coolest hours
of the day, he said, and for no more than nine-hour trips at a
time. Although the prisoners ``are expected to use the restroom
facilities prior to leaving,'' Castlebury said, ``a stop may be
made at another (prison) unit or county jail if facilities are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   He also challenged the group's suggestion that temperatures in
some death row areas had reached 130 degrees. Robison said one of
her sons, Larry, is on death row. A second son, Steve, is serving a
17-year sentence at the Beto prison unit in northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are problems, we certainly want to deal with them,''
Castlebury said. ``But there's nothing to these.

 &HT;    NASCAR ready with rain tires
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watkins Glen, N.Y. -- If the rain that is forecast to hang
around for Sunday's Bud at the Glen materializes, NASCAR is ready
to roll with a tire developed for wet pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear unloaded 1,200 wet-weather tires Friday at Watkins Glen
International. They're stacked in the back of the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   The tire has been in development for three years and was tested
in practice during qualifying last year in Japan. Usually, NASCAR
stops its races when rain falls and tracks get wet. Some rain
delays to dry the surface have lasted more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the new tire, unlike the normal slick racing tire, has a
slightly raised tread (6/32nds of an inch) separated by a mid-tire
groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some rain, we'll make the decision then,'' NASCAR
spokesman Tim Sullivan said. In case of rain, NASCAR will call all
the cars into the pits under caution to switch to the wet-weather
tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup teams have been instructed to arrive here with
quick-mount windshield wipers, defoggers and tail-light assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a monsoon, we'll get everybody off the track, of
course,'' Sullivan said. ``But we're prepared to go under some
moderate rain conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of racing in the rain has met with mixed reactions
from drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not have the rain tires at Watkins Glen?'' Dale Earnhardt
asked. ``We used them in Japan for qualifying, and the Goodyear
engineers did a great job with them. We need to have a rain plan.
The fans deserve every effort to make sure we race when they have
it scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I do have some reservations with racing in the
rain,'' Terry Labonte said. ``My biggest concern is the lack of
visibility. It might be interesting, but I prefer to race under dry
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin shares Labonte's concern. ``I think it will be
difficult to actually race in the rain, due to the spray of 43 cars
on the road course at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew swaps
</P>
<P>
   Charley Pressley, one of the more experienced crew chiefs in
Winston Cup racing, has been named crew chief for Morgan-McClure
Motorsports, which runs the No. 4 Chevrolet. He has been with
Larrry Hedrick Motorsports and takes over for interim crew chief
Robert Larkins.
</P>
<P>
   At Hedrick, Tim Brewer was hired as crew chief of the No. 41
Chevrolet. Brewer has been in racing 29 years, 13 of those under
the legendary Junior Johnson. He has helped prepare cars that have
won 53 times and 54 pole positions.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett reflects
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week after running out of gas and losing any chance at
the Brickyard 400, Dale Jarrett was still emotional on Friday when
asked about the controversial point in the race when Ward Burton's
car was disabled on pit road and drivers expected a caution flag
that didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I didn't even want to come here (to the
media-center press conference) today, because it's over and done
with,'' Jarrett said. ``The PR department said we needed to come
and do this. I can honestly say I didn't think about that race all
week, except when I was awake.''
</P>
<P>
   He voiced frustration at NASCAR's inconsistent calls. ``We're
told in drivers' meetings that if you have a problem with your
race, get off the racing surface, we'll get you taken care of, just
don't create a bigger problem. Ward Burton did exactly what he's
instructed to do, and when I was out of fuel, I did the same thing,
too. But you can bet the next time my butt is stopping on that race
track, I'll get a caution.''

   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ We interrupt The Jeff Gordon Show to
present two giddy Winston Cup drivers who are happy just to be in a
Winston Cup, forget about starting second and fifth in Sunday's Bud
at the Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon rolled along Friday, taking the pole at Watkins Glen
International with a best qualifying time of 120.331 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But it was two substitute drivers, Ron Fellows and Boris Said,
with surprising finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows, a Busch driver, qualified second in the No. 96
Chevrolet with a lap of 120.002 mph. On Sunday, he'll run in his
second career Winston Cup race. He finished 35th here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shaking a little bit,'' Fellows said.
</P>
<P>
   Said, who drives in the NASCAR truck series, qualified the No.
23 Ford fifth at 119.780 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a little kid at Christmas,'' he said. ``It's just
hard to believe I'm out here driving with these heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Between these no-names, Ricky Rudd (119.914) qualified third and
Jeff Burton (119.910) fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is on another of those little successful streaks that
have marked his brief, but very profitable, stock-car driving
career.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent pole was four races ago at Sears Point, but the
Bud pole is Gordon's sixth this season. He has started on the front
row in nine of the last 11 races.
</P>
<P>
   He has won three of the last four Winston Cup races to sprint
out to a 72-point advantage over Mark Martin in the championship
points race.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, he's back to defend his victory here
last year, and he recalled Friday that this is the track that gave
him the comfort level he now has on road courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race last year did a lot for me, confidence-wise, on the
road courses,'' Gordon said. ``I didn't know if I was capable of
winning on a road course until we won here. I think that
transferred to winning at California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning at California has definitely brought some momentum
into this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's comfort level was obvious on a day when a number of
drivers had trouble staying on the course because of high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we didn't hit anything,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott never finished his lap after losing control and
getting into some gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got in a little too hard and hit that inside curb,'' he
said. ``When it did, it just launched me straight across.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way my year has been going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kenny Irwin, in the No. 28 Ford, hit some oil in turn
seven, spun around and then took the car back around in the wrong
direction before actually qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of weeks, I think I've gained 10 years in
qualifying,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bobby Labonte, who did not qualify, had to go to a backup
car after destroying the sheet metal on the rear of his No. 18
Pontiac after hitting a wall in the last five minutes of practice.

JUDGE SAYS STARR'S LEAKS MAY HAVE VIOLATED RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs for inserts in 2nd and 5th grafs.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has found that prosecutors
investigating President Clinton's relationship with a former intern
may have violated federal rules by providing protected grand jury
testimony to journalists, according to court papers that were
unsealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare ray of good news for the White House, Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court declared that Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, may have broken the
ethical code governing criminal investigations, in his remarks to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that Clinton's lawyers had compiled a persuasive list of
potential violations by Starr's office, she said in her ruling on
June 19 that the prosecutors now carry the burden of proof and must
demonstrate their innocence in a hearing to avoid contempt
citations and possible penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Starr appealed aspects of the ruling, delaying the hearing. On
Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals dealt a setback to Clinton. It
ruled that to prevent the disclosure of more secret information,
the president's lawyers could not question prosecutors themselves
during the hearing, nor subpoena documents, as Judge Johnson had
decreed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not address the substance of the
accusations against Starr, and its ruling will probably not affect
the grand jury investigation. All the court motions and decisions
related to the appeal of Judge Johnson's ruling were released
Friday by the appeals court, the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has repeatedly denied that his office illegally slipped
grand jury secrets to reporters. Dozens of members of his office
submitted affidavits to the judge declaring that they had not
disclosed any protected information cited in a laundry list of news
articles and broadcasts compiled in February by David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But in an opinion crackling with anger, Judge Johnson swatted
aside the affidavits as defining the secrecy rules ``too
narrowly,'' and complained of ``the serious and repetitive nature''
of the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   She cited comments by Starr quoted in the magazine ``Brill's
Content'' that he and his deputy, Jackie Bennett, spoke anonymously
with reporters. She challenged his quoted assertion that it did not
violate federal rules to disclose what witnesses had told
prosecutors or federal agents before they testified.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson also wrote that in May, Starr publicly praised as
``magnificent'' a ruling by her against a White House claim of
executive privilege. The ruling was sealed, Judge Johnson said with
unmistakable scorn, so Starr's comment both confirmed its existence
and revealed that it was favorable to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confirming the existence and substance of a sealed court
ruling presents a prima facie violation'' of the rules, she wrote,
and ``a violation of the court order not to discuss the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Friday, Starr said that he would provide the
court with evidence to assure it ``that we are committed to an
investigation that is conducted thoroughly, fairly, professionally,
and in full compliance with the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when Starr began looking into whether Clinton
lied under oath in denying a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and tried to cover it up, the White House has complained
bitterly about press reports on the investigation's progress that
were based on anonymous sources. Fanning public suspicion of the
prosecutors, Clinton's advisers and lawyers have repeatedly accused
them of violating federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded by accusing the White House itself of
leaking the information to discredit the prosecutors. Under the
federal rules, witnesses before a grand jury may describe their
testimony, but prosecutors and others with direct access to it are
bound to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has put news organizations in a paradoxical
position. Besides the leakers themselves, reporters covering the
Lewinsky investigation are the only ones in Washington who know the
truth of the accusations against Starr. Yet because they have
guaranteed their sources anonymity in exchange for information,
they are unable to inform their readers, listeners or viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Judge Johnson cited news reports by several
organizations, including CBS News, the New York Daily News, and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson's June 19 ruling was sealed, so White House
lawyers and advisers say they have stayed silent about it to avoid
committing the very transgression that so irritated her. They were
as delighted on Friday at the unsealing of the documents as fidgety
children for whom the recess bell has finally rung.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the 20-year history of the Independent
Counsel Act, a federal court has found prima facie evidence of
potential criminal wrongdoing by an independent counsel,'' said
James Kennedy, a spokesman. It is unlikely but possible that a
judge who finds that prosecutors deliberately leaked grand jury
secrets could refer them for disbarment or perhaps even criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, the president's private lawyer, said in a statement:
``The endemic and casual disclosures of grand jury information
which have characterized the past seven months'' of the
investigation ``are highly unprofessional and utterly
indefensible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House was particularly pleased with Judge Johnson's
ruling because she has been widely perceived as favoring Starr,
having rejected repeated efforts by Clinton's lawyers to assert
various forms of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the documents followed by one day Ms. Lewinsky's
appearance before a grand jury, in which she contradicted a
previous sworn account and testified that she and the president had
had a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statement, Starr said that in prompting a hearing
Kendall had faced a ``minimal'' burden of proof of illegal leaks.
All he had to do was put together a list of articles and broadcasts
that referred to ``sources in Starr's office'' and made similar
attributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper articles and media reports supporting the allegation
may be capable of various interpretations,'' Starr said. ``They may
even be erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals on July 10, Clinton's
lawyers went so far to as to argue that the investigation of the
prosecutors was at least as important as the investigation of the
president. The prosecutors, they wrote, ``are public servants
endowed with extraordinary power to conduct a grand jury
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson had given permission to Clinton's lawyers to
question members of Starr's office about their contacts with the
press, with the discovery process to begin on July 11. But the
appeals court, which had previously blocked the discovery while it
weighed the case, found that this approach would improperly impede
Starr's investigation into the president ``at a crucial juncture,''
and also risk the same sort of disclosure of grand jury secrets
that started the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it ruled, Judge Johnson must conduct the hearing
herself. If she is not satisfied with Starr's argument for his
innocence, she may then take further steps, including appointing a
``special master or other individual'' to conduct a further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court wrote in its decision that charges of
violating grand jury secrecy were ``not to be taken lightly.'' It
quoted Justice Felix Frankfurter as saying that to have a
prosecutor feed reporters information is to turn the state ``into a
conscious participant in trial by newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr took no testimony Friday. But in a further sign that
Capitol Hill is girding for the eventual delivery of his report on
the Lewinsky matter, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee announced
that they had hired three more lawyers to serve on their
investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   They include Abbe Lowell, a Washington litigator and lecturer,
who will serve as chief investigative counsel; Lis Wiehl, a
prosecutor from Washington state; and Deborah Rhode, a professor of
law at Stanford University and legal columnist.

U.S. sole men deploy 
defense to edge Italy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Some teams have the heart of a champion. Others,
like this U.S. squad that sometimes seems destined for gold, have
the soul of a winner. The sole of a winner, too, as it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Hawkins proving it really is the shoes that make
the difference, he and fellow point guard Kiwane Garris led the
U.S. team to a gutsy, hard-fought 80-77 victory over Italy on
Friday at Olympic Stadium and a spot in the medal round today
against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins scored 12 of his team-high 16 points in the second half,
when he was wearing teammate Trajan Langdon's left shoe after
Hawkins' rubber sole ripped while he was making a cut late in the
first half. The problem: Langdon wears a 12{. Hawkins is a size 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole sole was completely torn on the bottom of my shoe
from all the cutting,'' Hawkins said. ``So I had to go to one of
Trajan's shoes, which was a half-size small. It was really tight.
But I had to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Size didn't matter in this job. Once in a while, Cinderella has
to slip into a slightly tighter slipper.
</P>
<P>
   Snug shoe and all, Hawkins was the guiding force _ and he had a
lot of help from Garris and the rest of the strong-willed Americans
as the United States assured itself of a top-four finish in the
FIBA World Championship of Basketball. Not bad for replacement
players thrown together in less than a month. They played Italy
close virtually the entire game, with the momentum alternating.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the United States held Italy without a field goal
for the final 7:22 and kept the Italians scoreless on six of their
final seven possessions to outscore them 11-2 in the final 4:50.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a relief,'' said Garris, who had 11 points, all
in the final 6:36. ``Back home, people were talking that we weren't
going to do this and we weren't going to do that. We're happy and
relieved to be in the medal round. But now that we're there, we
have to take advantage of it and go for the gold. We don't want to
just settle for a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Added center Gerard King: ``Some people said we wouldn't get
there, so there's a sigh of relief. But we're not quite there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They could get there by Sunday. After the way the Americans
played Friday, it's looking as if they are capable of overcoming
any obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   They were ahead 59-53 after a 12-0 sprint, then let the Italians
come off the floor with an 11-0 run that put the United States in a
66-61 hole with just less than six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Garris scored for the first time with a 3-pointer, and with the
Americans down 75-69, Garris hit a driving bank shot with 3:30 to
go. The defense dug in and forced a turnover from Gregor Fucka.
Jimmy Oliver was fouled on the ensuing fast break and hit two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Myers, Italy's best scorer who lived at the free-throw
line all game but was only 7-for-21 from the field, would miss
three jumpers in the final 2:30, tarnishing his 32-point effort.
</P>
<P>
   When Garris hit two free throws with 1:28 left, the game was
tied at 75. Brad Miller grabbed a Myers miss, and Hawkins then was
isolated against his defender and converted it into a drive down
the lane and a 10-foot bank shot for the lead with 41 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy (Tomjanovich, the U.S. coach) opened the court for me
because he knew I could take the guy,'' Hawkins said. ``I crossed
him over and got into the heart of the defense and waited to see
what the big guy was going to do. He stayed under the basket, so I
shot the jumper. And I did mean for it to go off the backboard. The
guys were kidding me about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy tied the game when Myers hit two of his 15 free throws
with 27.2 seconds left. It was the only points for Italy in the
final 3:43.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Alexis, who had 14 points, was fouled quickly and hit
two free throws with 25.7 seconds to go. When Myers missed a
3-pointer with Alexis' hand in his face, Garris rebounded and made
one of two free throws with 2.9 seconds left for the final score.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans felt the pressure that the quarterfinal round can
produce earlier. They were chasing the Italians throughout most of
the first half after squandering an early 11-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is money time. This is crunch time,'' Tomjanovich said.
``We lose this one, and it's: `Hey, we heard you guys were pretty
good. How was it over there?' And all the work these guys had done
(would have been lost).
</P>
<P>
   ``These are a bunch of hard-working guys. But it's a struggle
out there. We had times when we didn't look too damn good out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And a loss meant no chance at a medal.

AND SOUTHERN STATES: FOR CAMPAIGN 2000, A MONTH OF TUESDAYS  
 ARIZONA: NO. 9, NO. 9, NO. 9? NOT IN THIS STATE   
 MISSOURI: DESEGREGATION DIVIDES SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the spring of 1984, some Southern states got together
and created the first regional ``Super Tuesday'' by scheduling
their presidential primaries for the same early date in the
nominating season. Their aim was to increase the South's clout in
the presidential picking process by weighing in with a big bag of
votes while the process was still young enough to be influenced.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other regions have also toyed with the concept,
setting off a wild quadrennial scramble to be in the forefront of
primary and caucus voting. Adding to the freneticism, some big
individual states, like California, have also joined the scramble.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when the National Association of Secretaries of
State held its annual convention in Salt Lake City _ the
secretaries enforce election laws in most states _ there was a lot
of talk about bringing some order and calm to the nominating
process, possibly by establishing a series of five regional
primaries to be held one month after another, with the order of
voting to be rotated every four years. Iowa, which traditionally
has held the first caucuses, and New Hampshire, which traditionally
has held the first primary, would be excepted from the new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, the secretaries hope to be ready to present a detailed
regional primaries plan to the nation's state legislators and
governors. But where that will all come out is at best a guess and,
in any event, not much is likely to be acted upon before the 2004
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the scramble is on for primary and caucus
position in the 2000 presidential election, with March 7 shaping up
as the mother of all blockbuster Super Tuesdays if some states and
regions don't back off.
</P>
<P>
   California is talking to Oregon and Washington about setting
that date for a Pacific Coast Super Tuesday. Arizona and a
half-dozen other Southwestern and mountain states may also set
aside that day _ or maybe an earlier day _ for a Western Super
Tuesday .
</P>
<P>
   The New England states, other than New Hampshire, are talking
about a May 7 Yankee Super Tuesday, with maybe New York joining in.
Likewise, Maryland is thinking about holding a Mid-Atlantic Super
Tuesday that day, if it can persuade Pennsylvania and Delaware to
go along.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wants to hold a Prairie Super Tuesday, providing it can
persuade other farm belt states to join in _ at an early date. The
Southern states, though they started the regional Super Tuesday
trend, have said little about their schedule for 2000, but they
almost surely will opt again for an early date, maybe even March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting to be a bigger mess than ever, a political and
civic crisis,'' William Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of
state, commented the other day after the Salt Lake City meeting.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9, No. 9, No. 9? Not in Arizona
</P>
<P>
   The lottery was a form of gambling found in only a few states
until a quarter of a century ago. The others were too straitlaced
to permit it.
</P>
<P>
   But lottery fever has since swept the country and now 37 states
and the District of Columbia have lotteries. The players love the
whopping multi-million-dollar jackpots _ the latest Powerball prize
was almost $300 million _ and state legislators love to use what is
left over to finance new government goodies like schools, roads and
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lottery is not everybody's game. Just as opposition
is beginning to build in some parts of the country to spreading
numbers of electronic poker parlors and riverboat and Indian
reservation casinos, in Arizona opposition to the lottery is
building.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful group of social conservatives in the state
legislature has succeeded in forcing a statewide vote this fall on
whether to keep or kill the lottery, which has been a sanctioned
Arizona money game since 1981. The group argues that the
get-rich-quick tease of the lottery is ultimately destructive, not
just depleting paychecks and emptying bank accounts but, worse,
destroying families.
</P>
<P>
   No other state has scrapped a lottery, not once its citizens and
legislators got hooked on the big jackpots and extra revenue for
schooling, transportation and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arizonans want to keep their lottery, polls indicate. But
its opponents are not without a case. Besides their argument that
the lottery is socially destructive _ a powerful argument in a
state as conservative as Arizona _ they also have the results from
a recent state audit of the lottery operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery sales have been flat for several years, the auditors
found, mainly because of inept management. How inept?
</P>
<P>
   A new computerized bingo game that was designed to increase
sales turned out to be a bust. Even more embarrassing, a computer
program designed to run the Pick 3 game could never find the number
nine.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery director was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation Divides Missouri Senate Race
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon of Missouri had no trouble winning
the Democratic nomination in last Tuesday's U.S. Senate primary.
But a major political problem he faced before the primary is still
with him as he heads into an uphill general election battle with
the Republican incumbent, Christopher Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primary campaign, Nixon was severely criticized
by many of Missouri's top black leaders for calling for an end to
state aid for school desegregation programs. And no sooner was the
primary over than those critics resumed the attack, with the St.
Louis office of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People warning top national Democrats that they would be
confronted by pickets if they showed up at any Nixon fund-raising
events in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked to choose between a flawed candidate like Nixon and
respecting an NAACP picket line,'' the NAACP chapter president,
Charles Mischeaux, wrote in a letter sent to such leading national
Democrats as Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, as well as to the Democratic National Committee, ``I
am hopeful you will choose the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, now trailing in a race the experts originally predicted
would be closer all the way, needs every bit of campaign money he
can raise and _ every bit as serious _ he can ill afford to be at
odds with Missouri blacks, a significant part of the Democratic
base in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general contends that the Mischeaux letter is
nothing more than a recycling of an old complaint. He contends that
in the primary, he ran well in black precincts all over the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bond sees the letter as proof of great disarray in the Nixon
campaign. He says he, by contrast, is having good success drawing
blacks to his campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan, the state's top elected Democrat, is holding
talks with black leaders in an effort to heal the racial rift
within the party.

   The images hardly make for compelling television: mostly Monica
Lewinsky getting out of cars and Kenneth Starr getting into them.
The talking heads make up a largely over-exposed collection of
former prosecutors, defense attorneys and pundits. And often there
hasn't been a whole lot of hard news to headline.
</P>
<P>
   But for 24-hour cable news networks like MSNBC, CNBC, Fox News
and CNN, all that does not seem to matter. The questions that would
dominate dinner party conversation these days are apparently enough
to sustain what some have come to call ``All Monica All the Time'':
Will the dress test positive? Will the president submit his saliva?
What is Ms. Lewinsky's state of mind?

<P>
   Beyond the talk show clatter, the Monica Lewinsky story is big
business, meaning more revenue and higher ratings to shows that
mostly struggle at the margins, looking for, at best, the
mysterious murder of a beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   Where initially this kind of round-the-clock coverage, ushered
in by the Gulf War, appeared to be dictated by news developments,
now it seems largely fueled by the bottom line. All-news channels
depend on events like the O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess
Diana and now the trials and tribulations of President Clinton for
their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs live or die on issues of this sort,'' said
Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ``Because talk is
the cheapest form of entertainment, it can fill hours of air time
at the lowest possible cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news executives say they are simply responding to the
demands of the marketplace. ``Do I think we're crisis-driven now?
No,'' said John Moody, vice president of news editorial at Fox
News. ``The nation's viewing habits are changing. There's always
someone who wants to find out what's going on. This is not a
country that's all at home at 6:30 to watch Dan or Peter or Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   But media experts say cable news networks are not yet
established enough to eat into the networks in the absence of a big
breaking story. ``The worst thing that can happen to a CNN is for
there not to be a Monica Lewinsky or an O.J. Simpson or a war,
because you don't get any of these peaks and surges in viewing,''
said Larry Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates, a media research and
consulting firm based in Carmel, Calif. ``No news is bad news for
these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the cable universe is so much smaller than the broadcast
universe, media experts say _ 66 million households vs. 100
million, according to one estimate _ a little lift goes a long way.
A story like this one, for example, can boost a program's rating
from a 0.1 or 0.3 to a 0.3 or a 0.6. ``In broadcast terms, that's
nothing,'' said John P. Ellis, a marketing and advertising
consultant who has advised CNBC. ``But in cable terms, it's called
doubling your audience. To cable news people, Monica is a huge
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a story like the Lewinsky scandal not only helps
fledgling all-news cable shows build ratings and get noticed,
television experts say, it goes straight to the bottom line,
particularly because these programs have fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case like this, for cable news shows over the coming year,
is probably worth in the tens of millions of dollars,'' said Larry
Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc. a
Carmel, Calif.-based media research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how long it drags out, maybe even in the
hundreds,'' Gerbrandt continued, ``because future ad time is based
on historic viewing patterns. So the benefit really comes over the
next year to 18 months.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   For what are called spot advertising buys _ time that has not
been purchased in advance _ for example, cable news channels can
adjust their prices upwards depending on the daily Nielsen ratings
data, Ellis explained. ``Cable news is very spot market heavy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cable shows may reach a relatively small audience
compared with the networks, media experts say, their influence is
considerably broader. Networks and print organizations, cable news
executives note, are fueled by the constant scandal updates
available from their cable competitors. ``When the soap opera on
the news channels is better than the soap opera on the networks,
then I think it does provide a certain amount of pressure,'' Moody
said. ``Despite protestations that we're saturating America's
living rooms with tawdry detail, that same detail is exactly what's
being demanded by our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this means people like Geraldo Rivera are having a very
good time. Prime time ratings for his program, ``Rivera Live'' on
CNBC, which has devoted its hour to the Lewinsky-Clinton story
night after night, are up nearly 30 percent for the month of July
compared with the same period last year, from 438,000 households to
567,000.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rivera Live' has clearly found its niche,'' Rivera said.
``It's by seeking the nuance and promising your audience that
you'll report every significant development that you build an
expectation that, when push comes to shove, there's only one show
to turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' which started a
year and a half ago and appears just before Rivera's program on
CNBC, saw its prime-time ratings increase 57 percent for July
compared with last year and 147 percent in the program's midnight
time slot, when it is rebroadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cable news anchors are quite so proud. Keith Olbermann,
whose program ``White House in Crisis'' on MSNBC was started in
February in response to the Lewinsky story, has done some public
chest-thumping about his own coverage. In a May 23 speech to his
alma mater, Cornell University, he said: ``There are days now when
my line of work makes me ashamed, makes me depressed, makes me cry
... . About three weeks ago, I awakened from my stupor on this
subject and told my employers that I simply could not continue
doing this show about the endless investigation and the
investigation of the investigation, and the investigation of the
investigation of the investigation. I had to choose what I felt in
my heart was right, over what I felt in my wallet was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olbermann, who declined to comment, is still on the air
every night, discussing the latest Lewinsky speculation on MSNBC's
``The Big Show.'' Erik Sorensen, the executive vice president in
charge of programming at MSNBC who only started at the network last
week, said this kind of ambivalence comes with the territory.
``There is a lot about this story that a lot of us covering it
aren't particularly crazy about,'' he said. ``But that's what we do
for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news shows have been criticized on the Lewinsky story,
along with the mainstream press, for vamping without substance and
for vague attribution. Indeed, Gerbrandt suggested that the report
about nerve gas in Vietnam, which got CNN into trouble recently,
was an example of an ill-fated effort to generate excitement in a
slow news period. ``That story on nerve gas is the result of a CNN
trying to make sure they have an ongoing series of reports that can
attract viewers,'' Gerbrandt said, ``realizing that you can't count
on a scandal or a disaster or a trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, correspondents say their information is no less
reliable because they have so much time to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, for example, made a point of saying on the air last week
that he stood by his report of Aug. 4 alleging that the infamous
dress had tested positive for ``human genetic material,'' which he
attributed to ``one source very close to the president.'' NBC last
week sent out a message warning its other reporters not to pick up
Rivera's report and saying the network had not confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been wrong yet,'' Rivera said. ``In that sense, I'm
still living as queen for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is viewing newscasters like Rivera as
royalty. ``For me, I am finding _ as there is this explosion of
talk, talk, talk _ that I cannot listen to the din,'' said Kalb of
Harvard. ``I'm not learning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton story shows few signs of receding, cable
news executives acknowledge that there will come a time when Ms.
Lewinsky will be old news. ``I'm already losing sleep over it,''
said Sorensen of MSNBC. ``Inevitably, this story is going to end
and, as an all-news channel, we rely on reality _ and we need
reality to cooperate.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard D. Nanula is not in the middle of changing jobs and
moving, he likes to unwind by watching five television sets at
once, using a customized touch pad to change channels quickly and
adjust the sound. Oh, and he sometimes reads at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a multiprocessor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And listening to Nanula, 38, talk about his life is also like
watching several channels at once.
</P>
<P>
   There he is at the Walt Disney Co., which hired him out of
Harvard Business School 12 years ago and named him chief financial
officer at the age of 31. He quickly made his mark, negotiating
long and hard to get the troubled Euro Disney theme park on firmer
financial footing, handling more than $1 billion of financing for
Disney films and issuing rare 100-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is pursuing his second career as one of the world's
greatest sports fans. He once moved intensive business negotiations
to the Super Bowl so he wouldn't miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers
center, had moved into his Beverly Hills neighborhood last summer,
Nanula got his wish for a pick-up game with him.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is again, in a T-shirt, sunglasses and a baseball
cap, on the back cover of the menu at the recently opened ESPN Zone
restaurant in Baltimore. The restaurant is a Disney property, and
executives who knew of Nanula's passion for sports agreed that he
should be the poster boy for serious fandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite things I've ever done,'' Nanula said
of the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nanula (pronounced na-NOO-lah) faces perhaps the hardest
thing he's ever done, taking over as chief executive of Starwood
Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the world's largest hotel company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his challenge. By acquiring Westin Hotels and ITT,
Starwood has become, in a way, a $16 billion start-up. And Nanula,
who became its chief on June 1, must now assemble a team to run
Starwood's many distinct parts _ including the Caesars World
casinos and the company's Sheraton and luxury hotels _ and assemble
three companies into one at its new headquarters in White Plains,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs, he is using the company's size to renegotiate
contracts for its 650 hotels on everything from mattresses to
shrimp to long-distance service. He hopes to raise revenues by,
among other things, stitching together reservation systems and
frequent-guest programs.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Starwood is growing, with 125,000 employees and
$1 billion of projects in the pipeline, and it is starting a new
brand, W Hotels, to compete in the so-called boutique hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   Lest Nanula's job grow too dull, he must also develop a new
corporate structure for Starwood, which recently lost a battle with
Congress and the White House to extend the tax advantages of its
unusual corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price, meanwhile, has sagged, along with
others in the lodging industry; Starwood shares have fallen 5.7
percent over the last year, better than the 6.4 percent drop in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange index of real estate investment
trusts but well below the 16.7 percent gain in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anyone has tried to pull off what we're doing
here,'' Nanula said during three hours of interviews squeezed into
his schedule. ``It is a big and interesting challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake is the reputation of Barry S. Sternlicht, a
longtime friend of Nanula. Sternlicht, who is 37, built Starwood at
breakneck speed and is now its chairman, but he acknowledges that
he lacks the operational skills to make it all work. Nanula's
efforts will go a long way toward determining whether Sternlicht
will be regarded in coming years as a savvy deal maker or as
someone who paid too much to create an unwieldy corporate giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see today is a company operating on 2 of its 12
cylinders,'' Sternlicht said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people on Wall Street are betting that Nanula can make
Starwood hum, though no one minimizes the enormity of his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Richard Nanula to have left his job at Disney says a lot
about what he believes is the potential for Starwood,'' said Jason
N. Ader, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. ``But he's got to focus to
manage the assimilation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanula's route to Starwood can be traced, in part, to his
penchant for juggling several tasks.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day at Harvard, in 1984, he took a seat in the
lecture hall at the end of the last row _ or ``skydeck,'' as the
students called it _ so he could read newspapers and magazines or
do course work when class discussions bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Two seats away sat Sternlicht, another multitasker. ``I'm really
good at doodling and listening at the same time, which drives
people crazy because they don't think I'm listening,'' he explained
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The two had pursued different academic interests. Sternlicht was
a liberal arts major at Brown University in a program called Law
and Society (or ``Lost in Society,'' as he called it). Nanula
studied economics at the University of California at Santa Barbara
and was a certified public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   But the men soon found common ground. They spent many Sunday
afternoons watching football together. During intramural basketball
games, Sternlicht played point guard, often setting up Nanula, who
is said to have a pretty good outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht also helped Nanula land his first job. In their
second year, Sternlicht organized a field study project at Disney,
in part because he had a good contact there, but also because
Disney was far away from the chilly Northeast. He recruited four
classmates, including Nanula, to study the feasibility of a new
theme-park attraction of mini-factories showing how things like
bread and cheese are made.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula made a quick impression on Disney executives and was
hired into the strategic planning department even before the
students made their final presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht was not jealous, he said, because he preferred to
work in a smaller company. ``I didn't like hierarchy,'' he said.
``My goal was to do deals, to learn to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nanula, though, was drawn to the breadth and complexity of a
large corporation. He was also following in the footsteps of his
father, who had run companies that made products ranging from
cooling towers to automatic sprinkler systems (and, on occasion,
was known to read a book in front of the TV).
</P>
<P>
   Though fast friends, Nanula and Sternlicht assumed that they
would never work together. But they soon found themselves sitting
across from each other at a negotiating table. Sternlicht landed a
job at JMB Realty in Chicago, and he and Nanula haggled over the
sale to JMB of the real estate assets of Disney's Arvida
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed in touch _ Nanula sometimes called Sternlicht to
needle him about the California weather _ and they often went on
vacations and attended the NCAA Final Four together. But their
career paths were very different.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht's trajectory dipped sharply early on. He led a team
that analyzed the finances of Randsworth Trust PLC, a British real
estate company, before JMB and some American pension funds bought
it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Randsworth collapsed two years later, for a loss of more than
$425 million. Sternlicht has said he was made the scapegoat for the
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But failure, he said, ``teaches you intellectual discipline and
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after he left JMB, Sternlicht started Starwood Capital
with investments from the Ziff publishing family and others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Starwood, named for the community near Aspen, Colo.,
where it was assembled, bought its first hotels. The company took
off in 1995, when it acquired Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate
investment trust and standard operating company that traded as a
single stock _ a so-called paired-share or stapled REIT.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with its special structure, Starwood stormed the industry,
acquiring properties and companies that today give it hotels or
casinos in 70 countries. For most of that time, Starwood's stock
has performed well, far surpassing the average for hotel companies
and REITs. It has risen 284 percent in the last three and a half
years, despite its recent drop.
</P>
<P>
   At Disney, meanwhile, Nanula rose quickly. As chief financial
officer, he not only handled the negotiations over Euro Disney, now
known as Disneyland Paris, but also revamped the way Disney
financed its films, making the terms not quite so favorable to
outside investors. He learned Disney's businesses, from theme parks
to films to retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula also picked up a few things that would come in handy at
Starwood. For one thing, Disney has about 25,000 hotel rooms. And
Nanula has some familiarity with casinos, having made regular trips
with friends to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   As chief financial officer, Nanula was known to push colleagues
time and again for more analysis to back up recommendations to
invest in new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good in a company where risk is part of the
culture, but where you have to manage risk in a conservative
fashion,'' Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said in a recent
interview. ``He has pretty good antennae for spotting problems in
advance of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner made Nanula president of the company's Disney Store
Worldwide unit in November 1994 to give him operating experience.
Without it, Eisner said, ``he wouldn't have been able to go all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nanula's replacement as chief financial officer, Stephen P.
Bollenbach, left in early 1996 to become chief executive of the
Hilton Hotels Corp., Eisner named Nanula to the job again, to help
integrate Disney's $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula's accounting for the purchase was questioned in a lengthy
article in Barron's in March of this year; it said Disney had
created an undisclosed reserve of as much as $2.5 billion to absorb
expenses related to the merger without reducing its reported
earnings. When asked about this, Nanula said, ``Nobody who was up
on accounting standards ever questioned the accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Nanula immersed himself in the life of a Disney
executive. He stared down the difficult decision of which
character's costume to wear for a stroll through Disney World as
part of a theme-park orientation. (He chose Tigger,
Winnie-the-Pooh's sidekick). He met his future wife at Disney _
Tracey Hart, an executive assistant in strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   And his wealth rose. The 1997 Disney proxy said Nanula was paid
a salary of $632,692, plus a $1.3 million bonus. His exercisable
options had gained about $15 million in value. Options that he lost
upon leaving the company were worth an additional $30 million or
so.
</P>
<P>
   (Starwood has not released details of Nanula's pay package,
including the degree to which he was compensated for what he gave
up, though he has invested about $500,000 in Starwood stock.
Besides nurturing his own holdings, Nanula will now play an
important role in sustaining his friend's wealth; Sternlicht owns
Starwood stock worth about $400 million, plus options worth $80
million at the end of last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives grew to rely on Nanula to add levity to
meetings. If someone proposed an idea that no one liked, Nanula
might break the silence by saying: ``That's a great idea. It would
put us out of business in three days. But that's a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the CFO, or the CEO, you've got to say `no' a lot
without having everybody hate your guts,'' Nanula said. ``You want
them to keep coming up with good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanula built a collection of 50 Disney neckties and appeared to
be settling in for the long haul. He was often mentioned as an
eventual successor to Eisner. ``I never thought a minute about
leaving Disney,'' Nanula said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ever multitasking, Nanula often offered Sternlicht advice _
on everything from takeover tactics to dismissing executives. ``I'm
not good at firing people,'' Sternlicht said. ``When I had to let
somebody go, Richard and I would rehearse what I was going to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   They also helped each other through difficult personal times.
Last year, Sternlicht learned that his youngest son had juvenile
diabetes, and Nanula's twin daughter and son were born 15 weeks
early, weighing only one and a quarter pounds each. (Nanula's
children are now fine, and Sternlicht has joined the board of the
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.)
</P>
<P>
   As Starwood grew, Sternlicht mentioned the possibility of
turning his friendship with Nanula into a business partnership. But
Nanula politely waved off the idea. When Sternlicht closed in on
the $13.3 billion deal to acquire ITT, however, he raised the issue
again. This time, Nanula had a different answer: He would consider
it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht was certain that his friend would be the best
candidate, even though working so closely together would put their
friendship at risk. But the decision to hire a chief executive
would have to be made by Starwood's directors.
</P>
<P>
   There were other candidates. Buying some of them out of
option-laden contracts, however, would have been too costly. One
even demanded that he be given the chairman's title after a year.
``That's a little overreaching, I'm afraid,'' Sternlicht told him.
</P>
<P>
   The board settled on Nanula, in part because of his skills,
which complemented Sternlicht's, and in part because of the
chemistry between them.
</P>
<P>
   Though they walk into each other's offices at least a dozen
times a day to run through decisions, in the kind of shorthand that
develops between friends, Nanula and Sternlicht are still
adjusting. ``It's just very different having him next to me,''
Sternlicht said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nanula is often on the road, flying in a Gulfstream IV jet
to visit the company's many operations, refining goals for managers
and setting a tone for the company.
</P>
<P>
   He likes meetings with free-wheeling discussions, like those he
had at Harvard and Disney. ``There's no teacher,'' he said, ``just
a bunch of us in the room figuring out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nanula has little patience for people who are unprepared,
and he will direct a manager to do more homework before setting up
another meeting or phone call with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Wells was that way,'' he said, speaking of Disney's late
president. ``He would simply say, `Go get the answers, and we'll
make the decision when you get them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Nanula calls managers far down the ladder to get
front-line perspective. And he often sends managers handwritten
notes with a simple happy face or frowning face sketched in the
corner, for a quick take on his mood.
</P>
<P>
   This approach, he said, ``takes the edge off a little bit'' _ an
edge that is likely to exist when older executives find themselves
reporting to a thirtysomething boss. But former ITT executives who
are the resident graybeards at Starwood say that, after the first
few weeks, they like working for Nanula.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell by the way he asks questions that he wants to
gather all the facts,'' said Daniel P. Weadock, 59, a special
assistant to the chairman after working for ITT, in one stint as
president of its hotels, for all but one of the years that Nanula
has been alive. ``They do take the input I give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanula grew up in Pasadena and Santa Rosa, Calif. He held a
number of jobs as a teen-ager, waiting on tables many a summer _
``good, general people training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said they were at times concerned that Richard had
too many irons in the fire, his schoolwork competing with jobs,
sports and dating.
</P>
<P>
   But Nanula grew into a serious student at Santa Barbara. With
many fellow students pursuing majors in partying, Nanula saw an
opportunity. ``If I was the only one studying,'' he said, ``I could
probably get A-pluses and get into any business school I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did, though Harvard deferred his acceptance, so he
went to Deloitte, Haskins &AMP; Sells in Atlanta for two years,
becoming a CPA.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula, whose father is white and mother black, said he rarely
encountered racism growing up in mainly white neighborhoods,
perhaps in part because his light skin color made many people think
he was Hawaiian or Egyptian. ``Thankfully, nobody really cared,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   And today, he said, he does not often think about being one of
the few blacks in the highest ranks of corporate America. ``I do
believe in being a good role model,'' he said. ``But I've generally
just operated on doing my job, and race and age and background has
never really played into it very much, so I've just not focused on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, as he waits for his new house in Greenwich, Conn.,
to be renovated, he is focusing on Starwood during long workdays,
though he tries to be at home to help put his children to bed and
spend time with his wife, as well as to see his two golden
retrievers. He generally brings home a briefcase of work for the
weekend. There is not much time to watch even one television set.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sternlicht have talked about working out together again,
playing basketball or taking a ``spinning'' class _ Nanula said he
is a ``gigantic fanatic'' about riding an exercise bike to pounding
music for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found time to do either one of them yet,'' he said.
``But we'll do that.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ In a closed-door meeting Friday with
Vice President Al Gore sitting between them, an emotional Buddy
MacKay finally got the endorsement he so dearly wanted from U.S.
Rep. Alcee Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, whose campaign for governor has been damaged by
bickering among black and white leaders in the Democratic Party,
said the endorsement from Hastings is a major step toward bringing
the party back together and moving his campaign forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings agreed, but he also said Democrats still will have to
prove that they are taking blacks seriously. Hastings, a three-term
congressman and powerful voice in the black community, said more
blacks must be appointed to top party positions and made a part of
campaigns throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   During the hour-long meeting, Lt. Gov. MacKay became emotional
as he talked to a group of about 25 people that included
representatives from the NAACP, seven state House members and
Democratic Party chairman Mitch Ceasar.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay talked about the difficulties the party has faced ever
since the ouster eight months ago of state Rep. Willie Logan of
Opalocka as the first black Democratic House leader. The ouster,
done with little warning, was orchestrated by 31 white House
Democrats and caused a firestorm in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was touched by the fact that many of those in the room
were close friends, MacKay became emotional because, ``I respected
the difficulty of the situation. They were there and I appreciated
it and it was emotional for me, yes. They were doing something that
was hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the meeting ended, Hastings, D-Miramar, said, ``I
don't think the Democratic Party will ever take black people for
granted again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore, MacKay, his running mate Rick Dantzler, Hastings,
Gov. Lawton Chiles and other top Democratic leaders spoke at a
``united for victory'' rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no great need for high drama, there is no great need
for looking into the past, we're all here to do one thing and one
thing only, and I'm certainly going to make it clear that I'm
supporting Buddy MacKay and Rick Dantzler,'' Hastings shouted to a
cheering crowd of about 200 at the Fort Lauderdale Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, divisions remain. Some black state lawmakers are angered
by Hastings' attempt to step into the middle of the selection of a
new Democratic House leader to replace Logan. They say the
congressman has no business interfering with state House business.
</P>
<P>
   Since Logan's ouster, Hastings has been one of the loudest
voices of protest. He said the issue ``is not about personality but
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   As the issue festered, Logan began working closely with
Republicans and Democrats began to fear that significant numbers of
black voters would abandon the party. Hastings, in meetings at the
White House with Gore, warned that Democrats risked not only losing
the governor's race but also possibly losing the state in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page letter in Friday's edition of the Broward Times,
a widely read black newspaper, state Rep. Josephus Eggelletion Jr.,
who hopes to replace Logan as House leader, sharply criticized
Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Hastings for attempting to be the sole voice of
black leadership and said he resented Hastings' implication that
Eggelletion and other black leaders ``need your personal permission
and approval regarding the decisions we make in the representation
of our constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the crowd at the rally that he came to Florida to help
unite the party at the urging of Hastings. But whether Hastings can
bring all of the squabbling black Democrats together remained in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore attended a hurricane preparedness
meeting. He also attended a private money-raising reception that
collected an estimated $200,000 for the state Democratic Party.

PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER SUED BY OWN REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Cipriano, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, sued
his editor and his newspaper for defamation Friday after the
editor, Robert Rosenthal, was quoted as saying the reporter ``has a
very strong personal point of view and an agenda. ... There were
things that Ralph wrote that we didn't think were truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal's comments came in a June 13 article in The Washington
Post about Cipriano's decision to publish in The National Catholic
Reporter an article about the business practices of the
archdiocese. The article included unpublished reporting that
Cipriano said he had done for The Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which also names the paper's owner, Knight Ridder
Newspapers Inc., as a defendant, chronicles the history of
Cipriano's difficulties with his editors _ in particular the
disagreements over his coverage of the Philadelphia archdiocese and
Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Cipriano, who currently covers neighborhoods in
South Philadelphia, said his editors, under pressure from the
archdiocese and concerned about falling circulation, ``watered
down'' his copy. Later, he said, his city editor told colleagues
``that Cipriano was `biased' and `had an ax to grind,''' the suit
documents said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Rosenthal was returned by Pamela Browner, the paper's
vice president for business and community relations, who said: ``We
disagree with Ralph because we believe our coverage of the
archdiocese of Philadelphia has been fair, accurate and relevant.
We regret that Ralph has chosen a lawsuit as his means of
addressing the matter of how the Inquirer covers a topic of great
interest to our readers.''

GROWING CHORUS OF CONCERN OVER THE `SILENT' EPIDEMIC OF
HEPATITIS  C 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 25 years have passed since Paul McVetty,
now 44, roamed the streets of San Francisco, shooting drugs,
sharing needles, embracing havoc with fellow runaways.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McVetty hit bottom, got clean, got married, launched a career in
the gourmet coffee business and moved to Marin County. The wild
times, it seemed, had left no scars.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   McVetty is in the final stages of liver disease, a victim of the
quiet rampage of hepatitis C: a devilish blood-borne virus that
infects an estimated 4 million people nationwide _ four times the
number of Americans infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although hepatitis C is hardly as fearsome a killer as HIV, it
cuts a much broader swath. &UR;  &LR; Intravenous drug users are its primary
victims, but it has also hit such celebrities as singer Naomi Judd
and actor Larry Hagman. Baseball great Mickey Mantle died of cancer
after liver failure attributed to both alcohol and HCV, as it is
known.
</P>
<P>
   So quietly does the virus take its toll, it has long been called
``the silent epidemic.'' But the number of deaths from HCV is
expected to triple within the next 10 years. And as the death count
rises, so have the voices of people like McVetty, one among
thousands of recent recruits in a swelling grassroots movement.
</P>
<P>
   The volume can only increase:
</P>
<P>
   -- One in every 65 Americans harbors HCV, which is spread
through contact with infected blood. Hepatitis C is the No. 1 cause
of liver failure leading to transplant; it is also a significant
factor in liver cancer and big trouble for those also infected with
HIV or the other hepatitis viruses, A and B.
</P>
<P>
   -- Officials in charge of the nation's blood supply have been
sending alerts this year to some of the 300,000 Americans who may
have received HCV-tainted blood transfusions before 1992, when the
first effective screens against the virus were implemented.
</P>
<P>
   -- At least one class action lawsuit is in the works amid
complaints that the blood supply warnings should have been sounded
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   -- HCV-related legislation has been introduced everywhere from
Washington, D.C., to state capitols and city halls _ including
Sacramento and San Francisco. Measures typically call for more
government-led research and public education, but big money has not
been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   -- Although HCV infections can be treated, drugs are expensive,
difficult to take and help fewer than half of all patients.
</P>
<P>
   -- There's no cure in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous virus,'' said California state Sen.
Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, sponsor of a California measure, SB
694, that would direct state health officials to set up
HCV-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, doctors are reeling from an onslaught of
public concern, which they say has been veering dangerously close
to panic in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Dr. Teresa Wright, chief of
gastroenterology at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, where a large number of patients test positive for HCV. ``I
feel as if there's a tsunami wave about to land on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert, Dr. Leonard Seeff, senior scientist at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., is calling for a step back
from ``mass hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe for one moment that this is a benign
disease,'' Seeff said. ``But my concern is, we are going to provoke
an enormous amount of potentially unwarranted anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Many organizers in the hepatitis C movement agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need hype,'' said Ron Duffy, 46, a substance-abuse
counselor in Oakland who contracted HCV from a 1972 transfusion
while serving in Vietnam, and who now needs a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   What activists say they do need, however, is troop strength. And
they're getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finally waking up,'' said Brian D. Klein, 40, an
HCV carrier helping to organize the fledgling Hepatitis C Action
and Advocacy Coalition, a group based in San Francisco and inspired
by the success of AIDS organizations such as ACT UP. The group
plans to protest what members call price-gouging by the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   In California alone, at least 40 patient-advocacy and support
groups have sprung up in recent years; group leaders hope to forge
a statewide coalition. Duffy, who in 1995 founded the HCV Global
Foundation in Oakland, expects to draw about 1,000 people to a
hepatitis C conference August 23-25 at the Oakland Marriott City
Center.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the state, with about half a million HCV
carriers, is at the forefront of the grassroots response to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next big epidemic,'' said Bill Remak, a recent
liver-transplant recipient and coordinator of a Marin County
support group sponsored by the American Liver Foundation. ``Every
month, it seems a new support group is starting up somewhere.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
For years, hepatitis C did not even have a name. It was known only
as ``non-A, non-B'' hepatitis until the late 1980s, when scientists
at Chiron Corp., in Emeryville, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta managed to clone the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Detectable only through antibody and genetic tests, ``hepC'' was
discovered to be a fast-changing ``survival machine,'' as one
researcher called it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people's immune systems kill the virus. But an estimated 85
percent of those exposed to HCV become chronically infected _
almost invariably from a contaminated needle or long ago blood
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Over a 20-year period, about 20 percent of the chronically
infected develop cirrhosis, scarring of the liver that can lead to
liver failure. A smaller number, perhaps 1 to 2 percent of those
infected, develop liver cancer. The rest die of something
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   People can contract HCV from microscopic flecks of blood left on
a communal straw used for snorting cocaine. The virus can linger on
razors and toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   It's been found in small quantities in semen and other body
fluids besides blood, although most researchers say it's difficult
to transmit through sexual activity unless there's blood contact: a
possibility from rough sex, anal intercourse or sex during
menstruation or herpes outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The only treatments available are the drug interferon, which
often has debilitating side effects, and an anti-viral called
ribavirin, recently approved for use in combination with
interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments are costly _ at least $700 a month for interferon
alone, and up to $1,440 a month for the combination. Treatments
often manage to quell the virus, but it returns in the majority of
patients. The overall success rate for the new state-of-the-art
combination therapy, marketed by Schering-Plough Corp., under the
brand name Rebetron, is only about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any vaccine for hepatitis C, as there is for the
other main viral culprits in liver disease, hepatitis A and B.
Chiron scientists are in the early stages of testing one vaccine
candidate, but Michael Houghton, the company's top HCV expert, and
one of the discoverers of the virus, cautioned against getting
hopes too high.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, most carriers are not aware they harbor the
virus: symptoms typicaly do not appear for years, even decades,
while the microbe quietly destroys the liver.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is this insidiousness _ and the vast numbers of people
carrying HCV _ that has health experts concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 90 percent of intravenous drug users, for example, test
positive for the virus. HCV infects close to half of the California
state prison population. The chance of contracting it from a single
accidental needle-stick is as high as 1 in 10, far worse odds than
contracting HIV, making it one of the biggest occupational threats
faced by health-care and emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the AIDS virus is still a worse health problem
by far. It infects about twice as many people as the 13,000
estimated to carry HCV. But deaths from hepatitis C are rising
while AIDS deaths are in decline throughout the United States.
Coinfections are increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are both health crises, and HCV is now becoming a major
public health threat,'' said Supervisor Gavin Newsom, sponsor of a
San Francisco resolution that directs local public-health officials
to devise a plan to deal with the growing crisis. ``We need to be
much more aggressive in reaching out to people who might be
affected,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was also expressed by former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop, who during recent congressional testimony warned of a
surge in liver disease for which the medical establishment is
woefully unprepared. ``We are at the edge of a very significant
public health challenge,'' said Koop, who called for a high-profile
public-education effort and coordinated federal attack.
</P>
<P>
   The response so far has been disappointing, activists say.
Leaders of frontline organizations like the American Liver
Foundation are lobbying for a $56 million increase this year in the
$46 million National Institutes of Health budget for hepatitis A, B
and C research.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizers are directing their energies at persuading more
people likely to carry the virus to get tested for HCV, both to
limit spread of the disease and improve their chances with drug
treatments, ineffective though they may be.
</P>
<P>
   If they hadn't been pressured, meanwhile, federal authorities
might never have started the ``lookback'' study, in which local
blood banks around the country are digging through donor records
and attempting to notify anyone who might have received tainted
blood in long-ago transfusions. The effort marks the first time
authorities have gone out looking for those who may be infected.
</P>
<P>
   Blood Centers of the Pacific in San Francisco, for example,
which provides blood to 35 hospitals in Northern California, was
able to identify about 400 possibly contaminated units of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nora Hirschler, the blood bank's medical director, defends
the seemingly long time it took health authorities to send out the
notices. For one thing, she said, it was not clear that much could
be done, since there are no surefire treatments for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you embark on something like this, you need to be sure
you can do something to help people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such rationales do not wash with those warring in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should have been notified long ago that they may be a
walking time bomb,'' said Carol Craig, an Orange County organizer
who believes she became infected with HCV while working as a
medical assistant.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that virus carriers may be unwittingly infecting
members of their family by such innocuous behavior as sharing
razors with teenage children or having sex during menstrual
periods, although statistics suggest the risk of household
transmission is not very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be urgent without being shrill, but right now we
need to make a strong and urgent point about this disease,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, HCV inspired little urgency. The disease moved
too slowly. It did damage too discretely. It affected too wide a
populace: People who did not easily coalesce into a social
movement. By comparison, contracting HIV was almost immediately
seen as a virtual death sentence. Healthy young people became
wasted shells. The disease devastated a politically active gay
community.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the HCV picture is similarly finding focus. A vast group of
carriers contracted the virus in the freewheeling '60s and early
'70s, when it was unknown and the culture fostered high-risk
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the people now beginning to get ill,'' said Alan P.
Brownstein, president of the American Liver Foundation. ``Those are
the people dying, and given the vast reservoir of carriers, more
and more people are going to die unless something is done now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why so many people, from still-healthy carriers to
those near death, are joining the HCV movement. Like McVetty, who
four years ago began reeling from depression and fatigue that his
doctors could not explain, they now know what they have: a war on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get out there and fight,'' said Alan Franciscus,
49, a leader of the HepC Support Project in San Francisco.
``Because nothing's going to happen if we don't.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Picking the Beasts, Not the Beauties, of the World Wide Web  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The world is full of contests to pick the best. Movies, plays,
books, even Web sites vie for the winners' laurels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now the losers of the World Wide Web will have a chance at
their 15 minutes of fame _ or is that infamy _ thanks to the Mud
Brick, a new award dedicated to singling out the world's ugliest
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all being done tongue-in-cheek,'' said Manish Vij,
25-year-old chief executive of NetStudio Corp. ``We're not after
personal pages, but the sites of businesses that should know
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Mud Brick is not so much an independent contest as
a shameless publicity stunt. NetStudio sells software to create
attractive Web graphics. The Berkeley startup hopes to raise its
profile by getting people to name the stinkers of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To nominate a site for a Mud Brick, e-mail its address to
 &LR; mudbrick &LR; netstudio.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The contest will be judged by NetStudio's staff. The results
will be announced in September, when the Seybold printing and
graphics show comes to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Winners _ or is that losers? _ will get a copy of the $149
NetStudio software, an hour of design consulting time and a
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Feedback loop &LR; : Many Web sites invite visitors to e-mail their
comments to some sort of general address, like
 &LR; feedback &LR; company.com. &LR;  Handling the responses may not be difficult
when you're a startup like NetStudio trying to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, many Fortune 1000 companies post these general mail
boxes _ then find themselves unprepared for the volume and variety
of the responses they get.
</P>
<P>
   And that means they're missing a huge bet, said Mark Gainey,
president of Kana Communications, a Palo Alto startup that sells
software to sort, route and reply to general delivery e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is raw, unfiltered opinion from customers,'' Gainey said.
``This is what companies pay millions to get from market research
organizations, and here customers are giving it to them, free.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey stumbled into the e-mail response market after he quit
his venture capital job in 1995 to start his own company.
</P>
<P>
   He had intended to sell sporting goods over the Internet, but in
talking to equipment manufacturers, he discovered how they were
handling their general delivery e-mails. ``The president of one
name-brand company would give the feedback e-mails to his
teenaged-daughter, who would mail out replies through her AOL
account,'' he said. ``That's when the light bulb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   He founded Kana in 1996 to help automate the process of replying
to unsolicited e-mail. Several other companies are aimed at the
same niche, including General Interactive in Cambridge, Mass.,
Brightware Inc. in Novato, and Mustang Software in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Heart of silicon? &LR;  Two weeks ago I reported how venture
capitalists Gib Myers and Bud Colligan are trying to reverse the
valley's skin-flint reputation and stimulate philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a recent survey done by the Field Research organization,
for the Community Foundation Silicon Valley, indicates they'll have
their hands full, especially when it comes to converting valley
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The Field survey looked at the giving habits of 730 individuals
selected at random in Silicon Valley _ an area defined as
stretching from San Jose north to Highway 92 on the Peninsula, and
up to Fremont in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this scientific survey, Field zeroed in on 160
people in Silicon Valley identified as having more than $1 million
in liquid assets _ net worth minus real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The random sample, which represented the general population,
gave about 2.1 percent of their income to charity. That's on par
with national averages.
</P>
<P>
   The picture wasn't so bright for the 160 millionaires. Nearly
half of that batch gave $2,000 or less to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, if a family with $50,000 in liquid assets
was as tight as some valley millionaires, they'd only donate $100
to charity in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jay, president of Field Research, cautioned against
drawing too many conclusions from the 160-person sample. She said
it wasn't a scientific sample.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Chu, vice president of the foundation that sponsored the
survey, said diplomatically, ``What it says to us is that,
relatively speaking, we're a more affluent area, but we're not
giving up to our potential.''
</P>
<P>
   She also found a key difference between giving in the valley and
giving in other parts of the country, which suggests that high-tech
stinginess is cureable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elsewhere the church is the center of life, especially
charity,'' she said. ``In Silicon Valley, the workplace is
central.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that changes in CEO behavior could set the example
for all those future stock-option millionaires _ which is exactly
what Myers is trying to do with his Entrepreneurs' Foundation (see &LR; 
www.the-ef.org &LR; ).

 Newspapers, Union OK Pact   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
After 11 years of on-again, off-again bargaining, ANG Newspapers
Inc. has struck a tentative labor agreement with the Northern
California Media Workers Guild, which represents editorial staff
such as reporters, photographers and copy editors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The salary terms of the three-year agreement are meager, even by
newspaper standards, but union representatives said reaching any
accord after 11 years is a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ANG Newspapers publishes five dailies in the Bay Area including
the Oakland Tribune, Hayward Daily Review, Tri-Valley Herald, San
Mateo Times and Fremont Argus. It also owns six weeklies on the
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which will be voted on next week by the
220-member ANG bargaining unit, sets mandatory minimum average
salaries that are lower than in the industry as a whole, despite
the high cost of living in Alameda and San Mateo counties.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory pay raises, which will be based on merit, will average
just 1 percent in each of the first two years of the agreement and
2 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   Managers may opt to pay more, but there is no requirement for
them to do so. Discretionary pay increases by managers have
averaged 3 percent in each of the last two years, but future
increases will depend on the financial health of the business, said
Scott McKibben, ANG's president and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by no stretch of the imagination an economic incentive
to stick around,'' said Stacey Wells, bargaining unit chair and
city hall reporter for the Oakland Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing most people will be happy with is that it will
bring this (11-year) ennui to a close,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   The guild and ANG have been debating terms of an agreement since
1987, shortly after the company, then called the Alameda Newspaper
Group, was bought by William Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group of
Denver, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The company had not been organized under its previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   When the talks began, ANG offered a contract with $400 per week
minimum salaries. In 1996 it raised that offer to $425 and on
Monday, after several months of work with a federal mediator, the
company went up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's contract offer was initially rejected by the guild over
another issue, but the differences were resolved and a tentative
deal was struck yesterday, said Erin Tyson Poh, a guild organizer.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the contractual minimum salary will have
little impact, said McKibben. ``There were no people affected by
this agreement that were making as little as that to begin with, so
we felt we might as well move it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, editorial staff who have worked at the
paper less than six years would receive a minimum salary of $500,
or $26,000 annually, while veterans would be guaranteed at least
$580, or $30,160 per year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ANG agreed that median salaries would hit at least
$550 per week for the first group and $720 for the second. That
translates into annual salaries of $28,600 and $37,440
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the average guild salary for top-scale workers
around the country is $784, or $40,768 per year.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract is ratified, ANG reporters will make about the
same amount as reporters at the Peoria (Ill.) Journal Star.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract allows workers to earn time-and-a-half pay
when they work more than eight hours in a day or more than 40 hours
in a week. Some small improvements were made to employees' benefits
package.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the salary, the most important term of the contract
is the requirement for an annual evaluation of each employee to
give the worker a chance to discuss his or her compensation. ``This
will at least give them a foot in the door,'' said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Some ANG workers have not received a raise in 10 years, said
Poh.
</P>
<P>
   ANG promised to increase its $5.5 million salary pool for
covered employees by 1 percent for each of the next two years and 2
percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its five dailies, ANG owns six free weeklies in
San Mateo County with a combined circulation of 200,000. McKibben
said it will announce an expansion on the Peninsula in about 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   ANG's daily newspapers have a combined paid circulation of
215,000, McKibben said.
</P>
<P>
   ANG's contract with the Bay Area Typographical Union is slated
to expire at the end of this year. McKibben said discussions with
that group ``are moving along nicely.'' None of the company's other
780 employees are subject to outstanding labor contracts.

MEDIA FRENZY GREETS LEWINSKY'S ARRIVAL AT GRAND JURY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time Monica Lewinsky arrived at the E.
Barrett Perryman Federal Court House Thursday, the media mob was in
a full froth-at-the-mouth frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   At least 250 journalists, 19 satellite trucks and a
four-story-high cherry-picker carrying a CNN camera surrounded the
building on Pennsylvania Avenue, in the shadow of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The political paparazzi _ many of whom have spent the past 28
weeks chronicling the scandal _ stood guard outside each of five
courthouse entrances, and they snapped into action when a black
sport utility vehicle approached at 8:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in Washington when the House approved the most sweeping
campaign reforms in a quarter-century, when a congressional
committee voted to hold the attorney general in contempt for the
first time in history, and the nation inched closer to a
confrontation with Iraq _ the media's attention, and so the
nation's, was focused on the secret testimony of the president's
alleged paramour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're turning onto 14th!'' ``Looks like she'll go in the
Pennsylvania Avenue side.'' ``No, they're headed for the Third
Street entrance,'' came the cackling over scores of walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, wearing a blue pantsuit, ignored the press horde that
was kept 100 feet away by police, gave a hug to Sydney Hoffman, a
member of her legal team, shrugged her shoulders and went inside
for a day of private testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Her public appearance in the courthouse driveway lasted less
than 20 seconds. Nevertheless, the crowd outside spent much of the
next 81/2 hours discussing it _ much of it on live television.
Several networks carried live coverage of a man sitting in his
Toyota sport utility vehicle, waiting to take Lewinsky away from
the courthouse once she finally emerged shortly after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It is . . . something stupid,'' said Maryse Burgot, a French
television reporter who had arrived this week from Paris to cover
the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   In her thick accent, Burgot recalled how she had been dispatched
to Oklahoma City after the horrific bombing three years ago and was
stunned by the number of reporters and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same thing,'' she said. ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House, officials
tried hard to appear uninterested. As Lewinsky's testimony began,
President Clinton was in the Rose Garden celebrating the fifth
anniversary of the gun-control measure known as the Brady Bill.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to taunt the media when he looked up from his notes
and said: ``There has been another development today that because
of this opportunity, I feel I have to comment on.'' He went on to
criticize House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., over proposed tax
cuts, to the disappointment of reporters, who shouted questions the
instant he stopped speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, are you concerned about Lewinsky testifying
today? Are you sticking with your story, your denials?'' they
yelled.
</P>
<P>
   But the president ignored the questions, and a military band
began playing ``The Stars and Stripes Forever'' at top volume,
drowning out &UR;  &LR; even the most persistent interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a briefing, deputy press secretary Barry Toiv said he
was not aware that the president was paying any attention to the
testimony, which reportedly included graphic details of sexual acts
between Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has not expressed any views to us on this,
except we know that he does agree with us, and probably all
Americans, that if this means ... we're coming to the end of this
four-year, over $40 million investigation, then that would be a
good thing,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers preparing for their August recess could not avoid the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sick of hearing about it,'' House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., said when asked at a news conference. ``I think
most people are. I think we've had an overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif, complained that the focus on
Clinton's alleged indiscretions distracts from important policy
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try very hard for it not to, but it clearly does,''
Tauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the courthouse _ which some reporters dubbed ``Monica
Beach'' _ tourists and publicity seekers marveled at the scene
before becoming part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   George Hancock, a 32-year old from Bowling Green, Ky., carried a
sign reading ``Good Luck Monica.'' He told dozens of reporters the
story of how he was on his way to Niagara Falls when he heard
Lewinsky would be testifying and stopped by ``to let her know that
at least one person wishes her well.''
</P>
<P>
   With little hard news to report, the media focused on details.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a rumor spread that Lewinsky's spokeswoman, Judy
Smith, had gone to the courthouse cafeteria for two jelly
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said they were both for her,'' one reporter explained.
</P>
<P>
   When a former federal prosecutor descended the courthouse steps,
she was mobbed by reporters who thought perhaps she had some inside
information. She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to do an interview with Inside Edition,'' said
Cynthia Alksne.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on and the sun grew warm, one technician fell
asleep in a chair with a book on his lap. He was immediately
surrounded by photographers, who sought out angles to capture the
sleeping journalist with the courthouse in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The book on his lap was entitled: ``No Safe Place.''

JURY AWARDS $760 MILLION IN WORKERS' SUIT ON CHEMICALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury here has assessed punitive damages of more
than $760 million against five oil and chemical companies for
injuries suffered by workers building the Stealth fighter at
Lockheed Corp., lawyers involved in the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Los Angeles County Superior Court jury
followed a finding that the companies had not provided adequate
warning about the toxic effects of chemicals like solvents that
were used in the manufacture of the radar-evading aircraft in the
1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which last week assessed $25.4 million in compensatory
damages against the companies, levied punitive damages of $252.1
million against the Exxon Corp., $236.1 million against the Shell
Oil unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, $145.6 million against Ashland
Inc., $81.25 million against Unocal Corp., and $45.6 million
against DuPont, said Larry Janssen, an lawyer for the five
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen said the companies would appeal. ``This verdict is a
tremendous travesty,'' he said. ``It's just a miscarriage of
justice in the truest sense.'' Janssen, who is with the firm of
Steptoe &AMP; Johnson, said the judge did not let the jury hear
evidence of the warnings issued by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest trial is the sixth involving workers at Lockheed's
Skunk Works plant in Burbank, Calif., where the company does much
of its advanced aircraft development. But the jury verdict, handed
up Thursday but announced Friday, is the only one to result in more
than minor damages against the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some 640 workers initially sued Lockheed and numerous chemical
companies, saying the workers suffered injuries and illnesses that
ranged from cancer deaths and nervous system damage to lesser
illnesses, said Jack Girardi, a partner in the firm of Girardi &AMP;
Keese, which represented the workers. Lockheed and many of the
chemical suppliers settled in earlier stages.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in the case was that the Stealth fighter's secrecy
could have increased exposure to the chemicals. ``These were
closed-off buildings with windows blacked out with poor
circulation,'' Girardi said. But he said the chemical companies
knew about those conditions and did not provide adequate warning.

IN RURAL TENNESSEE RACE, YOUTH PREVAILS OVER AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Youth prevailed in Coffee County, Tenn., on Thursday as
18-year-old Nathan Cunningham defeated 81-year-old Fayna Walker in
an election for the county commission that gained national
attention because of the 63-year gap between the candidates' ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, a Republican who graduated from high school this
spring, said he was thrilled by his 282-187 victory over Mrs.
Walker, a Democrat who has served on the commission for 23 years.
``It feels great,'' he said. ``I believe people were ready for a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Mrs. Walker, Cunningham attributed his success to
opposing property-tax increases in Coffee County, a farming
community of about 40,000 some 65 miles southeast of Nashville. But
Mrs. Walker said that other factors might have played a part,
including her age and the size of Cunningham's large family.

   DALLAS _ Electronic Data Systems said Friday that the retirement
of Lester Alberthal Jr. as chairman and chief executive would cost
the company $38.6 million in benefits _ a cost the company defended
by citing his 30-year career at EDS and his agreement to never join
any competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of EDS rose $5.125, or nearly 14 percent, to
$41.8125, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal announced his retirement after the stock market closed
on Thursday under pressure from board members and major
shareholders dismayed by the company's loss of its former
leadership in the computer services industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with company managers Friday morning,
Alberthal said the decision to retire was his own. But the board
signaled its desire for change by announcing that the next chief
would come from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal's retirement package _ costing a nickel a share after
taxes _ brought a protest from the California Public Employees
Retirement System, among the company's loudest shareholder critics.
``You'd have to question the wisdom of offering this retirement
arrangement when his leadership has not created a lot of value for
shareholders,'' said Brad Pacheco, a fund spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   EDS refused to break down the expense other than to say that it
included the vesting of stock benefits, a five-year consulting
arrangement and pension payments. Last year, Alberthal was paid
$850,000, but received more than $12.9 million in stock benefits
based on the company's 1996 performance. Under current formulas,
company documents say, Alberthal is eligible for retirement
benefits of about $700,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Stubbs Norwood, a company spokeswoman, noted that at age
54, Alberthal was still in his peak earning years. ``This,'' she
said, referring to the retirement agreement, ``precludes him from
engaging in a wide range of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts welcomed the news of Alberthal's retirement while
adding that finding a prominent, qualified successor will be no
easy job. ``I'm not saying they should promote someone
internally,'' said Susan Scrupski, a partner in ARC Consulting of
Tinton Falls, N.J. ``I'm saying they should look for someone who
has knowledge of information services. It's a very special
executive, and they're in short supply.''
</P>
<P>
   EDS needs someone able to reassure employees and investors
alike, analysts said. ``They need a Lou Gerstner,'' said one
substantial shareholder, referring to IBM's chief executive and the
turnaround he achieved. ``But he's got a job.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp.'s pension fund, EDS' largest shareholder by
far with a 25.7 percent stake, said Friday that it would sell as
much as 8 percent of those holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would capitalize both on Friday's gains and on the lift
from news that at the close of trading Monday it will be included
in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.  &QL;

PHONE WORKERS IN NEW YORK STAGE WALKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Va.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of unionized telephone workers shut down
directory assistance in New York on Friday as they staged a
two-and-a-half-hour wildcat walkout aimed at pressuring Bell
Atlantic to help avoid a strike at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, when their
contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Walking off the job Friday afternoon, the workers gave millions
of consumers a taste of the inconveniences that would be suffered
in a full-fledged strike. The workers held raucous demonstrations
at phone company buildings in Manhattan, the Bronx and upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Workers shouted ``No contract, no work,'' and some occasionally
engaged in pushing matches with police officers, who tried to keep
them behind barricades to prevent them from impeding traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting a strike, Jose Navarro, a telephone service worker
from Brooklyn, said, ``We have to use all means necessary to
protect our job security.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he felt threatened because Bell Atlantic had moved
work once done by union employees to nonunion subsidiaries, a
practice known as double-breasting.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that double-breasting was the main issue in
the talks between Bell Atlantic and two unions representing 85,000
workers. The two sides continued their talks Friday in New York
City and Washington in an effort to avert a strike that would
affect phone service from Virginia to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working hard to reach an agreement before the current
contract expires,'' said John Bonomo, a phone company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the two unions _ the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers _
said there had been progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been progress in concept, but there are still
specifics to work out,'' said Jeffrey Miller, a spokesman for the
communications union workers. ``We want to see the exact contract
language proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   While the strike would not interrupt normal phone service, it
could create serious delays for consumers who want to use directory
assistance, make collect calls or talk with business
representatives. It would also cause delays in repairing telephone
service and installing new lines. A strike would not eliminate all
such service, however, because managers would do some of the work
now done by union members.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Friday's work stoppage, many callers who sought
directory assistance were greeted with busy signals. There were
also major delays for callers who sought to make operator-assisted
calls in the Bell Atlantic area. The work stoppage ran from 2:30
p.m. to 5 p.m., and directory assistance was again working smoothly
when the workers returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued during the stoppage, the company said,
``We are doing everything possible to minimize the impact on our
customers.'' Bell Atlantic added, ``This action will not impact
contract negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrating in front of the Bell Atlantic building at
42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, Kareemah Abdullah, a
service technician, said: ``We have to stick together. We're
worried about Bell Atlantic subcontracting out work to nonunion
places. Bell Atlantic has a lot of money and doesn't want to share
it with us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In separate negotiations, the communications union reached a
tentative agreement with Southern New England Telecommunications,
which provides phone service to almost all of Connecticut. The
union had threatened a strike against that company beginning Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 6,300 SNET workers, applauded the
agreement, under which employees would no longer have to pay for
health insurance and would receive an 11 percent wage increase over
the 32-month contract.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Miglio, SNET's chairman, said in a statement: ``We're
very pleased that we have a tentative agreement. We have good,
hard-working people who deserve a contract that recognizes their
significant contribution to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The communications union workers faulted Bell Atlantic for
moving work long done by unionized business representatives to a
nonunion subsidiary in Norfolk, Va., called Bell Atlantic Plus. In
addition, union officials complained that the company had set up
another nonunion arm to install sophisticated lines that give
business customers high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do here is smash double-breasting in its
infancy,'' one union official, who insisted on anonymity. ``If we
do that, this will be an important, trend-setting contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials have defended using the nonunion
subsidiaries, saying that they enable the company to increase
profits by using a work force that has lower wages and is not
hamstrung by union work rules.

COMMENTARY: ILLEGAL SMOKE FOR THE '90S, FROM CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Friday night, on day three of the great federal
crackdown against Manhattan's outlaw Cuban-cigar aficionados, a
cigar bar seemed just the place to puff awhile and wait for the
smoke to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dragging those people off just for smoking Cubans, it's
absurd,'' said John McFadden, an investment banker who was savoring
an Astral cigar and gesturing in the general direction of his
companion, Joseph Avantario.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole Cuban thing was topic one at lunch today,'' said
Avantario, lighting up another of McFadden's Astrals. ``Just about
every U.S. senator smokes Cuban cigars. So why not go after them?''
</P>
<P>
   They were enjoying a predinner puff Friday night with a friend,
Janine Johnson, in the Cigar Bar at Carnegie Bar and Books at 156
West 56th St., a cynosure of the smokily comfortable, clubby little
world of the upscale Manhattan cigar worshipper.
</P>
<P>
   True, it was the Friday night kickoff to a summer weekend, and
many high-end cigarophiles had already headed for the Hamptons or
were firing up entirely legal Cuban Cohibas in the hills of
Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, 35 diehards were breathing cigar smoke, sipping
cocktails and listening to light jazz in the mahogany-and-maroon
bar, with its bronze chandeliers and showcases filled with
Partagas, H. Upmann and Dunhill cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Subi Gurge, a financial consultant, was puffing a Honduran
Padron as he sat with 11 colleagues under the bar's ornate
stairway. He was ruminating annoyedly about ``that ridiculous
embargo against Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the world doesn't support it,'' he said, ``and it
isn't effective anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, most of the smokers said they were well aware
of the news that on Wednesday, federal officials charged the
operators of an upscale restaurant and a private club in Manhattan
with illicitly selling Cuban cigars to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents with search warrants seized hundreds of boxes of
cigars from the humidors of the Patroon restaurant on East 46th
Street and the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue. On Thursday,
prosecutors charged four investors and businessmen, including two
chief executives, with buying contraband Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two more cigar smokers were drawn into the federal
investigation, bringing to nine those arrested. Michael Dana, 38, a
managing director in the investment banking division at Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, and Jeffrey Kelter, 44, president of a
real-estate investment company in suburban Philadelphia, were
arraigned in federal court in Manhattan and released on their own
recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enforcement seems so selective,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``Why
single these people out from all the people who have Cuban
cigars?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
high-profile Cuban cigar prosecutions were a deterrent that not
only responded to violations of federal law (since owning them is a
felony) but also supported U.S. foreign policy and helped to deny
economic benefits to Cuba, since the state manages cigar
production.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gurge's colleagues, who gave his name only as Eric, said:
``Americans shouldn't smoke Cubans, because that's supporting the
Cuban government,'' he said. ``And they're evading paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Avantario, an investment banker who lives in Chappaqua, said
Cuban Cohibas, Montecristos and Romeo y Julietas are ubiquitous.
``If you want them, you can get them,'' he said. ``They even hide
them under the ribbons of Dominican cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few in the bar would admit to having gone Cuban. ``I did
have one Cuban cigar,'' said Peter Genet, a real-estate consultant,
``but I didn't inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   His companions in the book nook near the door, Robert and Marie
Guarnieri, rolled their eyes as they laughed. ``I had my first and
only Cuban cigar on my wedding night in Sweden,'' said Guarnieri, a
technology consultant who lives in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was legal!'' Mrs. Guarnieri said.
</P>
<P>
   At the ornate mahogany bar, Eric Lightner, the manager,
explained to a visitor that ``people ask all the time for Cubans,''
he said. ``What we tell them is the truth. We don't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``many customers come in with their own Cubans to smoke
them here,'' said Tara Oniki, the cocktail waitress. ``They aren't
worried by all this. They don't take this seriously. In fact, the
only reason they smoke Cubans is for show. You know why I think
they smoke them? Because they're illegal.''

A 1997 CHANGE IN RENT LAWS PRODUCES A BOOM IN APARTMENT
DEREGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since New York lawmakers scaled back rent regulations
last summer, at least three times the number of apartments in New
York City have been deregulated under the new laws as under the old
ones, a new study has determined.
</P>
<P>
   The rise _ from about 1,000 a year to more than 3,500 _ has
occurred almost exclusively in Manhattan, the study found, and is
higher than either landlords or tenant groups predicted during the
wrenching battle over rent laws.
</P>
<P>
   And it indicates that with the economy booming and real estate
prices soaring, landlords in prime neighborhoods have taken full
advantage of measures they won in Albany to bring about
deregulation by increasing rents sharply when some apartments turn
over.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new laws, a rent-stabilized apartment becomes
deregulated _ meaning the landlord can charge whatever the market
will bear _ when its rent under the stabilization rules reaches
$2,000 after a vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, the first
detailed look at the city's housing market since the new laws were
passed, also found that while rents had risen steeply for newly
occupied apartments south of 96th Street in Manhattan, the new laws
appeared to have had only a small impact elsewhere, as many
economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a tale of two cities,'' said Edward Hochman,
chairman of the rent board. ``What it shows is that in many parts
of the city, regulated rents already may be at or approaching
market levels.''
</P>
<P>
   From June 1997 to last March, when the study was conducted, the
median increase for newly rented apartments protected by rent laws
in so-called core Manhattan was 21 percent, far outstripping an
estimated 12 percent rise the year before the changes. Citywide,
the increase was 12 percent, after an 8 percent increase the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an average renter south of 96th Street whose old
rent was $1,500, paid $1,815 after moving.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, by comparison, such rents rose by an average of 5
percent, the same as the year before; in Queens, rents rose 8
percent, after a 5 percent increase the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But the study warns that even though increases remained
relatively stable outside Manhattan, working-class and poor
families appear to be having a harder time finding apartments they
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   For those earning the median income for families in
rent-stabilized housing _ $26,797 _ about 39 percent of newly
occupied apartments were considered affordable. A year ago, half
the newly occupied apartments were considered affordable, which,
according to the government, means that the family paid 30 percent
of its income or less for the apartment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And advocates for tenants warn that the problem will grow more
severe more quickly as a result of less stringent rent protections.
``Even though you may not be seeing bigger increases immediately in
those neighborhoods, it is going to happen,'' said Michael McKee,
policy director for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors
Coalition, ``because people will be priced out of part of the city
and pressures will grow in other neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But some landlords contend that the survey is the first clear
demonstration that only Manhattan is truly affected by rent
protections. In most other neighborhoods, they say, market forces
already prevail and rents will rise at slow, predictable rates
while landlords will continue to be burdened with the bureaucracy
of rent regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that the whole angry debate last year was a
waste of time,'' said Dan Margulies, executive director of the
Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association for
apartment building owners. ``Things have changed very little for
most owners.''

SOPHISTICATED TERRORIST GROUPS SUSPECTED IN EMBASSY ATTACKS

 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Administration officials said the attacks on two
U.S. embassies in East Africa only minutes apart Friday probably
were carried out by one of a small number of sophisticated
terrorist groups presumed to have attacked U.S. installations in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered teams of FBI agents, medical military
specialists and explosives experts to leave immediately for Africa
to track down the bombers and aid the victims. Although few
terrorism investigations overseas have ever borne fruit, Clinton
vowed to bring the bombers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the State Department, Under Secretary
Thomas Pickering said it was too early to single out suspects in
the bombing or to speculate about why they had chosen to carry out
the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find them, we'll ask them,'' he said. ``I don't
believe at this stage that we are reading anything special into the
choice of these until we get further down the investigative
process. I don't have an answer. Terrorists tend to be
unpredictable, and there may be some of that in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was reported to be rushing
home from Italy, where she was to have attended the weekend wedding
of her chief spokesman, James Rubin. She said in a statement that
the administration ``will spare no effort to use all means at our
disposal to track down and punish the perpetrators of these
outrageous acts.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that based on early circumstantial evidence, the
investigators were focusing on followers of Osama bin Laden, a
multimillionaire Saudi-born financier who has sworn to wage a holy
war on the United States and its interests abroad. The U.S.
official declined to describe the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Laden and a group of extremist Muslim clerics
called on their followers to kill Americans. He is considered a
prime suspect in a 1996 terrorist bombing of an American apartment
complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19 U.S. airmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there were also suspicions that
the attacks in East Africa may have been carried out by the Holy
War organization in Egypt, an Islamic extremist group that warned
earlier this week of reprisals against the United States over its
purported involvement in the extradition to Egypt of three of its
members who were arrested in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the early hours of this, and it's too early to finger
anybody,'' said another senior administration official, cautioning
against speculation about the identity of the bombers. ``We're
looking at the usual suspects. And this time, the usual suspects
may be to blame.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States said that within hours of the bombings Friday,
two teams made up of agents from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other government anti-terrorist experts had been
been gathered in Washington and ordered to fly from Andrews Air
Force Base to East Africa: one team bound for Nairobi, the Kenyan
capital, the other for Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon sent a C-141 cargo plane with a surgical team and
medical supplies from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Nairobi. A
separate anti-terrorism squad of 40 marines was being flown to
Nairobi from Saudi Arabia, where they are temporarily based.
</P>
<P>
   As the first teams of U.S. investigators were leaving for East
Africa, President Clinton, who was awakened at 5:30 a.m. with news
of the bombings, condemned them as ``cowardly acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhuman,'' the president said, interrupting a bill-signing ceremony
in the Rose Garden to comment on the bombings. ``We will use all
the means at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice no
matter what or how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ordered a tightening of security at U.S.
embassies and other diplomatic installations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Police hurriedly erected barricades in front of several U.S.
embassies elsewhere in Africa, out of fear that terrorists might
strike again on the continent. The Ugandan government ordered
traffic police in Kampala, the capital, to move vehicles from the
street in front of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that there was no specific threat to
the embassies in Kenya or Tanzania immediately before the bombings.
``There was no telephone call to the embassies minutes before,
saying something was going to happen, no,'' said Patrick Kennedy,
assistant secretary of state for administration.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said suspicion was falling on Laden in
part because of the location of the terrorist attacks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Laden, who has been described by the State Department as ``one
of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist
activities in the world,'' has close ties to Muslim extremist
groups in Sudan, which borders Kenya to the north, and lived in
Sudan before relocating to Afghanistan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long had strained ties with the Sudanese
government, which it has accused of harboring terrorist groups, and
has moved most of its embassy employees out of Sudan to Nairobi,
where they work out of the embassy building that was bombed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that Laden sends tens of millions of dollars
through Islamic banks and charities to terrorist organizations,
militant groups and extremist political movements based in Sudan,
Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon and the Philippines, as well as providing
support for Jihad, which is also suspected of involvement in the
attacks in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a newspaper in Kuwait quoted Ayman al-Zawahri, a
physician and leader of Holy War, as renewing his call for attacks
against American interests. The newspaper said Zawahri was then
living in Afghanistan with Laden, who has been stripped of his
Saudi citizenship by the government in Riyadh.

<P>
   For 20 years, the New Jersey beach resort of Wildwood has been a
town seething with envy. As hotels and shops along its boardwalk
have tried to survive on the income they made three months out of
the year, its more famous neighbor to the north _ Atlantic City _
has used its neon-splashed casinos to become a year-round mecca for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wildwood is fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Wildwood's city commissioners voted 2 to 1 to
approve the transfer of a 2.5-acre municipal parking lot to the
Delaware Tribe of western Oklahoma. In return, the Delawares would
operate an Indian casino on the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But this plan would run afoul of federal laws that give the
state a deciding voice in the creation of new Indian land, a
federal Indian Affairs spokesman said Friday. And Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman's administration has been opposed to the city's
gambling plan for years.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Mayor Fred Wager of Wildwood said Friday that he
believed the city could skirt the governor's opposition by limiting
the gambling to so-called Class II gaming, which includes bingo
and, he said, keno poker and off-track betting.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he hoped that the low-level gambling casino would
eventually grow into a full-fledged Class III casino, of the type
operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in Ledyard, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for all of it, but we're willing to start out
with a Class II casino, where you have bingo and keno poker and
horse racing, and move to a Class III casino later,'' Wager said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city could do this without federal approval because
Class II gambling was not regulated by the federal Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as our checking into it, we don't need the state or the
federal government's permission to do that,'' the mayor went on.
``I don't know if there's a way they can stop us, but the
information we have is that we don't need their permission.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rex Hackler, a spokesman for the Interior Department's
Bureau of Indian Affairs, said that federal rules governing the
tribal ownership of land, and not the type of gambling the city
envisions, stand in the way of an Indian Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Indian gaming has to take place on Indian land, and just
because the town of Wildwood gave this land to the Delawares does
not make it Indian land,'' Hackler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Class II gaming cannot take place until the Indians have
taken the land in trust, which basically means that the governor
must give her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delawares, who were compelled to move to Oklahoma in the
last century, signed an agreement with Wildwood in 1995 to operate
the casino. Larry Snake, the tribal chairman, said at the time that
the tribe had had no plans to operate a casino until Wildwood
merchants got in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe filed suit for the land in state court in March,
citing archeological evidence of Indian habitation near Wildwood.
Jeffrey April, the tribe's New Jersey lawyer, said in the spring
that the litigation was intended to expedite a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the parking lot over to the Delawares would settle the
tribe's claim to all of Wildwood as its ancestral lands. The tribe
has not formally agreed to the settlement under which they would
get the casino lot and the city's backing for a casino, Wager said.
But, the mayor noted, the council still had to take the legal steps
authorizing the transfer before a deal could be made. April could
not be reached by phone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the Wildwood casino would not serve alcohol, or
offer any dining more lavish than a food court, so that local
businesses would benefit directly from the crowds they expect the
casino would draw.
</P>
<P>
   Wildwood expects to earn more than $8 million a year in new
revenues from the casino, as well as employment for 600 to 1,000
residents _ a lot of jobs for a town of 5,000. &QL;

   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're not looking to compete with Atlantic City. We're not
looking to put 12 casinos in here, and we're not looking for the
high rollers,'' Wager said. ``We're looking for a family
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the New Jersey Constitution, casino gambling is legal only
in Atlantic City. The attorney general, Peter G. Verniero, repeated
through a spokesman on Thursday that the state was opposed to the
creation of an Indian tribal casino at Wildwood.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials were not clear Friday which state agency, if
any, would govern Class II gambling in New Jersey. Bingo and
similar games of chance are regulated by the Department of Consumer
Affairs, but a consumer affairs spokeswoman said her department
oversees only charity games.
</P>
<P>
   Several municipalities and developers across the country have in
the past tried to create Indian reservations out of private or
municipal land for the purposes of creating a casino, but without
success, and the federal government has never approved a grant of
land to a tribe outside its home state, said Stephanie Hanna, a
spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have to happen is that they would have to establish
reservation land in New Jersey and then enter into a compact with
the state of New Jersey for Class III casino gambling,'' Ms. Hanna
said. ``There has to be some established legal record that gave
them that land.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Hackler of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, approval
to take land in trust in order to create an Indian casino is a rare
occurrence, even with full state backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the entire history of the BIA we have taken only one piece
of land into trust for gaming purposes,'' Hackler said, ``and that
was in Duluth, Minn., and that came with the blessing of virtually
everybody involved, including the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackler said, ``We wish the town of Wildwood the best in
developing its economy, but it isn't going to happen this way.''

THEODORE APSTEIN, 80, A WRITER FOR THEATER, FILM AND TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: MEXICO, Calif., Pa.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Apstein, a writer for theater, films and television,
died on July 26 in Los Angeles. He was 80 and lived in Brentwood,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Apstein's theater work included ``The Innkeepers,'' which was
produced on Broadway in 1956. Directed by Jose Quintero, the play
starred Geraldine Page and Darren McGavin as a husband and wife who
leave the United States for Mexico after he is deemed a security
risk and is dismissed from his job.
</P>
<P>
   Another play, ``Come Share My House,'' was produced off-Broadway
in 1960. He also wrote several screenplays, including ``Whatever
Happened to Aunt Alice?,'' with Ms. Page, Ruth Gordon and Mildred
Dunnock; ``Baffled,'' with Leonard Nimoy, and ``The Link,'' with
Michael Moriarty and Geraldine Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a prolific writer for television, with more than 100
shows to his credit. He wrote original scripts for such series as
``Studio One,'' ``Alcoa Playhouse,'' ``Dr. Kildare,'' ``Marcus
Welby, M.D.'' and ``The Waltons.''
</P>
<P>
   Apstein taught play writing at Columbia University and play
analysis at the American Theater Wing before joining the faculty at
the University of Southern California at Berkeley, where he taught
the master class in the graduate play writing program for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia Elliott Apstein; two
daughters, Catherine Ertel of Los Angeles and Susan Apstein of
Philadelphia; three sons, Elliott, Norman and Michael, all of Los
Angeles; a sister, Consuelo Patargo of Mexico City; and 11
grandchildren.

MAYOR INTENSIFIES CRITICISM OF PLANNED YOUTH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said in a radio interview
Thursday night that the public should know that the organizers of
the planned Million Youth March have said they plan to bring
violent gangs into the city during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not talking about a million kids,'' Giuliani said in an
interview on WCBS' ``Ask the Mayor'' program, referring to the
march's primary organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a former senior aide to Louis Farrakhan, minister of
the Nation of Islam, wants to hold the rally in Harlem on Sept. 5.
Organizers are billing it as a show of strength and unity among
black teen-agers from across the United States. It is patterned
after the 1995 Million Man March in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has denied Muhammad a permit to hold the march on
that date or on Harlem's Malcolm X Boulevard, citing traffic
concerns. City officials offered two locations they said could
accommodate large crowds: Randalls Island and Van Cortlandt Park in
the Bronx. They also said that Sept. 19 would be a more appropriate
date for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has called that later date and the locations the city
has offered ``totally unacceptable.'' He has also vowed to hold the
event on Sept. 5 in Harlem or in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as a
``direct confrontation with the Jews of that area.''
</P>
<P>
   In his radio remarks Thursday night, Giuliani called it ``a
shame'' that the news media had not reported what he considered the
most vicious of Muhammad's threats: to bring gang members from
across the country to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference last week, Muhammad told reporters that
``if cooler heads don't prevail, there are obviously two forces
that are going to clash here on Saturday, Sept. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We are prepared to bring the youth here. We are
prepared on that day, with angry youth, some who are gang members,
Crips, Bloods, Vice Lords, gangster disciples, some who are from
the gangsta rap culture and the hip-hop culture in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer representing march organizers, said
that Muhammad, who was on a plane en route to Africa Friday, had
invited ``the gang members, along with the best and the brightest
in young black America'' to help forge a truce among the gangs.
Shabazz said the mayor's lack of sensitivity toward Muhammad's plan
had ``proven that he cares little about the concerns of the black
community of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   On the radio program, Giuliani also assailed other comments by
Muhammad. He said it was silly to believe _ as Muhammad had
asserted _ that Jews and other whites working for the mayor were
secretly responsible for the difficulties march organizers were
having with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the city's rationale, the mayor said: ``It's not
going to be a million people, but they are talking about a million
people. You can't go into a residential community in the city with
a million people and have a march. You're going to destroy the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added that Muhammad was ``filled with hatred, anger,
viciousness about the Jews, about Catholics, about the pope.''

PARCELLS PRAISES THE JETS, SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets crushed the Philadelphia Eagles on the ground,
and Curtis Martin, the 1,000-yard man, was not even playing.
</P>
<P>
   So while Thursday night's 29-15 victory was the preseason opener
in Philadelphia against a team whose run defense was ranked 25th
last season, Coach Bill Parcells had some kind words for the
offensive line Friday. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we accomplished some things fairly well; over all
I was pleased with the running and the line, a little bit,'' he
said. ``We had a few little protection problems with the second
group, particularly with guard positions. But overall, I'd have to
say, there I felt OK''
</P>
<P>
   That is a huge admission from the coach, whose demeanor after
early preseason games ranges from disgust to distress. Yet, his
revamped offensive line generated a surge, especially up the
middle, that was particularly strong in the first half when Richie
Anderson pounded out 66 yards on 14 attempts. He is not even the
No. 2 tailback. After Martin, there is Leon Johnson. Anderson is
trying to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Jets ran 44 times for 162 yards. Johnson picked up
40 on 10 carries, and fullback Jerald Sowell added 17 on only four
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, nursing a hamstring injury, will be back next Saturday
against the Baltimore Ravens at Giants Stadium. He said he can't
wait. It will also be a benchmark game to see whether the offensive
line can establish itself as a consistent unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line was very encouraging watching the blocking for the
running,'' Martin said. ``It looks like a lot of things were open.
The holes were open, and receivers were open and they were
blocking, too. It definitely inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Left tackle Jumbo Elliott said of the effort:
``We're going to get way better. It takes four or five games before
you're playing your best as a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Parcells plans to have the ball handed to
Martin 300 times, and hopes to run 500 times over all, that is an
encouraging assessment for Jets fans. They will see a line that
could be 60 percent overhauled _ from Kevin Mawae, the highly
regarded center from Seattle, to Todd Burger at left guard, to the
likely emergence of the rookie Jason Fabini of Cincinnati at right
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot was at his usual left tackle spot, while Matt O'Dwyer
anchored right guard. Fabini alternated with Siupeli Malamala.
</P>
<P>
   It was at center and left guard last year that the Jets proved
vulnerable too often. But Glenn Foley and Vinny Testaverde, who
played with the regulars, had good protection, with only Foley
suffering one sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a better job inside,'' Parcells said Frirday.
``We looked at Fabini a lot. I thought Burger gave up one sack, but
other than that had good run-blocking. I'd like to see Jumbo a
little bit more aggressive. He's kind of hopping on his block, but
he'll be OK. Mawae is a solid player.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how far the Jets' running game has come that
not too long ago Anderson was considered a possible No. 1 running
back. But now, despite heroics that included a touchdown, Parcells
said that the runner is going to have to make it on special teams
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis could have played in the game,'' Parcells said. ``I
want to see him, and I think everyone wants to see him. He hasn't
played football in a while now. He missed a few games the end of
last year; we need to get him game-ready right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he didn't figure on playing last Thursday, Martin
still suited up. Why? ``I just wanted to be dressed,'' Martin said,
``just in case he said, `Get in there.'''

McIVER TO MISS COWBOYS-RAIDERS PRESEASON GAME 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The strange details surrounding the
dorm-room episode involving the Cowboys' Everett McIver might never
be made public. But Michael Irvin, one of the players in this
mystery, said yesterday that he and McIver should have no problems
peacefully coexisting this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no animosity between us,'' Irvin said. ``Y'all cut
that out, the rumors of us not getting along. Me and Everett are
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing between Michael and Everett in the past and
candidly, there is nothing between them today,'' Jones said. ``They
have a lot of respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the case. Yet whatever happened during the July 29
``horseplay'' incident, in which McIver sustained a deep cut on his
neck, has kept him from being in game shape. He is expected to miss
tonight's preseason game against the Oakland Raiders at Texas
Stadium, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   McIver ran laps with strength coach Joe Juraszek yesterday and
left before the afternoon practice was over without comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been given a clean bill of health,'' Jones said. ``But
we don't want to take any risks that might involve him pulling (a
muscle), or him not being in shape. This has nothing to do with his
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver's absence will let coach Chan Gailey give Flozell Adams a
long look at right guard. Adams has been the club's most impressive
rookie this summer, and yesterday Gailey said Adams is already good
enough to be a starter in this league at either guard or tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, Adams' development will not cost McIver his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that Everett has played well enough, and he
shouldn't be penalized because he has lost time,'' Jones said. ``He
is one of our smartest players. Of all our guys who might miss some
time, he's probably one who could make it up better than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   There are others, however, who are fighting for starting jobs
tonight. Gailey will get a second look at the players in several
training-camp battles. Ernie Mills and Billy Davis are the primary
contenders for the No. 2 wide receiver spot. Omar Stoutmire, Kenny
Wheaton, and George Teague are battling for the starting free
safety job.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey might also get his first look at cornerback Deion
Sanders, who missed the last preseason game and the contact portion
of Thursday's scrimmage with the Raiders because he was not fully
recovered from off-season ankle surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Gailey would like to build cohesiveness among
his starters, who dominated the scrimmage against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased, but we've got a long way to go,'' Gailey said.
``We need every bit of the remaining opportunities we have to
practice.''

ELDON SHAMBLIN, 82, GUITARIST FOR TEXAS PLAYBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (lb) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eldon Shamblin, a gifted rhythm guitarist who quietly helped Bob
Wills' Texas Playboys with their influential merger of big-band
jazz and old-time Southwestern fiddle music, died on Wednesday at a
rest home in Sapulpa, Okla. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Weatherford, Okla., he got a job with the
Playboys in 1936, shortly after Wills made Tulsa, Okla., the
group's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shamblin's sound made a big impact on the band. A bit like
Freddie Green, Count Basie's rhythm guitarist at that time, he
cranked up the propulsive beat of the Western swing big-band sound
by playing walking chords, altering them on every beat of a bar.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later his hard-driving, popping single-note solos
showed that he had been listening to Charlie Christian, a fellow
Oklahoman. He was also the band's primary arranger; what he did
with ``San Antonio Rose'' became the Texas Playboys' signature.
</P>
<P>
   Shamblin left the band to join the Army in 1941. As a captain in
the 99th Infantry Division, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge.
He was missing in action behind enemy lines for three weeks and
presumed dead, but found his way back to his unit.
</P>
<P>
   One night in 1946 in San Diego, ``Eldon came in with his Army
uniform on,'' recalled Herb Remington, the band's steel guitarist,
``put on his cowboy hat and his boots, and he was a Texas Playboy
again.'' Until he left the band in 1959, he was also its payroll
manager. After Wills died in 1975, Shamblin joined Leon McAuliffe's
band, the Original Texas Playboys, remaining until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, he worked with Merle Haggard and became a
sometime member of his band, the Strangers. He was also a member of
the Playboys II, who released five records on the Glad Music label.
He taught music theory and guitar at Claremore College in Oklahoma
and had a piano-tuning business.
</P>
<P>
   Shamblin is survived by his daughter, Rita Shamblin Miller of
Tulsa; a stepdaughter, Sue Lackey of Tulsa; a brother, J.C.
Shamblin of Dallas, four grandchildren and three stepgrandchildren.

DOROTHY CARNEGIE RIVKIN, 85, EX-DALE CARNEGIE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Okla., Ore.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who
developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide
operation, died Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived
in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman
of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940s and '50s she was married to
the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic
American self-help book ``How to Win Friends and Influence
People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after
Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a
multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates
and $187 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   With her strawberry blonde hair, gleaming smile and rich
Oklahoma twang _ Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Carnegie as well as
his wife _ she proved as big a success in business as he was in
motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950s wondered
whether she had what it took to continue Carnegie's
quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such
skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took
over the operations ``so that I have no time to sit and whittle and
spit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee
of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first
published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat
message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he
wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning
smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced
mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called
an ``unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course
at a YMCA in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired
for the jump she made from stenographer in Gulf Oil Corp.'s
accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite.
She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.
</P>
<P>
   Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company
offered her a job in New York. She became Carnegie's secretary in
January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later
made her his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case
histories for a book she wrote, ``How to Help Your Husband Get
Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among
the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their
husbands were such aphorisms as ``Share his interests and ideals''
and ``Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a
wailing wall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and
teaching interests. She started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a
workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale
Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her
business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only
alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of
women taking the regular course.
</P>
<P>
   Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple
of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune
500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a
right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the
confidence to present themselves well in public settings.
Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now
surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate
Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics.
So did Lee Iacocca, the former chief of Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a
shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his
autobiography, ``Iacocca.'' ``But that was before I took a course
in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help
of Carnegie teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that
employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She
dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens
and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of
Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne
conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa.
She retired from active management of the closely held company in
1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she
remained chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie
of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier.
She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven
great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.

COMING CHANGES TO ALUMINUM BATS ALARM A MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill., Kan.)   (af)  
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the NCAA apparently on the verge of ordering significant
changes in the way aluminum bats are constructed, a major bat
manufacturer announced Friday that it had filed a $267 million
pre-emptive lawsuit against the collegiate governing body.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges an unlawful restraint of trade by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Easton Sports, which has headquarters in Van
Nuys, Calif., came one day after the NCAA's baseball rules
committee, citing safety concerns and mushrooming scores,
recommended that the size and weight specifications of aluminum
bats be altered to reduce their potency.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the committee recommended that the batted-ball
exit velocity of aluminum bats be reduced from 113 miles per hour
to 93. To do so, it wants the maximum diameter of the barrel of
aluminum bats reduced by one-eighth of an inch and the weight in
the length-to-weight ratios of the bats increased.
</P>
<P>
   If the recommendation is approved by the NCAA's executive
committee at a meeting next Wednesday in Chicago, the next question
would be when it would take effect. The baseball rules committee
wants the change to be enacted on Jan. 1, 1999, in time for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is that timing that has raised alarm at Easton and led to
the filing of the suit in the U.S. District Court in Kansas City,
Kan., near NCAA headquarters in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes the legal action will keep any rules change
from taking effect that quickly. The company estimated it would
lose $267 million if the rules change takes place in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let them know that this is a serious change,'' said
Jim Easton, the chairman of Easton Sports, which is one of the two
biggest manufacturers of aluminum bats. The other is Louisville
Slugger, and together the two companies produce about 40 percent of
the 500,000 aluminum bats manufactured annually in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA wants the bats to be different, so be it, Easton
said. But the timing, he said, has to be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Easton, whose company also makes hockey sticks and bicycle
tubing, said half of next year's bat orders had already been
shipped to colleges or are ready to be shipped. He said if the bat
specifications were changed next week, his company would face the
difficult task of retooling all of its bat orders at the same time
that the other bats were rendered obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA first approved use of aluminum bats in 1974, and their
attractiveness is their relative durability _ two to three years
for the average bat _ in comparison to wooden bats.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA is concerned that balls are coming off aluminum
bats too fast and that serious injuries could occur. It is also
concerned about out-of-control offensive rampages, such as the
record 35 runs in the championship game of this year's College
World Series.

RUDEL BRISCOE, 65, HAIRDRESSER AND PAINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudel Briscoe, a Harlem-bred painter who adored art,
but loved women and making a living so much that he made a
flamboyant detour into the world of high-fashion hairdressing, died
on Sunday at his home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe, who eventually returned to his roots and reconciled his
passions as an artist who specialized in painting beautiful,
fashionable women, was 65. He was known as one of the first black
hairdressers to operate a downtown salon.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause of death was heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Philadelphia whose artistic bent emerged during his
boyhood in Harlem, Briscoe studied with such acclaimed artists as
Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and Ben Shahn and took courses at
the Cooper Union School of Art before a sense of reality set in.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the difficulty of making a living from art in a city
where there seemed to be at least as many artists as actors, and
not enough waiting jobs to go around, Rudel, who had become
enchanted with the world of fashion and fashion models while
working as a Seventh Avenue sketch artist, hedged his bets by
switching to hairdressing school and emerging as an artist in a new
medium.
</P>
<P>
   When he and a partner, Walter Fountaine, opened their Coif Camp
salon on West 23rd Street in the predominantly white Chelsea
section of Manhattan in 1965, it caused something of a sensation
and not only because the proprietors were black hairdressers who
dared to venture outside Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For all their pride in the breakthrough accomplishment, Briscoe
and Fountaine, who had long lived outside Harlem, did not see
themselves so much as taking Harlem styles downtown as pursuing
their own styles on their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   And if they were known primarily for their expertise in handling
black women's hair, their idol was not Madame C.J. Walker, who
virtually invented the modern hair-straightening industry (and in
the process won fame as the first American woman to become a
self-made millionaire), but their friend and mentor, Vidal Sassoon,
the British-born trend setter whose short geometric cuts influenced
many of their own creative variations.
</P>
<P>
   Their timing could not have been better. Within months of
opening their shop they had attracted scores of models, secretaries
and other black women who were finding an upsurge in employment
opportunities outside Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The clientele of the ``interracial beauty salon,'' as they
called it, was about 30 percent white, but it was the black models
and black celebrities like the singer Leslie Uggams and the actress
Diana Sands who put Briscoe on the high-fashion map.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually led to hundreds of credits in publications like
Harper's Bazaar, Mademoiselle, Seventeen and Women's Wear Daily,
not to mention Ebony and Essence, and work as a stylist for movies
like ``Come Back Charleston Blue'' (1972) and ``Book of Numbers''
(1973) and a dozen album covers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Briscoe could braid with the best of them and shape and decorate
Afros to a fare-thee-well. But it was an index of the strength of
black women's demand for hair that could be cut, shaped and
softened into the full array of modern styles that in 1968 _ a year
the ``black is beautiful'' movement was in full cry, and Afros were
being hailed as a symbol of black pride _ 90 percent of his black
customers had their hair straightened, including two Atlanta
schoolteachers who flew to New York every four months to have the
master, as he delicately put it, ``rearrange the curl pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his customers wanted, and for all his continuing
interest in art, as a hairdresser Briscoe was in his element. A
gregarious man with an infectious optimism, he became a beloved
figure who was much in demand, among other things developing a line
of designer wigs with Miss Uggams and serving as a consultant to
Revlon and Clairol.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe, who opened his own salon on Lexington Avenue in 1969
and later worked in salons in Boston and Washington, never
abandoned art, and in 1991 after dabbling variously in sculpture,
silk screens and illustrations, he returned to New York to pursue
his old calling full time.
</P>
<P>
   The scores of acrylics, collages and mixed-media paintings he
turned out never made him as famous as he had been as a
hairdresser, but at gallery shows in New York and Washington they
were snapped up by private collectors at prices ranging from
several hundred to a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And while he painted a variety of subjects, it should not be
surprising that a self-styled romanticist who revered and respected
women should favor paintings depicting elegant women looking very
much as if they had just come from a high-fashion beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe, who was married and divorced twice, is survived by a
son, Oliver Paul Briscoe of Manhattan.

Nelson Rockefeller, the laws mandated such penalties as 15 years to
life for being caught with 4 ounces of cocaine. Designed to
suppress the drug trade, these sentences rivaled those for murder
and rape. But instead of wiping out the drug markets, the laws
overloaded prisons and court dockets with addicts and low-level
couriers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when a Republican governor who portrayed himself as a
crime-buster stepped up to this tough legal issue, the reformers
saw him as their perfect advocate _ able to soften drug laws
without being accused of weakness, ``the Nixon-going-to-China
syndrome,'' as one activist put it.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, however, Pataki could not persuade many of
those in his own party to correct the mistakes of 25 years ago. So
the governor has been quietly working around the edges to soften
the impact of the Rockefeller laws by pardoning individual
prisoners and pushing for alternative forms of incarceration,
including drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the right thing quietly is better than not at all, of
course, but it is time to deal openly with a sentencing mess that
many judges and law-enforcement officials have been protesting for
years.
</P>
<P>
   John Dunne, a former assistant attorney general under President
Bush and head of a bipartisan organization studying the state's
drug laws, explained earlier this year how the Rockefeller laws
have failed. They have ``handcuffed our judges, filled our prisons
to dangerously overcrowded conditions and denied sufficient drug
treatment alternatives to nonviolent addicted offenders who need
help,'' he argued in a report to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors want to retain the current laws so that a
sentence of 15 years to life can still hang automatically over the
head of somebody caught selling 2 ounces of the hard stuff. Those
brutal sentences can be used to persuade people to testify against
the bigger figures in this underworld business. But major dealers
often use the most addicted or most ignorant clients as couriers.
If they are arrested and do not know enough to implicate the
bosses, they pay the full price. Thus the system tends to lean
hardest on the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's effort to right these wrongs is admirable, but he
should have the courage to confront the drug sentencing problem on
the front steps of the state Capitol rather than out the back door.

EDITORIAL: BITE-SIZE TREASURY BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   There is no safer investment than a Treasury bill. But for
nearly three decades, the government has refused to make such safe
investments available to those with less than $10,000 to invest. It
is good that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has decided to end
that practice.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for discriminating against small investors were
never very good, but they vanished years ago. The policy was
adopted in 1970 out of fear that small savers would seek the higher
yields then available from the government rather than the lower
rates paid by banks and savings and loan associations. The Federal
Reserve's infamous Regulation Q in those days limited the rates
banks could pay, a move that supposedly kept mortgages affordable
but in reality assured that mortgage money would dry up when market
interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with next Monday's auction of three- and six-month
Treasury bills, the minimum investment in Treasury bills will be
returned to $1,000, where it was before the 1970 change. The
minimum for two- and three-year Treasury notes is being reduced
from $5,000 to $1,000, which had always been the limit for
longer-term Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury also announced improvements in its Treasury Direct
program, which lets investors buy securities directly from the
government, avoiding commissions. Beginning next month, investors
will be able to buy such securities through the Internet. Telephone
purchases will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Once those improvements are up and running, the Treasury should
consider reducing the minimum investments for Treasury securities
even further, at least to $500 and perhaps lower. There is no
reason that such safe investments should be denied to people with
relatively little to invest.

SERGE GOLOVINE, 73, A BALLET STAR OF THE '50S 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serge Golovine, a star of the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas
in the 1950s who was considered one of the most brilliant dancers
of his generation, died on July 31 at a hospital in Paris. He was
73 and lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a heart bypass operation in
early July, Le Figaro reported.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov in later
years, Golovine was known for the airborne quality, lightness and
virtuosity of his dancing.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known roles were the Blue Bird in ``The Sleeping
Beauty,'' where the articulation and elegance of his footwork were
seen to their best advantage, and the title role of ``Le Spectre de
la Rose.'' He was also greatly praised for his poignant portrayal
of Petrouchka, which he danced at the Paris Opera in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Golovine was a leading teacher at the ballet school at the Paris
Opera from 1981 to 1997. He stood out for the gentleness and quiet
wit of his teaching in master classes last summer at the New York
University School of Education, where he was a guest professor with
his wife, Claude Bessy, the director of the Paris Opera Ballet
School.
</P>
<P>
   Golovine, born in Monte Carlo, Monaco, was one of three siblings
who became noted dancers. (His sister, Solange, died several years
ago. George Goviloff, a brother, is now the director of the Theatre
de la Danse in Avignon, France.)
</P>
<P>
   He began his training in Nice, France, with Julie Sedova, a
former Maryinsky dancer, followed by studies with Gustave Ricaux at
the Paris Opera. Golovine made his professional debut at 17 with
the Nouveaux Ballets de Monte Carlo, a refuge for dancers reluctant
to perform in Paris during the German occupation. He joined the
Paris Opera Ballet in 1947 but left in 1950 to join the de Cuevas
company.
</P>
<P>
   During his years with the troupe, which he left in 1962,
Golovine created the role of Iphias in John Taras' ``Piege de
Lumiere.'' His repertory also included the ``Black Swan'' pas de
deux from ``Swan Lake,'' ``Les Sylphides'' and the lead male roles
in ``Giselle'' and the Bournonville production of ``La Sylphide.''
He effectively retired from the stage in 1964, when he joined the
Geneva Ballet as its resident choreographer and ballet master
through 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Golovine's best-known ballets were ``Feu Rouge, Feu Vert'' and
``La Mort de Narcisse.'' He was considered an expert in the staging
of ballets from the 20th-century Russian repertory. He also taught
for Maurice Bejart and at schools throughout the world, including
those of the Danish and English Royal Ballet companies, American
Ballet Theater and the Australian Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Golovine and Ms. Bessy, his childhood sweetheart, married in
1996 after several marriages for each. In his last performance, in
April, Golovine played the stalwart old general to Ms. Bessy's
fierce but flirtatious headmistress in David Lichine's ``Graduation
Ball'' at the Paris Opera Ballet School. He was inducted into the
Legion of Honor in June.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his brother George, Golovine is
survived by another brother, Jean, of Paris, and a daughter by a
previous marriage.

McCULLOUGH IS CLEARED TO JOIN TROJANS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC football recruit Sultan McCullough was granted
his academic eligibility by the NCAA Clearinghouse on Friday and
expected to join the Trojans' training camp today.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, a tailback from Muir High School, was forced to take
a summer class to meet NCAA eligibility requirements. He is
expected to compete with returning players Chad Morton and Malaefou
MacKenzie for playing time at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes likely to join team: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes is
expected to be available for Thursday's practice after striking a
plea bargain arrangement with the Lodi district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes will appear in court Wednesday and plead guilty to a
reduced misdemeanor count for writing bad checks. Hayes is expected
to pay about $8,500 in damages and receive probation.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes had originally faced three felony counts. USC's official
position has been that Hayes could be admitted to the university as
long as he was not guilty of felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot, 200-pound wide receiver, Hayes is considered one of
USC's impact recruits. He started two years at San Jose State,
leading the Spartans in receiving both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback added to roster: USC has added Chad Pierson, a 6-2,
220-pound fullback from Oxnard High. Pierson was recruited by many
Pac-10 schools last year, but only recently passed his Scholastic
Assessment Test. He will be on a full scholarship.

PIAZZA LOOKS LIKE LAST ANGRY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Mike Piazza is not saying much these days. He does not
need to. The body language says it all, especially the scowl.
</P>
<P>
   Scowl and all, Piazza was in the starting lineup Friday night as
the Mets opened a nine-game trip with a weekend series against the
Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. Asked before the game if he was
having any fun at all, Piazza simply said, ``I'm having a blast,''
and walked away, bat in hand, to take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident that seems to have dampened Piazza's
enthusiasm for New York occurred at Shea Stadium Thursday
afternoon, after he was removed from behind the plate in the eighth
inning during a game in which the Mets led the San Francisco Giants
by a run.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine replaced Piazza as part of a double
switch when he sent for Greg McMichael from the bullpen, Valentine
later said the move was a hunch _ and it did work out an inning
later when Matt Franco delivered a key pinch-hit single in what
would have been Piazza's spot in the order as the Mets rallied for
a 9-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Friday he had made the move with the bottom of
the eighth in mind, reasoning that with a hitter in the pitcher's
spot, the Mets would have a better chance to pad their lead in that
inning before San Francisco's outstanding closer, Robb Nen, got a
chance to enter the game.
</P>
<P>
   What Valentine had not planned on, he said, was McMichael
blowing the Mets' lead and Nen going into the game in the eighth
inning to protect a Giants' lead.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, the move required Piazza, an All-Star catcher, to
leave the field during an inning and be replaced by Todd Pratt,
just up from the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   As he took a seat on the Mets bench, Piazza did not look
particularly happy. But as one member of the Mets organization said
Friday, echoing the observations of others, Piazza always seems
upset of late.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the booing at Shea has been bothering Piazza, even
though it has subsided. Or maybe recent suggestions in the news
media that he will not be with the Mets next season have also had
an effect. Much has been made of Piazza's unproductive batting
average with runners in scoring position: entering Friday night's
game, he was hitting only .224 with two home runs and 15 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza also was batting .326 before Friday night in the 62
games since the Mets acquired him from Florida on May 22. And no
one is harder on Piazza than Piazza himself. Publicly, he will not
criticize the fans for booing. Privately, teammates are beginning
to wonder why a player making $8 million in the final year of a
two-year, $15 million deal should be so unhappy at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Todd Hundley. For someone struggling as much as
Hundley was at the plate before he went 3-for-3 on Thursday, it
would have been easy to understand why if his head were hanging in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's response has been exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to sound like an announcer, but Todd's attitude
has been so fabulous,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said Friday. ``When
you're hitting .300, it's very easy. But when you're hitting .150,
it is harder to have a very positive outlook. But Todd's presence
has been wonderful. We're starting to see him produce. And it is
starting to be recognized in the box score as well as in the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting down on himself. It was a tough situation
that he was thrown into. And he's had a positive attitude through
it all. For a baseball player, a missed fly ball or a strikeout is
a personal thing. He's been through a lot really. And he's held up
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The three hits against the Giants could not have come at a
better time for Hundley, who lifted his batting average to .200 in
the 25 games since returning from elbow surgery. Hundley made some
adjustments to his approach at the plate after reviewing videotapes
of his swing into the wee hours of Thursday morning.

FASSEL, LESS TENSE, BEGINS THE SEASON NO LESS INTENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, New York Giants Coach Jim Fassel said he faced his
team's first preseason game with this thought: ``Boy, I'd like to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel was then a rookie head coach. And he knew what that
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know people are wondering if you can coach at all,''
Fassel said this week, recalling the mix of nervousness and
anticipation that gripped him on the eve of that first game a year
ago. ``So you feel like you have something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, asked what he wished for as his Giants prepared for
their first preseason game Saturday night against the Cincinnati
Bengals, Fassel didn't hesitate with his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No injuries,'' the coach said. ``That's it, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, as the coach of the defending division champion,
as the National Football League's 1997 coach of the year, and as
the coach of a team that doesn't have a single starting job up for
grabs, Fassel is more relaxed in his role.
</P>
<P>
   He is no less the taskmaster _ he has been just as vocal
scolding his players in training camp as he was last summer _ it's
just that Fassel is more confident approaching what is still the
formative part of the pro football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told the team that every time we put on that uniform, I
want them to play hard and play smart,'' Fassel said. ``But yes, we
can see the bigger picture now. Other priorities creep in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel won that first preseason game in 1997. Then he lost the
next three, and three of the next four games in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be 1-3 again in the preseason, and it wouldn't worry
me too much,'' Fassel said. ``So long as we were playing hard. I
truly believe that we're a much better team now than we were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I want to win. But I've got a lot of guys
from the second and third teams that I have to see and evaluate.
You can't lose sight of the overall goal.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Fassel plans to play his reserves for about
three-quarters of Saturday's game. And while the Giants,
technically, have no starting roles unsettled, there will be a few
players auditioning for expanded roles.
</P>
<P>
   At running back, for example, expect Tyrone Wheatley to get the
bulk of the carries. Wheatley, with a strong preseason, could still
run his way right into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel won't want to expose Tiki Barber, who is his current
starter, for too long in the exhibition season. Barber, who had a
series of injuries last season, will be protected _ although he is
going to see considerable time as the team's new featured punt
returner.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Brown, the other candidate for the starting job at running
back, has displayed the power-running, between-the-tackles style
the Giants expected of him. The Giants know what Brown can do for
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is Wheatley, as always, about whom the team remains
uncertain. When healthy in training camp, Wheatley has looked in
better shape and more energetic. Fassel and offensive coordinator
Jim Skipper would like nothing better than to see Wheatley have a
strong, consistently productive preseason.
</P>
<P>
   This would allow them to rotate Wheatley, Brown and fullback
Charles Way _ who they would like to use more often as a halfback
this year _ on the early downs in a series and feature Barber in
the third-down packages.
</P>
<P>
   This is Wheatley's best chance to prove his worth yet. And he
seems eager to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the field, wide receiver Ike Hilliard could receive
that first jarring hit since his neck surgery last September. How
Hilliard will react to a testing collision _ there hasn't been one
in training camp _ has been a continuing topic of conversation at
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see me take the lick, get up and run back
to the huddle with a smile on my face,'' Hilliard said. ``I want to
get it over with, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With starting strong safety Sam Garnes out with a sore shoulder,
Giants fans will also get their first look at this year's
first-round draft pick, Shaun Williams. Veteran Rodney Young will
start the game in Garnes' place, but Williams, who has been
impressive at times in camp, will probably play most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sehorn, who has been practicing with the first-string
kickoff return unit, won't return any kickoffs Saturday night.
Sehorn will get a few kickoff-return attempts before the regular
season begins, but Fassel doesn't want to risk Sehorn to injury any
more often than is prudent.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the battle for the backup fullback
spot. So far, it seems apparent that the coaches believe rookie
Greg Comella of Stanford is winning that competition with Eric
Lane, the second-year player who was Way's backup last season.

PARK'S FOUNTAIN OF WHIMSY FLOWS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cherry Hill in Central Park was conceived in the
1860s as a scenic concourse where people on horseback and in
carriages could stop, admire the view of the shimmering lake and
tangled Ramble, and then perhaps take a short walk amid chirping
crickets to nearby Bethesda Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   At Cherry Hill's center was a considerably smaller fountain,
intended as a watering place for horses. When horses faded from the
scene, the area became a parking lot for cars. The fountain has not
been operating for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, after a painstaking restoration, the fountain was
turned on again, much to the delight of regular park goers. ``I
stopped each day, and they told me today would be the day,'' said
Tim Carroll, a police officer on a motorcycle whose beat is the
park.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain is a piece of Victorian whimsy. At the top of the
intricate 14-foot-high tower, water flows out of eight little
flowers, falling into goblet-shaped bowls. Each bowl spills water
onto a granite dome and the water sheets down, ultimately dripping
like light rain into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at how delicate it was, how gentle a fountain
it was,'' said Peter Champe, director of conservation and sculpture
for the Central Park Conservancy, which earlier this year took over
management of the park from the city.
</P>
<P>
   To turn on the fountain, Champe descended into the steaming-hot
underground pumphouse, which has been outfitted with brand-new
electrical and plumbing gear.
</P>
<P>
   He turned on a big valve. He then had to adjust eight small
valves, as a colleague outside told him one or another of the eight
goblets needed water or was getting too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more on No. 8, a little less on No. 3,'' the
conversation went. Ever so slowly, at a rate one-hundredth that of
Bethesda Fountain, water trickled forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now has life again,'' said Vallessa Monk, a monuments
restoration technician.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the fountain is a strange, almost surreal
object, located as it is in the middle of a traffic circle with no
traffic, just north of the 72nd Street drive through the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever a design were ornamental, this is it,'' said Karen
Putnam, president of the Conservancy. ``It is testimony to a
different kind of taste in a different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Champe sees the fountain's initial creation in the 1800s
as something of a lark. He imagines the architect Calvert Vaux, one
of the designers of Central Park, going to his associate Jacob Wrey
Mould and saying: ``Jacob, why don't you go out and design a horse
trough. Make it look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the effort fell short. Bob Garber, a retired architect
who jogs by the fountain daily, said it is out of scale with its
surroundings. Pointing to the granite base, he said: ``It could be
bigger. This base requires a larger statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Putnam says people can like it or not, but all should
understand that it represents an exact reproduction of the High
Victorian aesthetic that prevailed in early years of the park. She
called the fountain ``a decorative arts destination,'' one of the
park's most dramatic. She said it is important to restore such
small, sometimes quirky artistic touches, even as the park's huge
landscape improvements occupy center stage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The restoration of Cherry Hill fountain cost $20,000, which came
from a gift from Elizabeth and Clement Moore through the Indian
Point Foundation. Since 1980, the Conservancy has spent $170
million on restorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the gilding, so to speak,'' Champe said, ``restoring
the smaller, less noticed corners of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors seemed to love the new fountain. ``I could jump
in,'' said John Pierce, a Manhattan recording engineer. Jeanne
Mutti, a tourist from Switzerland, said, ``It's like an oasis
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gruber, a retired retailer wearing just shorts and
sandals, said he walks by Cherry Hill every day and is pleased the
fountain is finally back. Pointing to the view of the glimmering
lake and the verdant Ramble, he said: ``You dwell on life here.
Look at that picture postcard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clip-clopping around the fountain throughout the brilliantly
sunny day were horse-drawn carriages. Some hansom cab drivers said
Cherry Hill is a popular spot for couples to get engaged. The
leisurely equestrian parade scene suggested, just maybe, that not
much has changed since those long-ago days when New York City's
great park opened.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though, has changed: Horses are no longer permitted
to drink from what was once their own fountain.

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE DEAD CORMORANTS OF LITTLE GALLOO ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been trying for several days now to imagine the person or
persons who pulled ashore last week at Little Galloo Island in
eastern Lake Ontario and began firing at the double-crested
cormorants that nest there, killing nearly 900 of them. It isn't
the heat of the act that interests me but its coldness, the fact
that it was an economic crime, in all likelihood, rather than an
act of murderous insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Cormorants feed mainly on non-game fish, yet many anglers
believe, falsely, that the cormorants in the Great Lakes have
sharply reduced the numbers of game fish, like trout and bass.
Someone apparently believed it strongly enough to act upon it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a fisherman, and I've often heard other fishermen cursing
cormorants or pelicans or herons, though never with much passion.
What those anglers were glibly cursing, I think, was their own
inadequacy, their inability to be as stealthy and patient as a
great blue heron. Things would be different if a sport-fisherman's
life depended on stealth and patience, as a heron's does. Imagine
two predators of different species competing for the same prey. If
it's only a game to one of them _ i.e., not a matter of survival _
then the Darwinian rules are suspended. Or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter last week occurred because both sides were playing
in earnest. By 1973, cormorants in the Great Lakes had declined to
only 125 nesting pairs, largely the result of hunting and DDT. But
when the shooting began last week, there were some 8,400 active
nests on Little Galloo Island alone. The birds there fed in the
same waters where local charter-boat captains and fishing guides
take their clients.
</P>
<P>
   If we liked, humans could fish Lake Ontario with devastating
efficiency, the way we do the world's oceans _ so efficiently, in
fact, that it would doom cormorants and all other fish-feeding
birds almost as an afterthought. But sport fishing is intentionally
inefficient. That's one of the things that makes it a sport, one
sharing the same ethic, I believe, with naturalists and
bird-watchers who welcome the return of double-crested cormorants
from near-extirpation in the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   But a game fish becomes an economic force in its own right, its
value inflated by the money anglers spend on travel, gear and
guides just to catch it. And it is the high indirect-dollar value
of game fish that appears to bring cormorants and the sport-fishing
industry into competition, even though the competition is illusory.
Scientific evidence suggests that cormorants take only a tiny
fraction of the fish that game fish themselves, being cannibals,
take when they prey on their own kind. Still, birds make good
scapegoats when the fishing is bad.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this slaughter notable isn't just its savagery or its
magnitude. It's the fact that it reveals in sharp relief the
results of direct human competition with other species, something
we like to pretend no longer exists now that so few of us live in
nature. In fact, the consequences of our competition are merely
forgotten in the past or hidden at the far end of a long chain of
events for which we like to pretend we can disclaim responsibility.
When humans compete with other species, other species always lose.
It's one of the tragic, cardinal facts of our history, which is
filled with scenes like the one on Little Galloo Island.

WAYNE'S WORTH LINGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wherever he is in the middle of his summer vacation, Wayne
Gretzky undoubtedly will pause for a moment Sunday to mark an
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the federal prison in Lompoc, where Bruce McNall is
serving a 70-month sentence for committing $236 million in bank
fraud, the former Kings owner will pause, too, and ponder the
difference a decade makes.
</P>
<P>
   And avid hockey fans with a keen sense of history should take
the time this weekend to consider that 10 years ago Sunday, the
sport they love was irrevocably altered for better and worse by the
news that a frail, pale demigod on skates was changing his address.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, 1998, the sports world was stunned to learn that
Gretzky, hockey's greatest scorer, then 27 years old and at the
height of his powers, had been traded to the Kings by the Edmonton
Oilers in a multi-player deal that also sent a $15-million direct
deposit north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, McNall's blockbuster put hockey on the front
page in mid-summer, remarkable given that the sport traditionally
had struggled to gain attention in Southern California even during
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, and especially in Edmonton, the swap was met with
outrage, and then-Oilers owner Peter Pocklington gained instant
leper status. Today, Pocklington refers to the deal as ``strictly a
business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years ago, a Canadian politician said, ``Wayne Gretzky is
a national symbol like the beaver. ... The Edmonton Oilers without
Wayne Gretzky is like apple pie without ice cream, like winter
without snow, like the ``Wheel of Fortune' without Vanna White.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, Canada and Edmonton survived, though hardly a
year has passed since the deal without a rumor that the Oilers are
about to pick up and move to a sunny home in the southern United
States. Quebec and Winnipeg already have lost their NHL of the six
remaining Canadian teams in the league periodically are reported to
be in peril, in no small part a backhanded tribute to the big-money
era spawned by the Gretzky trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it hasn't all been bleak in Edmonton. The Oilers managed
to win a fifth Stanley Cup after Gretzky left, and Gretzky has not
won a Cup since two months before the trade, when Edmonton captured
its fourth championship in five years.
</P>
<P>
   How to assess the impact of this deal, given a decade's
hindsight?
</P>
<P>
   It has been good. And it has been bad. But it has not been
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, other factors have had significant roles in hockey's
evolution over the past decade. In analyzing hockey's altered
landscape, one cannot ignore the ever-escalating power of
television in sports and the increased militancy of the National
Hockey League Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   But would any of the changes have occurred or been so dramatic
had hockey's finest ambassador not been wrested from a mid-sized
Western Canadian city and dropped smack in the middle of the United
States' second-largest media market?
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned earlier, it's been good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the NHL's only Sun Belt team was the Kings.
Today, there are nine. Ten years ago, there was no U.S.
minor-league team west of Salt Lake City. Today, there are 11,
including the Ice Dogs in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But for those wishing to attend an NHL game in person, proximity
does not necessarily equal accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   The year before Gretzky came to the Kings, the average paid
ticket for a Kings game at the Forum cost $11.50. In Gretzky's
first year as a King, that figure rose to $16.50. By last season,
it had skyrocketed to $40.34. And for the coming season, Kings fans
have been treated to an 11-percent hike in ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring ticket costs in Los Angeles and around the NHL have
gone hand-in-hand with the rise in player salaries, another
development that can be linked closely to the Gretzky deal.
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky joined the Kings, he was coming off a season in
which he'd earned $1.1 million Canadian about $700,000 in U.S.
currency. With McNall freely spending money it would turn out he
should not have been spending, Gretzky's income rapidly increased.
This season, Gretzky will be paid $6 million by the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's fellow players should kiss the ice he skates on.
Salaries only began to rise so rapidly because there was someone of
Gretzky's mass appeal to set new standards. Since the NHLPA started
tracking such figures, the average NHL player's salary has jumped
from $271,000 in 1990-91 to $1.167 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone believe any of this would have happened so quickly
if Gretzky had not hit the Los Angeles scene and opened the NHL's
doors to puck-ignorant places such as Anaheim, San Jose, Miami,
Tampa and Nashville, to name a few?
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone believe sales of NHL licensed merchandise, as
reported by the league, would have increased 10-fold over the past
decade, to $1.2 billion in 1997-98, if Gretzky had not pulled that
silver and black Kings jersey over his head in 1988 while standing
on a stage in the packed ballroom of a hotel situated a few breaths
of carbon monoxide from Los Angeles International Airport?
</P>
<P>
   But there was only so much Gretzky could do.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he could not win a Stanley Cup in Los Angeles,
though he probably came within a Marty McSorley curved stick of
doing so in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And Gretzky did not transform Los Angeles forevermore into
anything resembling a hockey town. When the Kings began their
decline on the ice, the big crowds disappeared, even before Gretzky
was traded to St. Louis in 1996. Average attendance last season
(13,019) was closer to that of the Kings' final pre-Gretzky year
(11,667) than it was to the first season with Gretzky (14,875) or
the sold-out season of 1991-92, when there wasn't an officially
empty seat in the Forum all year.
</P>
<P>
   On a national scale, there is similar and plentiful evidence
that in most places in the United States, a losing NHL team leads
to instant fan indifference. The bright light Gretzky brought with
his move to the U.S. doesn't fill seats in the arenas of most
losers. And it doesn't impel fans to sit in front of their big
screens, either, as evidenced by national television ratings that
were in a free fall last season. Simply put, Gretzky's appeal was
never enough to spare us the glowing puck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the participant level, hockey never has been more
popular in the U.S. Today, nearly one-half million players are
registered with the sport's umbrella agency, USA Hockey, more than
double the number from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   And of all those kids, how many took their first strides
dreaming of being the next Mario Lemieux, Pavel Bure, Dominik Hasek
or Cammi Granato? Chances are, more of them have dreams of being
No. 99 than all the others combined.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Gretzky's on-ice legacy, awe-inspiring as it is,
almost certainly would have been even greater had he simply stayed
put.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from 1979-88 with an Edmonton lineup dotted with Hall of
Famers, Gretzky produced 2.4 points a game, and his teams were 192
games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with inconsistently-talented teams ever since, Gretzky
has averaged 1.56 points a game and his teams have been 16 games
below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Age and injuries have played into the decline of Gretzky's
still-impressive post-Edmonton statistics. But how stratospheric
would his numbers have been and how many more Stanley Cups would
the Oilers have won if Gretzky had spent the last 10 years skating
alongside all his old Edmonton buddies, instead of just some of
them?
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know, of course, and the reason we won't is the
trade that happened 10 years ago Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, its impact on hockey has been greater than
anyone could have predicted.

REPUBLICANS AGAIN SEEK CANDIDATE FOR COMPTROLLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A day after Ramon Antonio Serbia withdrew from
the state comptroller's race, in part because of his involvement in
a bank fraud case in Puerto Rico, Republican leaders began talking
Friday about how to best round out their ticket with a new
candidate for comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. John Rowland's Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep.
Barbara Kennelly, criticized the governor for a ``cavalier
attitude'' in choosing a statewide candidate without a more
extensive background check.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders said they did not know that Serbia was acquitted
of bank fraud charges in 1986 in Puerto Rico, and saw no need for
an extensive background check because they knew him personally and
he had been a state employee and a party worker.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia had also claimed on his campaign biography that he held
two academic degrees, which was not true. At one point on Thursday,
the Republican Party chairman, Chris DePino, said they did not
check Serbia's educational background in part because he was 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``For heaven's sake,'' Mrs. Kennelly said at a news conference
Friday in Wethersfield. ``Fifty-eight? What, is there a statute of
limitations? That is what we're talking about. A very cavalier
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they did know that Serbia had filed his federal
income tax late, but did not think that was a problem, because he
was paying the taxes he owed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Mrs. Kennelly admitted Friday that she did not expect
the case to become a major issue, and Republican leaders began
mentioning names of possible replacements for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Facing criticism by Democrats that the controversy over Serbia
resulted from Rowland's being too eager to put another minority
candidate on the ticket, Republicans on Friday stressed they would
choose the best candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But DePino said that if candidates were equally qualified, he
would like to see someone from Fairfield County or New London
County, and two names were mentioned on Friday: state Rep. Marilyn
Hess of Greenwich and Andrew Norton, a former state representative
from Colchester who ran for the Republican nomination for Congress
in the 2nd District and who recently said publicly that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   DePino said other people being considered included state Rep.
Christopher Scalzo of Ridgefield, and Susan Townsley, first
selectwoman of Old Saybrook.
</P>
<P>
   DePino said that he would discuss candidates with Rowland and
other party leaders early next week, and expected to name a
replacement by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Fergus Cullen, Rowland's deputy campaign manager, said that
while there were several candidates to choose from, it was still
too early to decide who would fill the slot. ``It's not as though
we had a bullpen of backup catchers here in case someone was
injured,'' he said.

THE OLD HANDS AND THE NEW SHARE A FEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the Yankees showed up early enough Friday to
make sure the long day of baseball in the Bronx would stretch even
longer. That's what happens when players on the finest club in the
major leagues are trying to be remembered as one of the best teams
ever. That is why it made sense for the players, destined to spend
at least 13 hours at Yankee Stadium, to gulp that first cup of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees and Royals playing games at 1:05 p.m. and at
7:35 p.m., with a separate admission for each one, the whole scene
was similar to an American Legion tournament rather than an
American League doubleheader _ play a game, devour a meal, wait a
few hours and play another game.
</P>
<P>
   This wrinkle in the schedule, caused by a rainout in May, did
not affect the Yankees, who pummeled the Royals, 8-2 and 14-2. They
did so in the first game behind the pitching of David Cone, the
offense of Darryl Strawberry, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams,
and Pat Rapp's shabby imitation of a pitcher _ all before a crowd
of 14,425, the team's lowest attendance figure of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance swelled to 37,988 in the second game and the
Yankees' record swelled to 82-29 as David Wells outdid Cone with
his fourth complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer outdid everyone in going 5-for-5 and powering the
Yankees to the victory. The rookie, filling in for Paul O'Neill in
right field, slugged the first two home runs of his career, and hit
two doubles and a single while scoring four runs and driving in
three.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch lined his ninth homer since the All-Star Game
break and Williams had a two-run shot that traveled 416 feet. Luis
Sojo had three hits and three RBIs as New York moved 53 games over
.500, a season high, and ensured a winning record for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' pitching was as impressive as the offense. Jermaine
Allensworth's run-scoring double in the third ended Wells' streak
of 25 straight at-bats without allowing a hit with runners in
scoring position, but that was the only serious dent the Royals
made.
</P>
<P>
   Neatly spotting his fastball, slider and changeup, Wells (14-3)
walked none, struck out four and allowed only six hits in winning
his sixth straight decision to creep closer to winning 20 for the
first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready to play,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``That
becomes a habit after a while. Now we're into August and we're used
to doing it all year.''
</P>
<P>
   With each day the Yankees pull on the pinstripes, they overwhelm
inferior teams such as the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (16-4) became the first 16-game winner in the majors and
strengthened his candidacy for the Cy Young Award by halting the
Royals on two runs and six hits in the opener, striking out five
and walking none in six and two-thirds innings. Martinez drove in
three runs, Williams knocked in two, and Strawberry had another
mammoth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's last six hits have been home runs, giving him 21,
and he has nine homers in his last 29 at-bats. Arthritic knee and
all, Strawberry was intentionally walked in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an imposing figure,'' Torre said. ``Every time he
swings the bat, it's a home run. At least it's been that way the
last few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry simply said, ``I feel a great confidence when I come
to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like Cone on the mound. After permitting a run in the
first on a double by Johnny Damon and a single by Jose Offerman,
Cone watched the Yankees score four runs off Rapp and then helped
his team run away. He retired 15 of 17 batters through six innings
as the Yankees pushed the lead to 6-2 and then 8-2. Cone's control
was precise and stingy with men on base as the Royals went 1 for 9.
Once again, Cone won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen wins is amazing to me,'' said Cone, who might
challenge the 20-3 record he had with the Mets in 1988. ``Again,
it's a byproduct of a great record. I've had great run support.''
</P>
<P>
   That started early as the Yankees scored four runs during a
first inning walkathon in which Rapp made 38 pitches. Williams
singled in the first run, and Martinez doubled in the second,
putting Yankees on second and third with one out. After Rapp fell
behind Strawberry, 2-0, the Yankee was walked intentionally.
``That's respect,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said, ``I was thinking, well, maybe they want to get
a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that. Rapp inexplicably walked Tim Raines on five pitches
to force in the third run, and Martinez slid over the plate and
then reached back to touch it before Mike Sweeney tagged him while
scoring the fourth run on Scott Brosius' sacrifice fly. Williams
singled in another in the second to make the score 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry gave them a splashy show in the third by
rocketing Rapp's high 1-2 fastball into the fourth row of the
right-field upper deck. He jogged stiff-legged around the bases, a
sight that has become more familiar lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the game begins, I'm thinking about hitting, not about
hitting homers,'' Strawberry said. ``The homers are just coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as quickly as victories.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Because David Cone has now pitched 149 innings and is scheduled
to make 10 more starts, he is almost guaranteed to eclipse 200
innings and trigger a $5.5 million option for 1999. While the
Yankees must offer the option if he hits 200, Cone can accept it or
become a free agent. Cone has reiterated that he wants to remain
with the Yankees. ``If I pitch the way I can, everything will work
itself out,'' said Cone, who is 10-0 at Yankee Stadium this season
and 25-3 as a Yankee in the Bronx.
