Welcome to the `House of Pain' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ England rugby coach Clive Woodward
has warned his players about the prospect of embarrassment when
they step into the ``House of Pain'' against New Zealand on
Saturday.
	   The local nickname for the Carisbrook ground is a sobering one
for England's players, whom many believe face a torturous afternoon
against the All Blacks.
	   Woodward, who accepted the blame for England's record 76-0 loss
in Brisbane two weeks ago, is expected to make eight changes from
that match. He will need a magnificent effort from his side to
prevent the All Blacks from breaking their records for winning
margin (27 points) and highest score (45) against England.
	   ``We cannot be any less competitive than we were in Brisbane,''
Woodward said. ``And there will be no excuses for the 15 players
who start on Saturday. I am not expecting a repeat of Brisbane _ I
am far more confident that we can give this test match a real go.
No-one has panicked.''
	   England will need much more than an absence of panic to win its
first test on New Zealand soil for 25 years.
	   Woodward's team was thrashed by an Australian outfit with a new
fly-half, Stephen Larkham, who destroyed the tourists by launching
repeated attacking waves.
	   Despite the loss of captain Sean Fitzpatrick, Zinzan Brooke,
Frank Bunce and Justin Marshall, New Zealand still has an imposing
lineup, including England's great nemesis Jonah Lomu on the wing.
	   Defense is crucial, says Woodward.
	   ``With someone like Jonah around, you need a physical presence
all over the pitch _ he doesn't just attack from wing positions,
and our whole first-up defense must be rock solid,'' Woodward said.
	   Woodward refused to name a side for the test, abandoning custom
to instead pick a 23-man squad with the final XV to be announced
just before kick off.
	   Six players were axed from England's Brisbane squad _ Dominic
Chapman, Steve Ravenscroft, Stuart Potter, Alex King, Duncan Bell
and Richard Pool-Jones. Spencer Brown, Scott Benton, Ben Sturnham
and Tony Diprose are expected to miss the starting side.
	   The key is the forwards where Danny Grewcock, Gareth Archer, Ben
Clarke and Steve Ojomoh must hold their own against the All Blacks
pack to allow returning scrum half Matt Dawson room to move.
	   New Zealand coach John Hart, who will become his country's most
successful All Blacks coach with 26 wins if the home side prevails
in Taine Randell's captaincy debut, is one of the few predicting a
tough struggle.
	   ``I think England will be very physical _ they have a galvanized
pack, and I expect a huge confrontation between the forwards,''
Hart said.
	   England's lack of competitiveness in Australia has flowed on to
the mood across the Tasman Sea, and the buildup in Dunedin has been
low key.
	   ``I think there's a bit of dampener on the whole occasion,
firstly because England didn't bring all their top players out and
secondly because of their performance _ it makes our job a bit
harder because of the high expectation,'' said All Blacks lock
Robin Brooke.
	   The 40,000 tickets have sold out, albeit on match eve instead of
the usual weeks before.
	   ``It's a bit like the beer in English pubs,'' said Dunedin
restaurant manager Marc Gosling, ``pretty flat.''

Butler: Iraq must act to have sanctions lifted 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ United Nations special weapons
inspector Richard Butler said on Friday that Iraq has an
opportunity to have lifted the economic sanctions imposed on it
after its invasion of Kuwait.
	   If Iraq gave UN inspectors the materials and documents they need
to verify destruction of its weapons of mass destruction, Butler
may be able to recommend the lifting of sanctions, he said.
	   ``I am hinting, obviously, at clause 22,'' Butler said,
referring to the UN provision dealing with sanctions.
	   Butler's certification _ with UN Security Council verification _
that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed or
dismantled, would lead to an automatic revoking of the sanctions,
he told an international law conference in Canberra.
	   ``There is no way that any of this will be possible unless Iraq
gives us the materials and documents that we want,'' he said.
	   ``We know that these materials exist, we know that they are in
the possession of the government of Iraq.
	   ``I am asking (Iraq) to give us the documents we need.''
	   Butler said the matter now rests with the Iraqi government.

South Korea to pay for U.S. troops in local currency 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will be allowed to pay
most of its share of maintaining U.S. troops in its territory in
local currency this year, saving it about 140 billion won (dlrs 100
million).
	   The agreement was announced Friday at a joint news conference at
the Defense Ministry attended by high-ranking U.S. and South Korean
military officials.
	   Seoul had promised to pay the United States dlrs 399 million
this year as its share of the cost of keeping some 37,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea.
	   But given South Korea's financial crisis, the United States
agreed to accept most of the payment in won at a pre-crisis
exchange rate of 907.6 won to the dollar. The won was trading at
1,392.1 to the dollar Friday.
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side against North
Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended without a peace
treaty, leaving the two Koreas still technically in a state of war.

Philippine Airlines' ground crew union to file strike notice 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground
personnel threatened Friday to join a devastating 2-week-old
pilots' strike at Philippine Airlines that has already brought
Asia's oldest airline to the brink of financial ruin.
	   The ground workers' union said it would file a strike notice
with the labor department later Friday, while the flight
attendants' union said it plans a strike vote.
	   The unions are not able to strike for at least 15 days after
filing a strike notice because of a mandatory cooling-off period.
	   The Philippine flag carrier, meanwhile, filed a rehabilitation
plan Friday with Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission saying
it is unable to meet payments on its loans, estimated at dlrs 2
billion, because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   The pilots' strike has cost the company more than 2 billion
pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL said.
	   PAL did not say in its petition what specific form the debt
relief would take, but pledged that all creditors would be paid
``in due course'' if the plan is implemented.
	   The airline says it plans to lay off 40 percent of its
13,000-member work force, dispose of 40 of its 54 planes, suspend
more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some subsidiaries.
	   It said Thursday it will decide in three months whether it will
shut down after seeing the results of the rehabilitation plan.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an
airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The plan put 225
pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union says.
	   The labor department has upheld PAL's power to retire the
pilots, which is included in a collective bargaining agreement
signed by the union and management.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots last week after they ignored a
government back-to-work order and now has only 25 management pilots
left.
	   The airline was already in serious financial shape before the
strike because of years of losses and an ambitious dlrs 4 billion
modernization program launched shortly before Asia's currency
crisis. The crisis sharply reduced passenger numbers and inflated
operating and loan repayment costs.
	   PAL says it currently is operating only 30 out of its normal 132
daily domestic flights and flying to only four of the more than 30
international destinations it used to serve.
	   Among destinations where flights have been suspended are
Australia, the Middle East, Europe, South Korea, China, Thailand,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.
	   PAL will continue flights to Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and San
Francisco and will probably resume service to Taipei, Fukuoka and
Los Angeles in the next few weeks, the company says.
	   PAL says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in the
fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its 57-year
history.

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Of all the major championships, it is the
U.S. Open that requires more than mere golfing skill to win.
	   It took a healthy helping of that self-control to handle the
treacherous Lake Course at The Olympic Club in Thursday's first
round of the U.S. Open.
	   Player after player had his hopes swallowed up in the ankle-deep
rough, slip away on the lightning-fast greens, or fade away on the
brutal stretch of closing holes.
	   Payne Stewart was up to the task, closing birdie-birdie-birdie
to take the lead at 4-under-par 66.
	   ``Always be satisfied with making par,'' said Stewart, who won
the Open in 1991. ``There is nothing wrong with making par on any
hole out there.''
	   Tom Lehman showed his grit when he fell to 2-over par after a
double bogey on the 10th hole and then made three birdies in the
last four holes to be at 68 along with Bob Tway, Jose Maria
Olazabal and Joe Durant.
	   And virtual unknown Mark Carnevale had it for one day at least,
making a spectacular birdie on No. 17 to slip in between Stewart
and Lehman with a 67.
	   But many others failed the test, letting good rounds slip away
over the final holes.
	   ``That's the beauty of the U.S. Open,'' David Duval said after
four bogeys in the final eight holes led to a 75. ``You're never so
happy as when you're done. There's no letup.''
	   Tiger Woods made bogeys on Nos. 16 and 17 and shot a 74. Steve
Pate was 2-under par with three holes to play but finished
bogey-bogey-double bogey and shot a 72. Tom Kite let a 2-under-par
round slip away with a double bogey on No. 16 and was at even-par
70.
	   ``You know coming here that par is going to be a really good
score,'' Stewart said. ``I took advantage of some breaks out there
today, and that's what you have to do in the U.S. Open.''
	   Among his breaks were a 12-foot (3.7-meter) putt to save par on
No. 5 and a 15-foot (4.6-meter) par-saver on the ninth hole. He
also made all three of his closing birdies from out of the rough
when he was fortunate enough to get good lies.
	   Lingering three shots off the lead were John Daly, the
Swedish-born Jesper Parnevik and Jeff Maggert at 69, one stroke
under par.
	   And while precious few players could get under par, a bunch of
big-names put up some big numbers, including Jim Furyk at 74, South
African Ernie Els at 75, the highest of his 20 U.S. Open rounds,
and Britain's Nick Faldo at 76.
	   PGA Championship winner Davis Love III, who is struggling with a
bad back, shot a 41 on the back nine to finish with a 78.
	   Colin Montgomerie was at 70, along with French-born Andrew
Magee, Masters champion Mark O'Meara and 19-year-old amateur Matt
Kuchar.
	   ``Limit the mistakes,'' Montgomerie said. ``That's a key to the
U.S. Open.''
	   Casey Martin, the first player to ride in a cart at the U.S.
Open, nearly ran over a tournament official with his cart after he
left the first tee. He also had trouble closing, making bogeys on
the last two holes for a 74.
	   ``It was overwhelming with the support I got,'' Martin said. ``I
have to admit that I was almost crying on the first tee when they
gave me that ovation.''
	   Lehman was carried along by a wildly supportive gallery clearly
aware that he has played in the final group in the last three U.S.
Opens only to finish third, second and third.
	   Wearing his trademark knickers, Stewart raised his putter in
triumph and punched his right fist through the air when a 12-foot
(3.7-meter) birdie fell into the cup on the final hole.
	   ``That hole is a par 5,'' Stewart said after he needed a driver
and a 2-iron to get to the green. ``On the scorecard it says I made
a birdie, but that was an eagle in my mind.''
	   The U.S. Golf Association came into the Open threatening to ban
high-tech clubs, but it didn't have to take the driver out of
Daly's bag. The course did it instead.
	   Playing with no driver because the 6,797-yard (6,213-meter)
course is so short, Daly turned the front nine at 2-over par, then
shot a 32 on the back side.
	   ``I'm going to tape it up and leave it in the trunk and take out
a 3-wood again tomorrow,'' Daly said, who compared giving up his
driver to giving up drinking.
	   ``The fairways are just too narrow here,'' he said.
	   Cruising along at 2-under par through eight holes, Woods played
the final 10 holes six over par, beginning with a four-putt on No.
9.
	   ``I'm not in that bad of shape,'' Woods insisted, despite being
eight strokes back.

Long Term Credit Bank unhappy with Moody's downgrade 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Long Term Credit Bank criticized a U.S.
credit rating agency Friday for downgrading its debt rating.
	   Moody's Investors Services on Thursday lowered LTCB's
subordinate debt rating to B1 from Ba1. That caused the bank's
stock price to plummet about 20 percent Friday morning, dipping
below 100 yen for the first time since its shares were listed.
	   An LTCB spokesman called the move unfortunate and said he can't
understand what prompted Moody's downgrade. He spoke on condition
of anonymity, as spokesmen at such companies often do in Japan.
	   LTCB's shares have lost about 40 percent of their value this
week on rumors that the bank was struggling to stay afloat.
	   A rapid erosion in a company's share price is often seen as a
sign of imminent collapse.
	   The stock of defunct Yamaichi Securities Co. experienced a
similar slide prior to the company's failure in November.
	   Analysts say fears are growing that the government is preparing
to allow some weak financial institutions to collapse as it
restructures the country's financial system.
	   On Friday, Kyodo news agency quoted unidentified government
sources as saying the government is considering measures to bail
out LTCB, including a possible merger with Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The share price of LTCB, Japan's second largest long term credit
bank, peaked in April 1987 at 2,820 yen.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Mauricio Cienfuegos scored twice in
the final 30 minutes as the Los Angeles Galaxy overcame a sluggish
first half to defeat the Colorado Rapids 2-1 in a Major League
Soccer match Thursday night.
	   Cienfuegos' left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area
eluded goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann with five minutes to play for
his ninth goal after Ezra Hendrickson's header went to Carlos
Hermosillo, who deflected the ball back to Cienfuegos.
	   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made a season-high 10 saves for the
Galaxy (13-2), which won its third consecutive match to tie D.C.
United for the league lead in victories.
	   Midfielder Ross Paule scored in the 41st minute for Colorado
(6-9), which had its three-match winning streak snapped before a
season-low announced crowd of 9,741 at the Rose Bowl.
	   Cienfuegos tied the score on a 60th-minute penalty kick. Referee
Paul Tamberino awarded the penalty kick when Rapids defender Joey
DiGiamarino tackled Galaxy midfielder Wellington Sanchez from
behind in the penalty area.
	   Paule gave Colorado a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute. Peter Vermes'
long pass into the penalty area was headed out by Los Angeles
midfielder Clint Mathis to Paule, who put a 15-yard (14-meter) shot
past Hartman for his fifth goal.

Micron Technology to take 25 percent stake in semiconductor venture 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Micron Technology Inc., a major U.S. maker of
memory chips, will establish a foothold in Japan by acquiring from
Texas Instruments Inc. a 25 percent equity stake in a joint
semiconductor venture with Kobe Steel Ltd.
	   Texas Instruments agreed to transfer its memory business in the
joint venture with Kobe Steel to the Boise, Idaho-based Micron,
Kobe Steel said in a release.
	   Because of a glut of memory chips in world markets and sharp
decreases in DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, chip prices,
the joint venture, KTI Semiconductor Ltd., has been in a slump
since 1996, Kobe Steel said.
	   Officials from Kobe Steel and TI have been in discussion over
the rebuilding of the joint venture and recently reached an
agreement that TI's equity share in KTI will be transferred to
Micron, a fast-growing semiconductor maker.
	   Kobe Steel will maintain the remaining 75 percent share in KTI,
which is capitalized at 42.1 billion yen (dlrs 307 million). KTI,
based in Nishiwaki, western Japan, was set up in 1990 and produces
16-megabit DRAMs and 64-megabit DRAMs. It employs 800 workers.
	   ``Micron's equity participation in KTI will enable us to gain a
production facility in Japan, one of the world's largest
semiconductor markets,'' Steven Appleton, Micron's chairman, chief
executive officer and president, said in the statement.
	   With the cooperation of KTI, Micron _ the biggest U.S. memory
chip maker _ will have the world's largest monthly production
capacity of 30 million chips in 1999, according to industry
sources.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan reassured the United States on Friday that it
will take swift measures to solve its bad loan problem and restore
health to its financial system, Japan's central bank said.
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told visiting Deputy U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that disposing of the pile of
soured loans held by Japanese banks is vital to sparking an
economic recovery, the BOJ said in a statement.
	   Summers expressed understanding of Japan's position on the bad
debt issue, the BOJ said.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo after the yen plummeted this week to an eight-year low
against the U.S. dollar, raising fears of another bout of currency
devaluations around Asia.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   In a meeting earlier with Deputy Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro
Nukaga, Summers urged Japan to implement steps to jumpstart its
economy and dispose of bad debts before elections for the upper
house of Parliament are held on July 12, the Nikkei news service
reported.
	   Friday's series of high-level meetings began with discussions
between Summers and Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. The two
applauded the success of the joint intervention to stop the yen's
slide.
	   ``We had good discussions,'' Summers told reporters after the
meeting. ``The United States and Japan share a very strong interest
in a return to sustained growth in the Asian continent.''
	   In a meeting late Thursday, Summers and Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, stressed the
need for close cooperation to stabilize both the yen and regional
currencies, the Nihon Keizai economic daily reported Friday.
	   Summers and Sakakibara also agreed that structural reform in
Japan's financial sector was essential to restoring calm to the
currency market, the newspaper said.
	   Early Friday, Sakakibara told reporters that his talks with
Summers had been ``informal'' and that he could not comment on
them.
	   On Thursday, Hayami also held talks with the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William McDonough, who
accompanied Summers on his visit, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   Hayami told McDonough that the BOJ has ordered banks to publicly
disclose their estimates of bad-asset burdens, the newspaper
reported.
	   Shortly before Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a nationally televised press
conference that Japan's economy would recover after the government
implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   He also pledged to come up with a program to clean up the bad
loans at the nation's banks.
	   Declining financial markets and worries about banks had severely
discouraged consumers, Hashimoto said, conceding that his
government's decision to raise the nation's sales tax last year had
hurt the economy.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   Japan will also host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation.
	   Finance officials from the Group of Seven _ Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Japan, Germany and the United States _ are expected
to attend along with as many as 22 senior officials from the
``Manila Framework Group'' of Asian countries.
	   Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank were also expected to attend.

Plans for third Australian airline backed by U.S. retirement fund 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A new airline company plans to start a
third domestic service in Australia, a direct assault on the
duopoly of Qantas Airways and Ansett Australia, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The Australian Financial Review said that Australian Airline
Holdings Ltd. claims to have secured a ``war chest'' of U.S. dlrs
500 million (Australian dollars 820 million) from a U.S. retirement
fund to start the new airline.
	   The paper said the company planned to acquire eight Boeing
737-300s and 400s for a coast-to-coast operation of 60 flights a
day, linking seven major Australian cities.
	   Company spokesman Paul Orpwood told the paper his proposed
venture would not indulge in ``suicidal'' price cutting and that it
aimed to fill a gap in the business and leisure markets.
	   The company intended to employ 500 staff directly, with another
420 subcontractors, the paper said.
	   ``Several meetings have been held with the Civil Aviation Safety
Authority about gaining an operator's certificate,'' it reported.
	   ``Detailed talks have taken place with the operator of
privatized Brisbane airport, which has set aside land for (the
company) to construct an administration and maintenance base.''
	   The company had also applied for slots at Sydney airport and was
understood to have been offered space at Melbourne airport, the
paper said.

Rebutting criticism, China accuses U.S. of nuclear proliferation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Attempting to blunt allegations China sold
nuclear technology to other nations, Chinese defense scholars have
accused the United States of contributing to nuclear proliferation.
	   The United States' dominant nuclear arsenal and its refusal to
forswear the use of nuclear weapons encourages nations to develop
deterrent forces, the scholars said in a signed editorial Friday in
the China Daily, an official English-language newspaper.
	   ``The United States has never promised no use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear nations. How can the non-nuclear nations feel
secure?'' the newspaper quoted Ouyang Liping, a researcher at a
think tank run by China's spy agency, as saying.
	   The criticisms come a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrives in China for a summit with Chinese leaders. They are likely
to discuss prominently last month's nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan and Chinese fears of a nuclear arms race on its southwest
flank.
	   Beijing's insistence that the United States pledge not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons against China has apparently scuttled
attempts to negotiate a summit agreement in which both sides would
stop targeting each other with ballistic missiles.
	   If U.S. nuclear policy does not change, Pakistan will not be the
last country to conduct nuclear tests, Zhu Chenghu of the National
Defense University, was quoted as saying.
	   The comments, in an official editorial, underscore long-running
tensions in Chinese-U.S. relations over nuclear proliferation. U.S.
intelligence has uncovered evidence this decade that China was
transferring nuclear and missile know-how to Pakistan and Iran _
charges which Beijing has always denied.
	   Although China has worked to develop stronger export controls
over the past two years with Washington's help, U.S. Ambassador
James Sasser said last week that suspect Chinese technology is
still leaking out.
	   Accusations that China has transferred nuclear or missile
technology are ``totally groundless,'' China Daily said.
	   Instead, the scholars said the United States has tested the
limit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it and China
have both signed.
	   The United States developed a new nuclear weapon in May 1997
that can penetrate hardened underground facilities and in July
conducted a low level nuclear test, despite NPT restrictions, the
scholars said. They did not elaborate how these may have violated
the treaty.
	   The treaty and a global pact banning the testing of nuclear
weapons have been criticized by India and other nations for
favoring what were until last month the five declared nuclear
power: China, the United States, Russia, Britain and France.

Mahathir attacks West, denies cronyism

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday railed against ``foreign powers,'' whom he accused of trying
to topple him and ruin his country, while denying that cronyism and
nepotism had hurt the economy.
	   Blaming foreign companies for preying on Malaysian companies
weakened by the Asian economic crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad urged ruling party members at their annual convention to
unite and deflect the attacks.
	   Mahathir dismissed accusations of crony capitalism in Asian
nations, saying Malaysians should not be influenced by Western
propaganda and by marauding market forces.
	   ``Rightly, the development process of the Malays, migrating from
farmers to entrepreneurs and educated traders, ought to continue,''
Mahathir told some 2,000 delegates at the United Malays National
Organization general assembly.
	   ``However it seems there are quarters who will not allow this.
We are pushed to become a backward, weak race, that is recolonized
and having to serve others,'' he said. ``They are trying to destroy
all that we have built.''
	   Mahathir received a standing ovation for the highly anticipated
speech in which he warned of approaching neocolonialism.
	   ``When a country becomes poor, its politics will become unstable
and the fight for power will ensue,'' he said. ``As a result,
leaders will be changed until a candidate willing to take (his)
place is found, one who is willing to submit to world powers. In
other words, colonialism has occurred.''
	   ``Finally, the problems become worse, leaders are unable to work
together, and either one will fall,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir, 72, may have been alluding to his second in command,
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, 51, who is also finance
minister and Mahathir's hand-picked successor, has often been at
odds with his mentor over the handling of the economy. Anwar is
pegged by some as more level-headed and better suited to lead the
country into the next century.
	   Some political observers had been anticipating a showdown
between the two men during the convention.
	   On Thursday, however, Anwar called on the party to stand behind
the prime minister during the economic crisis and echoed Mahathir's
controversial theory that foreign currency speculators are to blame
for the country's economic woes.
	   For the first time since the Asian contagion began battering the
economy one year ago and sent the currency and stock markets
crashing, Malaysia posted a negative growth rate of 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998. That compared with a robust 6.9 percent
growth in 1997.
	   Mahathir's anti-Western rhetoric has often scared investors and
sent the ringgit and stock market plunging.
	   But Mahathir, long the outspoken champion of the Southeast Asian
nations, has never been timid in voicing his belief that Western
powers would like to unseat him and cow the region.
	   Once accomplished, he said, Southeast Asia would then be forced
to beg those very same ``mat sallehs'' _ or ``white men''
colonialists _ for financial help.
	   ```Mat sallehs' should know because they are `mat sallehs' and
they are smarter than we are,'' he said.
	   Mahathir's comments at the first party conference since Malaysia
has slid into a deep economic crisis come amid rumbles of criticism
within UMNO about his 17-year leadership.
	   At the opening of the assembly Thursday, some delegates cheered
the youth leader who spoke out against corruption and nepotism
within the party.
	   Mahathir on Friday challenged the accusations.
	   ``Unfortunately, whoever is given the opportunity and support
will be branded as a crony,'' said Mahathir. ``If he succeeded and
became rich, he will be accused of being a crony although he has
not received any government assistance and is not close to any
leader.''

Mahathir: IMF would threaten affirmative action program 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia_Politics
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An IMF-supported revival of its
economy could force Malaysia to roll back its affirmative action
program for indigenous Malays, the prime minister warned Friday.
	   A bailout package would mean opening businesses to foreigners
and scrapping the 30-percent equity reservation for Malays, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the ruling United Malays National
Organization at its annual meeting.
	   ``With that, not only can foreigners own 100 percent equity in
our companies and banks, but they can also carry out their business
in our country without our participation,'' said Mahathir, in a
speech that heatedly reiterated his accusations that Western powers
were trying to seize control of the Southeast Asian country.
	   The 1971 National Economic Policy is designed to give Malays _
``Bumiputera,'' or ``sons of the soil'' _ a bigger role in
business, once dominated by ethnic Chinese. It sets quotas for
universities, government jobs and business contracts.
	   The policy has hugely benefited the mostly Muslim Malays, who
comprise about 60 percent of Malaysia's 22 million people, and has
been credited with maintaining a peaceful coexistence among Malays
and ethnic Chinese and Indians.
	   The NEC created prosperous middle and upper classes. It also
cemented UMNO power by assuring Malays their loyalty would be
rewarded.
	   ``The Malays and other Bumiputeras are still not strong enough
to be left alone to fend for themselves without UMNO's leadership
and protection,'' Mahathir said.
	   He said an IMF package would no doubt call for the end of the
Bumiputera quota, as IMF officials would see it as ``unacceptable
to their liberal democracy.''
	   ``Obviously there will not be any giant Bumiputera companies.
And we will be happy as there will not be any more Bumiputera
billionaires and millionaires with their Mercedes, private jets and
luxury yachts,'' said Mahathir.
	   ``The foreigners will earn high wages. They will in turn be the
millionaires and billionaires with the Mercedes, private aircraft
and luxury boats.''
	   Malaysia last year introduced austerity measures to stave off an
IMF bailout with its harsh conditions. Mahathir pointed to the
strict IMF measures in Indonesia, which led to soaring food and
fuel prices _ and deadly riots.
	   Still, the Malaysian economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter of 1998, and independent projections have contradicted the
government's optimism of a quick revival.

Excerpts from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's speech 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Politics
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's speech Friday at
the annual convention of Malaysia's governing United Malays
National Organization party.
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   ``They (foreign powers) are trying to destroy all that we have
built, the developments we have achieved and the corporate figures
we have nurtured. Their intention is to enslave the Malays ...
	   ``Do remember, those who created the economic turmoil that we
are facing now are just like the colonialists, who once colonized
us. Do not think their behavior has changed. As the Malay adage
goes, `Tigers will always have their stripes.'
	   ``When the Serbs attacked the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, the
West didn't do anything. Muslims were slaughtered, raped and
massacred in front of soldiers of the West who were supposedly sent
to save the Bosnians, yet did not lift a finger to help save the
Bosnian Muslims.
	   ``Currency and shares are the preserve of the rich. Let them
feel a little bit of pain as a result of the currency devaluation
and the tumbling of share values. They are too rich, owning
Mercedes, some having their own airplanes ... Let me feel slightly
the sufferings that have fallen on the poor, perhaps this will make
them remorseful.
	   ``Undoubtedly there is corruption, lack of transparency and
other things in governments of Southeast Asia. Even advanced
countries of the West are not free from this phenomenon.
	   ``Why is it that countries which are clearly corrupt and
non-transparent do not face currency devaluation as bad as
countries in Southeast Asia?
	   ``Due to accusations of cronyism, the government is not able to
assist anyone especially during this economic downturn. Any
assistance rendered will be termed as a bailout.

Few kids plus lots of retirees add up to aging problems for Italy 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo ROM108-109
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy likes to boast of its antiquities. Now, it has
something else remarkably old _ its population.
	   Fast-rising life expectancy and the world's lowest birthrate are
combining to make Italy ``the oldest country in the world,'' as
demographers put it.
	   Italy has the world's highest percentage of people over 60 _ 23
percent _ and the lowest percentage of those under 15, at 14
percent.
	   If the trend continues, which demographers say is likely, the
numbers could add up within a generation to serious problems: a
lack of money to pay pensions and a shortage of workers to keep
Italy competitive globally.
	   And then there's the dimension that can't be put on a
spreadsheet.
	   A generation ago, when Caterina De Santis was raising her
family, the laughter and chatter of children on balconies of the
eight apartments across her courtyard kept her company.
	   ``Now there's just one child in the entire building,'' said De
Santis, 69. She spoke between hands in a card game under a grape
arbor at a seniors' center in the working-class neighborhood of
Testaccio.
	   After she retired from her ice cream parlor in 1985, De Santis,
who won't let her cane stop her from dancing, turned to the daily
company of the other retirees to keep her spirits from sagging.
	   ``For me it's sad that there's so few children. Kids are
happiness. Kids are joy,'' she said. ``Thirty years ago, the
elderly were less alone.'' Not that life is so bad for most elderly
Italians, De Santis and her fellow card-players agreed.
	   Their free, city-run center stays open until everyone goes home
for dinner. It has a dentist's office where care is free. There's a
barber for the men, a podiatrist who stops by, ceramics lessons and
a billiard room.
	   But the ladies playing cards worried that retirement might not
be so good for their grandchildren. How to pay their pensions looms
largest.
	   ``In 2030, Italy could be the first (country) in the world where
there are more `over 60s' than people of working age, and in Italy
many of those of working age don't work,''' said demographer
Antonio Golini of Rome's Sapienza University, referring to chronic
unemployment. ``That's crazy.''
	   More elderly means more pensions to pay. Fewer workers means
less revenue to pay them.
	   Part of the reason is that Italian women of childbearing age
have an average of 1.19 children, one of the lowest averages in the
world. The consequences of Italy's shrinking baby population became
more worrisome with the news that the ``dolce vita'' is getting
longer.
	   The U.N. World Health Organization reported in May that people
born in 2025 can expect to live the longest, 82 years, if they
reside in Italy, Iceland, Japan or Sweden.
	   The pension burden is acute in a system that lets some state
employees retire as young as 40 after 20 years on the job. Many
Italians howled when the government in 1995 raised the general
retirement age to 62 for men and 60 for women to battle huge budget
deficits.
	   Many of the reasons for the shrinking Italian family are well
known: jobs and affordable housing are tough to find, and tax
writeoffs for dependants are paltry.
	   ``I was married when I was 20, had my first child at 21, the
next at 22,'' said Margherita Napolitano, an 82-year-old
grandmother. ``Now, a man at 30 doesn't even have a first job. They
should give us houses, jobs. Then Italians will have more
children.''

Trading in Long Term Credit Bank suspended after downgrade detail, background, byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to show suspension of trading of LTCB, NCB; ADDS
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Friday after a
downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked frantic selling.
	   The exchange also halted trading of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
following a news report the government is considering a bailout
that would merge it with struggling LCTB.
	   Shares of LTCB went into a nose dive after the downgrade,
dropping below the psychologically important 100-yen (73 U.S.
cents) line for the first time since its stock was listed.
	   The downgrade and subsequent plunge in stock prices were eerily
similar to events that preceded the November collapse of Yamaichi
Securities Co., the largest business failure in Japanese history.
	   LTCB's tribulations strike as Japan is trying to convince the
world it is serious about cleaning up its financial system, even if
that means letting weaker companies fold.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers arrived in Tokyo
on Thursday for talks with Japanese leaders about their efforts to
clean up an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad
loans.
	   LTCB announced problem loans worth 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in March. Most of those were made to property buyers
during the land price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   An LTCB spokesman called the move unfortunate and said he
couldn't understand what prompted Moody's downgrade. He said the
bank would try to convince the U.S.-based agency to reverse its
rating.
	   Moody's on Thursday lowered LTCB's subordinate debt rating to B1
from Ba1. Share prices dropped as much as 25 percent to 94 yen
before the Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading at 112 yen, down 14
yen.
	   The share price of LTCB, Japan's second largest credit bank,
peaked in April 1987 at 2,820 yen.
	   A downgrade can be a death blow to a credit bank like LTCB,
which must raise funds on debt markets instead of from customer
deposits, like regular commercial banks.
	   Credit banks played a key role in rebuilding Japan's economy
after World War Two by supplying industry with cheap, long-term
credit. But as deregulation has allowed more companies to raise
money directly from financial markets, the banks have had
difficulty finding a new role.
	   LTCB's shares have lost about 40 percent of their value this
week alone on rumors that the bank was struggling to stay afloat.
	   A rapid erosion in a company's share price to below the 100-yen
level is often seen as a sign of imminent collapse.
	   The exchange also suspended trading of Nippon Credit Bank after
an unsourced article by Kyodo News said the government may engineer
a merger with LTCB.
	   Both LTCB and the Ministry of Finance said a merger was
impossible.
	   In the past, Japan has dealt with bankruptcies by forcing the
struggling company to merge with a rival. But Japan is now under
pressure both at home and abroad to give freer rein to market
forces and let competition weed out weaker institutions.
	   Nippon Credit Bank's shares were up 10 yen at 135 yen.

Russian economic officials prepare for IMF talks 
</HEADLINE>
By JUDITH INGRAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's newly appointed liaison to international
financial organizations has tried to play down the decision by the
International Monetary Fund to delay a dlrs 670 million loan to
Russia.
	   Anatoly Chubais told the NTV television channel late Thursday
that Russian officials have been preparing for ``big talks'' with
the IMF on a ``big credit.'' Earlier in the day, he had said dlrs
10 billion to 15 billion would be necessary to stabilize Russia's
battered economy.
	   Chubais said that the visit by an IMF delegation next week would
give the government an opportunity to ``resolve those issues that
have arisen in connection with this installment of the existing
credit.''
	   Chubais will meet the acting chairman of the International
Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Monday.
	   In Washington, an IMF spokesman said the latest installment from
the fund's dlrs 9.2 billion, three-year support loan to Russia was
being delayed until next week to ``allow the Russian authorities
time to complete implementing the actions necessary'' to secure the
payment.
	   According to Western bankers, the IMF has been playing tough
with Russia in part because it wants to be sure that the government
is sufficiently motivated to carry out promises to overhaul
taxation and slash spending. The government's past promises have
often evaporated.
	   The IMF wants assurances from Moscow that broad tax code
revisions will become law, stalled land-reform and budget laws will
be passed, and various taxes will be increased.
	   Russia took a number of measures Thursday to address the crisis.
The country sold dlrs 2.5 billion in a 30-year Eurobond aimed at
restructuring its short-term debt. Boris Fyodorov, the country's
new tax chief, said he had reached agreements with 13 to 15 oil
companies to pay back taxes.
	   And Premier Sergei Kiriyenko held a late-night meeting with
Russia's most powerful businessmen, the so-called oligarchs, to
gather their support and ideas on resolving the crisis.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two days after dramatically stepping into world
currency markets, Japan and the United States remain ready to
intervene again to boost the sagging yen, the Finance Ministry
said.
	   Visiting Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga welcomed the effects of
Wednesday's joint action to halt the yen's free fall and vowed to
take similar steps again if necessary, the ministry said.
	   ``The minister and I had very good talks'' Summers told
reporters after a 40-minute meeting on Japan's strategy for
reviving its moribund economy.
	   Summers also urged Japan to move quickly to solve its bad loan
problem and restore health to its financial system, the ministry
said.
	   However, Summers did not ask Japan specifically to cut taxes to
boost the economy as had been rumored, it said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and implement a permanent income tax cut
to get the recession-plagued economy back on track.
	   Hashimoto made the decision after his telephone conversation
Wednesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton and he will announce the
tax relief before elections for the upper house of Parliament on
July 12, the Mainichi newspaper reported.
	   In talks earlier in the day, Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami
told Summers that disposing of soured loans is vital to sparking an
economic recovery, the central bank said in a statement.
	   Rampant lending during Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy of
the late 1980s have saddled banks with about 76 trillion yen (dlrs
563 billion) in bad loans.
	   Summers expressed understanding of Japan's position on the bad
debt issue, the BOJ said.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo after the yen plummeted this week to an eight-year low
against the U.S. dollar, raising fears of another bout of currency
devaluations around Asia.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar dipped slightly in Friday afternoon trading to 136.84
yen, down 0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo.
	   In a meeting earlier with Deputy Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro
Nukaga, Summers urged Japan to implement steps to jumpstart its
economy and dispose of bad debts before next month's elections, the
Nikkei news service reported.
	   Friday's series of high-level meetings began with discussions
between Summers and Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. The two
applauded the success of the joint intervention to stop the yen's
slide.
	   ``The United States and Japan share a very strong interest in a
return to sustained growth in the Asian continent,'' Summers told
reporters after the meeting.
	   In a meeting late Thursday, Summers and Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, stressed the
need for close cooperation to stabilize both the yen and regional
currencies, the Nihon Keizai economic daily reported Friday.
	   Summers and Sakakibara also agreed that structural reform in
Japan's financial sector was essential to restoring calm to the
currency market, the newspaper said.
	   Shortly before Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a nationally televised press
conference that Japan's economy would recover after the government
implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   Japan will also host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation. Summers will attend that meeting as well.

Study: Teaching safe sex pays off in preventing AIDS, other diseases AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The spread of AIDS could be reduced
significantly by providing training in safe sex practices to inner
city residents who are most at risk of contracting the disease,
according to a study published Friday.
	   The study, involving 3,705 men and women recruited from
community clinics in five states, showed that special safe sex
training courses can persuade up to half of those attending the
classes to start using condoms and to avoid unprotected sex,
researchers said Thursday.
	   Experts said the seven safe sex training sessions used in the
study cost about dlrs 278 per pupil, but could save thousands of
health care dollars by limiting the spread of HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
	   Treating HIV with an anti-viral drugs now costs about dlrs
12,000 a year per patient, researchers say.
	   The research project is the largest controlled U.S. study
designed to precisely measure the effectiveness of modifying sexual
behavior among men and women attending public health are clinics.
The study, published Friday in the journal Science, was supported
by a National Institutes of Health agency.
	   Ann O'Leary, a Rutgers University psychologist and one of seven
primary authors of the study, said the research convincingly
demonstrates that sex education and training in small groups may be
the best way to change sexual behavior of inner city residents who
are most at risk of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
	   ``Behavior science and prevention are becoming increasingly
respected and employed in medicine,'' she said. ``With HIV, it is
all we have in terms of prevention. It's clear we will not have a
vaccine for years.''
	   The participants, all adults, were selected based on answers
they gave on a questionnaire which they filled out while patients
at metropolitan clinics. Eligibility requirements included engaging
in unprotected sex during the previous 90 days, plus one of the
following requirements: sex with multiple and new partners;
infection with a sexually transmitted disease; sex with a partner
known to have multiple partners; sex with an injection drug user;
or sex with an HIV patient.
	   O'Leary said people meeting these characteristics are among the
most likely to contract HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.
	   In total, 1,855 men and women were assigned to a control group,
while 1851 were assigned to a special training group. More than
2,500 of the recruits were black, while 751 were Hispanic, and the
rest were of other ethnic origins, mostly European.
	   People in the control group attended a safe sex video
presentation that included a question and answer session.
	   In the study group, the men and women were broken into small
groups with an instructor who talked and guided group discussion
about safe sex measures during seven 1 1/2 to 2-hour sessions. The
instructions included the proper method of using a condom, with
genital models used as visual aids. The discussions included such
issues as self-control, partner selection and the effect of alcohol
and other substances on sexual behavior.
	   People in the control group received food, gifts and dlrs 10 to
dlrs 15 per session, said O'Leary.
	   O'Leary said that condom use increased from zero to 27 percent
for the control group, and from zero to 42 percent in the study
group. At some clinics, half of the study group members reported
consistent use of condoms, she said.

Intelligence service calls export of timber a security threat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The timber trade in Russia's Far East is a threat
to the region's economic security and the environment, a news
agency said Friday, citing an official from the Federal Security
Service.
	   In a message to the legislature of the Primorye territory in
Russia's Far East, the chief of the regional branch of the security
service, Col.-Gen. Viktor Kondratov, said that the amount of timber
produced in the area is much larger than official figures reflect,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He also said that timber companies' subsidiaries were getting
rich by evading taxes and smuggling capital abroad, ITAR-Tass said,
citing Kondratov.
	   Regional security service investigations have revealed that
Russia's national interests have been compromised because foreign
trade partners in timber do not comply with barter contracts,
Kondratov said. He called on the regional legislature to prohibit
further barter exports of the resource.

Car thefts soar in Singapore, police urge caution 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Car thefts have increased 50 percent over the
last year as Singaporeans, used to feeling safe in a low-crime
society, are being urged by police to be more wary and careful.
	   The local habit of leaving cars unlocked, and even with the keys
inside, has to stop, police spokesman Ng Guat Heng said.
	   From January through May this year, 1,234 vehicles were stolen
in Singapore, a 50 percent increase over the same period in 1997.
	   Last year's total of 2,242 cars stolen was an 18-year low. But
police say the driver negligence _ perhaps from complacency _ has
contributed to a sudden rise in thefts.
	   The Straits Times reported Friday the case of Toh Bok Kuan, 27,
who checked into the Geylang Hotel on Tuesday evening, handing the
keys of his red Daihatsu to a man who appeared to be the valet. The
next morning, when Toh left, his car was nowhere to be found. When
he asked hotel staff where the valet was, they told him none was
employed there.
	   Other cases reported in a 24-hour period this week included a
Honda Accord missing from an apartment block carpark when the owner
apparently left his keys inside overnight, and a Malaysian man who
found his Rover missing from a multi-story shopping center carpark,
where he had left it unattended for six days.

Two killed in bomb explosion east of Beirut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a car in a
neighborhood east of the capital Beirut Friday, killing the driver
and another person, police officials said.
	   George Dib, who was driving the Renault car, and Tony Bou Nakhle
were killed instantly in the blast, which went off shortly after
midnight Thursday, said the officials, who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The motive behind the bombing in Dora, just east of the capital
Beirut, was not immediately clear.
	   Police said the bomb, apparently placed under the driver's seat,
weighed three kilograms (6.6 pounds) and went off as Dib was
driving the car. The blast turned the car into a mangled wreck and
caused minor damage to nearby buildings.
	   Although bombings were common during the 1975-90 civil war when
militias ruled the streets, they have become rare in Beirut since
the end of the conflict and the government's reassertion of its
authority.

Chinese dissidents urge Clinton to push for freedoms during visit 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese dissidents appealed Friday to President
Clinton to push for greater freedoms and meet a veteran democracy
campaigner during his visit to China next week.
	   A group of 57 dissidents, in a fax to foreign news agencies,
urged Clinton to meet their Beijing-based representative, Xu Wenli,
after a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   If Clinton does not meet Xu, his visit will serve only to give
the Chinese government a diplomatic coup and do nothing to promote
democracy, said the letter signed by dissidents from 14 cities and
provinces.
	   The government is unlikely to let Xu meet Clinton during his
carefully scripted June 25-July 3 visit.
	   Xu was imprisoned from 1981 to 1993, mostly in solitary
confinement, for campaigning for democracy during the late 1970s.
He recently has reported police harassment for trying to set up a
human rights monitoring group.
	   In a separate appeal, dissident Xu Wanping wrote to Clinton
urging him to press President Jiang to reassess the Tiananmen
Square democracy protests in 1989 that the government violently
crushed and labeled as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' a Hong
Kong-based rights group said.
	   Xu, a worker in the southwestern industrial city of Chongqing
imprisoned for eight years for participating in the movement, also
called for the release of those jailed after the protests, an end
to suppression of public dissent, and enforcement of constitutional
guarantees of free speech and other civil liberties, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   The center also said Liu Lianjun, a dissident from eastern
Shandong province, was filing charges against Beijing police
alleging that he was beaten and tortured during a six-day illegal
detention that began May 29.
	   Liu said police took him to a deserted area in the city's
outskirts and threatened to kill and bury him if he did not
cooperate. A police spokesman was not immediately available to
comment.
	   Meanwhile, a U.S. based group of rights activists and scholars
urged Clinton to speak out ``forcefully'' in support of academic
and political freedoms, particularly during a planned speech at
prestigious Beijing University.
	   ``If you are silent, you will send a message of tacit
endorsement for the Chinese authorities' repressive policies,''
said an open letter signed on behalf of the New York-based Human
Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee by prominent Chinese
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and Jonathan Fanton, president of the New
School for Social Research.
	   It was among students at Beijing University and neighboring
schools that the 1989 protests gained momentum, eventually bringing
millions of residents into the streets in demonstrations centered
on Tiananmen Square.
	   The protests ended six weeks later on June 4, 1989, when troops
shot their way through the city, killing hundreds, perhaps
thousands. Thousands more were arrested.
	   Fang, who now teaches at the University of Arizona, was then one
of China's leading democratic campaigners. After the protests, he
and his wife spent 13 months in hiding in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing before fleeing into exile.

Philippine stocks, peso fall on yen uncertainty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Friday, losing much of their advances in the previous session as
investors cashed in on gains amid uncertainties over the
sustainability of the Japanese yen's recovery, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, sank against the dollar as the yen weakened
just two days after U.S.-Japan intervention to support it, traders
said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost 86.88 points,
or 4.8 percent, closing at 1,741.71. On Thursday it had risen 6.6
percent, its heftiest gain in four months, after the United States
and Japan sold dollars to halt the yen's recent decline.
	   The move managed to lift the yen from its eight-year low against
the dollar. But it remains to be seen how long the yen can hold its
position against the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   ``The bubble burst when the selloffs started. Most of the
movements came at the opening of Friday's session,'' Edwin Siao, a
trader for Abacus Securities Corp., said of Friday's stock market
decline.
	   The top gainers in the previous session were among the biggest
losers Friday. Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
fell 2.7 percent, while real estate concern Ayala Land Inc. plunged
10 percent.
	   Traders said Thursday's rally may have been overdone since the
U.S.-Japan intervention to prop up the yen was a stopgap measure
meant to provide temporary reprieve.
	   ``The intervention doesn't change the overall fundamental
picture. All it does is stop the speculation, but fundamental
problems remain,'' said Siao.
	   With Japan facing an economic recession, Siao said other Asian
economies will have to brace for further weakness.
	   He said the outcome of the visit by U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers to Japan will be critical in dictating
Asian stock market direction in coming sessions.
	   Full U.S. support for Japan's proposed economic reforms will be
greeted positively by Asian markets, traders said. However, if the
U.S. raises doubts about some of the reforms, renewed regional
weakness may develop.
	   ``We hope the Summers visit will result in something positive.
That can spark an uptick,'' said Siao.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 40.955 pesos in morning
trading compared to 40.425 pesos on Thursday.
	   Traders said the peso is expected to continue to follow the
direction of regional trading until a firmer solution to prevent
the yen from weakening further is implemented.

Hamas leader to travel to Egypt Monday, spokesman says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will allow Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, to travel to Cairo on Monday on his way
to the Gaza Strip, a Hamas official said Friday.
	   Yassin, his son and an aide have waited more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, after Egypt denied them entry
visas. Egypt was reportedly waiting until Israel officially
announced that they would let the Hamas leader return to Gaza.
	   It was not clear what prompted Egypt to relent even though
Israel has not made public any formal decision.
	   The Egyptian Embassy in Khartoum informed Yassin on Thursday
that the government had granted him and his aide permission to
travel to Egypt and that they could depart any time, said Jamal
Issa, the Hamas representative in Sudan.
	   ``The sheik decided to leave Khartoum to Cairo on Monday and he
prays to God that everything will go smoothly,'' Issa told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Khartoum.
	   Yassin must enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt fears that if Yassin gets stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas' popularity
in the Palestinian territories, especially in the strip, is seen as
a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin went to Sudan on May 29 after a 14-week fund-raising tour
of the Arab world and Iran. During his trip he repeatedly issued
statements supporting armed struggle against Israel.

Mutilated bodies found in abandoned car 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Policemen discovered the mutilated
bodies of two men Friday in an abandoned car in the ethnically
divided port city of Karachi, police officials said.
	   Police and paramilitary troops have stepped up security
throughout the congested city of 14 million after four days of
violence that has resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen
people.
	   The bodies have not been identified, but police say it's likely
that their deaths were linked to bitter fighting between rival
factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement.
	   The bodies were found in central Nazimabad a stronghold of the
largest Altaf Hussein faction, named for its exiled leader.
	   Late Thursday an activist with the rival Haqiqi faction was
gunned down outside his home.
	   The killings follow two bombings Thursday that injured 10 people
and prompted stepped up security outside all government and public
buildings, government officials said. In separate incidents two
people also were gunned down on Thursday and three policemen were
injured when their vehicle was fired upon.
	   The Mohajir Qami Movement represents Indian Muslims who settled
in Pakistan when the British left the subcontinent in 1947 and
created Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of the region.
	   In recent years Karachi has been wracked by violence, much of it
between the rival groups.
	   Police has arrested dozens of militants from both factions, but
has been unsuccessful in stopping the carnage.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will let Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, travel Monday to Cairo on his way to the
Gaza Strip, a Hamas official said Friday.
	   Yassin, his son and an aide have waited more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, after Egypt denied them entry
visas. Egypt was reportedly waiting until Israel officially
announced that they would let the Hamas leader return to Gaza.
	   It was not clear what prompted Egypt's change since Israel has
not announced any decision.
	   The Egyptian Embassy in Khartoum informed Yassin on Thursday
that the government had granted him and his aide permission to
travel to Egypt and that they could depart any time, said Jamal
Issa, the Hamas representative in Sudan.
	   ``The Sheik decided to leave Khartoum to Cairo on Monday and he
prays to God that everything will go smoothly,'' Issa told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Khartoum.
	   Yassin must enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt fears that if Yassin gets stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas' popularity
in the Palestinian territories, especially in the strip, is seen as
a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin went to Sudan on May 29 after a 14-week fund-raising tour
of the Arab world and Iran. During his trip he repeatedly issued
statements supporting armed struggle against Israel.

Nicklaus saves some magic for 18th hole AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus' approach shot landed just
beyond the flag on the 18th hole and rolled back, finally coming to
a stop 4 feet (1.2 meters) from the cup. Nicklaus raised his arms
in celebration and the crowd roared.
	   Not bad for a guy who nearly had to skip the U.S. Open because
of a pulled groin. Not bad for a 58-year-old golfer who needed a
special exemption to play in the Open.
	   The birdie on the final hole was the highlight of Nicklaus'
first round Thursday at the Open. He shot a 3-over 73 that included
consecutive bogeys on the 12th, 13th and 14th holes, but showed a
little of his old magic on the 18th.
	   Nicklaus, who has won the Open four times, said the closing
birdie will give him a boost heading into Friday's second round.
	   ``It's just a little bit more than one stroke, because mentally
it's a good way to come back tomorrow,'' said Nicklaus, who was
considering withdrawing from the tournament as recently as last
weekend because of the groin injury.
	   Nicklaus said he was rushing on his swing early in the round,
but corrected that after his caddy _ son Michael _ pointed out his
swing was out of sync. And he struggled with his 3-wood, hitting
three bad tee shots with that club.
	   But Nicklaus said he was satisfied overall with his round and
refused to join the chorus of criticism from players who complained
the course was too challenging.
	   ``I love to play where it's difficult and bouncy and it tests
your patience,'' Nicklaus said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STEALING A STROKE: A ball thief may have cost Paul Simson, an
amateur playing in his first U.S. Open, a one-stroke penalty in the
first round.
	   Simson, vice president of an insurance agency from Raleigh,
N.C., was at 2-under after the front nine when he hit his tee shot
on the 10th hole through a tree left of the fairway Thursday.
	   Two spectators told USGA official Ron Reed they saw the ball
bounce off the tree and land on the ground between the ninth and
10th holes, where a fan appeared to pick up the ball.
	   Simson, his caddie and several spectators searched for the ball,
even climbing into the tree to look for it. After having no luck,
Simson went back to the tee and played another ball, taking a
one-shot penalty and eventually shooting a triple-bogey 7 on the
hole.
	   Reed said Simson perhaps should have been allowed a free drop in
the vicinity of where the spectators saw the ball land, since the
Rules of Golf provide for such a ruling in cases where a ball is
moved or stolen.
	   But since Simson had returned to the tee and played another
ball, the possibility of a free drop was wiped out. He finished at
6-over 76 for the round.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EARLY WITHDRAWALS: Dudley Hart lasted just one round before
being knocked out of the U.S. Open with a wrist injury. Tommy
Tolles didn't even make it that far.
	   Hart, who hurt the wrist in June 1995 when his iron struck a
tree root, shot an 8-over 78 Thursday and then withdrew from the
tournament.
	   Tolles pulled out following his second shot on the sixth hole
because of a pulled back muscle. Tolles had injured his back
earlier this week, but hoped it would heal enough for him to play
in the Open.
	   ``If it had been any other tournament, I wouldn't have teed it
up,'' said Tolles, who tied for fifth at the 1997 U.S. Open. ``I
couldn't take a practice swing without pain.''
	   Neither player will be replaced.

Stars make Israel radio announcer a star with the Arabs BY SALAH NASRAWI 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS graf 12 to INSERT Hazboun's religion.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Even as Arabs and Israelis trade insults,
and sometimes gunshots, listeners around the Arab world are tuning
in to an Israel radio program. Maybe it's in the stars.
	   Ibrahim Hazboun's horoscope show opens every Friday with a theme
of smooth jazz just after a nightly news report on the Voice of
Israel's Arabic service that rarely brings listeners good news
about prospects for peace.
	   After reading a weekly forecast according to the 12 signs of the
zodiac, Hazboun takes international telephone calls in the
station's studios in Jerusalem.
	   ``I am a Cancer ... any chance that I will get married to
someone who lives abroad, because I dream of living somewhere
else'' comes the soft voice of a young Egyptian woman who
identifies herself only as Dalal.
	   ``No,'' Hazboun answers sympathetically after a little
pondering. ``Your star says you are a domestic person; you cannot
live away from your family.'' Hazboun's advise: stick to Egypt.
	   For about an hour, Hazboun advises a stream of callers hoping to
fathom what the stars have in store.
	   The large following of his ``World of Stars'' program is a small
sign that the suspicion and even hatred that Arabs and Israelis
have felt for each other for decades doesn't affect every issue.
	   ``I, myself, have no political agenda but I think such ways of
contacts improve understanding between Arabs and the Israelis,''
Hazboun, a 50-year-old Israeli Arab, said in a telephone interview.
	   Along with his staying away from politics, one reason the
program succeeds is the absence of competition. Arab radio stations
do not air horoscope programs because Islam bans fortune telling
and astrology.
	   Most of Hazboun's callers are from Jordan and Egypt, the only
Arab nations with diplomatic ties and direct telephone links to
Israel.
	   But Hazboun, a Greek Orthodox Christian, says listeners from
other countries, such as Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, travel to Jordan
to make calls, in some cases risking the death penalty on charges
of contacting an enemy state. Others write to him at a post office
box in Switzerland.
 &UR; Hazboun, a long-time broadcaster, pick up 12th graf pvs.

Dollar slips, stocks finish lower prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Friday
ahead of the weekend meeting in Tokyo of world finance officials.
Japanese stocks finished the day's trading lower.
	   The dollar bought 136.84 yen in mid-afternoon, down 0.04 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 137.83 yen
in late New York trading overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 93.56 points, or 0.61 percent, closing the week at 15,267.98
points. On Thursday, the average surged 646.16 points, or 4.39
percent.
	   The dollar moved in a narrow range in Tokyo as players refrained
from making significant moves prior to Saturday's meeting of deputy
finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations, traders said.
	   Finance officials from other Asian nations will also attend the
Tokyo meeting to discuss ways of stabilizing local currencies and
economies in the region.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met with Bank of
Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami Friday morning, and Hayami told him that
writing off the pile of bad debts held by Japanese banks is vital
to revitalizing Japan's sagging economy.
	   Summers expressed his understanding of Japan's position on the
bad debt issue. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to speed
up efforts to resolve the bad loan issues.
	   The weekend meeting was called earlier this week to find ways to
end the yen's recent slide against the dollar that has threatened
to rekindle new rounds of currency devaluation in already battered
Asian economies.
	   Japanese newspapers reported Friday that Hashimoto may propose
new tax cuts at the meeting as well as measures to accelerate the
write-off of some 76 trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad loans
held by his nation's banks.
	   Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday evening, and held talks
with Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for
international affairs. The two officials agreed to work together to
raise the yen's value, the Nihon Keizai financial daily reported.
U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened late Wednesday to stop
the yen's fall.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark index slipped amid renewed
fears over the health of Japan's financial system and on profit
taking after posting its biggest point gain since Jan. 16 on
Thursday.
	   Until that rise, the Nikkei had fallen in tandem with the yen,
hurt by the same pessimism about Japan's economy that plagued the
Japanese currency.
	   But with the yen's rebound at least momentarily stalled,
investors had no fresh reason to buy Tokyo stocks, analysts said.
	   ``The yen's climb has stopped, and there is no further incentive
to push the market sharply higher,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager of the equities operation group at Nikko Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 11.57 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,187.27.
It leaped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.275 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.285 percent, driving its price up to 111.43 yen from 111.36 yen.

Five wounded in attack on Russian-Georgian border 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five people were wounded in a rifle and grenade
attack on cars and trucks waiting to cross the Russian-Georgian
border, a police chief in the region said Friday.
	   Up to 70 cars and trucks were lined up and waiting for customs
clearance on the Georgian side of the Verkhni Lars checkpoint on
Thursday night when the attack occurred, said Otar Sudzhashvili,
the police chief of the Kazbek region in the Russian republic of
Northern Ossetia.
	   He said that unknown attackers had fired assault rifles and
grenade-launchers from the neighboring Russian republic of
Ingushetia. The attackers struck in two groups, firing at the head
and the end of the line of vehicles.
	   Border guards allowed the vehicles to enter Russia, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Four Georgian drivers and one Russian from North Ossetia were
wounded, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. They were brought to a
hospital in the North Ossetian capital Vladikavkaz.
	   Russian border guards and North Ossetian police, backed by three
helicopter gunships, fought the attackers for about 3 1/2 hours. Up
to a dozen assailants were involved, ITAR-Tass said, citing
officials in Vladikavkaz.
	   Many alcohol smugglers cross into Russia's Caucasus region from
Georgia. ITAR-Tass said that there has been ``a permanent
standoff'' on the border between border guards and smugglers.

Asian stocks fall on profit-taking, pessimism over Japan's economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks and currencies fell early Friday
on profit-taking and skepticism over whether the Japanese yen's
gains on the U.S. dollar the day before could be sustained.
	   Investors were also keeping a nervous eye on U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' meetings Friday with Japanese
officials for clues to whether Japan will dole out tougher reforms
to heal its ailing economy.
	   ``It's going to be choppy,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant
vice president of financial markets at the Tokyo branch of Bank of
America. ``The dollar's under pressure, and there are a lot of
rumors.''
	   The United States and Japan intervened heavily in the currency
market on Wednesday, selling dollars in an effort to stop the slide
of the yen against the U.S. currency.
	   But the momentum of Thursday's surge in the yen stalled early
Friday. The dollar bought 136.84 yen in mid-afternoon, down 0.04
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 137.83
yen in late New York trading overnight.
	   Although Asian stock markets posted strong gains of between 2.3
percent to 8.1 percent Thursday on the firmer yen, bourses in
Europe and on Wall Street recorded moderate losses as investors
remained skeptical.
	   ``The signs are that the Asian crisis is slowly coming under
control, and the initial fears have diminished,'' said Guenter
Burgold, a dealer at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ``But intervention in
the past has always proven to be grasping at straws. The skepticism
remains.''
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 93.56 points, or 0.61 percent, closing the week at 15,267.98
points. On Thursday, the average surged 646.16 points, or 4.39
percent.
	   In South Korea, the key index fell 3.8 percent to close at
313.26 points, after surging 16 percent on the strong yen during
the past two session.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index moved in negative
territory all morning and ended the morning session at 8,385.26,
down 130.71 points, or 1.5 percent, after Thursday's 6.39-percent
surge.
	   In Thailand, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index plunged 6.1
percent at 277.18 at midday, after rallying 8.13 percent Thursday.
Indonesia's JSX composite index lost 2.5 percent to 428.707 points
in late morning after Thursday's 4.92-percent gain.
	   In the Philippines, the Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed
down 4.8 percent at 1,741.71, erasing much of Thursday's 6.6
percent gain.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index also
dropped 2.2 percent to 1,108.67 points at midday, and Malaysia's
key Composite Index fell 2.1 percent to 461.73 points.
	   Most Asian currencies also were lower against the greenback,
with dealers expecting the U.S. currency to remain confined within
narrow ranges as the market looks ahead to developments over the
weekend in Japan.
	   At midday, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.6730 against
Singapore's dollar, up from 1.6591 late Thursday.
	   Against the Malaysian ringgit, the dollar was quoted at a
midrate of 3.9830, up from 3.9550 late Thursday.
	   Indonesia's rupiah was trading at 15,200 for the dollar in early
trading, down from 14,800 late Thursday.
	   Against the Thai baht, the dollar was at 41.83, up from THB41.25
at the close of trading Thursday.
	   Among other stock markets, Taiwan's Weighted Price Index closed
down 0.17 percent to 7,754.43 led by a fall in the heavily-weighted
financial shares.
	   New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index finished near its lows with
weakness in market bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand helping
drag the index down. The index fell 2.8 percent to 1,975.20.
	   Australia's All Ordinaries Share Index fell 0.7 percent to close
at 2,588.8.

Malaysia to rely on government spending for revival 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will rely on government
spending to revive its economy, and the World Bank is aiding with a
new injection of money, a senior finance official said Friday.
	   A proposed 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion) increase in the
country's budget will come from the government reserves and the
World Bank, said Deputy Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar.
	   The increased spending was announced by Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday. It amounts to a 13 percent hike in the
budget and could reverse to an extent an 18 percent cut made in
December.
	   The World Bank on Thursday approved a dlrs 300 million loan for
Malaysia. The Southeast Asian nation may seek another dlrs 700
million later this year.
	   The announcement of increased government spending _ aimed at
kick starting an economy that shrank by 1.8 percent in the first
three months of 1998 _ was criticized by the opposition Friday.
	   The effort will be futile unless the government launches a war
on corruption and bad business practices, said Lim Kit Siang,
opposition leader in Parliament and head of the Democratic Action
Party.

Report: VW to relocate Polo Production to Spain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's largest automaker,
Volkswagen, plans to move production of its Polo compact car to
Spain from Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily
reported Friday.
	   A VW spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
	   The move would free capacity at VW's Wolfsburg plant to produce
its new compact car, the Lupo, the newspaper said. The plans to
shift production to VW's Pamplona plant include an increase in Polo
output from 1,300 to 1,500 cars a day.
	   A VW spokesman quoted by the German daily put the investment at
about 300 million marks (dlrs 167 million.)

Ammunition depot fires extinguished 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An ammunition dump fire that killed at least 12
people in central Russia was extinguished on Friday after blazing
for three days, a news agency reported.
	   The compound in Losiny in the Sverdlovsk region of the Urals
Mountains is still smoldering, an official from the regional
Ministry of Emergency Situations said, according to the Interfax
news agency. But there is no further danger at the site, he said.
	   The fire broke out Wednesday when the military compound was
struck by lightning. By Thursday morning, munitions explosions set
off by the blaze had almost completely destroyed the compound,
Interfax said.
	   The fire also consumed more than 200 hectares (494 acres) of
forest surrounding the compound.
	   Firefighting efforts were slowed by the periodic munitions
explosions, but servicemen brought the blaze under control with the
help of an Il-76 plane from the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
The plane made six flights over the compound, pouring 240 tons of
water on the embers.
	   Most of the more than 1,000 residents of nearby villages who
were evacuated on Wednesday had returned to their homes by Friday.
Power and water, which had been cut because of the fires, have also
been restored to the region.
	   Initial reports said that 14 people were killed fighting the
blaze, but later estimates lowered the number to 12. Seventeen
people were injured and one is still missing, Interfax said.
	   Blazes at ammunition depots, which are often located in thick
forests, break out frequently in Russia.

Party figures urge Howard to oppose ultraconservatives 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Australia-Queensland-Election
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
Associated press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Senior figures in Australia's ruling
conservative coalition Friday urged Prime Minister John Howard to
support the rival Labor Party over the ultraconservative One Nation
party in coming elections.
	   A former prime minister and a top government figure said Howard
should make sure candidates for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
be listed last on his Liberal party's how-to-vote cards in the
federal election, expected within months.
	   The cards indicate how people should distribute their voting
preferences. If One Nation is listed above Labor, the Liberals are
effectively endorsing One Nation's candidates over Labor's.
	   Howard has refused to say outright that One Nation will be
placed last, prompting criticism he is considering giving de facto
support to Hanson in an attempt to placate voters and members of
the Liberal-National coalition who support her views.
	   One Nation sent shockwaves through Australian politics by
winning around 23 percent of the vote in a June 13 Queensland state
election, much of it taken from the coalition parties. Recent
opinion polls have placed the party's support nationally in low
double figures.
	   Hanson has been criticized as racist for claiming Australia is
in danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposing immigration.
Her party was linked this week to the anti-Semitic League of Rights
organization. She also opposes special welfare benefits for
Aborigines and advocates protectionist economics.
	   Defying a ban on government legislators speaking out on the
issue, Liberal parliamentary secretary Tony Abbott on Friday said
One Nation could ``destroy the government'' unless Howard took
decisive action.
	   ``Equivocating over Hanson, whatever the reason, alienates far
more voters in the center than it reconciles on the right,'' Abbott
wrote in The Australian newspaper. ``The first step to halt the
Hanson contagion is to put One Nation last on Liberal
how-to-vote.''
	   Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, whom Howard once served as
treasurer, said One Nation was a racist party and that supporting
Labor is a better option than entrenching One Nation candidates in
parliament.
	   The coalition's decision in Queensland to place Labor after One
Nation was a ``very bad, unethical decision,'' Fraser said.
	   ``One Nation is a racist party. You should not compromise with
racism. You can't have a little bit of racism,'' Fraser said.
	   Queensland state Liberal leader Joan Sheldon Friday resigned,
citing the poor result for the party at the election.

Yeltsin: Russia doesn't need Western money, only trust 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOSTROMA, Russia (AP) _ Two days after he reappointed a leading
free-market reformer to the government to negotiate aid from the
West, President Boris Yeltsin proclaimed on Friday that Russia
needed only moral support to stabilize its markets.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the reformer Yeltsin reappointed, said Thursday
that Russia needed dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in financial aid
to ease the financial crisis.
	   However, Yeltsin insisted Friday that just a vote of confidence
from the International Monetary Fund would suffice to keep foreign
investors in Russia and save markets from collapsing.
	   ``What we really need is not their money, but their trust,''
Yeltsin said during a visit to the central Russian region of
Kostroma.
	   Russian officials had been offering this view since the
financial crisis began late last month _ until they finally caved
in and acknowledged that more material assistance was in order.
	   ``The situation is very grave, but we are holding out,'' he told
reporters upon arrival in Kostroma. ``Even such a strong country as
Japan has been gripped by a crisis, but we are holding out.''
	   He also praised the new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko for keeping the national currency, the ruble, stable.
	   The markets' fall has prompted fears of a currency devaluation,
which could lead to a sharp rise in prices. Combined with the
government's continuing inability to pay state workers on time,
that could lead to mass protests.
	   Yeltsin said he had decided to visit Kostroma, located about 320
kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Moscow, because it is
experiencing troubles typical of all of central Russia, Yeltsin
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   In keeping with his tradition, Yeltsin ordered a money transfer
to Kostroma as his visit began.
	   Some 14 million rubles (dlrs 2.7 million) to cover pension debts
were transferred to the region on Friday, and 31 million rubles
(dlrs 5.2 million) more were to be allocated within the next few
days to pay wage arrears, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Russia's cash-strapped regions vie for the honor of being
visited by the president, in part because he usually brings money
with him.
	   Pot-holed roads in Kostroma have been newly paved ahead of
Yeltsin's visit _ leading residents to complain that all the
region's money ``has gone into asphalt.''
	   ``We don't have enough money to pay wages and pensions, but
these are temporary difficulties,'' Yeltsin said upon arrival.
	   Yeltsin visited Kostroma's Ipatiyev monastery, where in 1613 the
leaders of Russian aristocracy gathered to elect Mikhail Romanov as
the nation's czar. He was also to visit several enterprises.

Two killed in bomb explosion east of Beirut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb exploded Friday in a car in a
neighborhood east of the capital Beirut, killing the driver and
another person, police officials said.
	   Both men were killed instantly in the blast, which went off
shortly after midnight, said the officials, who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The motive behind the bombing in Dora, just east of the capital
Beirut, was not immediately clear.
	   Police said the bomb, apparently placed under the driver's seat,
weighed three kilograms (6.6 pounds). The blast turned the car into
a mangled wreck and caused minor damage to nearby buildings.
	   Although bombings were common during the 1975-90 civil war when
militias ruled the streets, they have become rare in Beirut since
the end of the conflict and the government's reassertion of its
authority.

Train signal and switch trouble affects 330,000 morning commuters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The main train line circling the heart of Tokyo was
shut down during Friday's morning rush hour because of faulty
equipment, stranding about 330,000 commuters.
	   It was the third time this week that service on the 34.5
kilometer (21.39-mile) Yamanote line has been interrupted by broken
equipment, said Yoshihito Saito of the East Japan Railway Co.
	   The line was shut down for several hours Friday.
	   The first malfunction occurred at JR's Ikebukuro station, where
a railway official discovered that a traffic signal guiding
conductors had flashed the wrong sign.
	   Then at Shinjuku station, officials found that a switch used to
move trains from one track to another wasn't working properly.
	   Saito said 96 scheduled train runs were canceled and 75 others
were delayed until 11:30 a.m., when service returned to normal.
	   On Monday, 165,000 passengers on the Yamanote line were stranded
for about 30 minutes when smoke was found coming from under the
front car of a train at Yurakucho station.
	   On Wednesday, a total of 65,000 passengers had their commutes
interrupted because of a malfunctioning alarm aboard a running
train.
	   Saito ruled out the possibility of sabotage in any of the
incidents.

Duma moves to prepare charges for Yeltsin's impeachment 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament on Friday voted in
favor of a communist-initiated proposal to begin preparing an
impeachment motion against President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The vote signaled the first time that the State Duma has managed
to set up the panel to prepare a formal indictment. Several
attempts since 1994 have collapsed.
	   The Duma voted 331-5 to set up a parliamentary commission, which
would draw up formal charges against Yeltsin that would serve as a
legal foundation for impeachment.
	   However, Russia's Constitution gives the president the upper
hand in confrontations with parliament, which would make it hard,
if not impossible, for Yeltsin's foes to succeed. The Constitution
is very vague on what grounds the president can be removed, citing
only treason and grave misconduct.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hard-line
allies, last month collected the necessary number of lawmakers'
signatures to set up the panel. The move was widely seen as an
attempt by the opposition to reassert themselves after they backed
down in a confrontation with Yeltsin over the appointment of
Premier Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   However, the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction delayed
the commission's creation earlier this month by refusing to take
part in preparing the charges. The Duma's rules of order require
that the commission comprise representatives of all parliamentary
factions.
	   Our Home Is Russia later changed its stance, without explaining
its motives.
	   The Duma is expected to set a time for the commission to present
the charges later Friday.
	   Once the indictment is prepared, a two-thirds majority of the
450 Duma members is needed to launch the impeachment motion.
	   The charges will also have to win confirmation from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts _ which is highly unlikely _
before they go to the upper chamber, the Federation Council. Many
of that chamber's members are loyal to Yeltsin.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of a range
of transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the
country's economy, which they blame for Russia's shrinking
population.

Israeli-backed militiaman, son killed in roadside bomb in south 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb believed detonated by Lebanese
guerrillas killed an Israeli-backed militiaman and his child Friday
in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   The bomb went off on a road just west of the Christian mountain
town of Jezzine as the militiaman of the South Lebanon Army drove
in a civilian vehicle, they said. His son was sitting next to him.
	   The two were identified as Fuad Abi Zeid, 40, and his son Dany,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. They said the child was between 4 and 5 years old.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Shiite Muslim guerrillas have frequently used roadside bombs to
target Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen in a bid to force an
end to the occupation of the border zone in the south.
	   On Thursday night, another SLA militiamen escaped injury after a
roadside bombing near the border village of Houla in southern
Lebanon, the security officials said. The pro-Syrian Shiite Amal
militia claimed responsibility for the nighttime attack.
	   Earlier this week, two Israeli soldiers were wounded in a
similar attack at another location in the south, and Israeli
warplanes twice attacked suspected guerrilla positions.
	   Jezzine, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the port of Sidon, is
controlled by the 2,500-member SLA, which helps 1,500 Israeli
soldiers patrol the occupied zone Israel set up in 1985.

Iran prepares for historic soccer battle with United States improve relations. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Clinton saying game could help
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hospitals are bracing to treat overly
excitable fans, one of Iran's most important trials since the
revolution has been postponed and everyone seems to have a
prediction.
	   Iran is readying for Sunday's contest with America in the World
Cup finals in France, a match that has taken on added significance
given the country's love-hate relationship with the United States.
	   ``I cannot hide my sentiments about the match, I pray that Iran
wins,'' said Iraj Ghadimi, who owns a home appliance shop in
Tehran's main bazaar. ``It doesn't matter if they lose against
Germany, but this match concerns the country's national pride. ''
	   Political enmity with the United States has been branded in the
psyches of Iranians since the 1979 Islamic revolution that
proclaimed the United States the ``Great Satan.''
	   But many Iranians have welcomed President Mohammad Khatami's
calls for cultural and sports exchanges with America. This week,
U.S. officials expressed support for the possibility of normalizing
ties with Iran, and U.S. President Clinton said the match Sunday
might even help.
	   ``I hope it can be another step toward ending the estrangement
between our nations,'' Clinton said.
	   For some Iranians, sports is a way to move the process forward.
	   ``For the first time after a 20-year enmity the representatives
of the two countries are confronting each other in healthy
battle,'' said Bijan Shariati, 26, a Tehran University student.
	   ``The ice between Iran and the United States is melting away and
if such meetings continue, it will dissolve,'' he said.
	   Across Tehran and other cities, cafes and restaurants have
installed television sets to bring in customers. Security has been
stepped up to control crowds _ jubilant or otherwise _ and everyone
seems to have their take on the match's outcome.
	   Hospitals are bracing to treat weak-hearted fans if all doesn't
go well for Iran. Or even if it does. Three people were treated for
heart attacks after Iran qualified for the World Cup finals in
November when it drew with Australia. Many people had suffered
cuts, bruises and sprained ankles when they jumped in excitement.
	   In Tehran, a hearing in the landmark corruption trial of Tehran
Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was postponed from Sunday to Thursday
to prevent a clash with the match. The judge said many people asked
him not to hold the session Sunday, and he had no objection.
	   Schools and some universities postponed examinations scheduled
to be held during the month-long tournament, and sales of nuts and
crackers are reportedly brisk in preparation for the matches.
	   ``Before the World Cup began, I bought several kilograms
(pounds) of pistachios, almonds and walnuts and I have not missed a
single match,'' said Ghadimi, the appliance salesman.
	   The matches are broadcast live on Iran's state-run television,
but with a 10-second delay to allow censors to edit out anything
considered un-Islamic or offensive to the Islamic regime.
	   Shots picked up by French cameras of women wearing thin summer
dresses, hooligans and banners by Iranian opposition groups are
blocked and replaced with footage of fans from other matches.

Ukrainian president signs economic decrees to stave off crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed a
series of economic decrees meant to improve the country's financial
situation, which the president says is approaching crisis, a news
report said Friday.
	   Kuchma promised to sign the decrees in a nationally broadcast
address on Thursday, in which he described Ukraine's financial
situation as close to crisis. Kuchma said he would take emergency
economic measures because the country's parliament is too
``paralyzed'' to act.
	   He warned that Ukraine's heavy international borrowing was
nearing a critical mark, and the crisis could undermine the
stability of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   One of the decrees that Kuchma signed
	   halves obligatory payments by employers to a special government
fund dealing with the consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster. Now they will pay a sum amounting to 5 percent of their
workers' salaries.
	   Another decree signed Thursday night introduces a single
agricultural production tax instead of the 10 such taxes existing
previously. Kuchma also allocated some 1.25 billion hryvna (dlrs
625 million) in state funds to payment of wages, pensions and
social benefits, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Several other orders allow the government to introduce new
excise and import tariffs, restructure or cancel debts by
agricultural enterprises and set up ``special economic zones'' in
the coal-producing Donetsk region, it said.
	   The president assailed both the previous parliament and the
newly elected legislature, which he criticized for being
preoccupied with political infighting and unable to elect a
speaker.
	   Kuchma's attempts at market reforms long have been stalled by
parliament. The current Verkhovna Rada, elected in late March, is
dominated by leftists and the centrist opposition.
	   Other decrees expected to be signed by Kuchma would lower the
current 20 percent value-added tax and simplify tax procedures for
small businesses.

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Mauricio Cienfuegos scored twice in
the final 30 minutes as the Los Angeles Galaxy overcame a sluggish
first half to defeat the Colorado Rapids 2-1 in a Major League
Soccer match Thursday night.
	   Cienfuegos' left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area
eluded goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann with five minutes to play for
his ninth goal after Ezra Hendrickson's header went to Carlos
Hermosillo, who deflected the ball back to Cienfuegos.
	   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made a season-high 10 saves for the
Galaxy (13-2), which won its third consecutive match to tie D.C.
United for the league lead in victories.
	   Midfielder Ross Paule scored in the 41st minute for Colorado
(6-9), which had its three-match winning streak snapped before a
season-low announced crowd of 9,741 at the Rose Bowl.
	   Cienfuegos tied the score on a 60th-minute penalty kick. Referee
Paul Tamberino awarded the penalty kick when Rapids defender Joey
DiGiamarino tackled Galaxy midfielder Wellington Sanchez from
behind in the penalty area.
	   Paule gave Colorado a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute. Peter Vermes'
long pass into the penalty area was headed out by Los Angeles
midfielder Clint Mathis to Paule, who put a 15-yard (14-meter) shot
past Hartman for his fifth goal.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two days after dramatically stepping into world
currency markets to boost the sagging yen, American and Japanese
finance officials vowed Friday to intervene again if necessary, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   Visiting Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met
Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, and both
welcomed the effects of Wednesday's joint action to halt the yen's
free fall.
	   ``The minister and I had very good talks'' Summers told
reporters after a 40-minute meeting on Japan's strategy for
reviving its moribund economy.
	   The Finance Ministry said Summers also urged Japan to move
quickly to solve its bad loan problem and restore health to its
financial system, but he did not ask Japan specifically to cut
taxes to boost the economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and implement a permanent income tax cut
to get the recession-plagued economy back on track, as critics have
urged.
	   Hashimoto made the decision after his telephone conversation
Wednesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Mainichi newspaper
reported, saying he will announce the move before elections for the
upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   In talks earlier Friday, Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told
Summers that disposing of soured loans is vital to sparking an
economic recovery, the central bank said in a statement.
	   Rampant lending during Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy of
the late 1980s have saddled banks with about 76 trillion yen (dlrs
563 billion) in bad loans.
	   Summers expressed understanding of Japan's position on the bad
debt issue, the BOJ said.
	   In a luncheon meeting, Summers and senior officials of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party discussed strategies to dispose of
soured loans such as creating an institution to take over the loans
and to manage their liquidation, the Nikkei news service reported.
	   Summers also told LDP officials that it is more important for
Japan to stimulate the economy than to put the country's finances
in order by tightening spending, the Nikkei said.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo after the yen plummeted earlier this week to an eight-year
low against the U.S. dollar, raising fears of another bout of
currency devaluations around Asia.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar dipped slightly in Friday afternoon trading to 136.84
yen, down 0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo.
	   In a meeting earlier with Deputy Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro
Nukaga, Summers urged Japan to jump start its economy and dispose
of bad debts before next month's elections, the Nikkei news service
reported.
	   Friday's series of high-level meetings began with discussions
between Summers and Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. The two
applauded the success of the joint intervention to stop the yen's
slide.
	   ``The United States and Japan share a very strong interest in a
return to sustained growth in the Asian continent,'' Summers told
reporters after the meeting.
	   In a meeting late Thursday, Summers and Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, stressed the
need for close cooperation to stabilize both the yen and regional
currencies, the Nihon Keizai economic daily reported Friday.
	   Summers and Sakakibara also agreed that structural reform in
Japan's financial sector was essential to restoring calm to the
currency market, the newspaper said.
	   Shortly before Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a nationally televised press
conference that Japan's economy would recover after the government
implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   Japan will also host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation. Summers will attend that meeting as well.

Palestinians ask U.N. to block Israeli building in east Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians have complained to
the United Nations about the construction of Jewish neighborhoods
in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, a Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The PLO representative to the United Nations asked U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a letter to pressure Israel to stop

Committee.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to negotiate the future of
Jerusalem in talks on a permanent peace agreement. The negotiations
have not yet begun, but are to conclude by May 1999.
	   The Palestinians want to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war, but Israel says it will never relinquish sovereignty
over all of the city of 420,000 Jews and 180,000 Arabs.
	   The Palestinians complain that by building in east Jerusalem,
Israel is preempting the outcome of the negotiations. Israel says
it is the sovereign in the city, and will not restrict its building
activities.
	   Since 1967, Israel has build large Jewish neighborhoods in east
Jerusalem, and the number of Jews and Arabs living in the eastern
sector is roughly the same.
	   When Israel broke ground last March for a new housing project in
east Jerusalem _ 6,500 apartments in an area known in Hebrew as Har
Homa and in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim _ the Palestinians suspended
peace talks.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu said he expected construction in Har Homa
to begin soon. ``You will see houses in Har Homa, many houses, by
2000,'' he said.
	   Also Thursday, government planners submitted a Jerusalem

percent of the total by investing heavily in job creation and
expanding the city westward. Planners said that if the government
did not intervene, the Palestinian population would increase from
30 percent to 40 percent in two decades due to a higher birth rate
and Jewish emigration.

New Zealand critical of Woodward tactic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand will officially complain
about England coach Clive Woodward's decision to keep Saturday's
test team secret.
	   Woodward, wounded after his team's record 76-0 loss to Australia
two weeks ago, named a 23-man squad for Saturday's test against the
All Blacks. He will make the team public just before the game and
said he intended to maintain that approach up to next year's World
Cup.
	   But Woodward's decision angered his hosts, who say the secrecy
is hindering the promotion of the sport.
	   New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) chairman Rob Fisher
called Woodward's decision ``disrespectful'' and said he would
write to the International Rugby Board in a bid to make the ploy
illegal.
	   ``I just think it is disrespectful to the rugby public who turn
up to buy a program and get a tatty piece of paper that lists the
teams,'' said Fisher, who is also the deputy chairman of the IRB.
	   Fisher wants to enforce an agreement that obliges touring sides
to name their teams at least 48 hours before games.
	   He said such a rule used to exist between test nations, and
still does at World Cup tournaments.

Two policemen killed in Dagestan shelling 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified assailants shelled a police vehicle
in the restive Caucasus region of Dagestan, killing two officers, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   Police also found the body of a resident of nearby Khasavyurt,
who was believed to have been killed for witnessing the attack on
Thursday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The killings brought the number of policemen killed on duty in
Dagestan in the last year and a half to 35, ITAR-Tass said, citing
the press service of the Interior Ministry.
	   Dagestan, a poverty-stricken and crime-ridden republic near the
breakaway region of Chechnya, has been swept by increasing unrest
recently. About 90 percent of adult males are unemployed, and there
have been numerous conflicts between the region's numerous ethnic
groups.

Japan's hesitation to open economy could stall trade talks 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan has raised objections to a plan
by Pacific Rim nations to remove trade barriers in certain
industries to stimulate the region's economies, a Japanese official
said Friday.
	   The plan, the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization, or EVSL,
was scheduled to begin next year but is likely to be delayed by the
devastating financial problems that have pummeled Japan's and big
Asian economies.
	   ``We have many reservations'' about the ESVL, a Japanese
delegate told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He did not elaborate.
	   EVSL, which was drawn up at the last Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation, or APEC, summit in Vancouver, aims to open up trade in
the 18 members countries over the next few years, although no
deadlines have been set.
	   Senior trade officials from APEC countries met for the second
day in the Malaysian city of Kuching on Friday to lay the
groundwork for a ministerial-level meeting beginning Monday.
	   The main topic of the June 22-23 meeting is the EVSL. But
upstaging trade talks were the financial concerns gripping the
region. Friday's closed-door talks centered on ``the adverse
effects on economies arising from the current financial
instability,'' according to the day's agenda.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in nine priority sectors: environmental products and
services, energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods,
chemical products and telecommunications.
	   Telecommunications ministers signed an agreement in Singapore
earlier this month easing trade restrictions on telecommunications
equipment.
	   However, U.S. and other officials said that much work needed to
be done before agreement was reached in the remaining sectors and
Japan's reluctance would further slow progress.
	   ``They (Japan) are the second largest economy in the world, they
have got to participate. Without them there is no critical mass and
critical mass is essential,'' a U.S. official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Japan considers the fish, forestry, toys and gem sectors, as
``sensitive'' industries, a Japanese official said.
	   The main sticking points for other countries were the fish and
forestry industries, which are heavily subsidized and seen as
vulnerable to competition. Those are precisely the areas which big
commodity exporting countries, such as Canada, would like to see
opened up.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, which are scheduled for admission in
November, have sent their ministers as observers.

World Cup: Brazilian captain questioned; is he too intense? 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ After he bullied, coaxed and
inspired Brazil to victory in the 1994 World Cup, captain Dunga
achieved a rare consensus as the team's unquestioned leader.
	   But now, some players feel he's going too far. While still team
captain, Dunga has drawn criticism for his domineering manner and
aggressive attitudes on the field.
	   The unrest nearly boiled over during Brazil's 3-0 victory over
Morocco on Tuesday.
	   Leading 1-0, Brazil faced a dangerous free kick near its penalty
area. Dunga wasn't satisfied with the way Bebeto set up in the wall
and shouted at him. Bebeto answered back, and Leonardo had to step
in front of a suddenly livid Dunga.
	   ``What's the matter, man? What's the matter with you?'' Leonardo
shouted.
	   The kick hit the wall and Brazil held on to win, but the
incident wasn't forgotten.
	   ``He was hot-headed and so was I, and things happened,'' Bebeto
said after practice Thursday as he fielded question after question
about the incident.
	   ``He came up later and hugged me,'' Bebeto said. ``I know him.
He's always been like this.''
	   Dunga said the incident had blown over.
	   ``I apologized to Bebeto on the field. He accepted, and it's
over,'' he told reporters after practice Thursday.
	   Leonardo, suddenly projected into the role of peacemaker and new
team leader, also sought to play down the confrontation.
	   ``No matter how big the argument was on the field, this won't
destabilize the group,'' he said. ``We've known Dunga for many
years. This is part of his spirit.''
	   Ronaldo admitted he bridles at bossing but stopped short of
criticizing his captain.
	   ``I don't like people shouting or gesturing at me, but I try to
understand Dunga,'' he said.
	   Others were less quick to pardon.
	   ``Dunga was too harsh,'' Bellini, captain of Brazil's 1958 World
Cup champions, said in an interview on the Internet. ``He seems
more nervous than in other Cups.''
	   This is the third and almost certainly last Cup for the
34-year-old midfielder of Japan's Jubilo Iwata. In victory and
defeat, he has been a symbol of the Brazilian team, his buzz-cut
hair a reflection of his commando image.
	   In 1990, coach Sebastiao Lazaroni hailed the tough, scrappy
style of his midfield bulldog. He announced the dawning of the
``Dunga Era'' and said Brazil's team would be ``Dunga and 10
more.''
	   That didn't sit well with many Brazilians, who preferred a ball
artist such as Careca, Bebeto or Romario as a symbol for the team.
It sounded even worse when Brazil got knocked out early by
archrival Argentina, and the ``Dunga era'' became a code phrase for
ugly, artless soccer.
	   But if fans renounced him, coaches admired his courage, his
leadership and, yes, his skills as offensive coordinator and
long-range threat. He returned to the national team in 1994, again
a symbol of the dedication to winning a fourth Cup title.
	   Dunga says he hasn't changed through his career in Brazil,
Germany, Italy and Japan. His experience gives him perspective, but
he always knew what was important.
	   ``For Brazil, we must try to win always,'' he said. ``I know how
much it hurts to lose and how joyful it is to win, so I want always
to continue being a winner.''

Macqueen again calls for sin-bin, criticizes Scots 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Not content with a record win over
Scotland, Australian coach Rod Macqueen tried to get under its skin
on the eve of Saturday's second test at Ballymore.
	   Macqueen, speaking at a news conference Friday, was critical of
Scotland's play during the first test last week, which Australia
won 45-3.
	   He backed his enduring support for the sin-bin to be introduced
at international level with criticism of Scottish loose forward
Eric Peters, who was penalized several times for offside during the
first test.
	   ``We had a lot of trouble with players coming in from the
offside positions and in Super 12 that would have been marked very
quickly with a yellow card or a sin-bin,'' Macqueen said. ``We
found that Peters spent more time in our side of the ruck than some
of our players did. We were thinking of giving him a gold jersey at
the end of the game.''
	   Macqueen complained about the absence of a sin-bin in his first
series as coach in November, when he accused Argentina of also
spoiling the game with offside tactics.
	   Scotland coach Jim Telfer said he agreed with the use of a
sin-bin for repeated infringements, but said Australia also broke
the rules, despite Macqueen's constant refrain.
	   ``They are equally adept at getting offside or whatever, I don't
accept that criticism,'' Telfer said.
	   Telfer said Australian hooker Phil Kearns was one Wallaby who
spent more than his share of time offside.
	   Macqueen did not end his criticism with the Scots, who impressed
their hosts despite the record loss in Sydney.
	   He also pointed the finger at New Zealand, a move sure to be
noted by the Wallabies' great rival.
	   ``When the All Blacks start to look at the possibility of a try
coming on they opt for the professional foul,'' Macqueen said.
	   Meanwhile Telfer declared South African prop Matthew Proudfoot
fit for action while Australian prop Andrew Blades was also
cleared.
	   Australia named an unchanged team for the third match in
succession while Scotland was forced to bring in hooker Kevin
McKenzie for Gordon Bulloch. Bulloch suffered a shoulder injury in
the opening 10 minutes in Sydney.
	   Telfer said he expected Australia to be looking ahead at the
tri-nations series against New Zealand and South Africa.
	   ``I think they might be trying to vary their game so they've got
a complete package in time for those games,'' Telfer said.
	   Teams:
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.
	   Scotland: Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen
Shepherd, Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric
Peters, Gordon Simpson, Rob Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes,
Scott Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Kevin McKenzie, David Hilton.
Reserves: Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh,
Stewart Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Steven Brotherstone.

Deputy Prime Minister Nemtsov to attend czar's burial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov confirmed on
Friday that he would attend next month's burial of Russia's last
czar, news agencies reported.
	   Nemtsov, who was in St. Petersburg on Friday to review
preparations for the ceremony, did not say whether he would be the
only government representative at the burial of Nicholas II, his
family and servants.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has said he would not attend. The
decision followed an announcement by the Orthodox Church that
neither Patriarch Alexy II nor any other member of the church
hierarchy would officiate at the service.
	   The church said that local priests in St. Petersburg could take
part in the service at the Peter and Paul Cathedral, the
traditional burial site of the Romanovs.
	   Until Alexy II refused to participate, the Russian government
had been planning a grandiose, no-expenses-barred burial ceremony,
which could have provided Yeltsin's government with a political
boost.
	   Now, the government is trying to arrange a much more modest
burial. Nemtsov refused to say how much the ceremony would cost,
saying only it could be anywhere between 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs
403 million) and 7 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion), the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   ``We shall minimize the expenses on the burial _ and not because
we are skinflints, but because there is no money in the country and
we would not be understood,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying.
	   ``Everything should be modest and decent,'' the Interfax news
agency quoted him as saying.
	   Nemtsov headed the Russian government commission that was in
charge of determining the identity of nine sets of bones recovered
in 1991 near the place where Nicholas was executed by the
Bolsheviks.
	   Repeated DNA testing has confirmed their identities as Nicholas,
his wife, three of their children and four servants.
	   But the church says it continues to doubt the identity of the
remains, and decided to refrain from high-level participation in
the burial.

Israeli-backed militiaman, son killed in roadside bomb in south 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A bomb believed detonated by Lebanese
guerrillas killed an Israeli-backed militiaman and his child Friday
in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   The bomb went off on a road just west of the Christian mountain
town of Jezzine as the militiaman of the South Lebanon Army drove
in a civilian vehicle, they said. His son was sitting next to him.
	   The two were identified as Fuad Abi Zeid, 40, and his son Dany,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. They said the child was between 4 and 5 years old.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Shiite Muslim guerrillas have frequently used roadside bombs to
target Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen in a bid to force an
end to the occupation of the border zone in the south.
	   On Thursday night, another SLA militiamen escaped injury after a
roadside bombing near the border village of Houla in southern
Lebanon, the security officials said. The pro-Syrian Shiite Amal
militia claimed responsibility for the nighttime attack.
	   Earlier this week, two Israeli soldiers were wounded in a
similar attack at another location in the south, and Israeli
warplanes twice attacked suspected guerrilla positions.
	   Jezzine, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the port of Sidon, is
controlled by the 2,500-member SLA, which helps 1,500 Israeli
soldiers patrol the occupied zone Israel set up in 1985.

Scholar: Russian science on the verge of collapse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian science will collapse in the next few
years if it doesn't get more government funding, a news agency said
Friday, citing a prominent scientist.
	   ``Today science is near a critical point. If the situation with
its financing does not change, it will merely die in two or three
years,'' ITAR-Tass wrote, citing Vladimir Strakhov, director of the
Institute for Earth Sciences.
	   Strakhov was the only research institute director to join a
protest that scientists staged on Thursday before the government
building in Moscow, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He has also held hunger strikes twice in recent years to protest
underfunding of the sciences. Strakhov said that tax evasion by the
rich is the main reason for the scientific community's woes,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russia's scientific institutions have been severely battered by
the nation's financial problems since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
Researchers' salaries have shrunk, and even the modest pay is often
months overdue.

Philippine Airlines' ground crew union to file strike notice approval of rehabilitation plan.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground
personnel threatened Friday to join a devastating 15-day-old
pilots' strike at Philippine Airlines that has pushed Asia's oldest
airline to the brink of financial ruin.
	   The ground workers' union filed a strike notice with the labor
department accusing PAL of union busting and harassment. The flight
attendants' union said it also plans a strike vote.
	   The unions are not able to strike for at least 15 days after
filing strike notices because of a mandatory cooling-off period.
	   The Philippine flag carrier, meanwhile, filed a rehabilitation
plan Friday with Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission saying
it is unable to meet payments on its loans, estimated at dlrs 2
billion, because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   The pilots' strike has cost the company more than 2 billion
pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL said.
	   PAL did not say in its petition what specific form the debt
relief would take, but pledged that all creditors would be paid
``in due course'' if the plan is implemented.
	   The airline says it plans to lay off 40 percent of its
13,000-member work force, dispose of 40 of its 54 planes, suspend
more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some subsidiaries.
	   It said Thursday it will decide in three months whether it will
shut down after seeing the results of the rehabilitation plan.
	   PAL's bank creditors, led by Philippine National Bank, urged all
parties with loans to PAL to approve the rehabilitation plan.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an
airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The plan put 225
pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union says.
	   The labor department has upheld PAL's power to retire the
pilots, which is included in a collective bargaining agreement
signed by the union and management.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots last week after they ignored a
government back-to-work order, and now has only 25 management
pilots left.
	   The airline was already in serious financial shape before the
strike because of years of losses and an ambitious dlrs 4 billion
modernization program launched shortly before Asia's currency
crisis. The crisis sharply reduced passenger numbers and inflated
operating and loan repayment costs.
	   PAL says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in the
fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its 57-year
history.

Government advisor warns against driving Pakistan to economic brink 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Economic sanctions that push a
``desperately poor country toward the economic brink,'' can
backfire on the United States and other industrialized nations that
impose them, a government advisor warned Friday.
	   Mahbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister and economic consultant
to the government, said that the dlrs 1.5 billion in economic
sanctions won't have an immediate impact on Pakistan, but the
future could be bleak for this poor country of 140 million people.
	   However, he warned that sanctions could backfire.
	   ``There is nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately
poor nation to the economic brink, where the only thing it may have
to sell may be its nuclear bombs,'' said Haq.
	   ``I think that is not a very sensible pressure, even when the
policy makers are very determined to be responsible and (Pakistan
Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharif is, I would not open the temptation,''
he warned.
	   U.S. intelligence analysts are watching for signs that economic
sanctions could boomerang and compel the Pakistan government to
find scarce cash by selling its nuclear technology or material,
particularly to other Islamic countries, most notably Iran.
	   On May 21, after Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices in
response to neighboring India's nuclear tests, Sharif went on
national television and promised Pakistan would safeguard its
nuclear technology. He said it wasn't for sale.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub, in an interview with The Associated
Press, also made the same promise. He also blasted the western
countries who are ready to label Pakistan's bomb an ``Islamic
bomb'' reflecting the fact that most Pakistanis are Muslims.
	   ``The western bomb is not a Christian bomb, the Russian bomb is
not a communist bomb, the Indian bomb is not a Hindu bomb and we
all know Israel has the ability to make a nuclear bomb and we don't
call that a Jewish bomb, but Pakistan's is an Islamic bomb. Is that
right?'' he asked.
	   So far the Pakistan government has not issued any official
statement on the sanctions and most senior government and
International Monetary Fund officials were in meetings.
	   In the southern port city of Karachi -- the financial heart of
Pakistan -- stock brokers and traders said the sanctions were
milder than anticipated.
	   ``I think people feel that these sanctions are less harsh than
what we were anticipating,'' said Farhan Mahmood, a stock broker.
	   ``People feared heavy trade sanctions that would have been
disastrous,'' he said.
	   Since conducting its nuclear tests, Pakistan has been bracing
itself for sanctions.
	   Foreign currency bank accounts were frozen to prevent the panic
withdrawal of an estimated dlrs 11 billion in foreign currency.
That would have bankrupted the country, which has foreign exchange
reserves of just dlrs 1.4 billion or enough to pay six weeks of
imports.
	   A state of emergency also was declared to make it legally
impossible to challenge the tough economic measures that were
taken.
	   The government announced a 50 percent across the board reduction
in government spending. It launched a massive tax collection scheme
to collect millions of dollars in unpaid taxes. It also vowed to
make a ``horrible example'' of people who did not repay their
outstanding bank loans, which amount to billions of dollars.
	   Haq said that the western world would be better to adopt a
policy of ``constructive engagement'' rather than sanctions.
	   ``This is not the time that the U.S. and its allies would like
to see this region unstable,'' he said.
	   Economic sanctions won't resurrect the western world's
nonproliferation regime, Haq said.
	   ``This is a post nuclear stage,'' Haq said. ``I cannot conceive
of any economic sanctions that could denuclearize India or
Pakistan. That stage is over.''
	   Instead he said the industrialized world should be looking at
coming to a new nuclear deal ``whether it is done as full members
of the nuclear club, or nonmembers or half members, but this should
be thought through ... and done through engagement.''

Chinese dissidents urge Clinton to meet democracy activist 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with police comment in graf 9
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese dissidents appealed Friday to President
Clinton to push for greater freedoms during his visit to China next
week and to meet with a veteran pro-democracy activist.
	   A group of 57 dissidents, in a fax to foreign news agencies,
urged Clinton to meet their Beijing-based representative, Xu Wenli,
after a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   If Clinton does not meet with Xu, his visit will be only a
diplomatic coup for the Chinese government and do nothing to
promote democracy, said the letter signed by dissidents from 14
cities and provinces.
	   The government is unlikely to allow Xu to meet Clinton during
the carefully scripted weeklong visit, which begins Thursday.
	   Xu was imprisoned from 1981 to 1993, mostly in solitary
confinement, for campaigning for democracy during the late 1970s.
He recently has reported being harassed by police for trying to set
up a human rights monitoring group.
	   In a separate appeal, dissident Xu Wanping wrote to Clinton
urging him to press President Jiang to reassess the Tiananmen
Square democracy protests in 1989 that the government violently
crushed and labeled as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' a Hong
Kong-based rights group said.
	   Xu Wanping, from the southwestern industrial city of Chongqing,
was imprisoned for eight years for participating in the movement.
He also called for the release of those jailed after the protests,
an end to suppression of public dissent, and enforcement of
constitutional guarantees of free speech and other civil liberties,
according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China.
	   The center also said Liu Lianjun, a dissident from eastern
Shandong province, was filing charges against Beijing police
alleging that he was beaten and tortured during a six-day illegal
detention that began May 29.
	   Liu said police took him to a deserted area in the city's
outskirts and threatened to kill and bury him if he did not
cooperate. A police spokesman, Liu Wei, said he had not heard of
the case.
	   Meanwhile, a U.S. based group of rights activists and scholars
urged Clinton to speak out ``forcefully'' in support of academic
and political freedoms, particularly during a speech at Beijing
University.
	   ``If you are silent, you will send a message of tacit
endorsement for the Chinese authorities' repressive policies,''
said an open letter signed on behalf of the New York-based Human
Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee.
	   Chinese astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and Jonathan Fanton, president
of the New School for Social Research, signed the letter.
	   Fang, who teaches at the University of Arizona, was one of
China's leading democracy advocates in 1989. After the Tiananmen
Square protests, he and his wife spent 13 months in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing before fleeing into exile.

Gates announces Chinese language Windows 98 in stores in July 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Chinese-language version of the latest
generation Windows 98 operating system will be in stores in July,
Microsoft chief Bill Gates said Friday.
	   Some new computers equipped with Windows 98 went on sale Monday,
and the software is to begin retail sales June 25. The new system
is an upgrade and consolidation of features available now through
Windows 95.
	   The time lag in the launch of the Chinese-language Microsoft
products has fallen from about a year in the case of Windows 3.0,
to just about a month, Gates said.
	   In a speech to the doyens of Taiwan's computer industry, Gates
praised Taiwan's growth as a user of personal computers and the
Internet as ``incredible.''
	   He discussed the concept of a ``Digital Nervous System,'' that
would fully integrate businesses' functions over the Internet. He
said the concept, now under development by Microsoft, would give
businesses an edge by speeding up distribution of information and
facilitating dialogue with customers.
	   Gates predicted a steady increase in the speed of
microprocessors to 2,000 mHz, and said Microsoft was already
prepared to adapt its new software to the faster chips.
	   ``As soon as the chips are there, we're ready,'' Gates said.
	   Increased memory storage space will further the importance of
pcs, and they will take on the functions of the old mainframe
computers in 3-5 years, he said.
	   But a breakthrough in monitor technology is still needed before
daily life can become fully digital, he said. Monitors need to
become more like paper in portability and resolution, and
breakthroughs are possible within the next five years, he said
	   ``Hardware is not a limitation. The key is creativity,'' said
Gates.
	   Gates' eight-hour stop in Taipei was part of a regional tour
that has also taken him to South Korea and Japan.
	   Making his seventh visit to Taipei, Gates delivered a copy of
the Windows 98 system to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, and
filmed a brief advertising spot promoting Taiwanese exports.

Defiant India says sanctions won't have much effect 
</HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Still defiantly defensive of its nuclear
ambitions, India said Friday that U.S. sanctions were regrettable
and unjustified, but won't take a large bite out of the economy.
	   The list of sanctions released Thursday in Washington ran as
expected, and could have been worse, industrialists said. They may
hurt U.S. jobs as much as the Indian market.
	   The U.S. State Department, elaborating on sanctions announced
after India and Pakistan tested nuclear devices last month, said it
was canceling non-humanitarian aid, suspending delivery of defense
material and dual use items, prohibiting bank loans to both
governments, and blocking new credit guarantees for private loans.
	   Washington estimated India will lose dlrs 2.5 billion in
international bank loans, and Pakistan would suffer a dlrs 1.5
billion setback.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called the sanctions ``a minor
roadblock'' toward better U.S.-Indian relations, but it was too
early to assess the impact. Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde
said trade would not be affected.
	   The Foreign Ministry denounced the sanctions as a ``coercive''
interference with free trade, which it called ``unjustified and
counterproductive.''
	   ``We consider it regrettable that these impediments have been
placed in the way of the growing economic cooperation between India
and the U.S.,'' the foreign ministry spokesman said.
	   The U.S. government said the sanctions were intended to
influence India and Pakistan to put their nuclear programs on hold
and refrain from deploying nuclear-capable missiles, but neither
country showed any sign of bending.
	   Hegde said India ``could not take the humiliation any more'' of
discrimination by the five official nuclear powers. Speaking at an
exporters meeting Friday, he complained that the country that had
dropped atomic bombs on two cities was ``now preaching sermons'' to
India.
	   Both India and Pakistan have declared a moratorium on further
tests, but Pakistan said Thursday it reserved the right to renew
the testing to maintain the balance with India.
	   Rajesh Shah, president of the influential Confederation of
Indian Industry, said the sanctions stayed within the limits
mandated by U.S. law and contained no surprises. He said they
``would adversely affect U.S. exports and jobs,'' and cautioned
India not to retaliate against U.S. companies operating in India
and providing jobs here.
	   The two U.S. companies that could be hit hardest by the denial
of U.S. loan guarantees are Enron Corp., which is building a
massive power project in western India, and Boeing, which is
bidding to upgrade Air India's fleet.
	   Amit Mitra, head of the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce, said both companies could raise the needed capital in
international financial markets at marginally higher costs.
	   The effect of the cancellation of dlrs 21 million in development
aid was unclear. Aid administrators said they were waiting to hear
which projects would be excluded from the humanitarian category.
	   One project likely to be axed was a program to help India's
stock market regulators strengthen their watchdog operations _ one
element of the 6-year-old Indian effort to reform an economy
riddled with corruption and inefficiency.
	   Most non-government organizations _ even those partially funded
by the U.S. government _ would not be badly hurt. The Aga Khan
Foundation, for example, receives some U.S. funding through its
head office in Geneva, which is then channeled to India and
Pakistan for health, education and rural development projects.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish hurdler Ludmila Engquist
strained a hamstring muscle while training and may have to cancel
her appearance at the European Track and Field Championships in two
months, the newspaper Expressen reported Friday.
	   The Russian-born 1997 World Champion and 1996 Olympic gold
medalist will miss a Swedish track event next week, a Swiss event
July 2 and probably the Oslo Grand Prix a week later.
	   The European Championships in Budapest are set for August.

Defense Minister orders dismantling of gunman's shrine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister ordered the
dismantling of a shrine at the grave of Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish
settler who killed 29 Muslim worshippers in the 1994 Hebron mosque
massacre.
	   Goldstein's family will try to reach agreement with the army on
how and when the benches, lamps and cabinet containing religious
books will be removed, the family's lawyer, Yair Golan, said
Friday.
	   Goldstein's grave on the outskirts of the Jewish West Bank
settlement of Kiryat Arba has become a site of pilgrimage for
Jewish extremists.
	   Admirers of the Brooklyn-born physician pray at the site and lay
pebbles on the tombstone, in line with Jewish custom.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Thursday called Goldstein
a ``perpetrator of a massacre worthy of every condemnation,'' and
told the West Bank army commander to dismantle the shrine after
consulting with the Goldstein family.
	   Earlier this month, parliament passed special legislation paving
the way for removing the shrine. It was not immediately clear when
the army would carry out Mordechai's order.

Germany lifts Nazi-era convictions in mass pardon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's upper house on Friday approved a
law rehabilitating hundreds of thousands of Germans convicted of
crimes by the Nazis, including soldiers who deserted Adolf Hitler's
army in World War II.
	   The blanket pardon, passed last month in the lower house, also
clears the names of dissidents, Jews and some 350,000 men and women
ordered sterilized by special Nazi courts to help create a supposed
German ``master race.'' About 50,000 sterilization victims are
still alive.
	   The debate on the law spanned decades, and ultimately required a
compromise over the wording to satisfy holdouts in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition.
	   ``This was overdue,'' said federal Justice Minister Edzard
Schmidt-Jortzig.
	   Conservatives have been reluctant to pardon deserters, fearing
it would be seen as a condemnation of the German military's conduct
during the war. Some opponents also argued that Germany had atoned
enough for the Nazi past.
	   The law did not explicitly exonerate about 20,000 deserters
sentenced to death by Nazi courts and tens of thousands more who
received jail terms. Instead, it lifts Nazi convictions imposed for
``military reasons.''
	   The liberal Greens, arguing that the pardon for deserters and
homosexuals condemned by the Nazis, abstained from voting in the
lower house.
	   Also lifted are convictions for political, religious and racial
reasons. The law does not include any financial compensation.

Tokyo stocks fall amid renewed worry over banking system, dollar tumbles 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond prices, other details
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell Friday amid renewed worries
over the health of Japan's banking system, just a day after a
dramatic rally. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 93.56 points, or 0.61
percent, closing the week at 15,267.98 points. On Thursday, the
average surged 646.16 points, or 4.39 percent, after a dramatic
intervention drove the yen higher.
	   Traders said share prices headed lower as selling in banking
issues led by a sharp drop in Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
dampened sentiment.
	   Shares of LTBC went into a noise dive after Moody's Investors
Services on Thursday lowered its subordinate debt rating to B1 from
Ba1, citing the bank's deteriorating financial fundamentals.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading of LTBC and Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd., another Japanese credit bank, for Friday
afternoon, following a news report the government is considering a
bailout for the two banks.
	   An estimated 482 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from Thursday's 701 million shares. Decliners
outnumbered gainers 679 to 419, with 170 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 11.57 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,187.27.
It leaped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Until that rise, the Nikkei had fallen in tandem with the yen,
hurt by the same pessimism about Japan's economy that plagued the
Japanese currency.
	   But with the yen's rebound at least momentarily stalled,
investors had no fresh reason to buy Tokyo stocks, analysts said.
	   ``The yen's climb has stopped, and there is no further incentive
to push the market sharply higher,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager of the equities operation group at Nikko Securities Co.
	   An estimated 482 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from Thursday's 701 million shares. Decliners
outnumbered gainers 679 to 419, with 170 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 11.57 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,187.27.
It leaped 42.00 points, or 3.63 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 134.97 yen, down 1.91 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 137.83 yen overnight.
	   Ryuichi Takami, assistant manager of the treasury department
with Sanwa Bank, said both Japanese and foreign speculators
aggressively bought the yen late Friday afternoon, pushing the
dollar lower.
	   For much of Friday's trading, the dollar remained in a narrow
range as players avoided from making significant moves prior to the
weekend meeting of deputy finance ministers and central bankers
from the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
	   Finance officials from other Asian nations will also attend the
Tokyo meeting to discuss ways of stabilizing local currencies and
economies in the region.
	   ``Whatever they say or don't say will drastically affect equity,
currency and bond markets Monday,'' said Geoffrey Bennett, a senior
salesman at ING Barings.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met with Bank of
Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami on Friday morning, and Hayami told him
that writing off the pile of bad debts held by Japanese banks is
vital to revitalizing Japan's sagging economy.
	   Traders said yen-buying was spurred on a believe that the
Japanese government may come up with something concrete steps to
lift the yen's value against the yen in near future.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to speed up efforts
to resolve the bad loan problems. Japanese banks are still
struggling to write off a total of 76 trillion yen (dlrs 567
billion) in bad loans, leftover from the collapse of highly
speculative ``bubble economy'' of late 1980s.
	   The weekend meeting was called earlier this week to find ways to
end the yen's recent slide against the dollar that has threatened
to rekindle new rounds of currency devaluation in already battered
Asian economies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.255 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.285 percent, driving its price up to 111.47 yen from 111.36 yen.

Russian economic officials prepare for IMF talks Berezovsky quotes. Trims.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin comments, Chubais and
AP Photos
By JUDITH INGRAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's newly appointed liaison to international
financial organizations has tried to play down the decision by the
International Monetary Fund to delay a dlrs 670 million loan to
Russia, while President Boris Yeltsin called Friday for moral
support from the West.
	   ``What we really need is not their money, but their trust,''
Yeltsin said during a visit to the central Russian region of
Kostroma.
	   ``The situation is very grave, but we are holding out,'' Yeltsin
told reporters in Kostroma, about 320 kilometers (200 miles)
northeast of Moscow. ``Even such a strong country as Japan has been
gripped by a crisis, but we are holding out.''
	   Anatoly Chubais told the NTV television channel late Thursday
that Russian officials have been preparing for ``big talks'' with
the IMF on a ``big credit.'' Earlier in the day, he had said dlrs
10 billion to 15 billion would be necessary to stabilize Russia's
battered economy.
	   The visit by an IMF delegation next week will give the
government an opportunity to ``resolve those issues that have
arisen in connection with this installment of the existing
credit,'' Chubais said.
	   He will meet with the acting chairman of the International
Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Monday.
	   In Washington, an IMF spokesman said Thursday that the latest
installment from the fund's dlrs 9.2 billion, three-year support
loan to Russia was being delayed until next week.
	   According to Western bankers, the IMF has been playing tough
with Russia in part because it wants to be sure that the government
is sufficiently motivated to carry out promises to overhaul
taxation and slash spending.
	   The IMF wants assurances from Moscow that broad tax code
revisions will become law, stalled land-reform and budget laws will
be passed, and various taxes will be increased.
	   For its part, Russia wants an infusion of financial resources
that could restore investor confidence, Chubais told the RTR
television station Thursday night.
	   He said that because of the ``serious world financial crisis,''
Russia had to ``act vigorously, aggressively and assertively.''
	   Russia took a number of measures Thursday to address the
financial crisis. The country sold dlrs 2.5 billion in a 30-year
Eurobond aimed at restructuring its short-term debt. Boris
Fyodorov, the country's new tax chief, said he had reached
agreements with 13 to 15 oil companies to pay back taxes.
	   And Premier Sergei Kiriyenko held a late-night meeting with
Russia's most powerful businessmen, the so-called oligarchs, to
gather their support and ideas on resolving the crisis.
	   Russian financier Boris Berezovsky, who is serving as the
executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said
Friday that such meetings should be held regularly.
	   He said that the major industrial and financial groups'
interests ``now have a strategic character, and what is profitable
to them is part of Russia's strategic interests,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A new airline company plans to start a
third domestic service in Australia, a direct assault on the
duopoly of Qantas Airways and Ansett Australia, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The Australian Financial Review said that Australian Airline
Holdings Ltd. claims to have secured a ``war chest'' of U.S. dlrs
500 million (Australian dollars 820 million) from a U.S. retirement
fund to start the new airline.
	   The paper said the company planned to acquire eight Boeing
737-300s and 400s for a coast-to-coast operation of 60 flights a
day, linking seven major Australian cities.
	   Company spokesman Paul Orpwood told the paper his proposed
venture would not indulge in ``suicidal'' price cutting and that it
aimed to fill a gap in the business and leisure markets.
	   The company intended to employ 500 staff directly, with another
420 subcontractors, the paper said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground
personnel threatened Friday to join a devastating 15-day-old
pilots' strike at Philippine Airlines that has already brought
Asia's oldest airline to the brink of financial ruin.
	   The ground workers' union filed a strike notice with the labor
department accusing PAL of union busting and harassment. The flight
attendants' union said it also plans a strike vote.
	   The unions are not able to strike for at least 15 days after
filing strike notices because of a mandatory cooling-off period.
	   The Philippine flag carrier, meanwhile, filed a rehabilitation
plan Friday with Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission saying
it is unable to meet payments on its loans, estimated at dlrs 2
billion, because of drastically reduced cash flow.
	   The pilots' strike has cost the company more than 2 billion
pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL said.
	   PAL did not say in its petition what specific form the debt
relief would take, but pledged that all creditors would be paid
``in due course'' if the plan is implemented.
	   The airline says it plans to lay off 40 percent of its
13,000-member work force, dispose of 40 of its 54 planes, suspend
more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some subsidiaries.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will rely on government
spending to revive its buckled economy, and the World Bank is
aiding with a new injection of money, a senior finance official
said Friday.
	   A proposed 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion) increase in the
country's budget will come from the government reserves and the
World Bank, said Deputy Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar.
	   The increased spending was announced by Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim Thursday. It amounts to a 13 percent hike in the
budget and could reverse, to an extent, an 18 percent cut made in
December.
	   The World Bank Thursday approved a dlrs 300 million loan for
Malaysia. The Southeast Asian nation may seek another dlrs 700
million later this year.
	   Malaysian policy makers are veering toward the economic model
suggested by British economist John Maynard Keynes, Affifuddin
said. Keynes argued that the free market wasn't the ultimate
arbiter, and that government spending could spur economic
performance.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Chinese-language version of the latest
generation Windows 98 operating system will be in stores in July,
Microsoft chief Bill Gates said Friday.
	   Some new computers equipped with Windows 98 went on sale Monday,
and the software is to begin retail sales June 25. The new system
is an upgrade and consolidation of features available now through
Windows 95.
	   The time lag in the launch of the Chinese-language Microsoft
products has fallen from about a year in the case of Windows 3.0,
to just about a month, Gates said.
	   In a speech to the doyens of Taiwan's computer industry, Gates
praised Taiwan's growth as a user of personal computers and the
Internet as ``incredible.''
	   He discussed the concept of a ``Digital Nervous System,'' that
would fully integrate businesses' functions over the Internet. He
said the concept, now under development by Microsoft, would give
businesses an edge by speeding up distribution of information and
facilitating dialogue with customers.
	   Gates predicted a steady increase in the speed of
microprocessors to 2,000 mHz, and said Microsoft was already
prepared to adapt its new software to the faster chips.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Friday after a
downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked frantic selling.
	   The exchange also halted trading of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
following a news report the government is considering a bailout
that would merge it with struggling LCTB.
	   Shares of LTCB went into a nose dive after the downgrade,
dropping below the psychologically important 100-yen (73 U.S.
cents) line for the first time since its stock was listed.
	   The downgrade and subsequent plunge in stock prices were eerily
similar to events that preceded the November collapse of Yamaichi
Securities Co., the largest business failure in Japanese history.
	   LTCB announced problem loans worth 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in March. Most of those were made to property buyers
during the land price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   An LTCB spokesman called the move unfortunate and said he
couldn't understand what prompted Moody's downgrade. He said the
bank would try to convince the U.S.-based agency to reverse its
rating.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Micron Technology Inc., a major U.S. maker of
memory chips, will establish a foothold in Japan by acquiring from
Texas Instruments Inc. a 25 percent equity stake in a joint
semiconductor venture with Kobe Steel Ltd.
	   Texas Instruments agreed to transfer its memory business in the
joint venture with Kobe Steel to the Boise, Idaho-based Micron,
Kobe Steel said in a release.
	   Because of a glut of memory chips in world markets and sharp
decreases in DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, chip prices,
the joint venture, KTI Semiconductor Ltd., has been in a slump
since 1996, Kobe Steel said.
	   Officials from Kobe Steel and TI have been in discussion over
the rebuilding of the joint venture and recently reached an
agreement that TI's equity share in KTI will be transferred to
Micron, a fast-growing semiconductor maker.
	   Kobe Steel will maintain the remaining 75 percent share in KTI,
which is capitalized at 42.1 billion yen (dlrs 307 million). KTI,

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest

according to a statement Friday.

Report: Cambodian police asked ransom for U.S. and Thai drug agents 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodians believed to be maritime
police tried to extort dlrs 400,000 for the release of a U.S. drug
agent and five Thai colleagues captured when an undercover
operation went awry, a Bangkok newspaper reported Friday.
	   The drug agents, seized during an operation in which they posed
as buyers of large quantities of marijuana, were freed after
negotiations between Thai and Cambodian authorities, the Bangkok
Post reported.
	   The report did not say if any money had been paid for the men's
release.
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry said last week that the agents had
been on a ``secret mission'' near Cambodia's maritime province of
Koh Kong. A ministry spokesman said Cambodian maritime police on
June 5 had apprehended the agents on charges of being in Cambodian
territorial waters.
	   He said the incident was the result of a misunderstanding. The
Post reported the two countries signed a memorandum of
understanding that neither was at fault.
	   A U.S. embassy spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press on
Friday that an American citizen was aboard a vessel in the Gulf of
Thailand on the weekend of the incident and that the vessel was
detained.
	   He said on condition of anonymity that the American and the
others were released and no charges brought and Washington
considers the incident closed. He declined comment on the details
of the Post's account.
	   According to the Bangkok Post, which did not name its sources,
the agents were on a trawler just outside Cambodian waters, waiting
to take delivery of several tons of marijuana for shipment to the
United States.
	   After no delivery came, the trawler headed back to Thailand, and
a U.S. Navy vessel which had been shadowing it sailed for
Singapore.
	   Around midnight, as the trawler headed towards the Thai coast,
two armed speedboats with what appeared to be Cambodian maritime
police markings seized it and towed it to an islet off Cambodia's
port city of Sihanoukville.
	   The crew of the speedboats stripped the trawler of navigation
and communications equipment and seized the agents' weapons and
personal belongings.
	   The Cambodians seemed to believe the agent from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration was a drug dealer from a trafficking
ring operating between Cambodia and Thailand, the Post's sources
said.
	   The ring apparently owed the Cambodians money, and the U.S.
agent was allowed to make a call to relay a demand for payment _
originally 3 million baht (dlrs 71,400), then 5 million baht (dlrs
119,000) and finally dlrs 400,000. He alerted his colleagues in
Bangkok.
	   After the call, negotiations began between Thai and Cambodian
authorities, while a U.S. satellite tracked the trawler being moved
to a new location.
	   The agents were sent to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, and
released and flown to Thailand four days after their capture. Some
had been hit by their captors, the Post said.
	   Cambodia, with a corrupt and inefficient police force, has
become a major exporter of marijuana. It is also an important
transit point for heroin coming from the Golden Triangle, the
opium-growing region where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma
meet.
	   A high-ranking officer of Thailand's Police Narcotics
Suppression Bureau, contacted by telephone, said he was unable to
confirm the Post's story.

Daimler-Benz to decide next month whether to build ultra-luxury Maybach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz will decide in the next
few weeks whether to resume production of its ultra-luxury Maybach,
first launched in 1921, a spokesman said Friday.
	   Daimler unveiled a study on the Mayback at the Tokyo Motor Show
in October, saying that a new version of the luxury auto would
travel at top speeds of 250 kilometers (155 miles) an hour.
	   When it was introduced 77 years ago, the Mayback had a maximum
speed of 170 kilometers (105 miles) an hour.
	   The 5.77-meter- (nearly 19-foot-) long car would sell for some
500,000-mark (dlrs 280,000) price tag, the Hamburger Abendblatt
reported on Friday. It said Daimler had already opened talks with
possible suppliers.
	   The Daimler spokesman said that if the board approves the plans,
the car is likely to be built at one of three German plants,
Bremen, Rastatt or Sindelfingen.

U.N. appeals to Arabs for dlrs 18 million to help Kosov refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United Nations appealed to wealthy Arabs
in Gulf states Friday to donate dlrs 12.9 million to help tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from their homes by fighting
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Wealthy Arabs reportedly donated millions of dollars to fellow
Muslims in Bosnia during fighting with Serbs.
	   ``Help is urgently needed and we appeal to the generosity of the
Gulf citizens to help the Kosovo refugees,'' said Panos Moumtzis,
spokesman of the Cairo-based Middle East office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We hope that this would be done through the UNHCR,'' he said.
	   Moumtzis said the U.N. agency has begun a campaign to encourage
donors in the oil-rich Gulf states.
	   The funding is also intended to support local communities
hosting the refugees, who are fleeing Serbia's crackdown against
ethnic Albanian insurgents demanding independence for Kosovo.
	   At least 13,000 people have crossed the mountainous border into
Albania and 9,000 others have fled to the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, the UNHCR says.
	   An estimated 45,000 are displaced within Kosovo itself.

Precede VATICAN CITY Pope arrives to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with pope arrival; changes dateline.
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II arrived Friday on his
third visit to this alpine nation amid a crisis in the Austrian
Roman Catholic church that critics say is caused partly by Vatican
refusal to institute badly needed reforms.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope landed a few minutes behind schedule
at Salzburg's Maxglan airport. On hand to welcome him were
President Thomas Klestil and Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
archbishop of Vienna, who has been mentioned as a possible
successor to the pope.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Austrian Catholics have led a
movement demanding the church drop its requirement that priests be
celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give greater voice to
lay Catholics.
	   The ``We are the Church'' movement gathered a half million
signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to
the United States.
	   During the pope's visit the movement was expected to demonstrate
against the Vatican's refusal to consider reforms.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal. The
pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
had to go into exile in Germany, but likely will be allowed to
return soon after the papal visit.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   Schoenborn, elevated to his post in February, has taken steps to
calm the waters among Catholics, who by the Vatican's count
comprise 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   In Vienna on Sunday, the pope is scheduled to beatify three
people, including a nun, Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded
by the Nazis in 1943. Beatification is the last formal step before
possible sainthood.

	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But plaintiffs say bank
officials stonewalled survivors and their heirs after World War II,
claiming they could not find accounts or demanding nonexistent
death certificates before giving funds to relatives of those who
died in concentration camps.
	   The banks met June 5 with lawyers for Holocaust survivors amid
reports the banks would offer more than dlrs 1 billion to settle
claims they stole assets from dormant wartime accounts.
	   However, in Zurich, a spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group
denied the settlement reports.
	   Jewish groups estimate the banks still hold billions of dollars
in dormant wartime accounts.

Swiss commercial banks offer maximum dlrs 600 million for settlement 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks are prepared to offer a maximum of dlrs 600
million in a ``global settlement'' of claims by Holocaust victims,
according to a statement Friday.
	   ``Swiss banks express continued interest to reach a fair
settlement,'' the joint statement from all three major banks
started.
	   The banks ``warned that the World Jewish Congress and the
plaintiffs' lawyers are seriously jeopardizing the settlement
negotiations.''
	   ``The court-ordered confidentiality agreement that was signed by
all parties to the negotiations is being repeatedly violated,'' the
banks said.
	   The dlrs 600 million sum _ termed the ``rough justice'' amount _
would include dlrs 70 million already paid into a fund to help
needy Holocaust survivors.
	   ``The banks urge that this offer be accepted so that money can
immediately be distributed to Holocaust survivors and heirs of
Holocaust victims,'' the statement said.
	   Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland
are negotiating with Jewish organizations and lawyers for
class-action claimants on a settlement of the claims.
	   The negotiations have been conducted under tight secrecy.
Friday's statement is the first time the banks have named a figure
for a possible settlement.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' they said.
Earlier this month, a Credit Suisse spokesman denied reports of a
settlement offer of dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``The banks view this offer to be at the upper limit of what can
be justified, based on the facts and circumstances,'' the statement
said.
	   ``The banks re-emphasized that they would not entertain
unfounded and excessive payments above this amount.''
	   They added that they ``explicitly recognize the considerable
efforts of (U.S.) Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat to
involve all parties in finding an acceptable solution and commend
him for his contribution to the discussions.''

China makes new proposal for WTO membership 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky met
with her Chinese counterpart Friday, hoping to reach agreement on
terms for China's membership in the World Trade Organization before
President Clinton's trip to China next week.
	   The talks came after China submitted a fresh proposal that
offers foreign companies increased access to China's service
sector, allowing more foreign competition in the mainland's tightly
controlled financial industry, telecommunications and legal and
accounting professions.
	   A Chinese official described the offer as ``very
comprehensive.''
	   Officials on both sides said they wanted to have an agreement
set by the time Clinton arrives next Friday. A WTO accord would
round out a summit conspicuously lacking in substantive agreements.
However, a breakthrough appeared unlikely.
	   ``We have substantial concerns with regard to the proposal,
which the Chinese have submitted,'' said Jay Ziegler, USTR
spokesman.
	   Barshefsky met Friday afternoon with Foreign Trade Minister Shi
Guangsheng to discuss how quickly key differences could be
narrowed.
	   In addition to unresolved ``technical'' issues, China and the
United States disagree over the general pace of liberalization.
	   With economic growth targets threatened by a drop in trade and
investment due to the Asian financial crisis, China is not eager to
expose domestic firms to competition while trying to restructure
ailing state industries.
	   U.S. officials have said they must be able to sell any agreement
with the Chinese to Congress and industry. That means showing that
an accord was based on commercial principles, not political
considerations.
	   The Chinese have a better understanding of U.S. expectations on
WTO, but it is too early to say whether the talks can conclude with
a bilateral summit pact, said Zeigler.
	   ``I think it's premature to pre-judge an outcome at this
point,'' he said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for a
fourth consecutive session Friday after a late buying spree erased
earlier losses.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 75.94 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,591.91. On Thursday, the
index surged 6.4 percent or 511.62 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.44 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
825 billion), down from Thursday's 10.35 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.32 billion).
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower as investors took profits
following Thursday's sharp gains that were triggered by a stronger
Japanese yen.
	   But the index rebounded in the afternoon session, following a
late buying spree in selective blue-chip stocks.
	   Among gainers, Cheung Kong rose 1.80 Hong Kong dollars to 38.60,
Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.10 dollars to 39.20, Sun Hung Kai
Properties rose 90 cents to 34.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 40 cents
to 47.10.
	   Remaining unchanged were HSBC Holdings at 187.50, and China
Light at 33.40.

Bank sale vote postponed after violent protest

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking bank workers stormed a
shareholders' meeting Friday to force the cancellation of a vote on
the sale of Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   Strikers entered overturned tables, dismantled microphones and
drove out Ionian Bank management before the meeting could begin.
Management had refused to discuss worker demands for job and
pension guarantees.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank. Strikers have ignored
court orders to return to work.
	   The efforts to sell Ionian Bank is an important test of the
Socialist government's resolve to reform the banking sector and
bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   ``The meeting has been called off,'' said Yannis Apostolidis,
president of Commercial Bank, the state-owned bank that controls
Ionian.
	   It was not immediately known when the meeting will be held. Law
requires that it take place within 20 days.

Precede VATICAN CITY Pope arrives to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with pope arrival; changes dateline.
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Friday opened his
third visit to Austria amid a crisis in the nation's Roman Catholic
church that critics say is caused partly by Vatican refusal to
institute badly needed reforms.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope landed a few minutes behind schedule
at Salzburg's Maxglan airport. On hand to welcome him were
President Thomas Klestil and Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
archbishop of Vienna, who has been mentioned as a possible
successor to the pope.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Austrian Catholics have led a
movement demanding the church drop its requirement that priests be
celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give greater voice to
lay Catholics.
	   The ``We are the Church'' movement gathered a half million
signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to
the United States.
	   During the pope's visit the movement was expected to demonstrate
against the Vatican's refusal to consider reforms.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal. The
pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
had to go into exile in Germany, but likely will be allowed to
return soon after the papal visit.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   Schoenborn, elevated to his post in February, has taken steps to
calm the waters among Catholics, who by the Vatican's count
comprise 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   In Vienna on Sunday, the pope is scheduled to beatify three
people, including a nun, Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded
by the Nazis in 1943. Beatification is the last formal step before
possible sainthood.

Russia orders peacekeepers in Abkhazia to use force if threatened 
</HEADLINE>
By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A day after six Russian peacekeepers
were injured in a mine blast in breakaway Abkhazia, the Russian
Defense Ministry on Friday ordered the force to start using weapons
if the troops' safety is threatened.
	   The peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier struck a road mine
in the Ghali district, the site of recent fighting between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.
	   ``This is already the fifth case of illegal terrorist or
diversionary acts against the peacekeepers or the United Nations
observers,'' said a statement by the peacekeepers' press service,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, despite repeated protests by the peacekeepers'
command, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides are not taking the
necessary measures for ensuring the normal functioning of the
peacekeeping force in the region,'' the statement said.
	   The Defense Ministry cited the latest mine blast as grounds for
its orders to ``tighten the regime of carrying out service'' and to
use weapons in case of a ``real threat'' to peacekeepers' safety,
Interfax said.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
Russian peacekeepers' presence.
	   A delegation of Russian officials, led by executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States Boris Berezovsky, arrived in
the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi on Friday for talks with Abkhazian
leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze's envoy Vazha Lordkipanidze. They were expected to fly
to the Georgian capital Tbilisi later in the day.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled Abkhazia during the
fighting in the Ghali region last month.
	   Georgia has been pushing for the refugees' immediate,
unconditional return. Abkhazia has stalled, saying it needs time
build new housing and screen the returning refugees to ensure that
they do not include pro-Georgian militants.
	   The United States, France, Germany and Russia have warned the
Abkhazian government that its continued refusal to allow the
refugees to return would amount to ethnic cleansing.

Philippine stocks, peso fall on yen uncertainty 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING
Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Friday, losing much of their advances in the previous session as
investors cashed in on gains amid uncertainties over the
sustainability of the Japanese yen's recovery, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, sank against the dollar in step with most
other Asian currencies, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost 86.88 points,
or 4.8 percent, closing at 1,741.71. On Thursday it had risen 6.6
percent, its heftiest gain in four months, after the United States
and Japan sold dollars to halt the yen's recent decline.
	   The move managed to lift the yen from its eight-year low against
the dollar. But it remains to be seen how long the yen can hold its
position against the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   ``The bubble burst when the selloffs started. Most of the
movements came at the opening of Friday's session,'' Edwin Siao, a
trader for Abacus Securities Corp., said of Friday's stock market
decline.
	   The top gainers in the previous session were among the biggest
losers Friday. Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
fell 2.7 percent, while real estate concern Ayala Land Inc. plunged
10 percent.
	   Traders said Thursday's rally may have been overdone since the
U.S.-Japan intervention to prop up the yen was a stopgap measure
meant to provide temporary reprieve.
	   ``The intervention doesn't change the overall fundamental
picture. All it does is stop the speculation, but fundamental
problems remain,'' said Siao.
	   With Japan facing an economic recession, Siao said other Asian
economies will have to brace for further weakness.
	   He said the outcome of the visit by U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers to Japan will be critical in dictating
Asian stock market direction in coming sessions.
	   Full U.S. support for Japan's proposed economic reforms will be
greeted positively by Asian markets, traders said. However, if
Washington raises doubts about some of the reforms, renewed
regional weakness may develop.
	   ``We hope the Summers visit will result in something positive.
That can spark an uptick,'' said Siao.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 40.898 pesos for the
day, up 1.2 percent from Thursday's 40.425 pesos.
	   Dealers said heavy dollar demand put pressure on the peso as
regional concerns about the sustainability of the Japanese yen's
recent gains persisted.
	   However the peso managed to gain some lost ground late in the
session on rumors of another round of intervention to support the
yen, traders said.
	   Traders said the peso is expected to continue to follow the
direction of regional trading until a firmer solution to prevent
the yen from weakening further is implemented.

World Cup: Group leader Mexico is looking at Belgian challenge with confidence 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Both may have confidence after their
first match, but Mexico has an important victory under its belt,
forcing Belgium out of its traditional defensive shell for
Saturday's Group E game.
	   Mexico is healthy, has a fine two-goal striker in Luis Hernandez
and already gave the World Cup a technical skill all its own, the
frog-like ``Cuauhtemoc'' jump with the ball that epitomizes
Mexico's eagerness.
	   Belgium still happily remembers a draw against the arch-rival
Netherlands, but didn't score a goal. The only skills it showed in
the clash with the Dutch were relentless tackling and verbal
provocation.
	   Mexico will advance with a win and even a draw would hold the
current two-point edge over Belgium. The Netherlands is favored
over South Korea in Marseille on Saturday in another Group E clash
	   ``We have high hopes for the next match,'' said Hernandez. ``We
can make it to the next round.'' They hope skills will make the
difference over brawn.
	   Belgian coach Georges Leekens now sees the need for victory in a
group where the Dutch are still the favorites to win the group and
where the Mexicans hold a two-point edge.
	   ``This is by far the most important match for us,'' said
Leekens.
	   Because the Red Devils will be in the dreaded position of having
to set the pace of play, something they have rarely pulled off over
the past decade, Leekens decided to bring back a veteran with
flair.
	   Enzo Scifo started out his World Cup career in Mexico a dozen
years ago, leading the Red Devils into the semifinals with his
unbridled playmaking skills.
	   ``We need somebody who can make that decisive pass,'' said
Leekens. Scifo's skills may have faded somewhat and his speed may
have slowed at 32, he still is a figure that commands respect.
	   But the Mexicans won't allow Scifo to run free all over the
Bordeaux pitch.
	   ``We have to press them and contain them in their half of the
field. We have to be relentless from the very start,'' striker
Jesus Arellano said.
	   The Mexicans won't change too much of their winning strategy,
keeping their offensive flow going and hopefully not cave if they
fall behind.
	   When forced into a corner, they can always do a ``Cuauhtemoc.''
	   Cuauhtemoc Blanco trapped the ball twice between his ankles and
jumped past opponents to provide a unique World Cup moment.
	   Belgium hasn't produced anything like that. The stylish Scifo
will side in midfield with muscle-packed Marc Wilmots, the Schalke
04 power player with a smothering tackle and fierce shot.
	   Belgium's only fear is that defensive midfielder Franky Van der
Elst will be missing. At 37, the captain is in his fourth World Cup
and his experience was vital to keep the Dutch at bay.

Speaker ousted amid street protests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUZZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Kashmiri lawmakers ousted the
province's parliamentary speaker and deputy speaker on Friday amid
protests by dozens of stone throwing activists, eyewitnesses said.
	   Mumtaz Rathore was ousted as Speaker of the Kashmir provincial
Parliament with 35 of the 47 legislators voting against him in a
no-confidence vote tabled last week. The remaining 12 lawmakers
abstained.
	   Rathore was accused of partisan politics.
	   Police patrolled the streets of this Himalayan provincial
capital after Rathore, who belongs to ousted prime minister Benazir
Bhutto, called for citywide protests against the no-confidence
vote.
	   There were reports of tear gas shells being fired and a heavy
contingent of police were deployed outside the marble Parliament
buildings. Several people were injured.
	   Pakistan is seeking control of a united Kashmir, which currently
is divided between India and Pakistan. The dispute over Kashmir has
caused two previous wars between Pakistan and India.
	   Since both countries declared themselves nuclear powers last
month, renewed international attention has focused on Kashmir in an
attempt to solve the 51-year-old dispute.

Advisor warns against driving Pakistan to economic brink Ld-Writethru to some points.  
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with further effects of sanctions, and with money'
received from Middle East. FIXES garble in last graf. STANDS as 1st
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Economic sanctions that push a
``desperately poor country toward the economic brink,'' can
backfire on the United States and other industrialized nations who
impose them, a Pakistani advisor warned Friday.
	   Mahbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister and economic consultant
to the government, said that the dlrs 1.5 billion in economic
sanctions announced Thursday won't have an immediate impact on
Pakistan, but the future could be bleak for this poor country of
140 million people.
	   However, sanctions could backfire, he warned.
	   ``There is nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately
poor nation to the economic brink, where the only thing it may have
to sell may be its nuclear bombs,'' said Haq.
	   ``I think that is not a very sensible pressure, even when the
policy makers are very determined to be responsible and (Pakistan
Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharif is, I would not open the temptation,''
he warned.
	   U.S. intelligence analysts are watching for signs that economic
sanctions could boomerang and compel the Pakistan government to
find scarce cash by selling its nuclear technology or material,
particularly to other Islamic countries, most notably Iran.
	   On May 21, after Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices in
response to neighboring India's nuclear tests, Sharif went on
national television and promised Pakistan would safeguard its
nuclear technology. He said it was not for sale.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub, in an interview with The Associated
Press, also made the same promise. He also blasted the western
countries who are ready to label Pakistan's bomb an ``Islamic
bomb'' reflecting the fact that most Pakistanis are Muslims.
	   ``The western bomb is not a Christian bomb, the Russian bomb is
not a communist bomb, the Indian bomb is not a Hindu bomb and we
all know Israel has the ability to make a nuclear bomb and we don't
call that a Jewish bomb, but Pakistan's is an Islamic bomb. Is that
right?'' he asked.
	   So far the Pakistan government has not issued any official
statement on the sanctions and most senior government and
International Monetary Fund officials were in meetings Friday.
	   In the southern port city of Karachi -- the financial heart of
Pakistan -- stock brokers and traders said the sanctions were
milder than anticipated.
	   ``I think people feel that these sanctions are less harsh than
what we were anticipating,'' said Farhan Mahmood, a stock broker.
	   ``People feared heavy trade sanctions (and) that would have been
disastrous,'' he said.
	   The sanctions announced Thursday will not affect money in the
pipeline, including a dlrs 200 million IMF payment and about dlrs
100 million from the World Bank, said Haq.
	   The problems arise if the U.S. tries to block next year's IMF
payments. That also would seriously affect Pakistan's ability to
raise money from commercial institutions to pay its dlrs 30 billion
external debt.
	   ``The IMF hurts because the IMF is a seal of good
housekeeping,'' said Haq. ``It opens the door to international
financial institutions, commercial banks and affects credit
ratings.''
	   Since conducting its nuclear tests, Pakistan has been bracing
itself for sanctions.
	   Foreign currency bank accounts were frozen to prevent the panic
withdrawal of an estimated dlrs 11 billion in foreign currency.
That would have bankrupted the country which has a foreign exchange
reserve of just dlrs 1.4 billion or enough to pay six weeks of
imports.
	   A state of emergency also was declared to make it legally
impossible to challenge the tough economic measures that were
taken.
	   The government announced a 50 percent across the board reduction
in government spending. It launched a massive tax collection scheme
to collect millions of dollars in unpaid taxes. It also vowed to
make a ``horrible example'' of people who did not repay their
outstanding bank loans, which amount to billions of dollars.
	   Sharif has been pleading with expatriate Pakistanis to send
foreign currency home. Two weeks ago he went to Saudi Arabia, where
Haq said ``we go quite a large amount from the Middle East.''
	   He refused to elaborate or specify how much.
	   ``This is a post nuclear stage . . . I cannot conceive of any
economic sanctions that could denuclearize India or Pakistan. That
stage is over,'' he said. ``This is not the time that the U.S. and
its allies would like to see this region unstable.''
	   The industrialized world, Haq said, should try to reach a new
nuclear deal ``whether it is done as full members of the nuclear
club, or non-members, or half members, but this should be thought
through . . . and (it should be) done through engagement.''

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed a
series of economic decrees meant to improve the country's financial
situation, which the president says is approaching crisis, a news
report said Friday.
	   Kuchma promised to sign the decrees in a nationally broadcast
address on Thursday, in which he described Ukraine's financial
situation as close to critical. Kuchma said he would take emergency
economic measures because the country's parliament is too
``paralyzed'' to act.
	   He warned that Ukraine's heavy international borrowing was
nearing a critical mark, and that the crisis could undermine the
stability of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   One of the decrees that Kuchma signed halves obligatory payments
by employers to a special government fund dealing with the
consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Now they will
pay a sum amounting to 5 percent of their workers' salaries.
	   Another decree signed Thursday night introduces a single
agricultural production tax instead of the 10 such taxes existing
previously. Kuchma also allocated some 1.25 billion hryvna (dlrs
625 million) in state funds to payment of wages, pensions and
social benefits, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Several other orders allow the government to introduce new
excise and import tariffs, restructure or cancel debts by
agricultural enterprises and set up ``special economic zones'' in
the coal-producing Donetsk region, it said.
	   The president assailed both the previous parliament and the
newly elected legislature, which he criticized for being
preoccupied with political infighting and unable to elect a
speaker.
	   Kuchma's attempts at market reforms have long been stalled by
parliament. The current Verkhovna Rada, elected in late March, is
dominated by leftists and the centrist opposition.
	   A senior U.S. official on Friday endorsed Kuchma's steps but
said Ukraine needed fundamental reforms to overcome its economic
woes.
	   ``Ukraine has very serious financial difficulties right now and
actions will have to be taken to avert a financial crisis in the
future,'' said Ambassador Richard Morningstar, President Clinton's
adviser for the former Soviet republics,
	   ``We hope very much and expect that the actions taken by
President Kuchma and overall, the actions that will be taken over
the next weeks, will create a positive situation,'' he told a news
conference in Kiev.
	   Morningstar said aid from the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund would be very important for Ukraine _ but not enough.
	   ``Ukraine would have to take steps necessary to encourage and
develop economic growth, and has to take the structural reform
steps that would help this process ... in areas such as tax reform,
deregulation, truly creating a private agricultural sector and
energy sector,'' he said.

U.N. appeals to Arabs for dlrs 18 million to help Kosovo refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United Nations appealed to wealthy Arabs
in Gulf states Friday to donate dlrs 12.9 million to help tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from their homes by fighting
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   The funding is also intended to support local communities
hosting the Muslim refugees, who are fleeing Serbia's crackdown
against ethnic Albanian insurgents demanding independence for
Kosovo.
	   ``Help is urgently needed and we appeal to the generosity of the
Gulf citizens to help the Kosovo refugees,'' said Panos Moumtzis,
spokesman of the Cairo-based Middle East office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We hope that this would be done through the UNHCR,'' he said.
	   Wealthy Arabs reportedly donated millions of dollars to fellow
Muslims in Bosnia during fighting with Serbs.
	   Moumtzis said the U.N. agency has begun a campaign to encourage
donors in the oil-rich Gulf states.
	   At least 13,000 people have crossed the mountainous border into
Albania and 9,000 others have fled to the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, the UNHCR says.
	   An estimated 45,000 are displaced within Kosovo itself.

Bank sale vote postponed after violent protest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking financial workers stormed a
shareholders' meeting Friday to force the cancellation of a vote on
the sale of Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   Strikers entered overturned tables, dismantled microphones and
drove out Ionian Bank management before the meeting could begin.
Management had refused to discuss worker demands for job and
pension guarantees.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank. Strikers have ignored
court orders to return to work.
	   The efforts to sell Ionian Bank is an important test of the
Socialist government's resolve to reform the banking sector and
bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   ``The meeting has been called off,'' said Yannis Apostolidis,
president of Commercial Bank, the state-owned bank that controls
Ionian.
	   It was not immediately known when the meeting will be held. Law
requires that it take place within 20 days.

Friday but posed no further danger, a news agency reported.

lightning. By Thursday morning, munitions explosions set off by the

Swiss commercial banks offer maximum dlrs 600 million for settlement 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks announced Friday they are prepared to offer a
maximum of dlrs 600 million in a ``global settlement'' of claims by
Holocaust victims.
	   The announcement by Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union
Bank of Switzerland marked the first time the banks have named a
figure for a possible settlement.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' the banks
said in a joint statement.
	   However, they warned that through repeated violations of a
court-ordered confidentiality agreement, ``the World Jewish
Congress and the plaintiffs' lawyers are seriously jeopardizing the
settlement negotiations.''
	   Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland
are negotiating with Jewish organizations and lawyers for
class-action claimants on a settlement.
	   They met June 5 with lawyers for Holocaust survivors amid
reports the banks would offer more than dlrs 1 billion to settle
claims they stole assets from dormant wartime accounts. Edward
Fagan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, had said dlrs 1 billion
might not satisfy some claimants.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks when the Nazis were gaining power in Europe.
	   Plaintiffs, however, say bank officials stonewalled survivors
and their heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find
accounts or demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving
funds to relatives of those who died in concentration camps.

Eds: UPDATES with scene in Elton on Friday
By ROBIN ESTRIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ It was a drama that riveted millions: A
baby's death, a murder conviction, a surprise reprieve, and an
agonizing wait for an appeal verdict.
	   But the final act unwound quietly as au pair Louise Woodward
returned Thursday to her home and a life that was forever changed.
	   Ms. Woodward's many supporters here wished her and the northern
England village a return to normalcy after her conviction for the
death of the 8-month-old Massachusetts boy in her care. It wouldn't
be easy.
	   Ms. Woodward herself said her life couldn't be the same.
	   ``Of course, not. How could it be?'' she told hundreds of
reporters in her first public comments since the saga began 16
months ago.
	   On Friday morning, the town of Elton was beginning to look again
like a sleepy northern English village. Only a handful of
journalists remained from the hundreds who descended here this
week. Villagers went about their routines, buying pastries and
groceries _ and newspapers which still had Louise Woodward on the
front pages
	   David Smith spent part of the morning taking down the yellow
``welcome home'' ribbons that had covered trees near the Rigger
pub, the unofficial gathering spot for Ms. Woodward's supporters.
	   ``It's over with,'' he said, as he carried a handful of crumpled
ribbons to the trash bin. ``It needs to be back to normal.''
	   Ms. Woodward's return to Britain followed Tuesday's decision by
Massachusetts' highest court that a lower court judge acted within
his power when he reduced her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served since
her arrest.

Media watchdog criticizes Jordanian draft press law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Legislation that bans coverage considered
disparaging of Jordan's royal family and censors foreign newspapers
will undermine freedom of the press, a media watchdog group said.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it met
Jordan's ambassador to Washington to ``express its deep concern
over the government's restrictive draft press legislation.''
	   It ``poses a grave threat to press freedom in Jordan,'' the
group said in a statement received Friday.
	   The legislation, which was sent to Parliament this week for
endorsement, allows the government to censor foreign newspapers and
close foreign and local publications for violations.
	   It stipulates hefty fines on local and foreign media for
violating vaguely defined provisions of state security and
financial stability. It calls for high capital requirements for
media enterprises, which could force many papers to close down.
	   It also imposes a ban on coverage considered disparaging to the
royal family, the armed forces, heads of state and on reporting of
investigations or trials taking place in Jordan.
	   The government says the legislation will control a freewheeling
media that is often irresponsible.
	   In particular, King Hussein has criticized Jordan's 22 weekly
tabloids, many of which are affiliated with Muslim fundamentalist
and leftist groups opposed to his pro-western style and the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.

Newspaper mock referendum: two-thirds favor West Bank withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a mock referendum involving 50,000 newspaper
readers, two-thirds supported a withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank, as proposed by the United States, the Maariv daily said
Friday.
	   Maariv's editor, Yaakov Erez, wrote in a front-page editorial
that he hoped the results would prod Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to carry out the pullback immediately.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately
available for comment.
	   Far-right coalition partners and the Jewish settlement movement
have threatened to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government if he goes ahead with the withdrawal which would leave
40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control.
	   The United States has urged Netanyahu to make a quick decision
on the plan that was first submitted in January and has been
accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Maariv reported earlier this week that U.S. President Bill
Clinton has given Netanyahu until Wednesday to decide.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he was considering the idea of holding a
referendum on a pullback, a move that would cause further delays,
but effectively silence those trying to prevent it.
	   According to Maariv, 63 percent of 50,607 respondents favored a
troop withdrawal, while 37 percent opposed it. Erez said the sample
was not representative, but that the results were similar to those
in recent opinion polls.
	   In addition to its mock referendum, Maariv published a
representative Gallup poll conducted among 500 Israeli Jews, with
57 percent in favor of a withdrawal and 31 percent opposed. The
survey had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
	   The poll indicated that 67 percents favored holding a referendum
on a withdrawal, and that 28 percent were opposed.

Media watchdog criticizes Jordanian draft press law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Legislation that bans coverage considered
disparaging of Jordan's royal family and censors foreign newspapers
will undermine freedom of the press, a media watchdog group said.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it met
Jordan's ambassador to Washington to ``express its deep concern
over the government's restrictive draft press legislation.''
	   It ``poses a grave threat to press freedom in Jordan,'' the
group said in a statement received Friday.
	   The legislation, which was sent to Parliament this week for
endorsement, lets the government censor foreign newspapers and
close foreign and local publications for violations.
	   It stipulates hefty fines on local and foreign media for
violating vaguely defined provisions of state security and
financial stability. It calls for high capital requirements for
media enterprises, which could force many papers to close down.
	   It also imposes a ban on coverage considered disparaging to the
royal family, the armed forces, heads of state and on reporting of
investigations or trials taking place in Jordan.
	   The government says the legislation will control a freewheeling
media that is often irresponsible.
	   In particular, King Hussein has criticized Jordan's 22 weekly
tabloids, many of which are affiliated with Muslim fundamentalist
and leftist groups opposed to his pro-western style and the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.

Soccer championship enthralls its global followers AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only religions. For the faithful, it is a way of life, a solace for
the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for holy war. And the
heavy gold cup is its holy grail.
	   Nagayuki Miyara, a Tokyo salesman, stood outside Toulouse
stadium clutching what seemed to be the things dearest to him: his
wife, Midori, and two tickets to Japan's opening game with
Argentina.
	   ``Japan is going to win for sure,'' he pronounced, clearly
convinced, although oddsmakers had easily predicted Argentina's
victory. ``I'm here to see my team play.''
	   Nearby, Ruben Carpio, watched for scalpers. A businessman from
Cordoba, he came without tickets, hoping for the best. Asked why,
he seemed surprised at the question. ``Because,'' he explained,
``I'm from Argentina.''
	   As a rule, soccer fans are seldom more specific. Their passions
range from patriotism to puppy love. Handsome, dashing players are
heart throbs. Teams draped in national colors fight surrogate wars
with traditional rivals. Honor hangs in the balance.
	   When the United States and Iran, long at political loggerheads,
play Saturday in Lyon, the larger implications are obvious enough.
Scotland plays as Scotland, not some element of Great Britain. On
the soccer field, nations like Bulgaria and Paraguay share center
stage with the heavyweights of global power politics.
	   Nigeria lives under military rule and its image is tarnished by
crime and corruption. But it shows another side when the Super
Eagles take the field.
	   For no small number, the thrill is the sport itself. Soccer is a
complex structure of strategy, skill and stamina, with elements of
ballet, chess and bar fights.
	   But Michel Aubert, a town planner in Montelimar and one of 60
million Frenchmen playing host to this year's World Cup, has a
simpler explanation.
	   ``They're crazy,'' he said, ``We need an asylum big enough for
80,000 people.'' That is the capacity of the new
half-billion-dollar Stade de France on the edge of Paris. ``Soccer
fans prove that some things simply have no explanation.''
	   Aubert's expressed belief, of course, did not stop him from
sprinting toward his television set at the first strains of La
Marseillaise so he could watch France mop up Saudi Arabia by a
score he had accurately predicted before kickoff: 4-0.
	   In fact, he has seen almost every other game so far during the
opening round, and he knows by name the best players on all 32
teams.
	   Enthusiasm ignores the odds. Austria is not likely to get far in
the World Cup. But in the Saint-Etienne stadium, Austrians tied the
score with Chile in the last minute of play. Fans bellowed cheers
and anthems for 30 minutes, long after everyone else went home.
	   The 1-1 tie might still put Chile into the Round of 16, which is
the best that realistic fans are hoping for.
	   ``I'm here to cheer for my country,'' explained Janila Sanchez
Gutierrez, who had brought her 7-year-old daughter to the game. She
wore a puffy three-cornered jester's hat in Chilean blue, red and
white.
	   Though Chilean, she lives in France, and she bought tickets
through normal channels. She only had to put her phone on redial,
making five tries a minute for a week until she finally got
through.
	   Juan Correa, 35, a waiter, and his 43-year-old friend, Bernando
Mella, a welder, scraped together their savings for the trip from
Chile to the middle of France.
	   ``I think we'll make it to the next round, probably no
further,'' Correa said, and Mella's nodded his agreement.
	   Asked if watching only a few early games was worth the trip, the
men looked at each other as if wondering about the sanity of the
reporter who put the question to them.
	   After a moment, they chimed in unison: ``Of course.''

South Korean media watchdog accuses spy agency of media control 
</HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A press union federation accused the
government of President Kim Dae-jung on Friday of trying to control
the news media despite his promise of democratic reforms.
	   The government's chief intelligence agency is still running a
``media task team,'' with agents assigned to gather information
from each newspaper and television station, the federation said.
	   ``The existence of the media team shows that the government,
under Kim Dae-jung, still targets the media for controlling,'' said
Media Today, a weekly organ of the press union group.
	   The Agency for National Security Planning, once known as the
Korean Central Intelligence Agency, long served as a tool of
repression for the country's past military dictators.
	   Kim, himself once a target of torture and surveillance by
government agents, vowed to clean up the agency. One of his
government's first acts this year was to indict the agency's top
officials on charges of illegal involvement in politics. Dozens of
supposedly tainted agents were fired.
	   The agency acknowledged that its agents were gathering
information from journalists but said its activity had nothing to
do with media control.
	   ``As the supreme government intelligence organization, our
agency should have no limit to its information gathering
activities. The media is no sanctuary,'' said an agency spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``There is no media control, and there should be none,'' he
said.
	   The spokesman said his agency was especially concerned about
what he called increasing attempts by communist North Korea to
infiltrate the South Korean news media.
	   Only last week, the spy agency admitted for the first time that
it runs Naewoe Press, South Korea's only news agency allowed to
monitor North Korean news media.
	   Naewoe Press has often been quoted by local and international
news organizations as an authoritative source on the inner workings
of North Korea's secretive government.
	   South Korea's past military regimes often used the spy agency to
control the news media. In the early 1980s, the government of
strongman Chun Doo-hwan even sent out daily ``guidelines,''
virtually dictating to the news media what it could and could not
report.
	   President Kim, then an opposition leader, condemned the practice
and called for media freedom.

Newspaper mock referendum: two-thirds favor West Bank withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a mock referendum involving 50,000 newspaper
readers, two-thirds supported a withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank, as proposed by the United States, the Maariv daily said
Friday.
	   Maariv's editor, Yaakov Erez, wrote in a front-page editorial
that he hoped the results would prod Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to carry out the pullback immediately.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately
available for comment.

Sudan accuses Eritrea of attacking border posts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has accused Eritrea of attacking
seven border posts with artillery and tanks, the latest skirmish
between two neighbors with increasingly uneasy relations.
	   Eritrean officials could not be reached for comment. But the
report comes amid a nearly six-week border conflict between Eritrea
and Ethiopia that has cost hundreds of lives.
	   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have severed ties with Sudan, and each
has accused the other of harboring rebels. Sudan has accused
Eritrea in the past of taking part in rebel attacks.
	   Eritrean forces Thursday carried out ``an intensive shelling of
seven border points using all sorts of heavy artillery and tanks,''
the Sudanese armed forces said in a statement broadcast on
state-run television Thursday night.
	   The statement said Sudanese forces repulsed the attack, killing
an undisclosed number of Eritrean soldiers and seizing artillery,
ammunition and food. It did not say where the clash occurred.
	   The independent Sudanese daily Akhbar Al-Youm said in a dispatch
from the region that Eritrean forces shelled a ``number of
inhabited villages on the border.''
	   The newspaper said children and civilians were killed, but it
did not provide numbers.

S.E. Asian environment ministers outline action against fires, haze

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations outlined a plan Friday
to catch haze-causing wildfires more quickly with aerial
surveillance, clearer satellite photos and international aid for
fuel and training.
	   It's an expensive plan, ``but it's much more expensive to fight
fires that are out of control,'' Singapore's environment minister
Yeo Cheow Tong told reporters.
	   The one-day meeting was aimed at avoiding a repeat of last
year's costly fires and cross-border haze pollution, which
blanketed the region in smoke, causing widespread health problems
and hobbling transportation.
	   ``A repeat of this disaster will surely aggravate the already
bad regional economic situation,'' Yeo told fellow ministers and
officials from the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, or ASEAN.
	   Conservative estimates say last year's disaster cost about dlrs
4.5 billion, not counting the loss of human and animal life, plus
the continuing disturbance of tourism, health costs and damage to
forests up until May this year from the lingering rain forest fires
on Borneo.
	   The United Nations Environment Program is coordinating donor
countries toward a target of dlrs 10 million to help prevent new
fires and put out existing ones. Some are taking a wait-and-see
attitude, because of recent rains.
	   Underground peat and coal seam fires, the most difficult to
extinguish, are still burning. The United States has committed part
of its dlrs 6 million in anti-fire aid money to focus on those
unique types of fires, and American experts are heading into the
region now to assess them and give advice, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, new hot spots have been detected in central Sumatra,
resulting in some haze drifting over Singapore.
	   The new Indonesian government, which has made forest
fire-fighting its second priority after food, is doing all it can
to quickly put out the Sumatran fires before they spread, an
Indonesian official told reporters.
	   ``For sure, it's not enough,'' said Effendy A. Sumardja,
assistant minister for environment coordination. ``That's the
reason why we need the support.'' He said the government had
allocated dlrs 4 million to fire fighting this year ``but it isn't
enough.''
	   Within two weeks, he said, Indonesia plans to provide four
military planes, and civilian and military personnel, for aerial
surveillance in four provinces.
	   The satellite photos now in use are not detailed enough to spot
fires when they first break out. Better pictures will cost more.
	   About 80 percent of the fires that burned agricultural land,
grassland and rain forest in Indonesia since last year are blamed
on large landowners who illegally use fire to clear away unwanted
vegetation. But it is often hard to prove who set the fire, said
Yeo.
	   In Indonesia, legal cases have begun against two landowners as a
result of last year's fires, said Sumardja.

Trading in Long Term Credit Bank suspended after downgrade grafs 3-4, 19-20. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments from a Finance Ministry official in
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Friday after a
downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked frantic selling.
	   The exchange also halted trading of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
following a news report the government is considering a bailout
that would merge it with struggling LCTB.
	   A senior Finance Ministry official said late Friday the
government hadn't considered a merger of the two banks or heard
from either bank about a merger plan. LTCB also said it was not
considering a merger.
	   The Finance Ministry also tried to allay fears the bank was in
trouble.
	   ``The LTCB has a concrete financing plan for the coming month,
and the ministry doesn't see any problems after that,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Shares of LTCB went into a nose dive after the downgrade,
dropping below the psychologically important 100-yen (73 U.S.
cents) line for the first time since its stock was listed.
	   The downgrade and subsequent plunge in stock prices were eerily
similar to events that preceded the November collapse of Yamaichi
Securities Co., the largest business failure in Japanese history.
	   LTCB's tribulations strike as Japan is trying to convince the
world it is serious about cleaning up its financial system, even if
that means letting weaker companies fold.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers arrived in Tokyo
on Thursday for talks with Japanese leaders about their efforts to
clean up an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad
loans.
	   LTCB announced problem loans worth 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10
billion) in March. Most of those were made to property buyers
during the land price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   An LTCB spokesman called the move unfortunate and said he
couldn't understand what prompted Moody's downgrade. He said the
bank would try to convince the U.S.-based agency to reverse its
rating.
	   Moody's on Thursday lowered LTCB's subordinate debt rating to B1
from Ba1. Share prices dropped as much as 25 percent to 94 yen
before the Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading at 112 yen, down 14
yen.
	   The share price of LTCB, Japan's second largest credit bank,
peaked in April 1987 at 2,820 yen.
	   A downgrade can be a death blow to a credit bank like LTCB,
which must raise funds on debt markets instead of from customer
deposits, like regular commercial banks.
	   Credit banks played a key role in rebuilding Japan's economy
after World War Two by supplying industry with cheap, long-term
credit. But as deregulation has allowed more companies to raise
money directly from financial markets, the banks have had
difficulty finding a new role.
	   LTCB's shares have lost about 40 percent of their value this
week alone on rumors that the bank was struggling to stay afloat.
	   The exchange also suspended trading of Nippon Credit Bank after
an unsourced article by Kyodo News said the government may engineer
a merger with LTCB.
	   In the past, Japan has dealt with bankruptcies by forcing the
struggling company to merge with a rival. But Japan is now under
pressure both at home and abroad to give freer rein to market
forces and let competition weed out weaker institutions.
	   The finance ministry official said the ministry won't coordinate
bank mergers, saying any such steps should be taken by private
companies.
	   ``In a deregulated financial environment, the ministry is not in
a position to tell them to merge or tie up with some other banks,''
he said.
	   Nippon Credit Bank's shares were up 10 yen at 135 yen.

Newspaper mock referendum: two-thirds favor West Bank withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment by Netanyahu adviser
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a mock referendum involving 50,000 newspaper
readers, two-thirds supported a withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank, as proposed by the United States, the Maariv daily said
Friday.
	   Maariv's editor, Yaakov Erez, wrote in a front-page editorial
that he hoped the results would prod Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to carry out the pullback immediately.
	   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the mock
referendum was ``completely unscientific'' and that it would not
influence the prime minister's decision.
	   Bar-Illan said a real referendum on a withdrawal is ``being
considered seriously'' by the prime minister, but that a final
decision has not yet been made.
	   Far-right coalition partners and the Jewish settlement movement
have threatened to topple Netanyahu's government if he goes ahead
with the withdrawal which would leave 40 percent of the West Bank
under Palestinian control.

Swiss commercial banks offer maximum dlrs 600 million for settlement settlement; RESTORES reference to Jewish groups' estimate banks hold billions; ADDS byline

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks announced Friday they are prepared to offer a
maximum of dlrs 600 million in a ``global settlement'' of claims by
Holocaust victims.
	   The announcement by Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union
Bank of Switzerland marked the first time the banks have specified
a figure for a possible settlement.
	   The dlrs 600 million, they said, would include dlrs 70 million
already paid into a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' the banks
said in their joint statement.
	   The three banks urged the plaintiffs to accept the offer ``so
that money can immediately be distributed to Holocaust survivors
and heirs of Holocaust victims.''
	   However, the statement warned that through repeated violations
of a court-ordered confidentiality agreement, ``the World Jewish
Congress and the plaintiffs' lawyers are seriously jeopardizing the
settlement negotiations.''
	   The three banks are negotiating with Jewish organizations and
lawyers for class-action claimants on a settlement.
	   They met June 5 with lawyers for Holocaust survivors amid
reports the banks would offer more than dlrs 1 billion to settle
claims they stole assets from dormant wartime accounts. Edward
Fagan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, had said dlrs 1 billion
might not satisfy some claimants.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks when the Nazis were gaining power in Europe. Jewish groups
estimate the banks still hold billions of dollars in dormant
wartime accounts.
	   Plaintiffs, however, say bank officials stonewalled survivors
and their heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find
accounts or demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving
funds to relatives of those who died in concentration camps.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With World Cup ticket scandals widening, the head
of the world soccer federation is threatening disciplinary action
and wants to rethink the sales process before the next time around.
	   FIFA president Joseph Blatter spoke Thursday as two more
incidents surfaced _ the theft of thousands of tickets from an
agency under investigation, and reports that at least some phone-in
ticket sales were rigged.
	   ``This whole World Cup ticketing operation must be reviewed for
the next time, in 2002,'' Blatter said on France Info radio. ``But
we need to take action now.''
	   Black-market sales, including some by national federations who
sell off their surplus tickets, are ``something that shocks us,''
Blatter said. ``Our disciplinary commission has the power to
intervene and even ... to sanction them.''
	   In the latest development, an American travel agency said that
nearly 15,000 World Cup tickets and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash were stolen from its Paris office.
	   Prime Sport International offered a ``no questions asked
reward'' of 1 million francs _ about $160,000 _ to recover the
tickets that were stolen overnight. It also promised to reimburse
buyers of undelivered tickets.
	   But World Cup organizers said they had questions about the
reported theft. Spokesman Bruno Travade said Friday that the
committee was still waiting after two requests for PSI to identify
who had purchased the tickets and give their match and seat
numbers.
	   Travade also said that _ while PSI listed an undetermined number
of tickets for Thursday night's France-South Africa match among
those stolen _ a check at the Stade de France found the seats
``duly occupied by spectators.'' He said the organizers had not
received any complaints from people who purchased tickets and did
not receive them from PSI.
	   ``It is PSI that says it (the tickets) has been stolen,''
Travade said.
	   PSI officials were not immediately available for comment on the
committee's statements.
	   Travade also said that the organizers had filed a complaint with
prosecutors against ISL France, the first step toward seeking
damages in connection with a ticket fraud case involving a
consultant to the marketing company.
	   ``We can't accept that anyone casts aspersions on the very
thorough work of the CFO (organizing committee) in the preparations
for the World Cup,'' the spokesman said.
	   It was not clear why PSI had such a stockpile of tickets.
Judicial sources said on customary anonymity that the agency was
under investigation after a Madrid travel agency complained it
never received more than 1,000 tickets it bought from PSI.
	   Along with the tickets, the thieves made off with $550,000 in
cash, the company said in a statement.
	   Police sources said the burglars also took access badges to get
into the Stade de France, the main World Cup venue just north of
Paris.
	   France Telecom, the country's main telephone company, was
investigating a report that one of its workers leaked a phone
number that allowed thousands of World Cup tickets to be bought
unfairly.
	   The tickets were among the 170,000 sold by the World Cup
organizing committee, CFO, on a first-come, first-served basis from
April 22 through May 8.
	   The CFO switchboard was so swamped that most callers had to dial
more than 500 times before getting through. But a France Telecom
worker gave a friend a special number that allowed direct access to
the switchboard, the daily Le Parisien reported.
	   The CFO said it would file legal charges if necessary.
	   The revelations came a day after three people _ including the
president of the French affiliate of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's
exclusive marketing partner _ were arrested in a separate
investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

Swiss commercial banks offer maximum dlrs 600 million for settlement 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS with background, context, adds byline.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks Friday offered dlrs 600 million in a ``global
settlement'' of claims by Holocaust victims.
	   In Israel a spokesman for the World Jewish Restitution
Organization immediately rejected the offer to settle claims for
money allegedly stolen from dormant accounts opened before the end
of World War II.
	   ``The Swiss banks know that the amounts they are discussing are
offensive and if we were not dealing with such a tragic story, this
would be laughable,'' Yoram Dori told The Associated Press.
	   The banks issued a statement saying they were breaking their
silence on two months of negotiations because the other side had
repeatedly violated a confidentiality agreement.
	   ``The World Jewish Congress and the plaintiffs' lawyers are
seriously jeopardizing the settlement negotiations,'' being held
under the auspices of U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat.
	   Recent reports from New York citing sources close to the talks
have said the banks _ Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse _ were offering dlrs 1 billion or more.
	   The banks have been negotiating the settlement since last April
with Jewish organizations and lawyers for claimants in a
multi-billion-dollar suit filed in New York.
	   ``The court-ordered confidentiality agreement that was signed by
all parties to the negotiations is being repeatedly violated,'' the
banks said.
	   The banks' statement ``expressed continued interest to reach a
fair settlement.''
	   The dlrs 600 million sum _ termed the ``rough justice'' amount _
would include dlrs 70 million already paid into a Swiss fund to
help needy Holocaust survivors, said the statement.
	   World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman said late last
year that Switzerland should be paying billions of dollars in
restitution to settle Jewish claims for missing assets of victims
killed by the Nazis.
	   Edward Fagan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, has said dlrs 1
billion might not satisfy some claimants.
	   Jewish organizations say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks when the Nazis were gaining power in
Europe.
	   Plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their
heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or
demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to
relatives of those who died in concentration camps.
	   ``The banks urge that this offer be accepted so that money can
immediately be distributed to Holocaust survivors and heirs of
Holocaust victims,'' the banks' statement said.
	   The State Department-sponsored negotiations have been conducted
under tight secrecy. Friday's statement is the first time the banks
have named a figure for a possible settlement.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' they said.
``The banks view this offer to be at the upper limit of what can be
justified, based on the facts and circumstances.''
	   The banks said they ``would not entertain unfounded and
excessive payments above this amount.''
	   Credit Suisse spokesman Ulrich Pfister confirmed that this is
the offer currently on the table.
	   ``As all these figures have been made public and sometimes
presented in a distorted way, we had a duty to set out our offer,''
Pfister said.
	   The Swiss government's task force addressing the country's
wartime past declined to comment on the banks' statement.
	   Spokeswoman Marie-Marceline Kurmann said the Swiss government,
which is not a party to the negotiations, had been informed of the
offer.

Air Tanzania to pull out of African Joint Air Services 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Air Tanzania Corporation, which
owns the East African nation's flag carrier Air Tanzania, is to
pull out of the African Joint Air Services, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The AJAS, which operates Alliance Air, is jointly owned by Air
Tanzania, Uganda Airlines and South African Airways.
	   Alliance Air operates flights between London and Johannesburg
with stopovers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Entebbe, Uganda.
	   The Guardian, an independent newspaper, quoted an unidentified
Air Tanzania official as saying the Tanzanians are unhappy with
AJAS's accumulated loss expected to amount to dlrs 30 million by
next June.
	   ATC board chairman Abbas Sykes told company employees it is in
the interest of both the airline and the government to pull out of
the ailing venture, the newspaper said.
	   It said Air Tanzania Corporation management will notify its
partners of the decision June 30 and will pull out all together
after 12 months, as required by the agreement with the other
partners.
	   Air Tanzania Corporation owns 10 percent of the AJAS, which is
expected to lose dlrs 9.1 million in the current financial year
which ends June 30.

Yeltsin: Russia doesn't need Western money, only trust won't seek third term. Trims.

	   KOSTROMA, Russia (AP) _ Two days after he reappointed a leading
free-market reformer to the government to negotiate aid from the
West, President Boris Yeltsin proclaimed on Friday that Russia
needed only moral support to stabilize its markets.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the reformer Yeltsin reappointed, said Thursday
that Russia needed dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in financial aid
to ease the financial crisis.
	   However, Yeltsin insisted Friday that just a vote of confidence
from international financial organizations would suffice to keep
foreign investors in Russia and save markets from collapsing.
	   ``What we really need is not their money, but their trust,''
Yeltsin said during a visit to the central Russian region of
Kostroma.
	   Russian officials had been offering this view since the
financial crisis began late last month _ until they finally caved
in and acknowledged that more material assistance was in order.
	   ``The situation is very grave, but we are holding out,'' he told
reporters upon arrival in Kostroma. ``Even such a strong country as
Japan has been gripped by a crisis, but we are holding out.''
	   Yeltsin also praised the new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko for keeping the national currency, the ruble,
stable. The markets' fall has prompted fears of a currency
devaluation, which could lead to a sharp rise in prices.
	   Yeltsin said he had decided to visit Kostroma, located about 320
kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Moscow, because it is
experiencing troubles typical of all of central Russia, Yeltsin
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   In keeping with his tradition, Yeltsin ordered a money transfer
to Kostroma as his visit began.
	   Some 14 million rubles (dlrs 2.7 million) to cover pension debts
were transferred to the region on Friday, and 31 million rubles
(dlrs 5.2 million) more were to be allocated within the next few
days to pay wage arrears, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Pot-holed roads in Kostroma have been newly paved ahead of
Yeltsin's visit _ leading residents to complain that all the
region's money ``has gone into asphalt.''
	   ``We don't have enough money to pay wages and pensions, but
these are temporary difficulties,'' Yeltsin said upon arrival.
	   He told students at a agricultural academy that he would not
seek a third term because ``the Constitution would not permit
that.''
	   Though Yeltsin has repeatedly denied that he would run for
president, his aides have kept speculation alive by hinting that
the 67-year-old leader may run again, and a case to decide whether
Yeltsin can run again is still pending in the Constitutional Court.
	   Yeltsin visited Kostroma's Ipatiyev monastery, where in 1613 the
leaders of Russian aristocracy gathered to elect Mikhail Romanov as
the nation's czar. He was also to visit several enterprises.

Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia watch Kosovo, brace for trouble 
</HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ON THE MACEDONIA-YUGOSLAV BORDER (AP) _ For now, the attacks on
ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province haven't spilled
over the border into the nation of Macedonia.
	   But the Kosovo fighting is kindling fear and bravado among
Macedonia's 550,000 ethnic Albanians, a quarter of the total
population.
	   ``We are afraid,'' says Vahid Azizi, a 28-year-old ethnic
Albanian. ``If the situation comes to arming villagers, we'll do
it. We have nowhere to run.''
	   Locals say the rising death toll in Kosovo could turn mistrust
between ethnic Albanians and Macedonians into bloodshed as well.
Macedonians have the same ethnic roots as Serbs.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since late February in
the campaign by Yugoslavia's Serb-led security forces against
ethnic Albanian militants. Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in
1991.
	   In Macedonia's west, which is 75 percent Albanian, lookout
towers for a 750-member U.N. force dot the border and the
Macedonian military watches for tension. American soldiers make up
nearly half the U.N. force.
	   Western diplomats describe a worst-case scenario as a flood of
refugees from Kosovo swelling Macedonia's Albanian population and
moving residents to violence. So far, only a few Kosovars, mostly
visiting relatives, have arrived.
	   Although more than 30 percent of Albanians are unemployed, many
Macedonians say they have scores of relatives in the West who
finance the expensive mosques and parks that distinguish Albanian
towns. Border police accuse the ethnic Albanians of using these
international contacts for smuggling.
	   Albanians settled Macedonia's west in waves of immigration that
started a century ago and peaked in the 1980s.
	   They are prohibited from legal university studies in the
Albanian language and complain of police harassment. Many don't
have citizenship due to complex Macedonian law that requires at
least 15 years of waiting and bureaucracy.
	   Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, with five of the 19 state
ministers and ten of the 120 members of parliament, are likely the
best represented in the Balkans.
	   But Alajdin Demiri, the ethnic Albanian mayor of Tetovo, whose
200,000 inhabitants form the unofficial capital of Albanian
Macedonia, say the fight for rights is uphill.
	   ``The Macedonians have the majority, and they can vote whatever
they want,'' he said.
	   Albanian rights are expected to take the fore in October
parliamentary elections. Parties that oppose greater Albanian
rights could increase their hold on parliament.
	   ``If the political option for greater rights is not accepted, we
will have to eliminate it,'' said Demiri. ``The groups who come
after us would be really radical.''
	   Demiri will leave local politics Wednesday when he begins a
two-year prison sentence. Amid loud local protest, courts recently
convicted him of refusing to display the Macedonian flag beside the
Albanian flag outside his office.

World Cup: Bergkamp back, Kluivert out as Dutch take on South Korea 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ The Dutch have lost a starting striker and
regained one since last Saturday's frustrating 0-0 draw with
Belgium. But it could be a third frontman who decides this
Saturday's tie, against Group E minnow South Korea.
	   Fully recovered from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for
six weeks, Dennis Bergkamp is an almost certain starter.
	   Patrick Kluivert, sent off against Belgium for elbowing defender
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest, will miss the match as he serves the
first half of a two-game suspension.
	   But Dutch coach Guus Hiddink believes that Nottingham Forest
striker Pierre van Hooijdonk could come off the bench to score
against the well-organized, defensive-minded Koreans.
	   ``The Koreans have a very high work rate, but they get tired
late in games. That is the time to send in a new weapon,'' Hiddink
said in a clear reference to Van Hooijdonk, who the Dutch use as a
late ``super sub'' to break down tired defenses.
	   The Koreans have not won a World Cup finals match in 11 attempts
and coach Cha Bum-kun isn't holding out much hope of ending the
losing streak in Marseille's Stade Velodrome.
	   ``Our chances now are very, very slim,'' Cha said. ``Maybe we
can hold out for a 0-0 draw with Holland and can go all out against
Belgium for a win.''
	   Mexico, which takes on Belgium later Saturday, stands atop Group
E after beating South Korea 3-1. The Netherlands and Belgium both
have one point.
	   Hiddink is planning to use wide midfielders on both flanks to
exploit the one weak link in the Korean defense. ``The flanks is
where the Koreans leave room,'' he said. ``That is where we can be
creative.''
	   Hiddink's problem is that both his specialist wide men _
Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars _ favor the left.
	   For Zenden, who moves from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona next
season, a trip to the right flank would be a journey into the
unknown. ``I can't remember the last time I played there,'' he
said.
	   Overmars plays on the right more regularly but is far more
effective from the left.
	   South Korea also is lacking firepower; its goal scorer in the
opening match Ha Seok-ju was sent off in the 30th minute for a
tackle from behind and is suspended Saturday.
	   Also out is Korea's top scorer Hwang Sun-hong, who has a knee
injury. Hwang has scored 45 times in 79 internationals.
	   But Cha, who played for South Korea at the 1986 Mexico World Cup
finals and twice won the UEFA cup with German teams during his
playing career, said his remaining players will do their best
against the fancied Dutch.
	   ``We will take it as though it is our last chance and play our
very best match,'' he said.
	   Hiddink also is not allowing his players any room for
complacency. He noted that the South Koreans are quick and will
require a focused effort.
	   ``But I think we can do something against them in the final
phase. We know that they get tired late on,'' the coach said.
	   That's when Van Hooijdonk will likely make his entrance.
	   ``He seems to need to feel like he is saving the fatherland,''
Hiddink said of his reasons for keeping the lanky striker on the
bench.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut it, as it did the main
east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of Serb
forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) reponse to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling them ``small groups of people fighting to
protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which has thrown its support behind the more
moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Meanwhile, there was more evidence in the Serbian capital
Belgrade that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing
support for his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of parents of Serb soldiers serving in the explosive
province protested for a second day Friday, blocking traffic in
front of army headquarters to demand their sons be brought home.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant KLA fighters since the authorities launched a
crackdown on the last day of February.
	   Six Yugoslav army soldiers have been killed in the past month
and a half, a sign that the army _ mostly engaged in fierce duels
with guerrilla groups alongside the porous Kosovo-Albania border,
is having casualties, too.
	   One army recruit, a 20-year-old from southern Serbia, was
reported killed in an ambush by the KLA Wednesday, was to be buried
Friday in his native village of Spancevac, in a region just east of
Kosovo.

Myanmar dissident welcomes guests at 53rd birthday 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
celebrating her 53rd birthday on Friday, was allowed the rare treat
of a home more-or-less open to visitors.
	   Mrs. Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, usually
has her visitors carefully screened by the government, which is
keen to restrict her political activities. The general public is
kept well away.
	   Last year Mrs. Suu Kyi held only a small private birthday
celebration at her home, limited to about 10-15 close associates.
Party members, other than the top leadership, were not allowed into
her compound. They were forced to leave presents at the party's
headquarters, where they were met by other league officials but not
Suu Kyi.
	   This year many members of her party, many wearing the party
uniform of peach-colored jackets and traditional sarongs, could be
seen entering her lakeside home in the capital after showing
identification to state security agents outside her front gate.
	   Those making a visit had to give their names in advance, but
otherwise were not harassed. Diplomats were also expected to
attend.
	   Party officials said Suu Kyi held a private religious ceremony
as well Friday, offering food and other necessities to Buddhist
monks.

Danes in shock after referee expels three from World Cup match vs. S. Africa 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The referee who handed out three red
cards during the Denmark-South Africa World Cup soccer match the
day before was a ``whistling insanity'' who left local fans in a
``red shock,'' Danish news media commented Friday.
	   ``Dumb, 'dommer' (Danish for referee), dumbest,'' the B.T. daily
said about John Jairo Toro of Coloombia, who sent off two Danish
and one South African for faults which Danish media didn't believe
merited expulsion.
	   The respected Politiken daily said Toro gave ``the most
miserable referee performance in Danish soccer history.'' Toro
``whistled and tore cards out of his pockets _ three red and seven
yellow cards _ as if he was The Law in person in some violent
American movie.''
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. Then Toro
showed the red card to South African substitute Alfred Phiri two
minutes later for elbowing aside Thomas Helveg.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping Benni McCarthy from behind and knocking him
down.
	   A Danish radio sports reporter said Toro had been ``too
zealous'' about applying FIFA's new guideline after FIFA president
Joseph Blatter had complained that referees were too lax. The
Ekstra Bladet daily which called Toro ``a jerk'' and ``a scandal
referee,'' said he ``had spoiled the game with his peculiar
expulsions. Hopefully he himself will get the red card.''
	   Sole words of consolation came from Crown Prince Frederik, the
heir to the throne who had traveled to Toulouse, France, to see the
match. ``What a referee. But don't look so down. You'll make it in
Lyons,'' Frederik was quoted as saying by the B.T. daily.
	   The prince was referring to Denmark's next game in this
southeastern French town where they will meet the hosts from
France. Denmark's 1-1 draw with South Africa left them with a good
chance to advance to the second round.

Pope arrives to face Austria's angry and divided Catholics editing.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II began his third visit
to this alpine nation on Friday, arriving this time in the midst of
a crisis in the Austrian Roman Catholic church that critics say is
partly the Vatican's fault.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope was welcomed at Salzburg's Maxglan
airport by President Thomas Klestil and Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna, who has been mentioned as a
possible successor.
	   Also greeting him was Cardinal Franz Koenig, who was in the
conclave that selected the pope in 1978.
	   About 100 spectators, mostly schoolchildren, cheered the pontiff
and held up greeting signs, including one saying ``We are with
you.''
	   A military salute of cannon shots startled the pope, who slowly
moved down the gangway, then used a cane to walk along a red carpet
rolled out in his honor.
	   Speaking from a podium, he mentioned the construction of Europe
``from the Atlantic to the Urals, from the North Sea to the
Mediterranean'' _ a reference to European integration planned in
the years ahead.
	   He lauded Austria, a neutral country of 8 million people, as ``a
mirror and model for a united Europe, which does not marginalize
but has room for all.''
	   In his welcome address, Klestil recalled with ``gratitude and
admiration'' how much the pope had ``contributed to overcoming
Europe's partition and to the liberation of our neighbors in the
East from the slavery of a totalitarian (communist) regime.''
	   Only a small number of people lined the route on which the pope
was driven into downtown Salzburg, a center of European culture.
	   Many Austrian Catholics have been annoyed with the Vatican in
recent years for its refusal to institute what they consider badly
needed reform.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Austrian Catholics have led a
movement demanding the church drop its requirement that priests be
celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give greater voice to
lay Catholics.
	   The ``We are the Church'' movement gathered a half-million
signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to
the United States. Demonstrations by members of the movement were
expected during the pope's visit.

Sanctions will have little short-term effect, but could backfire in the long run 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES India-Sanctions and Pakistan-Nuclear-Sanctions
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. sanctions meant to prod India and
Pakistan to sheath their nuclear weapons weren't as painful as both
countries feared, but experts warned Friday the measures could
backfire.
	   India denounced the sanctions as a ``coercive'' interference
with free trade, which it called ``unjustified and
counterproductive.''
	   The Pakistan government had no immediate reaction. But a
statement issued hours before the sanctions were published said
Islamabad will pursue its nuclear program however it sees its own
interests and to maintain the balance with India.
	   There was no sign from either country that it would reconsider
its nuclear options, which were hugely expanded after each
conducted a series of underground explosions last month.
	   Elaborating on sanctions announced earlier by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Washington said Thursday it was canceling
non-humanitarian aid to India and Pakistan, suspending delivery of
defense material and dual use items, prohibiting bank loans to the
governments, and blocking new credit guarantees for private loans.
The U.S. State Department estimated the two countries together
would lose dlrs 4 billion in international bank loans.
	   Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called the sanctions ``a
minor roadblock'' toward better U.S.-Indian relations, but said it
was too early to assess the impact. Commerce Minister Ramakrishna
Hegde said trade would not be affected.
	   The U.S. government said it sought to influence India and
Pakistan to put their nuclear programs on hold and refrain from
deploying nuclear-capable missiles. Hegde accused the United States
_ a country which destroyed two cities with atomic bombs, he said _
of ``preaching sermons.''
	   ``These sanctions are less harsh than what we were
anticipating,'' said Pakistani stock broker Farhan Mahmood in
Karachi. ``People feared heavy trade sanctions. That could have
been disastrous.''
	   But Mahbub-ul Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister who now
heads an independent development research center, said tough
sanctions could force Islamabad to sell nuclear technology for
cash. ``There's nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately
poor nation to the economic brink,'' he said.
	   Rajesh Shah, president of the influential Confederation of
Indian Industry, said the sanctions did not go beyond those
mandated by U.S. law, as many had feared. He said the measures
``would adversely affect U.S. exports and jobs,'' and cautioned
India not to retaliate against U.S. companies operating in India
and providing jobs here.
	   The two U.S. companies that would be hit hardest by the denial
of U.S. loan guarantees are Houston-based Enron Corp., which is
building a massive power project in western India, and
Seattle-based Boeing, which is bidding to upgrade Air India's
fleet. Both could raise capital in international financial markets
at marginally higher costs, industrialists said.
	   The sanctions will affect cash-strapped Pakistan more than
India, which has a comfortable reserve of foreign exchange.
Pakistan, which has declared a state of emergency to combat the
sanctions, may default on payments of its dlrs 30 billion foreign
debt if the International Monetary Fund is blocked from extending
future loans, financial analysts have said.
	   The effect on U.S.-funded development programs won't be clear
for several days or weeks, until the government decides which
projects fall into the humanitarian category.
	   One project likely to be axed was a program to help India's
stock market regulators strengthen their watchdog operations _ one
element of the six-year Indian effort to reform an economy riddled
with corruption and inefficiency.

World Cup: Japan seeks life-saving upset against Croatia 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Japan is promising a tough fight against
Croatia on Saturday in a key first-round game for both World Cup
newcomers, and the favored Europeans aren't taking their opponents
lightly.
	   In a clash of styles, the Japanese are betting on speed and
disciplined teamwork to offset Croatia's advantages in individual
technique, physique and international experience.
	   Croatia can virtually clinch its spot in the last 16 by winning
the game at Nantes, while Japan must go for a win to avoid
elimination. Croatia beat Jamaica in their opener, while the
Japanese lost to Argentina.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic, a master at mixing bluster and
demonstrative caution, took Japan's narrow 1-0 loss to group
favorite Argentina as a warning that the Japanese game is gaining
ground.
	   ``I fear this team,'' said Blazevic, who sent one of his
deputies to the game. ``Japan is strong enough to surprise any
other team.''
	   With Croatian midfield director Zvonimir Boban doubtful after
pulling a leg muscle in practice this week, Japan's chances seem to
have improved.
	   Blazevic said Friday he had not yet ruled out fielding the AC
Milan star, whose loss would punch a hole at the heart of Croatia's
game. But he said he was considering replacing him with Croatia
Zagreb's Krunoslav Jurcic, 28, partly because his 1.88-meter (6
feet, 2 inch) stature would add to Croatia's edge on high balls.
	   Japan, which is co-hosting the 2002 World Cup with South Korea,
will go all out to stay alive in the tournament, coach Takeshi
Okada said.
	   ``The chances for it may be low, but we are going to be playing
to win, not to end in a draw,'' he said at the team's camp in
Aix-les-Bains.
	   Japan's biggest problem is the finishing touch in front of the
goal, so Okada is in for some tinkering.
	   ``We definitely have to score,'' team captain Masami Ihara said.
``So we must review both our defense and offense.''
	   Defender Naoki Soma said he believes the Croatian defense has
more holes than Argentina's. Indeed, Croatia conceded 13 goals in
10 games during an unimpressive World Cup qualifying campaign.
	   Japan's chance lies in breaking up the measured pace of
Croatia's one-touch passing game. It's that style which sets up
strikers led by Real Madrid's Davor Suker, who has tallied 31 times
in 36 appearances for his nation, including the third goal in
Croatia's 3-1 opening win over Jamaica.
	   Suker knows that a victory Saturday is the ticket to the second
round.
	   ``If we do our work against Japan, the game with Argentina won't
be too much of a problem,'' he said. ``I am totally confident that
we will make three points.''

Kwasniewski vows to veto administrative divisions approved in upper house 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski vowed
Friday to veto a map of new administrative districts supported by
the Solidarity prime minister and approved in a late-night session
by Poland's upper house.
	   The veto sends Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, on a collision
course with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who has recommended the new
map of 15 provinces to replace the existing 49, a holdover from the
highly bureaucratic communist era.
	   Kwasniewski supports the leftists plan to reduce the number of
provinces to 17.
	   Kwasniewski and Buzek are to meet with the parliament leaders
this week to see if a compromise can be worked out. The pair have
rarely met since Buzek took over as head of the Solidarity-run
government last fall.
	   Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski called the veto pledge
``very bad news'' and said it was a ``step toward blocking the
whole administrative reform.''
	   The bill needs the approval of the lower chamber of parliament
and of the president to take effect.
	   The administrative reform is part of Poland's efforts to get its
laws and procedures in line with European standards for eventual
admission into the European Union.
	   The government initially proposed 12 provinces, but added a few
following protests from cities that would lose their current status
of provincial capital.

Asian stocks fall on profit-taking, pessimism over Japan's economy 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Friday as
investors took profits amid skepticism over whether the Japanese
yen's recent dramatic gains on the U.S. dollar could be sustained.
	   Philippine stocks tumbled, losing much of their advances in the
previous session as investors cashed in on gains amid uncertainties
over the sustainability of the Japanese yen's recovery.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 86.88 points,
or 4.8 percent, closing at 1,741.71. In currency trading, the
dollar averaged 40.898 pesos for the day, up 1.2 percent from
Thursday's 40.425 pesos.
	   The United States and Japan intervened heavily in the currency
market on Wednesday, selling dollars in an effort to stop the slide
of the yen against the U.S. currency.
	   But the momentum of Thursday's surge in the yen stalled Friday.
In late afternoon, the dollar bought 134.97 yen, down 1.91 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
137.83 yen overnight.
	   Investors were also watching U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers' meetings with Japanese officials for clues to
whether Japan will dole out tougher reforms to heal its ailing
economy.
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told Summers Friday that
writing off the pile of bad debts held by Japanese banks is vital
to revitalizing Japan's sagging economy.
	   South Korean shares also closed sharply lower, with the key
index falling 3.8 percent on profit-taking.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
fell 12.23 points to 313.26.
	   Thai shares closed 3.7 lower, but off the day's low after
investors scooped up bargains in finance stocks in late afternoon,
dealers said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slumped 10.83 points
to close at 284.32.
	   Indonesia share prices also closed sharply lower, with key
Composite Index falling 14.640 points, or 3.3 percent, to 425.453.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 93.56 points, or 0.61 percent, closing the week at 15,267.98
points. On Thursday, the average surged 646.16 points, or 4.39
percent, after a dramatic intervention drove the yen higher.
	   For much of Friday's currency trading in Tokyo, the dollar
remained in a narrow range as players avoided from making
significant moves prior to the weekend meeting of deputy finance
ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations.
	   Finance officials from other Asian nations will also attend the
Tokyo meeting to discuss ways of stabilizing local currencies and
economies in the region.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher for a fourth consecutive
session after a late buying spree erased earlier losses. The Hang
Seng Index rose 75.94 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,591.91.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Price Index fell 13.88 points, or 0.17 percent, to
7,754.43.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 56.74 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,975.20.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower as dealers remained
cautious about the Japanese economy. The All Ordinaries Index fell
19.4 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,588.8.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on
profit-taking. The benchmark Composite Index fell 4.21 points, or
0.89 percent, to 467.61.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The benchmark
Straits Times Industrial Index fell 10.48 points, or 0.9 percent,
to to 1,122.93.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA Friday, hundreds Thursday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 15th graf to CORRECT that only about 30 demonstrated
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut it, as it did the main
east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of Serb
forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) reponse to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling them ``small groups of people fighting to
protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which has thrown its support behind the more
moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Meanwhile, there was more evidence in the Serbian capital
Belgrade that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing
support for his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   A day after hundreds of parents of Serb soldiers serving in the
explosive province protested in front of army headquarters,
blocking traffic to demand their sons be brought home, about 30
parents demonstrated Friday.

Indonesia and IMF agree on framework for revised budget 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with U.S. treasury official to visit Indonesia.
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesia and the International
Monetary Fund have agreed on a revised framework for the annual
budget of the economically shattered nation, a Cabinet minister
said Friday.
	   The budget is expected to include more subsidies to alleviate
the burden of economic hardship on millions of poor people in
Indonesia. Riots over price increases killed as many as 1,200
people last month in the capital, Jakarta, and helped topple
President Suharto.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, coordinating minister for the economy,
finance and industry, said Indonesia and the IMF will announce
terms of the new budget next week.
	   The IMF is leading a dlrs 43 billion bailout for the nation of
200 million people, but aid was suspended because of recent
political turmoil. An IMF official, Hubert Neiss, was in Jakarta
this week to gauge how to resume loan disbursements.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who is
currently in Japan, is scheduled to visit Indonesia for talks next
week with government officials about the economy.
	   The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, rose to 14,000 against the
U.S. dollar at the end of Jakarta trading on Friday, up from 14,800
a day earlier.
	   Dealers said the rupiah climbed because of the strengthening of
the Japanese yen after intervention by the U.S. and Japanese
governments.
	   However, potential for the rupiah's recovery remains hampered by
political uncertainties and concern about more social unrest
because of rising inflation and unemployment.

Duma moves to prepare charges for Yeltsin's impeachment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Duma setting a liberal time limit to
prepare charges, reaction from lawmakers, Kremlin. TRIMS pvs.
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament voted Friday to
begin preparing an impeachment motion against President Boris
Yeltsin but gave itself 1 1/2 years to launch it, signaling the
effort would probably fade away like previous such attempts.
	   Pro-government deputy speaker Vladimir Ryzhkov said that
Yeltsin's foes understand they have little chance to oust the
president and simply want the panel as an ``instrument of blackmail
and pressure against the government.''
	   The Communist-initiated vote signaled the first time that the
State Duma has managed to set up a panel to prepare a formal
indictment. Several attempts since 1994 have collapsed.
	   The Duma voted 331-5 on Friday to set up a parliamentary
commission, which would draw up formal charges against Yeltsin that
would serve as a legal foundation for impeachment.
	   However, Communists and their allies have left themselves ample
room for backpedaling, saying the panel could work on the charges
until the current Duma's term expires in December 1999.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president the upper hand in
confrontations with parliament, which would make it hard, if not
impossible, for Yeltsin's foes to succeed. The constitution is very
vague on what grounds the president can be removed, citing only
treason and grave misconduct.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of a range
of transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the
country's economy.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's representative to the State Duma,
said none of these accusations could bear any legal criticism.
	   ``The accusations against the president are totally inadequate
from the legal viewpoint,'' he told reporters.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hard-line
allies, last month collected the necessary number of lawmakers'
signatures to set up the panel. The move was widely seen as an
attempt by the opposition members to reassert themselves after they
backed down in a confrontation with Yeltsin over the appointment of
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   However, the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction delayed
the commission's creation earlier this month by refusing to take
part in preparing the charges. The Duma's rules of order require
that the commission comprise representatives of all parliamentary
factions, although some lawmakers said the house could bypass that
provision.
	   Deputy speaker Ryzhkov, who belongs to Our Home Is Russia, said
that his faction joined the panel to prevent Communists from fully
controlling its work.
	   Once the indictment is prepared, a two-thirds majority of the
450 Duma members is needed to launch the impeachment motion.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, said the Duma could
try to do that after the summer recess. He added it would be hard
to raise the 300 votes needed.
	   The charges will also have to win confirmation from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts _ which is highly unlikely _
before they go to the upper chamber, the Federation Council. Many
of that chamber's members are loyal to Yeltsin.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks and currencies fell early Friday
on profit-taking and skepticism over whether the Japanese yen's
gains on the U.S. dollar the day before could be
sustained.Investors were also keeping a nervous eye on U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' meetings Friday with Japanese
officials for clues to whether Japan will dole out tougher reforms
to heal its ailing economy.The United States and Japan intervened
heavily in the currency market on Wednesday, selling dollars in an
effort to stop the slide of the yen against the U.S. currency.
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two days after dramatically stepping into world
currency markets to boost the sagging yen, American and Japanese
finance officials vowed Friday to intervene again if necessary, the
Finance Ministry said. Visiting Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers met Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru
Matsunaga, and both welcomed the effects of Wednesday's joint
action to halt the yen's free fall. ``The minister and I had very
good talks'' Summers told reporters after a 40-minute meeting on
Japan's strategy for reviving its moribund economy. The Finance
Ministry said Summers also urged Japan to move quickly to solve its
bad loan problem and restore health to its financial system, but he
did not ask Japan specifically to cut taxes to boost the economy.
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Friday after a
downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked frantic selling.
The exchange also halted trading of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
following a news report the government is considering a bailout
that would merge it with struggling LCTB. A senior Finance Ministry
official said late Friday the government hadn't considered a merger
of the two banks or heard from either bank about a merger plan.
LTCB also said it was not considering a merger. The Finance
Ministry also tried to allay fears the bank was in trouble.
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan has raised objections to a plan
by Pacific Rim nations to remove trade barriers in certain
industries to stimulate the region's economies, a Japanese official
said Friday. The plan, the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization,
or EVSL, was scheduled to begin next year but is likely to be
delayed by the devastating financial problems that have pummeled
Japan's and big Asian economies. EVSL, which was drawn up at the
last Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit in
Vancouver, aims to open up trade in the 18 members countries over
the next few years, although no deadlines have been set.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground
personnel threatened Friday to join a devastating 15-day-old
pilots' strike at Philippine Airlines that has pushed Asia's oldest
airline to the brink of financial ruin. The ground workers' union
filed a strike notice with the labor department accusing PAL of
union busting and harassment. The flight attendants' union said it
also plans a strike vote. The unions are not able to strike for at
least 15 days after filing strike notices because of a mandatory
cooling-off period. The Philippine flag carrier, meanwhile, filed a
rehabilitation plan Friday with Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission saying it is unable to meet payments on its loans,
estimated at dlrs 2 billion, because of drastically reduced cash
flow.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KOSTROMA, Russia (AP) _ Two days after he reappointed a leading
free-market reformer to the government to negotiate aid from the
West, President Boris Yeltsin proclaimed on Friday that Russia
needed only moral support to stabilize its markets. Anatoly
Chubais, the reformer Yeltsin reappointed, said Thursday that
Russia needed dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in financial aid to
ease the financial crisis. However, Yeltsin insisted Friday that
just a vote of confidence from international financial
organizations would suffice to keep foreign investors in Russia and
save markets from collapsing.
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed a
series of economic decrees meant to improve the country's financial
situation, which the president says is approaching crisis, a news
report said Friday. Kuchma promised to sign the decrees in a
nationally broadcast address on Thursday, in which he described
Ukraine's financial situation as close to critical. Kuchma said he
would take emergency economic measures because the country's
parliament is too ``paralyzed'' to act. He warned that Ukraine's
heavy international borrowing was nearing a critical mark, and that
the crisis could undermine the stability of the national currency,
the hryvna.
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese dissidents appealed Friday to President
Clinton to push for greater freedoms during his visit to China next
week and to meet with a veteran pro-democracy activist. A group of
57 dissidents, in a fax to foreign news agencies, urged Clinton to
meet their Beijing-based representative, Xu Wenli, after a summit
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. If Clinton does not meet with
Xu, his visit will be only a diplomatic coup for the Chinese
government and do nothing to promote democracy, said the letter
signed by dissidents from 14 cities and provinces.
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday railed against ``foreign powers'' he accused of trying to
topple him and ruin the country, and he denied that cronyism and
nepotism had hurt the economy. Blaming foreign companies for
preying on Malaysian companies weakened by the Asian economic
crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged ruling party members
at their annual convention to unite against the attacks. Mahathir
dismissed accusations of crony capitalism in Asian nations, saying
Malaysians should not be influenced by Western propaganda and by
marauding market forces. Mahathir is a frequent critic of the West.
His acerbic rhetoric has often scared investors and sent the
ringgit and stock markets plunging.
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks announced Friday they are prepared to offer a
maximum of dlrs 600 million in a ``global settlement'' of claims by
Holocaust victims. The announcement by Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank
Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland marked the first time the banks
have specified a figure for a possible settlement. The dlrs 600
million, they said, would include dlrs 70 million already paid into
a fund to help needy Holocaust survivors. The three banks urged the
plaintiffs to accept the offer ``so that money can immediately be
distributed to Holocaust survivors and heirs of Holocaust
victims.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament on Friday overwhelmingly
extended by one-year the mission of 3,000 German peacekeepers in
Bosnia.
	   The soldiers are part of the 34,000-member NATO-led force that
helps enforce the terms of Bosnia's 1995 peace accord. The U.N.
Security council on Monday extended the force's mandate through
June 21, 1999.

Italy increases evening openings of museums for summer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ More than fifty museums, palaces and archaeological
sites throughout Italy will extend their evening hours for the
summer months starting Saturday.
	   The sites include the Roman Forum and Castel Sant'Angelo Museum
in Rome; Villa Adriana and Villa d'Este on the ouskirts of the
capital; the archaeological site of Pompeii, and the Capodimonte
gallery in Naples. Royal palaces in Caserta, south of Naples, and
Turin, in northern Italy, will also be open longer.
	   Up to three nights a week, museums will keep their doors open
until 11:30 p.m., whereas archaeological sites and monuments will
prolong their hours until 8:30 p.m.
	   The sites will return to their regular closing hours, in most
cases at 6:00 p.m., Sept. 12.
	   The initiative follows a successful campaign by Culture Minister
Walter Veltroni to extend the evening hours of 16 state museums
year round.
	   For the summer months these museums will further extend their
hours to 11:30 several nights a week.

Parliament snubs EU, extends hunting season 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pressured by France's influential hunting lobby,
the National Assembly on Friday defied a European Union regulation
and voted to extend the hunting season for migrant birds, beginning
on Bastille Day.
	   On a vote of 92 to 20, the legislation by the center-right Union
for French Democracy (UDF) passed with Socialist support and over
protests by Greens politicians who are part of the leftist
government.
	   As a result, the hunting season will run from July 14 to Feb.
28, beyond a 1979 EU regulation limiting the season to a period
from Sept. 1 to Jan. 31.
	   The vote was seen as a symbolic challenge of the growing
authority of the EU that is imposing a single currency, free-market
measures and various regulations affecting people's daily lives.
Some say the EU is doing too much and that national governments
should retain as much of the decisionmaking _ or ``subsidiarity'' _
as possible.
	   National Assembly members from left to right were pressured by
the hunters, a powerful lobbying group that can cast fear in a
lawmaker with re-election plans.
	   ``I thought that the left of the 20th century, inheritors of
those of the 19th, had begun to open themselves to the aspirations
of the 21st century,'' ecologist lawmaker Guy Hascoet said in
debate Thursday. ``The Greens will not be discouraged!''
	   Noel Mamere, another Greens lawmaker, called Socialist
supporters of the legislation ``despicable and disgusting.''
	   The Greens member of the government, Environment Minister
Dominique Voynet, did not put in doubt her allegiance to the
leftist coalition. But she refused to comment.

World Cup: Soccer championship enthralls its global followers AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: version also moved with ``i'' category code
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only religions. For the faithful, it is a way of life, a solace for
the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for holy war. And the
heavy gold cup is its holy grail.
	   Nagayuki Miyara, a Tokyo salesman, stood outside Toulouse
stadium clutching what seemed to be the things dearest to him: his
wife, Midori, and two tickets to Japan's opening game with
Argentina.
	   ``Japan is going to win for sure,'' he pronounced, clearly
convinced, although oddsmakers had easily predicted Argentina's
victory. ``I'm here to see my team play.''
	   Nearby, Ruben Carpio, watched for scalpers. A businessman from
Cordoba, he came without tickets, hoping for the best. Asked why,
he seemed surprised at the question. ``Because,'' he explained,
``I'm from Argentina.''
	   As a rule, soccer fans are seldom more specific. Their passions
range from patriotism to puppy love. Handsome, dashing players are
heart throbs. Teams draped in national colors fight surrogate wars
with traditional rivals. Honor hangs in the balance.
	   When the United States and Iran, long at political loggerheads,
play Saturday in Lyon, the larger implications are obvious enough.
Scotland plays as Scotland, not some element of Great Britain. On
the soccer field, nations like Bulgaria and Paraguay share center
stage with the heavyweights of global power politics.
	   Nigeria lives under military rule and its image is tarnished by
crime and corruption. But it shows another side when the Super
Eagles take the field.
	   For no small number, the thrill is the sport itself. Soccer is a
complex structure of strategy, skill and stamina, with elements of
ballet, chess and bar fights.
	   But Michel Aubert, a town planner in Montelimar and one of 60
million Frenchmen playing host to this year's World Cup, has a
simpler explanation.
	   ``They're crazy,'' he said, ``We need an asylum big enough for
80,000 people.'' That is the capacity of the new
half-billion-dollar Stade de France on the edge of Paris. ``Soccer
fans prove that some things simply have no explanation.''
	   Aubert's expressed belief, of course, did not stop him from
sprinting toward his television set at the first strains of La
Marseillaise so he could watch France mop up Saudi Arabia by a
score he had accurately predicted before kickoff: 4-0.
	   In fact, he has seen almost every other game so far during the
opening round, and he knows by name the best players on all 32
teams.
	   Enthusiasm ignores the odds. Austria is not likely to get far in
the World Cup. But in the Saint-Etienne stadium, Austrians tied the
score with Chile in the last minute of play. Fans bellowed cheers
and anthems for 30 minutes, long after everyone else went home.
	   The 1-1 tie might still put Chile into the Round of 16, which is
the best that realistic fans are hoping for.
	   ``I'm here to cheer for my country,'' explained Janila Sanchez
Gutierrez, who had brought her 7-year-old daughter to the game. She
wore a puffy three-cornered jester's hat in Chilean blue, red and
white.
	   Though Chilean, she lives in France, and she bought tickets
through normal channels. She only had to put her phone on redial,
making five tries a minute for a week until she finally got
through.
	   Juan Correa, 35, a waiter, and his 43-year-old friend, Bernando
Mella, a welder, scraped together their savings for the trip from
Chile to the middle of France.
	   ``I think we'll make it to the next round, probably no
further,'' Correa said, and Mella's nodded his agreement.
	   Asked if watching only a few early games was worth the trip, the
men looked at each other as if wondering about the sanity of the
reporter who put the question to them.
	   After a moment, they chimed in unison: ``Of course.''

New U.N. envoy to Tajikistan meets with Rakhmonov 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new United Nations envoy to Tajikistan, Slovak
diplomat Jan Kubis, presented his credentials to President Emomali
Rakhmonov on Friday.
	   The two men also discussed problems with the implementations of
Tajikistan's 1997 peace agreement between the government and the
opposition, Kubis said after the meeting.
	   ``The process goes on. Occasionally it spins around and
sometimes it even stops,'' Kubis told reporters. ``There are some
signs that clearly indicate that not everybody is aware of the
danger of not fulfilling their commitments.''
	   Kubis said he planned to meet with Tajik opposition leaders on
Saturday.
	   The 1997 peace accord ended a five-year civil war in this former
Soviet republic in Central Asia, but sporadic outbreaks of violence
have continued.

Swiss commercial banks offer maximum dlrs 600 million for settlement 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS with background, context.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's three biggest
commercial banks on Friday offered dlrs 600 million in a ``global
settlement'' of claims by Holocaust victims.
	   In Israel, a spokesman for the World Jewish Restitution
Organization immediately rejected the offer to settle claims for
money allegedly stolen from dormant accounts opened before the end
of World War II.
	   ``The Swiss banks know that the amounts they are discussing are
offensive and if we were not dealing with such a tragic story, this
would be laughable,'' Yoram Dori told The Associated Press.
	   The banks issued a statement saying they were breaking their
silence on two months of negotiations because the other side had
repeatedly violated a confidentiality agreement.
	   ``The World Jewish Congress and the plaintiffs' lawyers are
seriously jeopardizing the settlement negotiations,'' being held
under the auspices of U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat.
	   Recent reports from New York citing sources close to the talks
have said the banks _ Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse _ were offering dlrs 1 billion or more.
	   The banks have been negotiating the settlement since last April
with Jewish organizations and lawyers for claimants in a
multi-billion-dollar suit filed in New York.
	   The banks' statement ``expressed continued interest to reach a
fair settlement.''
	   The dlrs 600 million sum _ termed the ``rough justice'' amount _
would include dlrs 70 million already paid into a Swiss fund to
help needy Holocaust survivors, said the statement.
	   Edward Fagan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, has said dlrs 1
billion might not satisfy some claimants.
	   Jewish organizations say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks when the Nazis were gaining power in
Europe.
	   Plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their
heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or
demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to
relatives of those who died in concentration camps.
	   ``The banks urge that this offer be accepted so that money can
immediately be distributed to Holocaust survivors and heirs of
Holocaust victims,'' the banks' statement said.
	   The State Department-sponsored negotiations have been conducted
under tight secrecy. Friday's statement is the first time the banks
have named a figure for a possible settlement.
	   The banks said they ``would not entertain unfounded and
excessive payments above this amount.''
	   Credit Suisse spokesman Ulrich Pfister confirmed that this is
the offer currently on the table.
	   ``As all these figures have been made public and sometimes
presented in a distorted way, we had a duty to set out our offer,''
Pfister said.
	   Spokeswoman Marie-Marceline Kurmann said the Swiss government,
which is not a party to the negotiations, had been informed of the
offer.

Russia orders peacekeepers in Abkhazia to use force if threatened conform.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A day after six Russian peacekeepers
were injured in a mine blast in breakaway Abkhazia, the Russian
Defense Ministry on Friday ordered the force to start using weapons
if the troops' safety is threatened.
	   The peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier struck a road mine
in the Ghali district, the site of recent fighting between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.
	   ``This is already the fifth case of illegal terrorist or
diversionary acts against the peacekeepers or the United Nations
observers,'' said a statement by the peacekeepers' press service,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, despite repeated protests by the peacekeepers'
command, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides are not taking the
necessary measures for ensuring the normal functioning of the
peacekeeping force in the region,'' the statement said.
	   While allowing the peacekeepers to use weapons would not have
prevented the mine blast, Interfax said the Defense Ministry cited
the incident as grounds for its orders to ``tighten the regime of
carrying out service'' and to use weapons in case of a ``real
threat'' to peacekeepers' safety.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
Russian peacekeepers' presence.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Russian officials, led by Boris
Berezovksy, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, arrived in the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi on Friday for
talks with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze's envoy Vazha Lordkipanidze. They
were expected to fly to the Georgian capital Tbilisi later in the
day.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled Abkhazia during the
fighting in the Ghali region last month.
	   Georgia has been pushing for the refugees' immediate,
unconditional return. Abkhazia has stalled, saying it needs time
build new housing and screen the returning refugees to ensure that
they do not include pro-Georgian militants.
	   The United States, France, Germany and Russia have warned the
Abkhazian government that its continued refusal to allow the
refugees to return would amount to a deliberate campaign to rid the
area of ethnic Georgians.
	   Elsewhere in Georgia, unidentified gunmen opened fire on the
border with Russia on Thursday, prompting officials to close the
Verkhny Lars checkpoint to road traffic on Friday, Interfax said.
	   Five people were wounded in the shooting on the border with the
restive Russian region of Ingushetia.

Human rights organization wants monitors allowed in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An international human rights
organization urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday
to immediately allow human rights investigators into the battered
province of Kosovo.
	   The investigation is particularly urgent following reports that
up to 200 ethnic Albanian men may be held in a detention facility
in the Decani region, members of the International Helsinki
Federation told reporters.
	   International aid and human rights organizations have been
prevented from entering Kosovo, where more than 300 people have
died since March in clashes between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanians.
	   Thousands have fled Kosovo, heading to Albania or Montenegro,
which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   Intelligence reports by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe indicate that Serbs have mined the border
with Albania to prevent arms and rebels from returning to Kosovo,
said William Hayden of the Helsinki federation.
	   One man with injuries from a land mine was transported to the
Albanian capital, Tirana, for treatment, Hayden said.
	   The organization sent teams to Albania and Montenegro to
interview refugees and survey their situation.
	   ``Civilians and civilian property has been the target of this
warfare, which violates human rights,'' said Aage Borchgrevnik, who
led the Albanian mission.
	   The refugees reported systematic attacks on villages by the
Yugoslav army, police and paramilitary units.
	   To calm the situation, the organization called for NATO troops
to be deployed in Kosovo, and along the Albanian and Macedonian
borders.

China makes new proposal for WTO membership slight recasting and editing 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with vice minister's interview in last two grafs,
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hoping for agreement in time for President
Clinton's visit to China next week, senior U.S. and Chinese
officials on Friday discussed ways to push forward China's
long-stalled bid to join the World Trade Organization.
	   A new Chinese proposal would offer foreign companies greater
access to China's service sector, allowing more foreign competition
in its tightly controlled financial industry, telecommunications
and legal and accounting professions.
	   Washington has long been pressuring China to further open its
markets before it joins the body that sets rules for world trade.
	   Officials on both sides said they wanted to have an agreement
set for Clinton's arrival next Friday. An accord would round out a
summit conspicuously lacking in substantive agreements. However, a
breakthrough appeared unlikely.
	   ``We have substantial concerns with regard to the proposal,
which the Chinese have submitted,'' said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
	   Barshefsky, who arrived Thursday, met Friday afternoon with
Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng to discuss how quickly key
differences could be narrowed.
	   With economic growth targets threatened by a drop in trade and
investment due to the Asian financial crisis, China is not eager to
expose domestic firms to competition while trying to restructure
ailing state industries.
	   U.S. officials have said they must be able to sell any agreement
with the Chinese to Congress and industry. That means showing that
an accord was based on commercial principles, not political
considerations.
	   The Chinese have a better understanding of U.S. expectations on
WTO, but it is too early to say whether the talks can conclude with
a bilateral summit pact, said Zeigler.
	   ``I think it's premature to pre-judge an outcome at this
point,'' he said.
	   Sun Zhenyu, a Chinese vice minister for foreign trade, said
keeping China outside of the WTO for a long time would not be
conducive to world economic stability and prosperity.
	   In an interview with Xinhua, the state news agency, Sun urged
Washington to fulfill a commitment to support China's WTO bid in
order to avoid damaging trade ties between the two countries.

World Cup: FIFA says refs still don't have it right on red cards AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup referees may have overreacted to calls
from soccer's top official to hand out more suspensions and
warnings for rough play, the sport's world body said Friday.
	   Two top FIFA officials, acting general secretary Michel
Zen-Ruffinen and outgoing president Joao Havelange, were meeting
with the referees at their compound north of Paris to try to find
middle ground between too little enforcement of the rules and too
much.
	   They were there at the request of FIFA's new president, Sepp
Blatter, who's call two days ago for referees to crack down on
dirty play led to an explosion of red and yellow cards on Thursday.
	   Players complained that the refs had been pressured by Blatter
into handing out punishment for minor contact.
	   Keith Cooper, FIFA's chief spokesman, said the federation was
happy with the way technical calls, such as offsides and handballs,
were being judged.
	   ``What needs to be made clearer is the disciplinary action,''
Cooper said. ``There is some room for improvement as to how the
actions are punished. The first days, there was too much leniency.
Yesterday (Thursday), the movement was in the opposite direction.''
	   Asked if that change was caused by Blatter's statements, Cooper
replied: ``That is a conclusion that one could draw.''
	   Last March, FIFA announced a campaign against tackling from
behind, a move that studies have shown can lead to crippling ankle
injuries.
	   It said that, from now on, any back tackle at any spot on the
field was automatic grounds for a red card, which kicks the
offender out of the game and bars him for at least one more match.
	   The first 20 matches over eight days produced four red cards,
and Blatter complained at a Wednesday news conference that the refs
were not doing their job.
	   ``You have to protect the players and especially the key players
that make the game, the show,'' said Blatter. ``For a tackle from
behind, the sanction is a red card.''
	   He said he was not trying to pressure the officials, just get
them to abide by the rules.
	   Pressure or not, refs started reaching in their pockets for
disciplinary cards right away. Three red cards and seven yellows
were handed out in Thursday's 1-1 tie between Denmark and South
Africa. Only one of the ejections was for a tackle from behind, and
it was a questionable call.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' Danish defender Marc
Rieper said. ``Referees have been very good so far and it is a very
stupid comment that he (Blatter) has made. I don't know if he is
trying to ruin the tournament that he made himself, and kill the
football game.''
	   And that night, the referee in the France-Saudi Arabia match
kicked out a player from each team, including French star Zinedine
Zidane for putting his cleats in the side of Saudi captain Fuad
Amin.
	   ``I didn't deserve this,'' Zidane said. ``I did not mean to hurt
the man. I just fell on him.''
	   Cooper said Havelange and Zen-Ruffinen, himself a former
international referee, would try to clarify just how far the
officials should go and warn them not to go too far.
	   ``That (confusion) is a possibility at any time,'' Cooper said.
``A referee wants to improve his career, move up in the hierarchy,
and that is normal ambition. But that ambition will be stifled if
he doesn't have the character to do what he feels is right.''

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut the road off, as it did the
main east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of
Serb forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) reponse to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling it an assemblage of ``small groups of
people fighting to protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which supports the more moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Meanwhile, there was more evidence in the Serbian capital
Belgrade that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing
support for his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Demonstrations by parents of Serb soldiers serving in the
explosive province continued. On Thursday, hundreds of parents had
blocked traffic in front of army headquarters.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant KLA fighters since the authorities launched a
crackdown on the last day of February.
	   Six Yugoslav army soldiers have been killed in the past month
and a half.

Top soccer player pleads guilty to match-fixing charge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top Hong Kong soccer player pleaded guilty
Friday to accepting a bribe from a bookmaker to fix a World Cup
qualifying match last year.
	   Chan Tsz-kong, 26, admitted to conspiring with his teammates to
give up two goals in a World Cup qualifying match between Hong Kong
and Thailand last March in Bangkok. Hong Kong lost to Thailand 2-0.
	   Chan, who plays as a striker for the Hong Kong national team,
pocketed 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,641) from the
bookmaker, the Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against
Corruption said.
	   Chan has remained in the custody of the commission pending
sentencing by the court next month.
	   He was among 30 people who were arrested when police raided
three gambling syndicates in the territory last week.
	   The commission had said earlier that several other qualifying
matches played by the Hong Kong team were also suspected to have
been fixed.
	   Both Hong Kong and Thailand were eliminated in the early stages
of the qualifying round for the World Cup.

World Cup: As France qualifies, Parisians defrost 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup fever swept through normally blase Paris
after France's convincing 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia.
	   Parisians who weren't at Stade de France for Thursday night's
match gathered in their houses or in bars to watch the match on
television. With every goal, cheers rose up through the City of
Lights.
	   After the win, Parisians strolled the sidewalks along the Champs
Elysees drinking and celebrating, while drivers around the capital
honked their horns.
	   ``Les Bleus go through,'' the daily Liberation headlined Friday.
The sports daily L'Equipe noted it was the biggest margin of
victory so far, calling it ``Grand Bleu.'' Le Parisien just needed
one word: ``Qualified.''
	   France's victory over Saudi Arabia earned it a place in the
second round after just two games. Not bad for a country that
hasn't qualified for the World Cup since 1986, when it made the
semifinal.
	   French fans decorated the stadium in red, white and blue, and
gave raucous applause as each player was announced before the
match.
	   After a minute's silence for Fernand Sastre, the organizing
committee co-president who died Saturday, 80,000 voices boomed ``La
Marseillaise'' in what L'Equipe called ``a great cry of love.''
	   But the French are aware of the cost their victory, or as Le
Parisien put it, ``a triumph with a bitter aftertaste.''
	   In the 30th minute, Christophe Dugarry pulled a hamstring and
could be out for the rest of the tournament, while Zinedine Zidane
will be banished for at least one match after being given a red
card in the 70th minute.
	   With key players out of action, some French newspapers are
pessimistic about their team's World Cup chances.
	   Le Parisien featured a cartoon with a cheering French fan in
front of his television saying, ``Great, we are starting to get a
real chance of being beaten by Brazil or Germany.''

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II began his third visit
to this alpine nation on Friday, arriving this time in the midst of
a crisis in the Austrian Roman Catholic church that critics say is
partly the Vatican's fault.
	   The frail, 78-year-old pope was welcomed at Salzburg's Maxglan
airport by President Thomas Klestil and Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna, who has been mentioned as a
possible future pope.
	   Also greeting him was Cardinal Franz Koenig, who was in the
conclave that selected the pope in 1978.
	   About 100 spectators, mostly schoolchildren, cheered the pontiff
and held up greeting signs, including one saying ``We are with
you.''
	   A military salute of cannon shots startled the pope, who slowly
moved down the gangway, then used a cane to walk along a red carpet
rolled out in his honor.
	   Speaking from a podium, he spoke of plans to integrate Europe
``from the Atlantic to the Urals, from the North Sea to the
Mediterranean.''
	   He lauded Austria, a neutral country of 8 million people, as ``a
mirror and model for a united Europe, which does not marginalize
but has room for all.''
	   Klestil recalled with ``gratitude and admiration'' how much the
pope had ``contributed to overcoming Europe's partition and to the
liberation of our neighbors in the East from the slavery of a
totalitarian (communist) regime.''
	   Only a small number of people lined the route on which the pope
was driven into downtown Salzburg, a center of European culture.
	   Many Austrian Catholics have been annoyed with the Vatican in
recent years for its refusal to institute what they consider badly
needed reform.
	   Since the pope's 1988 visit, Austrian Catholics have led a
movement demanding the church drop its requirement that priests be
celibate, allow women into the priesthood and give greater voice to
lay Catholics.
	   The ``We are the Church'' movement gathered a half-million
signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to
the United States. Demonstrations by members of the movement were
expected during the pope's visit.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal. The
pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
had to go into exile in Germany, but likely will be allowed to
return soon after the papal visit.
	   Austrian church leaders had been eager to resolve the Groer case
before the pope's visit to avoid potentially embarrassing
demonstrations while John Paul was in the country.
	   Schoenborn, elevated to his post in February, has taken steps to
calm the waters among Catholics, who by the Vatican's count
comprise 77 percent of Austria's eight million people.
	   In Vienna on Sunday, the pope is scheduled to beatify three
people, including a nun, Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded
by the Nazis in 1943. Beatification is the last formal step before
possible sainthood.

Four Ukrainian doctors face corruption trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Four Ukrainian doctors are being
investigated for selling disability certificates enabling patients
to state pensions or compensation from their employers, the
Interfax news agency said Friday.
	   The case involved a chief doctor and her deputy who worked at an
office assessing possible disabilities in the eastern city of
Poltava, according to the city prosecutor's office.
	   Two other doctors brought them ``clients'' and negotiated the
size of the bribe _ usually dlrs 500 _ Interfax said.
	   Prosecutors said team issued dozens of false disability
certificates.
	   In addition, the doctors are suspected of stealing an
unspecified large sum of government money, Interfax said.

New Manila government says budget deficit its biggest challenge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government's growing
budget deficit is the biggest challenge awaiting the administration
of President-elect Joseph Estrada, his finance secretary said
Friday.
	   In a worse-case scenario, the deficit could reach 30 billion
pesos (dlrs 750 million) by the end of 1998, a far cry from the
present government's prediction of a 5 billion peso (dlrs 125
million) surplus, incoming Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   ``Attaining a 5 billion peso budget surplus looks impossible,''
Espiritu said in a briefing on the Estrada government's economic
agenda.
	   Espiritu said his projection is based on the present
government's acknowledgment that it will fall short of its 1998
revenue target by some 40 billion pesos (dlrs 1 billion). Estrada's
administration takes over June 30.
	   The government posted a budget deficit of 15.4 billion pesos
(dlrs 385 million) in the first five months of 1998 due by lower
tax payments from companies whose earnings were affected by the
regional currency crisis. Espiritu expects the budget deficit to
widen to 21 billion pesos (dlrs 525 million) by the end of June.
	   The government has posted a budget surplus in each of the past
three years, at 1.56 billion pesos (dlrs 39 million) in 1997, 6.26
billion pesos (dlrs 156 million) in 1996 and 11.07 billion pesos
(dlrs 275 million) in 1995.
	   Incoming Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said, however, that
the Estrada administration is determined to check the deterioration
of the government's budget position by eliminating expenditures
such as ``pork barrel'' funds given to members of the House of
Representatives.
	   ``This paves the way for discretion that leads to graft and
corruption,'' Diokno said, noting that the pork barrel budget for
this year is 37 billion pesos (dlrs 925 million).
	   So far, the administration of President Fidel Ramos has released
only 3 billion pesos (dlrs 75 million) of the funds.
	   Diokno said the Estrada administration has vowed not to release
the remaining balance.
	   By reducing expenditures, Diokno said the government's budget
deficit could improve to 20 billion pesos (dlrs 500 million), lower
than Espiritu's worse-case scenario.
	   To improve revenue collection, Espiritu said the Estrada
administration is considering the creation of a special large
taxpayers' division within the Bureau of Internal Revenue to
monitor more closely the earnings of the country's top 1,000
corporations.
	   These top 1,000 corporations account for 78 percent of the
bureau's total collections, Espiritu said.
	   Other measures being considered are exempting employees of
revenue-collecting agencies from the government's salary
standardization law that places a cap on their potential earnings.
This would at least reduce the temptation of accepting bribes or
other payoffs from tax evaders, Espiritu said.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA allowed in 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to add 3 grafs, rights group demands investigators be
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut the road off, as it did the
main east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of
Serb forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) reponse to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling it an assemblage of ``small groups of
people fighting to protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which supports the more moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Meanwhile, there was more evidence in the Serbian capital
Belgrade that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing
support for his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Demonstrations by parents of Serb soldiers serving in the
explosive province continued. On Thursday, hundreds of parents had
blocked traffic in front of army headquarters.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant KLA fighters since the authorities launched a
crackdown on the last day of February.
	   Six Yugoslav army soldiers have been killed in the past month
and a half.
	   In Vienna, the International Helsinki Federation urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to immediately allow human rights
investigators into Kosovo.
	   The investigation is particularly urgent following reports that
up to 200 ethnic Albanian men may be held in a detention facility
in the Decani region, members told reporters.
	   International aid and human rights organizations have been
prevented from entering the province.

Policeman, 19, shoots self after taking woman hostage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A 19-year-old policeman committed suicide by
shooting himself in the chest after holding a woman hostage in a
six-hour standoff against 100 fellow officers Friday.
	   It was unclear why the man took the woman hostage. Government
television said the woman was believed to have been his girlfriend.
	   In a violation of policy, the policeman had taken his revolver
from his station house Thursday night. He appeared with his hostage
at Changi International Airport in the early hours of Friday
morning, then left and hid out in an isolated park.
	   About 100 officers, armed with automatic weapons, set out in
vans for the park, found the pair, and talked the gunman into
releasing the woman. He then shot himself once in the chest and
died at a hospital, according to the television reports.
	   The reports said the dead man had been a police officer for less
than a year.

Panic selling sends U.S. dollar to month's low in Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Panic selling Friday sent the U.S. dollar to
its lowest level in almost a month against the Singapore currency
as traders worried about possible plans to push down the value of
the greenback.
	   By evening the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.6391 Singapore
dollars, a level not seen since late May, and a full 6 percent
below the five-month-low 1.75 Singapore dollar level at the end of
last week.
	   Traders do not expect the high Singapore dollar level to hold,
but feel it will not soon revert to the low of last week, when the
main stock index also hit a 9 1/2 year low, following the plunging
Japanese yen and markets.
	   Currency traders were eyeing meetings in Tokyo between Deputy
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Japanese Finance
Minister Hikaru Matsunaga. Joint Japan-U.S. action this week to
sell U.S. dollars and buy yen has boosted the Japanese and other
Asian currencies, and a similar move is expected again.
	   Currency traders holding lots of U.S. dollars also were worried
about a repeat of the 1985 Plaza Accord. In that agreement, the
United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France worked together
to drive down the price of the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 30
percent decline in the currency over a two-year period.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday railed against ``foreign powers'' he accused of trying to
topple him and ruin the country, and he denied that cronyism and
nepotism had hurt the economy.
	   Blaming foreign companies for preying on Malaysian companies
weakened by the Asian economic crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad urged ruling party members at their annual convention to
unite against the attacks.
	   Mahathir dismissed accusations of crony capitalism in Asian
nations, saying Malaysians should not be influenced by Western
propaganda and by marauding market forces.
	   ``Rightly, the development process of the Malays, migrating from
farmers to entrepreneurs and educated traders, ought to continue,''
Mahathir told some 2,000 delegates at the United Malays National
Organization general assembly.
	   ``However it seems there are quarters who will not allow this.
We are pushed to become a backward, weak race, that is recolonized
and having to serve others,'' he said. ``They are trying to destroy
all that we have built.''
	   Mahathir is a frequent critic of the West. His acerbic rhetoric
has often scared investors and sent the ringgit and stock markets
plunging.
	   But he received a standing ovation for his speech Friday, in
which he warned foreign countries could try to manipulate
Malaysia's internal politics to cause a power struggle.
	   Such a struggle could lead to the selection of a leader
``willing to submit to world powers,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir, 72, may have been alluding to Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, 51, who is also finance minister and
Mahathir's hand-picked successor, has often been at odds with his
mentor over the handling of the economy and pegged by some as more
level-headed and better suited to lead the country into the next
century.
	   Some political observers had been anticipating a showdown
between the two men during the convention.
	   But later Friday, Mahathir and Anwar appeared together at a news
conference where the prime minister backed Anwar as his deputy in
the party in case there was a challenge for the office.
	   ``If people want to have a contest, by all means do. But as far
as I am concerned, if people want to contest against my deputy,
I'll support the incumbent.''
	   Anwar said he had never challenged Mahathir's leadership. ``It's
only the implication of some groups, particularly the foreign
media,'' he said.
	   Mahathir's comments at the first party conference since Malaysia
has slid into a deep economic crisis come amid rumbles of criticism
within UMNO about his 17-year leadership.
	   For the first time since the Asian contagion began battering the
economy a year ago, Malaysia posted a negative growth rate of 1.8
percent in the first quarter of 1998. That compared with 6.9
percent growth in 1997.
	   At the opening of the assembly Thursday, some delegates cheered
the outspoken UMNO Youth leader, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who spoke out
against cronyism and nepotism within the party. He alleged that
lucrative contracts have been directed toward businessmen with
political connections.

Artillery shells rain down on Guinea-Bissau capital

<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ The capital of Guinea-Bissau awoke to heavy
bombardment Friday as artillery shells apparently fired by renegade
soldiers landed in the city center, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   After the shelling, long bursts of heavy machine-gun fire could
be heard from the area where government forces are laying siege to
rebel positions around a Bissau military garrison and the nearby
international airport, the Portuguese ambassador to Guinea-Bissau
said.
	   ``It seems ... that government forces are advancing on the
airport,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva said on
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western
tip, has been descending into civil war with regional side-effects
since former military chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane launched a
mutiny garrison in Bissau, the country's capital, on June 7.
	   Da Silva said the fighting in Bissau had subsided by mid-morning
and only Red Cross and military vehicles were on the city's
streets.
	   He also said all efforts at mediation had failed.
	   Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe reportedly left the
country Thursday after Mane's rebels snubbed his offer of talks.
	   Talks proposed last week by religious and political leaders also
failed.
	   Thousands of villagers, meanwhile, have been fleeing a barrage
of rocket and artillery shells in northern Guinea-Bissau, heading
for the Senegalese border.
	   The intense assault, which began Wednesday night and continued
into Thursday, was directed at Ingore and Bula, villages just miles
south of the Senegalese border.
	   It was not clear who launched the attack, although the
Senegalese army _ fighting on behalf of President Joao Bernardo
Vieira _ had been firing artillery across the border in recent
days.
	   Senegal's army has sent troops and artillery fire across the
border, and troops from the Republic of Guinea, south of
Guinea-Bissau, have been fighting for the loyalists.
	   In a clandestine broadcast, rebel spokesman Maj. Manuel De
Santos Gomes said Thursday his forces ``are sure of our victory''
in their quest to oust Vieira.
	   ``We are regrouping our forces and planning an offensive on
Bissau once the civilians have all left,'' he said in the
broadcast, monitored in the Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   The renegade soldiers accuse Vieira of corruption and demand he
step down. They have also vowed to retaliate against the loyalists
attacks.
	   Bissau has been pounded by heavy artillery and mortar fire since
the fighting began, and witnesses and aid groups say more than
three-quarters of its 300,000 residents have fled.

Taiwan suggest fall China meeting of top negotiators 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan on Friday proposed an autumn
meeting between top Taipei and Beijing negotiators to push for the
restoration of semiofficial talks before the end of the year.
	   The semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation said a visit by
Chairman Koo Chen-fu to Beijing would help lay the ground work for
restarting talks suspended by China in June 1995.
	   The call comes amid a slow gathering of momentum for talks
following SEF Deputy Secretary General Jan Jyh-horng's ice-breaking
visit to Beijing in April. That visit was the first formal contact
between the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in nearly three years.
	   To prepare for Koo's visit, the SEF suggested Friday that Jan
pay a return trip to Beijing in July, followed in August with a
visit by SEF Secretary General Shi Hwei-yow.
	   Beijing cut off talks over what it saw as a campaign by Taiwan
towards creeping independence. Efforts to restart negotiations were
stymied by China's repeated demands that Taiwan recognize Beijing's
sovereignty over it and quit a campaign to gain international
recognition.
	   Beijing has ceased raising those demands, allowing a gradual
restoration of contacts between the two organizations.
	   But Taiwanese officials complain privately that Chinese
officials have shown little willingness to make firm arrangements
for a resumption of talks, preferring the polite symbolism of
rapprochement.
	   Taiwan and China last split politically at the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949, but Beijing still claims the island as a
renegade province to eventually be reunified with.

Survey: Hong Kong's Tung worse than British predecessor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In another blow to Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa, who has been criticized for his handling of Hong Kong's
economic troubles, a survey Friday showed that most people thought
he was doing a worse job than the last colonial governor.
	   Just 13.7 percent of the 544 respondents said Tung was doing a
better job, compared with 43.5 percent who said previous Hong Kong
governor Chris Patten was better, the survey by the University of
Hong Kong's Social Research Center said.
	   The margin of error was 4.4 percent.
	   The survey also showed that one year after the reversion of Hong
Kong to Chinese rule, more people believe the territory would be
better if it had remained under British rule.
	   Just 39.9 percent of respondents last year said the British were
better rulers, compared with 45.2 percent in the latest survey.
	   Hong Kong's economy soared after the territory's July 1 handover
to China, with money pouring in from China-related enterprises and
investors' confidence growing in Hong Kong's political stability.
	   But the economy has since dived as the territory was dragged
into Asia's protracted financial turmoil. The economy contracted in
the first quarter this year for the first time in 14 years, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   Recent polls have shown dissatisfaction with the government as
the territory's economic woes show no signs of abating. The
government has been criticized for being too timid, and the two
stimulus packages officials announced in recent weeks are seen as
inadequate to lift the economy.

Taiwan suggests fall China meeting of top negotiators 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS spelling of `suggests' in overline
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan on Friday proposed an autumn
meeting between top Taipei and Beijing negotiators to push for the
restoration of semiofficial talks before the end of the year.
	   The semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation said a visit by
Chairman Koo Chen-fu to Beijing would help lay the ground work for
restarting talks suspended by China in June 1995.
	   The call comes amid a slow gathering of momentum for talks
following SEF Deputy Secretary General Jan Jyh-horng's ice-breaking
visit to Beijing in April. That visit was the first formal contact
between the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in nearly three years.
	   To prepare for Koo's visit, the SEF suggested Friday that Jan
pay a return trip to Beijing in July, followed in August with a
visit by SEF Secretary General Shi Hwei-yow.
	   Beijing cut off talks over what it saw as a campaign by Taiwan
towards creeping independence. Efforts to restart negotiations were
stymied by China's repeated demands that Taiwan recognize Beijing's
sovereignty over it and quit a campaign to gain international
recognition.
	   Beijing has ceased raising those demands, allowing a gradual
restoration of contacts between the two organizations.
	   But Taiwanese officials complain privately that Chinese
officials have shown little willingness to make firm arrangements
for a resumption of talks, preferring the polite symbolism of
rapprochement.
	   Taiwan and China last split politically at the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949, but Beijing still claims the island as a
renegade province to eventually be reunified with.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut the road off, as it did the
main east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of
Serb forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) response to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.

Queensland wins State of Origin series 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Veteran scrum half Allan Langer led
Queensland to a 2-1 series victory over New South Wales on Friday
in what might have been his final State of Origin rugby league
game.
	   Langer scored a brilliant second-half try to convert
Queensland's dominance into a 18-4 victory at the Sydney Football
Stadium.
	   Langer said he was considering retirement before the opening
match of the series and was again an outstanding leader in his 30th
Origin match.
	   New South Wales was without six of the players, through injury
or suspension, who leveled the series in Brisbane a fortnight
earlier, and in a late blow lost chief playmaker Geoff Toovey to
illness.
	   Queensland held a 12-4 lead at half-time after dominating
possession in the first term.
	   Kevin Walters opened the scoring on eight minutes when he
finished off a spectacular movement. Winger Wendell Sailor pulled
in a high kick from Brad Fittler and ran the ball to the halfway
line before being brought down.
	   The ball was passed through eight sets of hands before Walters
confused the defense to cross.
	   Center Ben Ikin put the visitors further ahead on 29 minutes,
taking an inside pass from hard-running Gorden Tallis and raising
his arm in triumph 30 meters out from the try-line.
	   The Blues hit back immediately as replacement Ken McGuinness
crossed out wide after Andrew Johns made room with a long pass.
	   Queensland was well on top for the opening 25 minutes of the
second term but could not crack the Blues' line with fullback Tim
Brasher holding firm.
	   But Langer set up the win on 65 minutes when he shaped to stab
through a short kick but instead weaved past several defenders.
	   Queensland winger Robbie O'Davis, who has been under pressure
after escaping a ban for a positive drug test because of a
technicality, put his troubles aside to play a strong game.
Queensland forwards Gorden Tallis and Gary Larson were also
outstanding while the Blues were let down by a poor kicking game.
	   Scores:
	   Queensland 19 (Kevin Walters, Ben Ikin, Allan Langer tries;
Darren Lockyer 2, Robbie O'Davis 1 goals; Jason Smith 1 field goal)
def. New South Wales 4 (Ken McGuinness try).

Atomic Energy Ministry to wait until 2000 to fix Millennium problems 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry will wait until
2000 to fix problems associated with the Millennium Bug, a
spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We don't have any problems yet,'' spokesman Vladislav Petrov
told The Associated Press. ``We'll deal with the problem in the
year 2000.''
	   The Millennium Bug arises because many computers, originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year, may be
unable to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900 because their
codes represent those years as simply 00.
	   Computer experts warn that at 12:00 A.M on Jan 1, 2000 banking
systems may fail, air traffic controls could stop working, and
nuclear reactors might melt down if the problem in their computer
systems is not fixed in time.
	   On May 21, Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko ordered the
country's computer experts to develop ways to resolve the Year 2000
problem by the end of this year, but it is commonly acknowledged
that Russia is far behind its western counterparts in fixing the
glitch.
	   Many experts believe that if major government institutions and
large companies haven't started fixing the problem yet, they're
already too late. A recent study revealed that the U.S. Defense
Department will update all its necessary computers by 2012 at the
pace it is going now.
	   It has already invested dlrs 1.9 billion in fixing the bug.

Clerides repeats demilitarization offer to ease tension 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus reiterated a longstanding proposal
to demilitarize the war-divided island as a way to reduce
escalating tension with Turkey, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   President Glafcos Clerides made the offer in a letter Thursday
to the U.N. secretary-general ``with concrete proposals and a
timetable,'' spokesman Christos Stylianides said.
	   He did not offer details.
	   Tension escalated this week after Turkey sent six warplanes and
naval units to the northern-occupied part of the island in
retaliation for the visit of six Greek planes to the government
controlled south earlier in the week.
	   The last of the six Turkish F-16s left Friday, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency said.
	   ``We have proved through these specific proposals that we are
for the reduction of tension,'' Stylianides said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake of
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Thursday that Greece's
dispatch of the planes ``exhibited its offensive intentions against
Turkey. It is out of the question for Turkey not to respond.''
	   But Stylianides defended the visit by the Greek planes, saying
it was ``perfectly legal within the framework of the joint defense
pact Cyprus has with Greece.''
	   He dismissed the likelihood of a military clash.

Eds: UPDATES with polls opening; Polls are open between 1200 and
By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs tried to reshuffle the
political deck Friday, going to the polls in hopes of voting in a
more stable government this country has lacked for two years.
	   Heading into early parliamentary elections, the Social Democrats
appeared poised to form the first left-of-center Czech government
since the collapse of Communism in 1989.
	   The center-left party led pre-election polls with more than 20
percent of the vote, at least 5 percent ahead of the second-place
Civic Democratic Party of former premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Polls opened Friday afternoon and will close at 10 p.m.
(2000GMT). Voting continues the next morning and ends at 2 p.m.
(1200 GMT) Saturday, with first results expected after polls close.
	   At stake are all 200 seats in the lower chamber of the
parliament and the chance to form the next Cabinet.
	   Some 8.09 million eligible voters vote for parties, but can move
individual candidates up on the party list by circling their name,
improving their chances of winning a seat.
	   The elections are being held two years ahead of schedule,
following the ouster of Klaus and his center-right coalition after
a party finance scandal last winter. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   Although it was hoped the early elections would break the
stalemate that has stymied Czech politics since 1996, no one
expects any political clarity to emerge from the vote.
	   Even if the Social Democrats win by a large margin, it won't be
enough for a clear majority. There is little chance that their
leader Milos Zeman would join with his bitter rival Klaus in a
``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Difficult negotiations to form a coalition will most likely
follow, with President Vaclav Havel playing a key role.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent hurdle
needed to get into the parliament, including the old guard
Communists and the extreme Republicans. Both are excluded by all
mainstream parties as possible coalition partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by Havel _ and the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living as potential partners in the
government.
	   The Social Democrats say their ideal choice would be forming a
coalition with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn,
suggest taking on Jan Ruml's Freedom Union.
	   But Ruml, a former dissident and lifelong fighter against
communism, says he would prefer yet another round of early
elections to forming a coalition with a leftist party.
	   That would force the Social Democrats to try and make a
coalition with the Pensioners and tacit support from the
Communists.
	   The possibility of a left-wing government has financial experts
and foreign investors worried, but analysts said Thursday political
instability and a hung parliament could pose an even bigger threat
to the Czech koruna.
	   But President Vaclav Havel has welcomed the possibility of a new
government, in which young people would play an increasingly active
role.
	   ``Change is the essence of democracy,'' said Havel, before
campaigning came to a close. ``There is no danger of communism
returning.''

Russian jewelry merchant formally charged. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A jewelry merchant suspected of engineering a
fraudulent scheme that cost Russia dlrs 180 million in stolen gold
and gems was formally charged on four counts Friday, a news report
said.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency did not specify the charges against
Andrei Kozlenok.
	   Kozlenok, 38, was extradited Wednesday from Greece, where he had
been in custody since his arrest in January. He had fought
extradition by claiming his life would be in danger in Russia, but
Greek courts rejected the appeals.
	   After being flown to Moscow, Kozlenok was taken directly to a
jail for questioning, Russian media said. Prosecutors have ordered
additional security for Kozlenok and refused to say where exactly
he is being held.
	   Kozlenok is accused of embezzling more than dlrs 183 million in
gold, diamonds and silver. He is accused of making a fake jewelry
production contract with the Russian State Committee on Metals and
Gems on behalf of a San Francisco-based company, Golden ADA Inc.
	   The Russian government filed a lawsuit in San Francisco in 1995,
claiming Golden ADA sold the metals and gems without permission
instead of returning them to Russia after processing. The
government says the company used the money to buy yachts, a
business jet, luxury cars and a mansion.
	   A U.S. court trustee ruled in April that dlrs 40 million in
remaining Golden ADA assets will be divided among the Russian
government, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and creditors.
	   Prosecutors believe that Kozlenok might give fresh evidence
against some former senior government officials involved in the
scheme. But ITAR-Tass reported Friday that Kozlenok was refusing to
answer investigators' questions.
	   The suspects include Yevgeny Bychkov, the former head of the
State Committee on Metals and Gems, who was fired by President
Boris Yeltsin in February 1996 after the scandal broke. Bychkov has
already faced charges, but was granted an amnesty.
	   Another suspect in the scheme, Sergei Dovbysh, a former Russian
Interior Ministry official, was found dead in February in a
courthouse cell in Moscow. His death was officially ruled a
suicide.

Talks open aimed at ending three-day-old train strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Government and union negotiators resumed
talks Friday aimed at ending a three-day-old strike that has idled
more than half of the nation's trains.
	   The government reportedly prepared a new offer overnight, but
details were not released. The union representing 14,000 of
Poland's 22,000 train engineers threatened to escalate protests if
it found the offer unacceptable.
	   The leftist Union of Train Engineers is demanding pay raises and
early retirement options. The right-wing Solidarity trade union has
not joined the strike, which it says is politically motivated.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek has declared the strike illegal
because strikers did not follow correct negotiating procedures
before walking off the job at midnight Tuesday. Eight railway
officials were fired on Thursday.
	   The government has estimated that 4,600 engineers have stopped
work, idling half of the nation's passenger trains and two-thirds
of the cargo trains just ahead of school holidays.
	   Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski said he will issues
licenses in the next few days, ahead of schedule, to 11 private
cargo rail companies.
	   The strikers are demanding a 300-zloty (dlr-88) increase in the
current average monthly pay of 1,600 zlotys (dlrs 470) and the
right for workers with 20 years of service to retire at age 55.
	   Railway officials estimated the losses so far at 7 million
zlotys (dlrs 2 million). The Polish rail carries 1.1 million
passengers and some 600,000 tons of goods daily.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quote from Yugoslav official
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut it, as it did the main
east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of Serb
forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) response to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling them ``small groups of people fighting to
protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which has thrown its support behind the more
moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Defying the demands of foreign powers, which it says are
furthering the militants' cause, the government insists it will
continue the crackdown.
	   ``All international pressures on Serbia... are a direct help to
separatists,'' Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic was quoted Friday
as saying by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   But there was more evidence in the Serbian capital Belgrade that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing support for his
crackdown on Kosovo.
	   A day after hundreds of parents of Serb soldiers serving in the
explosive province protested in front of army headquarters,
blocking traffic to demand their sons be brought home, about 30
parents demonstrated Friday.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant KLA fighters since the authorities launched a
crackdown on the last day of February.
	   Six Yugoslav army soldiers have been killed in the past month
and a half, a sign that the army _ mostly engaged in fierce duels
with guerrilla groups alongside the porous Kosovo-Albania border,
is having casualties, too.
	   One army recruit, a 20-year-old from southern Serbia, was
reported killed in an ambush by the KLA Wednesday, was to be buried
Friday in his native village of Spancevac, in a region just east of
Kosovo.

Ukrainian inspection finds huge abuse of Chernobyl funds 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Nearly 10 billion hryvna (dlrs 5 billion)
allocated to deal with the consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear disaster have been misspent, the government said Friday.
	   The Finance Ministry's main control and inspection directorate
checked 5,000 enterprises handling Chernobyl Fund money and found
serious misuse of funds allocated for medical care and
construction.
	   In the Kiev region alone, the inspection discovered 1 billion
hryvna (dlrs 500,000) worth of violations, including instances in
which housing intended for Chernobyl victims was given to other
people and money was invested outside the fund to earn interest.
	   Some 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1 billion) allocated for health
services, free food and medicine were illegally used for other
purposes, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The government made the violators return 2 billion hryvna (dlrs
1 billion) to the Chernobyl Fund and opened 70 criminal cases, it
said. Fines were levied against 94 officials.
	   The government set up the fund to address the consequences of
the 1986 explosion and fire that destroyed Chernobyl's reactor No.
4 and sent a radioactive cloud over much of Europe.
	   Ukrainian officials say millions of people have been affected,
and that close to 3,600 Ukrainians who took part in the Chernobyl
cleanup effort have died from radiation exposure. Private groups
say the death toll is at least twice as high.
	   President Leonid Kuchma has recently estimated the damage
suffered by Ukraine at up to dlrs 130 billion, and said Kiev has to
spend dlrs 1 billion a year to deal with the consequences of the
world's worst nuclear accident.
	   But on Thursday, Kuchma halved obligatory payments by employers
to the Chernobyl Fund as part of a series of emergency steps to
avert a full-blown economic crisis in Ukraine. The employers will
now pay a sum equal to 5 percent of their workers' salaries.

Iranian delegation presses for more information on POWs 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iranian delegation is pressing Iraq for
information on thousands of Iranian prisoners of war Tehran claims
are still held in Iraq, an Iranian diplomat said Friday.
	   The delegation arrived Wednesday with a list of Iranian POWs,
the diplomat told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian
prisoners and was reportedly angered by the new list.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees.
	   It was the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since
1990, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which
supervised the swap. The Iran-Iraq war, in which more than more
than 1 million people were killed or wounded, ended in 1988.
	   The issue of POWs has long stood in the way of better ties, and
the delegation's visit might stall efforts to normalize relations.
	   Iraq's official media have ignored the delegation's visit. That
contrasts with the extensive coverage by Iraq's state-controlled
newspapers of past trips, even those by junior Iranian officials.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross in Baghdad is not
involved in the talks. But ICRC representative Manuel Bessler said
his organization ``supports and encourages both parties to solve
this pressing humanitarian issue.''
	   The ICRC says that Iran has so far released more than 56,000
Iraqi POWs. Iraq has freed more than 37,000 Iranian POWs.
	   The ICRC says it knows of several thousand Iraqis in Iran but is
not aware of more Iranian POWs in Iraq.

Tourist's body returned to Scotland without a heart 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The body of a Scottish tourist was returned to
his family without the heart that had been removed during an
autopsy in Israel, a pathologist confirmed Friday.
	   British Embassy spokeswoman Sara Buchanan said the incident left
her ``disturbed and concerned.''
	   The tourist, Alistair Sinclair, had committed suicide in an
Israeli jail in April after being arrested on suspicion of drug
smuggling, the Yediot Ahronot daily said Friday.
	   During an autopsy, doctors removed Sinclair's heart to examine
it for signs of disease, said Jehuda Hess, director of the
Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.
	   Tests on the heart were still not completed by the time the body
was shipped to Sinclair's family in a small Scottish village in
early May, Hess said. Israeli authorities failed to notify the
family that the heart was missing, Buchanan said.
	   The family only learned from Scottish doctors who performed a
second autopsy that the heart was missing. By the time the family
received the results of the second autopsy, the body had already
been cremated, Yediot said.
	   Israeli authorities sent the heart to Scotland in early June.
	   Hess said that when organs are removed as part of an autopsy of
a foreigner it is determined together with the family abroad
whether the organs will be returned or buried separately in Israel.
	   ``We can't always complete all the tests before the body is
returned for burial,'' Hess said.

Cronje and Rhodes defy England with a record stand 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jonty Rhodes, eyeing a test century for the second
time this series, shared a record stand with Hansie Cronje Friday
as South Africa wrested the initiative from England in the second
test at Lord's.
	   Cronje drove Headley imperiously for his ninth boundary to post
a new South African fifth-wicket record against any country,
improving on the 157 between Tony Pithey and John Waite at the
Wanderers in 1964/65.
	   The pair rescued the Proteas innings, joining when the score was
46 for four, and taking the score to 224 for four at lunch on the
second day.
	   England took the early initiative, sending South Africa into bat
on a rain-affected pitch and then Dominic Cork vindicated the
decision by taking four wickets in a 44-ball spell.
	   But Rhodes and Cronje are back on top of the English bowling
attack, both reaching half centuries _ Cronje, 77 not out and
Rhodes, 91 not out _ after resuming Friday morning at 135 for four.
	   Cork and his fellow bowlers Angus Fraser and Dean Headley all
beat the bat at various stages, but Cronje and Rhodes were equal to
the task with some positive batting and have shared an undefeated
178 runs.
	   Rhodes, the dominant partner in the stand, was the first to
reach his half century in 69 balls. He was denied of a century in
the first test when he was dismissed for 95 at Edgbaston.
	   If Rhodes reaches his century, it will be his first in 43
innings and only the second since scoring an unbeaten 101 against
Sri Lanka at Moratuwa in 1993/94.
	   It has been a chancy innings for Rhodes, who was dropped on 10
by Mike Atherton off Headley on a rain ruined first day.
	   The much needed breakthrough was not forthcoming for England and
skipper Alec Stewart introduced off spinner Robert Croft for the
first time in the 55th over.
	   Rhodes has hit 13 boundaries to go with the six he deposited
into the new 11.5 million pound grandstand which was officially
opened on the first day.
	   Cronje, playing a captain's innings, has hit 11 boundaries off
149 balls in his 210-minute stay at the crease.
	   Cork's four wickets has so far cost hims 77 runs.

Pakistani foreign minister: Israel helped India carry out tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel helped India carry out its nuclear tests
in May, the foreign minister of Pakistan alleged in remarks
published Friday in an Israeli newspaper.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai Bazak,
denied the charges, saying Israel did not have any role in India's
nuclear tests.
	   Israel maintains relations with India, but not with Pakistan,
the first Muslim country to go nuclear. Pakistan also carried out
nuclear tests last month, in response to India.
	   In an interview with the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot, Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub said Pakistan had evidence that India tried to
destroy the Pakistani reactor to prevent Pakistan from carrying out
its own tests.
	   Pakistani officials initially claimed that Israel tried to help
India in the alleged plot, but Ayub said in Friday's interview that
Israel played no role. ``It was India's plan,'' he said.
	   Last month's rival nuclear tests by the South Asian neighbors,
who have fought three wars in the last 50 years, heightened fears
of a new nuclear arms race that could ultimately spread to other
aspiring nuclear nations.
	   Israel has been especially concerned about nuclear know-how
reaching Iran, one of its most implacable foes. However, Ayub said
Israel did not have to worry about Pakistan passing on its secrets.
	   ``We have not transferred knowledge, and we won't transfer it,''
Ayub told Yediot reporter Orly Azulai-Katz in his office in
Islamabad.
	   Ayub charged that there was close military cooperation between
India and Israel. ``In the nuclear tests which India conducted on
the 11th and 13th of last month, Israel supplied India with the
devices for carrying out simultaneous tests, at an interval of one
thousandth of a second,'' Ayub alleged.
	   ``Only America and Israel have this apparatus, and we know that
it came from Israel,'' Ayub said.
	   The foreign minister also said that Pakistan had ``many, many
bombs,'' a claim disputed this week by Jane's Intelligence Weekly,
a respected military magazine published in London.
	   Jane's said Pakistan exhausted a significant part of its meager
arsenal in last month's tests _ and the poor performance of its
weapons revealed the country's strategic nuclear weakness.

Russia's envoy to NATO not to return to Brussels soon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's envoy to NATO, who was recalled to Moscow
earlier this week as a protest against the western alliance's air
exercises in the Balkans, will not be returning to Brussels any
time soon, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
	   Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin returned to the Russian capital for
consultations following NATO's announcement that it would go ahead
with the exercises over Albania and Macedonia on the day before
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was due to meet with
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow.
	   The exercises on Monday were intended to demonstrate the West's
readiness to use force to stop Yugoslavia's violent campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   Col.-Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, said Zavarzin would not be
returning to NATO headquarters in Brussels in the next few days.
	   ``We need to coordinate our approach to our mutual relations
with the North Atlantic bloc, including in light of the latest
events _ the NATO air force exercises,'' Ivashov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   If NATO ``resorts to any violent action to resolve the Kosovo
conflict without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, this
would be the start of a new Cold War in Europe and will determine
Russia's conflict,'' Ivashov warned.
	   He said political means to solve the crisis had not been
exhausted, and that the military option was the ``1,001st one,''
Interfax reported.
	   Ivashov also warned of an ``explosive'' military imbalance in
Bosnia, where Serbs allegedly are unable to arm themselves because
of economic and geographic regions, while the U.S.-led effort to
arm the Muslims and Croats is continuing apace.

Eritrean president calls for peaceful resolution of Ethiopian border conflict

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a
veteran of a 30-year struggle for his nation's independence, Friday
said war is no solution to his country's border conflict with
Ethiopia.
	   ``We don't have any intention of escalating this war,'' he said.
``Any battle you would call the mother of battles, the mother of
wars, will never happen. It's bluffing.''
	   ``Let's put our alliance back in place so that we contribute to
each other's stability and to the stability of the region,'' he
said.
	   But the spokesman for a team of African leaders trying to
mediate the crisis said Friday in neighboring Ethiopia that their
shuttle diplomacy had been unsuccessful since Eritrea continued to
reject a four-point proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda as a basis for direct talks.
	   ``The Eritrean side stated clearly the facilitation process was
over. From this point of view, therefore, the delegation was not
able at this juncture to make headway with respect to the
facilitators' recommendations,'' Salim A. Salim, secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity, told reporters.
	   But Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, a member of the OAU
team, told The Associated Press the team had received assurances of
restraint from both sides.
	   ``We've got a commitment from both sides that they accept to
restrain from hostility while the mission of the OAU is trying to
get a solution,'' Bizimungu said.
	   The OAU delegation met both Meles and Isaias Thursday, then
returned to Addis Ababa. Bizimungu said committees would be set up
to study the core problems and that heads of state would return to
the region in a month.
	   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Blaise Campaore of
Burkina Faso are also on the team.
	   ``It is very unrealistic to expect that there would be dramatic
change overnight or in a matter or hours,'' Isaias told reporters,
adding the talks were ``exciting and fruitful'' despite the impasse
in the 6-week border conflict between the two countries that has
resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.
	   Ethiopia has agreed to the four-point proposal, which includes a
provision that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas before peace
talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory in accordance with new boundaries it
says were established when Eritrea became independent in 1993.
	   Isaias also condemned Ethiopia for failing to honor a
U.S.-brokered moratorium on air strikes and the threat of air
strikes. Despite the Sunday agreement, Ethiopia is reported to have
told airlines this week that they must advise Ethiopia 10 minutes
before entering Eritrean air space, a civil aviation source said.
	   In a proposal outlined Thursday to the OAU delegation, Isaias
called for demilitarization of conflict zones within a month,
monitored by foreign observers and representatives of both sides.
Troops would be pulled out of the hotly contested Badme region
first.
	   Ethiopians have demanded that their armed militiamen patrol
areas they believe are rightfully theirs.
	   The U.N. Cartographic Section, or other appropriate body, would
have six months to demarcate the boundary between the neighboring
countries ``in accordance with existing colonial border treaties,''
under the Eritrean plan.
	   At the news conference, Isaias said ``We believe the boundaries
are the most clearly defined boundaries ever in Africa, and there
is no controversy. But let's give our Ethiopian colleagues the
benefit of the doubt to come with a claim on the boundaries.''
	   The border conflict that broke out in early May has claimed
hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea,
wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

Hiroshima survivor opposes sanctions against nuclear India 
</HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAIPUR, India (AP) _ A Hiroshima survivor and anti-nuclear
activist condemned Friday economic sanctions punishing India and
Pakistan for testing nuclear devices.
	   After conducting his own protest near India's nuclear test site,
Yashuhiko Taketa said Japan should abandon its support for the U.S.
nuclear policy and urge the United States to dismantle its own
nuclear arsenal.
	   ``Japan should have told the United States that its failure to
abolish nuclear weapons had forced India to test nuclear devices,''
Taketa told reporters.
	   Sanctions, he said, will not work. ``That is not the way to
bring peace.''
	   Under the sanctions announced Thursday in Washington, India and
Pakistan could lose a total of dlrs 4 billion annually in
international loans. Non-humanitarian aid will stop.
	   Taketa, who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945,
traveled to India to describe the horrors of nuclear war.

Red cards waved like flags at World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with FIFA criticizing referees
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The red tide that so many predicted finally has
come ashore at the World Cup. They're not blaming El Nino _ they're
blaming El Presidente.
	   One day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter and French organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini criticized referees for not being
tough enough, particularly on tackles from behind and time wasting,
five red cards were issued in two games Thursday _ one more than
was shown in the first eight days and 20 games of the tournament.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' Danish defender Marc
Rieper said following Denmark's 1-1 draw with South Africa, a match
that saw three ejections and seven cautions.
	   ``Referees have been very good so far and it is a very stupid
comment that he (Platini) has made,'' Rieper said. ``I don't know
if he is trying to ruin the tournament that he made himself and
kill the football game.''
	   Two more ejections and four more yellows followed in France's
4-0 victory over Saudi Arabia Thursday night, a win which
guaranteed the host nation passage into the second round and made
the Saudis the first team to be eliminated.
	   On Friday, FIFA said World Cup referees may have overreacted to
Blatter's call for more suspensions and warnings for rough play.
	   ``What needs to be made clearer is the disciplinary action,''
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is some room for
improvement as to how the actions are punished. The first days,
there was too much leniency. Yesterday (Thursday), the movement was
in the opposite direction.''

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs tried to reshuffle the
political deck Friday, going to the polls in hopes of voting in a
stable government after two years of stalemate.
	   Heading into early parliamentary elections on Friday and
Saturday, the Social Democrats appeared poised to form the first
left-of-center Czech government since the collapse of Communism in
1989.
	   The center-left party led pre-election polls with more than 20
percent of the vote, at least 5 percent ahead of the second-place
Civic Democratic Party of former premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Polls opened Friday afternoon and will close at 10 p.m.
(2000GMT). Voting continues the next morning and ends at 2 p.m.
(1200 GMT) Saturday, with first results expected after polls close.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel cast his ballot Friday at the local
elementary school near his country residence at Lany, outside of
Prague, where he is recovering from abdominal surgery he underwent
in April.
	   At stake are all 200 seats in the lower chamber of the
parliament and the chance to form the next Cabinet.
	   Some 8.09 million people are eligible to vote for parties, but
can improve individual candidates' chances of winning a seat by
circling their name.
	   The elections are being held two years ahead of schedule,
following the ouster of Klaus and his center-right coalition after
a party finance scandal last winter. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   Although it was hoped the early elections would break the
stalemate that has stymied Czech politics since 1996, no one
expects any political clarity to emerge from the vote.
	   Even if the Social Democrats win by a large margin, it won't be
enough for a clear majority. There is little chance that their
leader Milos Zeman would join with his bitter rival Klaus in a
``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Difficult negotiations to form a coalition will most likely
follow, with Havel playing a key role.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent hurdle
needed to get into the parliament, including the old guard
Communists and the extreme Republicans. Both are excluded by all
mainstream parties as possible coalition partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by Havel _ and the
populist Pensioners for Secure Living as potential partners in the
government.
	   The Social Democrats say their ideal choice would be forming a
coalition with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn,
suggest taking on Jan Ruml's Freedom Union.
	   But Ruml, a former dissident and lifelong fighter against
communism, says he would prefer yet another round of early
elections to forming a coalition with a leftist party.
	   That would force the Social Democrats to try and make a
coalition with the Pensioners and tacit support from the
Communists.
	   The possibility of a left-wing government has financial experts
and foreign investors worried, but analysts said Thursday political
instability and a hung parliament could pose an even bigger threat
to the Czech koruna.
	   Havel has welcomed the possibility of a new government, one in
which young people would play an increasingly active role.
	   ``Change is the essence of democracy,'' said Havel before
campaigning ended earlier this week. ``There is no danger of
communism returning.''

Danes in shock after referee expels three from World Cup match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The referee who handed out three red
cards during the Denmark-South Africa World Cup soccer match was a
``whistling insanity'' who left local fans in a ``red shock,''
Danish news media said Friday.
	   ``Dumb, 'dommer' (Danish for referee), dumbest,'' the B.T. daily
said about John Jairo Toro of Colombia, who expelled two Danes and
one South African in Thursday's game.
	   The Politiken daily said Toro gave ``the most miserable referee
performance in Danish soccer history.'' Toro ``whistled and tore
cards out of his pockets _ three red and seven yellow cards _ as if
he was The Law in person in some violent American movie,'' the
newspaper said.
	   Danish substitute Miklos Molnar was sent off in the 67th minute
after knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. Then Toro
showed the red card to South African substitute Alfred Phiri two
minutes later for elbowing aside Thomas Helveg.
	   In the 85th minute, another Danish substitute, Morten Wieghorst,
went off for bumping Benni McCarthy from behind and knocking him
down.
	   A Danish radio sports reporter said Toro had been ``too
zealous'' in his response to FIFA president Joseph Blatter's
complaint that referees were too lax. The Ekstra Bladet daily,
which called Toro ``a jerk'' and ``a scandal referee,'' said he
``had spoiled the game with his peculiar expulsions. Hopefully he
himself will get the red card.''
	   Denmark's 1-1 draw with South Africa left it with a good chance
to advance to the second round.

Euro will be as strong as mark, finance minister predicts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Celebrations on Friday marking the 50th
anniversary of the German mark couldn't ignore the fact that its
days are numbered.
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel and the president of the new
European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, both praised the mark for
setting stability standards that will pave the way for the new
single European currency, the euro.
	   By Jan. 1, 11 nations joining in the European currency union
will lock their exchange rates. From then on, the currencies will
essentially function as one, although the national bills and coins
will continue to circulate until 2002.
	   ``Germany isn't losing the mark, rather we're gaining the stable
currency of a huge domestic market,'' Waigel said at a gathering
ahead of Saturday's anniversary. ``The mark has paved the way for a
good future.''
	   Duisenberg said Germany's postwar monetary policies have set a
course of stability for the single currency.
	   He cited the independence of Germany's central bank, a deeply
ingrained ``stability culture,'' and popular support for the German
currency as critical factors behind the mark's success.
	   To solidify the euro's success, Duisenberg said European central
banks must adhere to financial discipline as well as pursue
structural and market-oriented reforms.
	   ``Such a policy would make it easier for the European system of
central banks to ensure long-term price stability, the best
contribution that monetary policy can give to the long-term
reduction of unemployment,'' Duisenberg said.
	   German Central Bank President Hans Tietmeyer said the euro must
build on the mark's tradition of stability if it wants to match the
mark's strong reputation.

`Mad cow' crisis may be ending, but British farmers still mad AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos LON101-104
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, England (AP) _ The worst of Britain's ``mad cow'' crisis
looks like it's over, but that brings little joy to the cattlemen
at the Newark livestock auction. They see no quick end to their
nightmare.
	   The European Commission wants to end the worldwide ban on
British beef exports that has cost the industry billions, but many
farmers say they'll believe it only when they see it.
	   After more than two years out of the global market, the folks
who raise and sell beef in rural Britain say that even if they can
resume exports, finding markets will be hard.
	   ``It's killed the job,'' laments farmer George Noble. ``It's
killed the farm jobs.''
	   The cattle moved briskly through the Newark auction ring at the
busy Wednesday morning auction, but the raucous bustle conceals the
depression gripping the industry. Farmers say they're lucky to get
two-thirds of the price they used to command.
	   Many seethe when discussing the political hurdles that lay
ahead, including stiff opposition from Germany, before British beef
can be exported again.
	   ``My views on Europe aren't printable,'' said John Iredale, a
Gainsborough farmer. ``I don't see what gives Europe the right to
ban our beef worldwide anyway.''
	   At the Newark branch of the National Farmers Union, group
secretary Andrew Smith says many cattle farmers have switched to
other products and more have dug into savings to subsidize losses.
	   That sounds painfully familiar to Tom and Maureen Goy, who cut
back their Lincolnshire herd of bulls from 200 head to 100.
	   ``You work seven days and nights, and at the end, you're living
on your savings,'' Mrs. Goy said. They came to Newark to sell three
bulls for about 400 pounds (dlrs 660) each, compared with prices of
about 600 pounds (dlrs 990) to 700 pounds (dlrs 1,155) before the
beef scare.
	   Many cattle farmers just gave up. Don Wilkinson had almost 600
head of young cattle on his farm in North Yorkshire when the
British government announced on March 20, 1996, it had found a link
between mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE, and a new variant of a fatal human brain
ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   Since the 1960s, Wilkinson had been buying baby cattle from
dairy herds then fattening them up to be sold for beef. Since dairy
herds had the most BSE problems, sales of dairy cattle for beef
were banned.
	   Wilkinson had never had a BSE cow on his farm and he figured the
troubles would blow over in a few months, so he sold about three
dozen cattle per month at a loss he would not disclose.
	   The crisis wore on, and Wilkinson ran out of cows. Now, he's
gone to work certifying the quality of products on other farms.
	   ``We were all tarnished with the same brush,'' Wilkinson said.
``It's all a bit galling.''
	   The low cattle prices spread economic troubles throughout rural
Britain.
	   ``Farmers grumble tradionally. It's part of their culture,''
said Anthony Parrott, who sells plows, trailers and John Deere
tractors from the Maltby's dealership at the Newark market. ``But
this time they've got something to grumble about.''
	   So does Parrott. The high value of the British pound has enabled
him to offer his American-made tractors for better prices, but the
market has dried up.
	   ``Tractor sales for John Deere are down by something like 47
percent from last year,'' Parrott said. ``It's a knock-on effect
all around.''
	   Clothing salesman Mike Wilson said he's even finding it hard to
keep up a good business dealing little things _ the rubber work
boots and the Barbour tweed caps worn by virtually every farmer in
the market.
	   ``They're not spending,'' Wilson said.

Second time around, Venus approaches this as `first' Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ As Venus Williams prepares for her
second Wimbledon appearance, don't bother asking about her first.
As far as she's concerned, it never happened.
	   ``I just want to make an official statement that I was not at
Wimbledon last year,'' Williams says. ``I did not play. I was never
there. This will be my first Wimbledon, and I'm really looking
forward to it.''
	   You can't blame Williams for wanting to forget.
	   Last June, she waited through five days of rain delays before
finally getting on court for her first-round match against an
unknown Polish player named Magdalena Grzybowkska.
	   Williams looked uncomfortable on the grass, dropped seven
straight games in one stretch, served 10 double faults and lost
4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Williams, who turned 18 last Wednesday, returns this year as the
sixth seed and one of the hottest properties in women's tennis.
She's joined by 16-year-old sister Serena, who is truly playing her
first Wimbledon.
	   With their beaded hair, imposing physiques and powerful games
(Venus hits serves of 120 mph (193 kph), the sisters have become
star attractions wherever they play.
	   Yet for all the progress Venus has made since last year, the
early signs are that she may have trouble again.
	   In her only grass-court match this season, she was trounced 6-2,
6-1 by doubles specialist Natasha Zvereva at the Eastbourne
tournament this week.
	   Williams again showed her inexperience on grass. She rarely came
to net and was confounded by Zvereva's off-speed slice.
	   ``I think it's pretty sad that I had to lose, but I have to move
on from this and learn from it,'' Williams said. ``I have to start
out faster and play hard from the very beginning. But sometimes
it's good to lose so you can learn. You learn more from when you
lose than when you win.''
	   Williams has been winning a lot lately. Ranked No. 204 in the
world at the start of 1997, she reached the U.S. Open final _
losing to Martina Hingis _ and finished the year at No. 22.
	   Of the eight tournaments she has played this year, she won two
and reached the final in two others. She made the quarterfinals of
the French Open, again losing to Hingis.
	   Williams' goal now is to capture her first Grand Slam title.
	   ``I'm definitely ready to win, no doubt,'' she said.
	   But doubts remain as to whether she can adapt her game to the
subtleties of grass and the wet and windy conditions so often
associated with Wimbledon.
	   ``Some days Venus can be a force and others she can be a
completely different person,'' Serena said of her sister after the
Eastbourne defeat. ``I eradicated that tendency a long time ago. I
concentrate properly on the surface involved, which is something
Venus is struggling to do.''
	   Serena has emerged as a force herself, rising to No. 22 in the
world in her first full year on the tour, and could be dangerous at
Wimbledon. Making her grass-court debut at Eastbourne, Serena won
her first two matches in straight sets over Naoko Sawamatsu and Ai
Sugiyama.
	   The Williams sisters have played each other twice, at this
year's Australian Open and Italian Open, with Venus winning both
matches. There is a chance they could meet in the fourth round at
Wimbledon, but Serena could have to beat fellow teen stars Mirjana
Lucic and Anna Kourniova to get that far.
	   The sisters are accompanied by their mother, Oracene, who's
sporting a cast after breaking her left ankle in a fall at the
Wimbledon house the family is renting.
	   Coach and father Richard Williams is back home, Serena says,
``taking care of my dogs.''
	   Dad will surely consider traveling to London if one of his
daughters closes in on the title.
	   Venus, for one, can see it happening.
	   ``My chances are a lot better than they were last year,'' she
said. ``I couldn't win it last year, remember, because I wasn't
playing.''

Senior lawmaker: No time set for START II ratification debate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the parliamentary defense committee
said Friday that a strong opposition would make it difficult to
ratify the START II arms reduction treaty and that the treaty
should include a new condition to ensure ratification.
	   Roman Popkovich, a member of the pro-government Our Home Is
Russia faction, suggested that the parliament should add a
provision that Russia would disavow the treaty if the United States
walks out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Treaty.
	   ``It will be difficult to ratify the treaty in its present
shape,'' Popkovich said at a news conference.
	   The ABM treaty is founded on the principle that a country
without a defense against long-range missiles would not launch an
attack for fear of devastating retaliation. An additional agreement
last year between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin would
allow Pentagon programs to protect U.S. troops and allies with an
anti-missile defense to go forward, but ban a space-based national
defense system.
	   However, some Republicans in the U.S. Congress back development
of a national missile defense system and said a thorough review
must precede approval of the ABM deal.
	   The Senate ratified the START II arms reduction treaty in 1996,
but the State Duma has balked, saying it would weaken Russia's
defenses and be too expensive for the cash-strapped country.
	   Popkovich backed the treaty and assailed its critics, saying
``it would be not just wrong but criminal to say that the treaty
hurts national interests.''
	   START II's opponents say they are against the treaty because it
envisages the destruction of SS-18 ballistic missiles, which carry
10 nuclear warheads each and are considered the most powerful
weapon in Russia's arsenals.
	   Russian military leaders counter that by 2007 _ the treaty's
deadline for destroying the weapons _ SS-18s will be at the end of
their service life and will have to be discarded anyway.
	   Under pressure from Communists and nationalists, the Duma
reversed its previous decision to hold parliamentary hearings on
START II this month and postponed them until the fall.
	   Popkovich said he hoped the hearings would be held in September
or October, but wouldn't say when the actual ratification debate
may be held.

For Japan's newly recruited bureaucrats, Mr. Bean is dream boss

	   TOKYO (AP) _ He sleeps with a teddy bear, speaks in a mumble and
has repulsive table manners. No matter _ Japan's newest bureaucrats
have voted Mr. Bean the ideal boss.
	   As part of an annual April welcoming ritual for fresh recruits,
new government employees were asked to pick the famous person they
would most like to serve under.
	   Mr. Bean, the goofball TV character played by British actor
Rowan Atkinson, garnered the most votes with 43 out of 439 cast.
	   Why do the top graduates of Japan's top universities _ the
mandarins of the world's second largest-economy _ admire a
character who does things like wear turkey carcasses on his head?
	   ``They picked someone opposite to the image of a typical
bureaucrat,'' Katsushi Koizumi, of the National Personnel
Authority's planning division, which conducted the survey, said
Friday.
	   Koizumi said he believes young recruits wanted to change the
image of Japanese bureaucrats _ often seen as capable but
inflexible, arrogant and totally humorless.
	   ``I think they ... want to have fun and enjoy life just like any
other Japanese,'' he said.
	   Japan's bureaucrats could do with an image change. Over the past
year, they've been blamed for mismanaging the troubled economy and
are at the center of a massive influence-peddling scandal.
	   Finishing second with 26 votes was Japan's pro baseball club
Orix BlueWave coach Akira Ogi. Last year's class took a much more
serious approach: they chose 13th century Mongol warrior Genghis
Khan.
	   While a lighter mood may be in order, there's a limit to the fun
and games.
	   ``It's good ... to try to be more flexible and have a better
sense of humor,'' said Koizumi. ``But it's a problem if they really
start acting like Mr. Bean.''

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ The capital of Guinea-Bissau awoke to heavy
bombardment Friday as artillery shells apparently fired by renegade
soldiers landed in the city center, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   After the shelling, long bursts of heavy machine-gun fire could
be heard from the area where government forces are laying siege to
rebel positions around a Bissau military garrison and the nearby
international airport, the Portuguese ambassador to Guinea-Bissau
said.
	   ``It seems ... that government forces are advancing on the
airport,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva said on
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western
tip, has been descending into civil war with regional side-effects
since former military chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane launched a
mutiny garrison in Bissau, the country's capital, on June 7.
	   Da Silva said the fighting in Bissau had subsided by mid-morning
and only Red Cross and military vehicles were on the city's
streets.
	   He also said all efforts at mediation had failed.
	   Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe reportedly left the
country Thursday after Mane's rebels snubbed his offer of talks.
	   Talks proposed last week by religious and political leaders also
failed.
	   Thousands of villagers, meanwhile, have been fleeing a barrage
of rocket and artillery shells in northern Guinea-Bissau, heading
for the Senegalese border.
	   The intense assault, which began Wednesday night and continued
into Thursday, was directed at Ingore and Bula, villages just miles
south of the Senegalese border.
	   It was not clear who launched the attack, although the
Senegalese army _ fighting on behalf of President Joao Bernardo
Vieira _ had been firing artillery across the border in recent
days.
	   Senegal's army has sent troops and artillery fire across the
border, and troops from the Republic of Guinea, south of
Guinea-Bissau, have been fighting for the loyalists.
	   In a clandestine broadcast, rebel spokesman Maj. Manuel De
Santos Gomes said Thursday his forces ``are sure of our victory''
in their quest to oust Vieira.
	   ``We are regrouping our forces and planning an offensive on
Bissau once the civilians have all left,'' he said in the
broadcast, monitored in the Senegalese border town of Mpak.
	   The renegade soldiers accuse Vieira of corruption and demand he
step down. They have also vowed to retaliate against the loyalists
attacks.
	   Bissau has been pounded by heavy artillery and mortar fire since
the fighting began, and witnesses and aid groups say more than
three-quarters of its 300,000 residents have fled.
	   The United Nations refugee agency said Friday it had sent an
emergency team to the Senegalese border area. Spokesman Kris
Janowski also said from Geneva that boats were still arriving in
Dakar, Senegal's capital, with foreign nationals who have left
Bissau.
	   France and Portugal, meanwhile, announced Friday that they would
be coordinating humanitarian aid to the country.

Clerides repeats demilitarization offer to ease tension 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus has proposed demilitarizing the
war-divided island as a way to reduce escalating tension with
Turkey, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   President Glafcos Clerides reiterated the longstanding offer in
a letter Thursday to the U.N. secretary-general ``with concrete
proposals and a timetable,'' spokesman Christos Stylianides said.
	   He did not offer details.
	   Tension escalated this week after Turkey sent six warplanes and
naval units to the northern-occupied part of the island in
retaliation for the visit of six Greek planes to the government
controlled south earlier in the week.
	   The last of the six Turkish F-16s left Friday, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency said.
	   ``We have proved through these specific proposals that we are
for the reduction of tension,'' Stylianides said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake of
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Thursday that Greece's
dispatch of the planes ``exhibited its offensive intentions against
Turkey. It is out of the question for Turkey not to respond.''
	   But Stylianides defended the visit by the Greek planes, saying
it was ``perfectly legal within the framework of the joint defense
pact Cyprus has with Greece.''
	   He dismissed the likelihood of a military clash.

Australian foreign minister begins Thai visit

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Australian government is committed
to growing ties with Asia despite rising anti-Asian sentiment at
home, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Friday.
	   Downer is on a two-day official visit to Thailand to meet the
twelve-nation grouping the Friends of Cambodia and other countries
trying to mediate the Cambodian conflict on behalf of Southeast
Asian nations.
	   The visit comes in the wake of a strong showing by the One
Nation party of Pauline Hanson last Saturday in a Queensland state
election.
	   Hanson claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by
Asians'' and opposes immigration. The depth of her support among
Australians was thought to be minor, but her party won about 23
percent of the vote in the poll.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with Thai Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan, Downer said the government repudiates Hanson's
protectionist policy, ``which will cost Australia lots of jobs.''
	   ``We are committed to Australia being a strong contributor to
Asia as we have been for past several years,'' he said.
	   Downer said he regretted that Hanson's electoral success was
drawing so much attention and commentary from Thailand's
English-language newspapers.
	   ``We obviously would rather not have the headlines that you get
out of people saying the sort of thing that Ms. Hanson and some of
her colleagues have said,'' he told reporters. ``The vast majority
of Australians don't go along with this sort of nonsense.''
	   Surin agreed that Hanson's popularity was not a sign of a swing
to the right in Australia.
	   ``We have been reassured by Minister Downer that the phenomenon
in Queensland in no way reflects the position and policy of the
government in Canberra,'' he said.
	   ``We understand, as it's explained to us, that it's an
expression, one expression of frustration of some portion of the
population,'' said Surin. ``It could happen anywhere.''

New grass on Center Court, but same rainy weather possible AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Coming off the wettest Wimbledon in
history, head groundsman Eddie Seaward won't venture a guess about
the weather prospects for this year's tournament.
	   ``I haven't really got a clue,'' he said. ``I don't look
long-run. If I did, I'd just get paranoid about it.''
	   Frankly, it doesn't look good.
	   It has rained almost daily in southern England for the last
three weeks, disrupting all the Wimbledon warmup tournaments and
Wimbledon qualifying.
	   And the London Weather Center doesn't see much immediate
improvement.
	   ``Naturally it's a wee bit too far ahead to be sure, but mild
with showers would probably describe the first days,'' the duty
forecaster said. ``Typical British summer.''
	   Last year, rain washed out all play for two days in a row for
the first time since 1909. And for only the second time in
tournament history, officials scheduled matches on the middle
Sunday, usually a rest day, to help clear the backlog.
	   At this week's draw, Wimbledon referee Alan Mills announced that
Pete Sampras is scheduled to play the first match on Center Court
at 2 p.m. on Monday _ ``we hope.''
	   Weather permitting, Center Court is ready with new grass.
	   The world's most famous tennis court, re-laid for the first time
in almost 40 years, gets its first match with Sampras against
Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty.
	   ``Visually, you won't notice a change and our experience is that
the ball will bounce very well,'' said Seaward, who heads a crew of
23 groundsmen, plus 120 students who pull the covers on and off the
courts.
	   ``Nobody knows for sure the last time Center Court was done
over, but an old groundsman called and said it was 1960,'' he said.
	   In the vanguard of wet-weather technology, the All England Club
has put in two huge fans at each end of Center Court and has also
installed a new, more translucent rain cover.
	   ``We're giving the court every chance with more ventilation and
more light even when it rains,'' Seaward said.
	   Despite the non-stop rain leading up to Wimbledon, Seaward said
Wimbledon's two-dozen courts had been covered ``at night and when
it rains and are ready as ever.''
	   ``If the weather is good, this job is a lot more relaxed,'' he
said. ``Otherwise, it's always on the go with everyone else
waiting.''

Opposition parties renew threat to boycott Cambodian polls 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two opposition leaders on Friday
renewed a threat to boycott Cambodia's upcoming elections if
minimum conditions are not met for a free and fair poll three weeks
before the vote takes place.
	   Leaders of the Sam Rainsy Party and the Son Sann Party said in a
statement released Friday that killings of opposition activists
continue and that politically motivated murders have consistently
gone unpunished.
	   Opposition party organizers in the provinces are being
threatened and intimidated by ``thugs'' within Cambodian leader Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party, they charged, and legal
institutions remain stacked in favor of the country's strongman.
	   ``Unless there is a commitment by the government and the
National Election Commission to improve the electoral process, the
undersigned leaders of opposition parties will declare on July 5
... that their parties will not take part in a July 26 election,''
they wrote.
	   The new threat to withdraw from the electoral process was
released in Phnom Penh as the so-called Friends of Cambodia, an
grouping of Western and Asian countries seeking an end to
Cambodia's continuing political unrest, were scheduled to meet this
weekend in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The Friends of Cambodia is expected to consider whether or not
the electoral process is so flawed that free and fair polls are not
possible.
	   Seeking to counter the concerns which have in recent days been
voiced by government critics, the ruling Cambodian People's Party
meanwhile boasted that over 98 percent of all eligible voters have
thus far registered to take part in the polls.
	   ``This is a clear proof of the political rights freedom,
democracy and will of the Cambodian people,'' the party said in a
communique released Friday.
	   Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert called on the government to provide
main opposition parties fair and equitable access to the electronic
media, saying that so far, ``media access is doled out in token
amounts (to opposition political parties) while the ruling party
has free rein.''
	   They also demanded the right to assemble, and said citizens who
have been left out of the registration process _ allegedly
supporters of the opposition _ must be given an opportunity to
vote.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a coup one year ago, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-brokered elections in 1993.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed in the
months that followed, apparently by Hun Sen's forces. Fearing for
their lives, Ranariddh and scores of his loyalists fled the
country.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been held back after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to
proceed with a new election on July 26. Under pressure from foreign
aid donors, he allowed Ranariddh to return to participate.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a
veteran of a 30-year struggle for his nation's independence, Friday
said war is no solution to his country's border conflict with
Ethiopia.
	   ``We don't have any intention of escalating this war,'' he said.
``Any battle you would call the mother of battles, the mother of
wars, will never happen. It's bluffing.''
	   ``Let's put our alliance back in place so that we contribute to
each other's stability and to the stability of the region,'' he
said.
	   But the spokesman for a team of African leaders trying to
mediate the crisis said Friday in neighboring Ethiopia that their
shuttle diplomacy had been unsuccessful since Eritrea continued to
reject a four-point proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda as a basis for direct talks.
	   ``The Eritrean side stated clearly the facilitation process was
over. From this point of view, therefore, the delegation was not
able at this juncture to make headway with respect to the
facilitators' recommendations,'' Salim A. Salim, secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity, told reporters.
	   But Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, a member of the OAU
team, told The Associated Press the team had received assurances of
restraint from both sides.
	   ``We've got a commitment from both sides that they accept to
restrain from hostility while the mission of the OAU is trying to
get a solution,'' Bizimungu said.
	   The OAU delegation met both Meles and Isaias Thursday, then
returned to Addis Ababa. Bizimungu said committees would be set up
to study the core problems and that heads of state would return to
the region in a month.
	   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso are also on the team.
	   ``It is very unrealistic to expect that there would be dramatic
change overnight or in a matter or hours,'' Isaias told reporters,
adding the talks were ``exciting and fruitful'' despite the impasse
in the 6-week border conflict between the two countries that has
resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.
	   Ethiopia has agreed to the four-point proposal, which includes a
provision that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas before peace
talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory in accordance with new boundaries it
says were established when Eritrea became independent in 1993.
	   Isaias also condemned Ethiopia for failing to honor a
U.S.-brokered moratorium on air strikes and the threat of air
strikes. Despite the Sunday agreement, Ethiopia is reported to have
told airlines this week that they must advise Ethiopia 10 minutes
before entering Eritrean air space, a civil aviation source said.
	   In a proposal outlined Thursday to the OAU delegation, Isaias
called for demilitarization of conflict zones within a month,
monitored by foreign observers and representatives of both sides.
Troops would be pulled out of the hotly contested Badme region
first.
	   Ethiopians have demanded that their armed militiamen patrol
areas they believe are rightfully theirs.
	   The U.N. Cartographic Section, or other appropriate body, would
have six months to demarcate the boundary between the neighboring
countries ``in accordance with existing colonial border treaties,''
under the Eritrean plan.
	   At the news conference, Isaias said ``We believe the boundaries
are the most clearly defined boundaries ever in Africa, and there
is no controversy. But let's give our Ethiopian colleagues the
benefit of the doubt to come with a claim on the boundaries.''
	   The border conflict that broke out in early May has claimed
hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea,
wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Swiss biologist, a Japanese mathematician and an
American artist have won the 1998 Kyoto Prizes, a Japanese award
for advances in the arts and sciences.
	   The winners _ Dr. Kurt Wuthrich of Switzerland, Dr. Kiyoshi Ito
of Japan and Nam June Paik, a Korean-born American _ were announced
Friday by the Inamori Foundation, which gives the prizes.
	   The advanced technology prize went to Wuthrich, a biologist, for
his work in establishing a new methodology for studying structural
biology.
	   The prize for basic science went to Ito for establishing a
mathematical theory that is now used in a variety of areas ranging
from physics to economics.
	   Paik was given the award in creative arts for achievements in
the field of video art, which he introduced over 30 years ago.
	   The foundation was established in 1984 by Kazuo Inamori,
chairman of Kyocera Corp., a manufacturer of industrial ceramics.
The prizes include a gold medal and 50 million yen (dlrs 435,000).
The awards were first presented in 1985.
	   The prizes will be awarded at a ceremony to be held in the
western Japan city of Kyoto on Nov. 10.

REPEATING Batting first, Sri Lanka make 243 for 6 against India

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A splendid third wicket stand of 145
runs between Aravinda de Silva and Marvan Atapattu led Sri Lanka to
243 for 6 in 50 overs against India in the first match of the
3-nation Independence Cup cricket tournament Friday.
	   The pair propped up the side from a shaky 50 for 2, as De Silva
made 97 off 119 balls and Atapattu stroked 70 in 89 balls with six
fours.
	   Their stand was broken by Anil Kumble who came on for a new
spell to bowl Atapattu as he attempted to square-drive a delivery.
	   De Silva was out in the 49th over, caught by Mohammed Azharuddin
at mid-wicket off their new fast bowling discovery Ajit Agarkar
after hitting five fours and one six.
	   India succeeded in neutralizing explosive Sri Lankan opener
Sanath Jayasuriya early in the innings when Agarkar took the left
hander by surprise and clean bowled him with a faster delivery.
	   Jayasuriya made just 12 runs after smashing the first ball of
the innings from Agarkar to the cover boundary.
	   Co-opener Romesh Kaluwitharana did some lusty hitting to
overcome the setback, but was out when he drove a ball from off
spinner Harbhajan Singh and was caught by Agarkar. He made 29 runs
in 34 balls with three fours.
	   New Zealand is the third team in the tournament.

Four men win Spain's big prize for fighting poverty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Four men were named winners of Spain's
Prince of Asturias Prize Friday for their work with the poor.
	   Lauding their ``struggle against poverty in the world,'' the
jury awarded the Concord Prize to Mohammad Yunus of Bangladesh and
Spaniards Vicente Ferrer, Nicolas Castellanos and Joaquin Sanz
Gadea. The Concord Prize is the seventh of eight Prince of Asturias
prizes being granted this year.
	   Yunus, 58, was cited for founding the Grameen Bank 20 years ago.
Since then, it has loaned dlrs 1.5 billion to 2.1 million borrowers
in 36,000 villages.
	   Yunus' bank introduced the concept of ``microloans'' to help the
poor start small businesses. He also launched a project last year
to put at least one cellular phone in each of Bangladesh's 65,000
villages within six years.
	   Missionaries Ferrer and Castellanos were honored for their work
in India, while Sanz was praised for medical work in several
hospitals in Congo, Africa.
	   The Prince of Asturias Prize ranks nearly as high in the
Spanish-speaking world as the Nobel Prize and awards are given in
several fields, including science, the arts and sports.
	   Crown Prince Felipe of Asturias will present the winners 5
million pesetas (dlrs 34,000) and a sculpture by Spanish artist
Joan Miro during an October ceremony in this northern Spanish city.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A day after six Russian peacekeepers
were injured in a mine blast in breakaway Abkhazia, the Russian
Defense Ministry on Friday ordered the force to start using weapons
if the troops' safety is threatened.
	   The peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier struck a road mine
in the Ghali district, the site of recent fighting between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.
	   ``This is already the fifth case of illegal terrorist or
diversionary acts against the peacekeepers or the United Nations
observers,'' said a statement by the peacekeepers' press service,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, despite repeated protests by the peacekeepers'
command, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides are not taking the
necessary measures for ensuring the normal functioning of the
peacekeeping force in the region,'' the statement said.
	   While allowing the peacekeepers to use weapons would not have
prevented the mine blast, Interfax said the Defense Ministry cited
the incident as grounds for its orders to ``tighten the regime of
carrying out service'' and to use weapons in case of a ``real
threat'' to peacekeepers' safety.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
Russian peacekeepers' presence.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Russian officials, led by Boris
Berezovsky, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, held talks in the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi with Abkhazian
leader Vladislav Ardzinba and an envoy from Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Berezovsky said the leaders came up with new proposals but he
declined to elaborate, Interfax reported.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled Abkhazia during the
fighting in the Ghali region last month.
	   Georgia has been pushing for the refugees' immediate,
unconditional return. Abkhazia has stalled, saying it needs time to
build new housing and screen the returning refugees to ensure that
they do not include pro-Georgian militants.
	   The United States, France, Germany and Russia have warned the
Abkhazian government that its continued refusal to allow the
refugees to return would amount to a deliberate campaign to rid the
area of ethnic Georgians.
	   Elsewhere in Georgia, unidentified gunmen opened fire on the
border with Russia on Thursday, prompting officials to close the
Verkhny Lars checkpoint to road traffic on Friday, Interfax said.
	   Five people were wounded in the shooting on the border with the
restive Russian region of Ingushetia.

Mubarak says he turned down offer to buy nuclear bomb 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After the fall of the Soviet Union, Egypt was
offered to buy nuclear weapons, Israeli peace activists on Friday
quoted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as telling them.
	   Mubarak said he turned down the offer because he did not want
his country to join the nuclear arms race, according to Motti
Awerbach, one of six members of the Israeli Peace Now group who met
with Mubarak on June 9 in Cairo.
	   During the two-hour meeting, Mubarak was asked by his visitors
whether he was concerned about last months nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan.
	   Mubarak proposed that the international community propose a plan
to destroy all weapons of mass destruction over the next 15 to 20
years, said Awerbach who took notes in the meeting.
	   ``It is easy to buy nuclear weapons,'' Awerbach quoted Mubarak
as saying, after referring to his notes.
	   ``After the fall of the Soviet bloc, I could have bought a bomb.
I was offered one, and I refused,'' Awerbach quoted Mubarak as
saying.
	   Mubarak did not say who offered him the nuclear weapons.

Eds: UPDATES with Finance Minister pledging to stabilize financial

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two days after dramatically stepping into world
currency markets to boost the sagging yen, American and Japanese
finance officials vowed Friday to intervene again if necessary, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   Visiting Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met
Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, and both
welcomed the effects of Wednesday's joint action to halt the yen's
free fall.
	   ``The minister and I had very good talks'' Summers told
reporters after a 40-minute meeting on Japan's strategy for
reviving its moribund economy.
	   Summers urged Japan to move quickly to solve its bad loan
problem and restore health to its financial system, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Later Friday, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Japan would
``take all possible measures to stabilize the financial system.''
	   His remarks seemed aimed at allaying fears of there would be
more bank failures following dramatic declines in bank stocks on
the Tokyo exchange Thursday and Friday.
	   ``There is no evidence that (a) Japanese bank might fail,'' he
said at an impromptu press conference.
	   In talks earlier Friday, Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told
Summers that disposing of soured loans is vital to sparking an
economic recovery, the central bank said in a statement.
	   Rampant lending during Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy of
the late 1980s have saddled banks with about 76 trillion yen (dlrs
563 billion) in bad loans. A half-a-dozen major financial
institutions have failed in the last two years under the weight of
irrecoverable loans.
	   According to the Finance Ministry, Summers did not ask Japan
specifically to cut taxes to boost the economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and implement a permanent income tax cut
to get the recession-plagued economy back on track, as critics have
urged.
	   Hashimoto made the decision after his telephone conversation
Wednesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Mainichi newspaper
reported, saying he will announce the move before elections for the
upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   In a luncheon meeting, Summers and senior officials of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party discussed strategies to dispose of
soured loans such as creating an institution to take over the loans
and to manage their liquidation, the Nikkei news service said.
	   Summers also told LDP officials that it is more important for
Japan to stimulate the economy than to put the country's finances
in order by tightening spending, the Nikkei said.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo after the yen plummeted earlier this week to an eight-year
low against the U.S. dollar, raising fears of another bout of
currency devaluations around Asia.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar dipped slightly in Friday afternoon trading to 136.84
yen, down 0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo.
	   In a meeting earlier with Deputy Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro
Nukaga, Summers urged Japan to jump start its economy and dispose
of bad debts before next month's elections, the Nikkei news service
reported.
	   Friday's series of high-level meetings began with discussions
between Summers and Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. The two
applauded the success of the joint intervention to stop the yen's
slide.
	   ``The United States and Japan share a very strong interest in a
return to sustained growth in the Asian continent,'' Summers told
reporters after the meeting.
	   In a meeting late Thursday, Summers and Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, stressed the
need for close cooperation to stabilize both the yen and regional
currencies, the Nihon Keizai economic daily reported Friday.
	   Summers and Sakakibara also agreed that structural reform in
Japan's financial sector was essential to restoring calm to the
currency market, the newspaper said.
	   Shortly before Summers arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a nationally televised press
conference that Japan's economy would recover after the government
implements its latest stimulus plan.
	   ``Japan has fallen into a state of excessive lack of
confidence,'' Hashimoto said. ``These are very hard times.''
	   Japan will also host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation. Summers will attend that meeting as well.

Batting first, Sri Lanka make 243 for 6 against India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A third wicket stand of 145 runs
between Aravinda de Silva and Marvan Atapattu led Sri Lanka to 243
for 6 in 50 overs against India in the first match of the
three-nation Independence Cup cricket tournament on Friday.
	   The pair propped up the side from a shaky 50 for 2, as De Silva
made 97 off 119 balls and Atapattu stroked 70 in 89 balls with six
fours.
	   Their stand was broken by Anil Kumble who came on for a new
spell to bowl Atapattu as he attempted to square-drive a delivery.
	   De Silva was out in the 49th over, caught by Mohammed Azharuddin
at mid-wicket off their new fast-bowling discovery Ajit Agarkar
after hitting five fours and one six.
	   India succeeded in neutralizing explosive Sri Lankan opener
Sanath Jayasuriya early in the innings when Agarkar took the
left-hander by surprise and clean-bowled him with a faster
delivery.
	   Jayasuriya made just 12 runs after smashing the first ball of
the innings from Agarkar to the cover boundary.
	   Co-opener Romesh Kaluwitharana did some lusty hitting to
overcome the setback, but was out when he drove a ball from
off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and was caught by Agarkar. He made 29
runs in 34 balls with three fours.
	   New Zealand is the third team in the tournament.

Kournikova out with thumb injury; Sanchez Vicario into final 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario is into the
final of the Eastbourne grass-court tournament, but another
Wimbledon favorite Anna Kournikova is out with a thumb injury.
	   Sanchez Vicario beat American Serena Williams in three sets
Friday to reach the semifinals. Kournikova withdrew to rest a right
thumb she injured in her quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf on
Thursday.
	   The Russian was to have played Sanchez Vicario in Friday's
seminfinals.
	   In the other quarterfinal, Jana Novotna advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-4, 7-5 win over fifth seed Irina Spirlea of
Romania. The top-seeded Czech was to meet Natasha Zvereva of
Belarus in the other semifinal later Friday.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, beat Graf 6-7
(4-7), 6-3, 6-4 but fell during the match and injured her right
thumb.
	   The 17-year-old Russian said X-rays had shown there were no
problems but, as a precaution, she withdrew from a doubles
quarterfinal Thursday evening and the singles Friday.
	   Third-seeded Sanchez Vicario completed her quarterfinal match
against Williams Friday after the match was tied 1-1 when rain
stopped play Thursday.
	   Sanchez Vicario's experience proved the difference in her 4-6,
6-4, 6-4 win over the teen-age American, who was playing her first
tournament on grass.
	   It was Williams' third loss this year to Sanchez Vicario and
followed a tense battle at the French Open in which Sanchez Vicario
accused the 16-year-old of showing no respect for other players.
	   The Spaniard broke to lead 4-3 in the third set but was broken
back in the next game after holding three game points. She
responded by breaking serve to love to lead 5-4, and claimed a two
hour 12 minute victory with a pass as a desperate Williams rushed
the net.
	   Although Williams tested Sanchez Vicario with a fierce forehand,
the Spaniard responded in kind and both players were often at full
stretch in some fiercely contested rallies.
	   But Williams was often careless with her volleys, one of which
missed the court completely and had spectators at the back of the
court diving for cover.
	   Williams had her right thigh strapped, and also received
treatment to her lower right calf during play Thursday.
	   ``It's a little serious in some areas,'' Williams said. ``I had
my knee taped today, and my ankle and the side of my leg.''
	   ``It would have been tough for me to continue on in the next
rounds, but I'll definitely be all right for Wimbledon.''
	   Despite the nagging injuries on grass, Williams said she was
growing accustomed to it.
	   ``I'm getting used to it and feeling very comfortable on it,''
she said.
	   ``I'm playing pretty well on it and like the grass a lot. It's
definitely going to be one of my favorite surfaces.''
	   Williams said grass forced a player to attack and that was good
for her game.
	   ``It forces me to come forward a little more and that's exactly
what I need. At Wimbledon, whatever I do I have to always play my
game,'' she said.
	   `` I know if I do what I'm told I will come out victorious.''

Uganda to develop bird-watching as tourist attraction 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda hopes to use its more than 1,000
species of birds to attract bird-watching tourists to the East
African nation, a newspaper said Friday.
	   ``Uganda has a phenomenal potential for avi-tourism development,
and the Uganda Tourism Board has done several things to promote
it,'' the board's marketing adviser Shaun Mann told the daily New
Vision.
	   Mann said the UTB planned to spend dlrs 165,000 on developing
tourist bird-watching or avi-tourism. The funds come from a dlrs
500,000 grant from the European Union to help tourism grow in
Uganda.
	   Tourism centered on big game once thrived in Uganda but went
into decline during two decades of civil strife that began in 1972
and ended in the late 1980s after President Yoweri Museveni seized
power in 1986 after a five-year bush war.
	   Mann said just 100 bird-watchers visited Uganda last year, but
with proper promotion, avi-tourism could turn into a source of
considerable revenue for the country.
	   Most of the 1,076 species of birds in Uganda are found in Queen
Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda near Lake Edward where
the tourism board plans to build a bird observatory with some of
the funds.
	   ``Unless we embark on a diversification program, we cannot
ensure a continued and sustained flow of tourists by presenting a
predictable product again and again,'' UTB chairman Peter Kamya
said.

World Cup: Austrians head for beach in run up to crucial match 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ARSAC, France (AP) _ With its two draws in two games, Austria
must win Tuesday against Italy, the most feared team in its group,
to have a realistic chance of advancing. So how are they preparing
for the match?
	   By going to the beach.
	   ``Some of the players went for a swim in the Atlantic today,''
Wolfgang Gramann, the Austria squad spokesman, said Friday.
``Others are just hanging out in their hotel, and some have gone
sightseeing in Bordeaux.''
	   The team had a light workout on Thursday, one day after its 1-1
draw against Chile. But coach Herbert Prohaska _ apparently
thinking that a rest was more beneficial than more training _ gave
the Austrians a day off Friday.
	   ``We came up with good efforts,'' Prohaska said of the draws
against Cameroon and favored Chile.
	   Many of the 22-man squad went to the Atlantic beach, about 60
kilometers (35 miles) west of their base.
	   Other activities included a motorbike tour for midfielder Martin
Amerhauser and keeper Michael Konsel; golfing for backup keeper
Franz Wohlfahrt, Harald Cerny and Andreas Heraf, and sightseeing in
Bordeaux for midfielder Ivica Vastic, who got the equalizer against
Chile, Martin Hiden, Dietmar Kuehbauer and Peter Stoger.
	   Defender Wolfgang Feiersinger and midfielder Anton Pfeffer opted
to laze around in their exclusive quarters in Arsac, a pretty,
wine-growing town north of Bordeaux.
	   ``The team has earned its rest,'' Gramann said. ``It has proven
both against Chile and Cameroon that it can deliver 91 minutes of
good soccer.''
	   In both its matches, Austria gained a point with late
equalizers.
	   Gramann said the mood was positive four days ahead of the game
with Italy, the group leader with three points.
	   With the Austrian game improving each time it faces a World Cup
opponent, ``there is justified hope'' of a win against Italy on
Tuesday, he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified assailants shelled a police vehicle
in the restive Caucasus region of Dagestan, killing two officers, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   Police also found the body of a resident of nearby Khasavyurt,
who was believed to have been killed for witnessing the attack on
Thursday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   However, the Interfax news agency said four people were killed
in the attack on the police car near Khasavyurt _ a policeman, his
driver and two civilians.
	   The killings brought the number of policemen killed on duty in
Dagestan in the last year and a half to 35, ITAR-Tass said, citing
the press service of the Interior Ministry.
	   Dagestan, a poverty-stricken and crime-ridden republic near the
breakaway region of Chechnya, has been swept by increasing unrest
recently. About 90 percent of adult males are unemployed, and there
have been numerous conflicts between the region's numerous ethnic
groups.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An ammunition dump fire that killed at least 12
servicemen and a fireman in the Ural Mountains was still smoldering
Friday but posed no further danger, a news agency reported.
	   The fire broke out Wednesday when the military compound in
Losiny, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of Moscow, was struck by
lightning.
	   The fire and explosions destroyed about half of more than 200
tons of landmines, artillery shells and rockets belonging to the
Russian troops withdrawn from Eastern Germany, Russian news reports
said.
	   The fire also consumed more than 200 hectares (500 acres) of
forest surrounding the compound.
	   Firefighting efforts were held back by continuing munitions
explosions, but servicemen brought the blaze under control with the
help of an Il-76 plane from the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
The plane made six flights over the compound, pouring 240 tons of
water on the flames.
	   Most of the more than 1,500 residents of nearby villages who
were evacuated on Wednesday had returned to their homes by Friday.
Power and water, which had been cut because of the fires, have also
been restored.
	   Rescue workers were still looking for one soldier who has been
missing. Seventeen servicemen were hospitalized with injuries.
	   The 44-year old ammunition depot chief Lt.-Col Sergei Zhuikov
was among the victims. He died while trying to control the fire.

Eritrean president calls for peaceful resolution of Ethiopian border conflict

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a
veteran of a 30-year struggle for his nation's independence, Friday
said war is no solution to his country's border conflict with
Ethiopia.
	   ``We don't have any intention of escalating this war,'' he said.
``Any battle you would call the mother of battles, the mother of
wars, will never happen. It's bluffing.''
	   ``Let's put our alliance back in place so that we contribute to
each other's stability and to the stability of the region,'' he
said.
	   But the spokesman for a team of African leaders trying to
mediate the crisis said Friday in neighboring Ethiopia that their
shuttle diplomacy had been unsuccessful since Eritrea continued to
reject a four-point proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda as a basis for direct talks.
	   ``The Eritrean side stated clearly the facilitation process was
over. From this point of view, therefore, the delegation was not
able at this juncture to make headway with respect to the
facilitators' recommendations,'' Salim A. Salim, secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity, told reporters.
	   But Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, a member of the OAU
team, told The Associated Press the team had received assurances of
restraint from both sides.
	   ``We've got a commitment from both sides that they accept to
restrain from hostility while the mission of the OAU is trying to
get a solution,'' Bizimungu said.
	   The OAU delegation met both Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and Isaias Thursday, then returned to Addis Ababa. Bizimungu
said committees would be set up to study the core problems and that
heads of state would return to the region in a month.
	   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso are also on the team.
	   ``It is very unrealistic to expect that there would be dramatic
change overnight or in a matter or hours,'' Isaias told reporters,
adding the talks were ``exciting and fruitful'' despite the impasse
in the 6-week border conflict between the two countries that has
resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.
	   Ethiopia has agreed to the four-point proposal, which includes a
provision that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas before peace
talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
Ethiopia claims the territory in accordance with new boundaries it
says were established when Eritrea became independent in 1993.
	   Isaias also condemned Ethiopia for failing to honor a
U.S.-brokered moratorium on air strikes and the threat of air
strikes. Despite the Sunday agreement, Ethiopia is reported to have
told airlines this week that they must advise Ethiopia 10 minutes
before entering Eritrean air space, a civil aviation source said.
	   In a proposal outlined Thursday to the OAU delegation, Isaias
called for demilitarization of conflict zones within a month,
monitored by foreign observers and representatives of both sides.
Troops would be pulled out of the hotly contested Badme region
first.
	   Ethiopians have demanded that their armed militiamen patrol
areas they believe are rightfully theirs.
	   The U.N. Cartographic Section, or other appropriate body, would
have six months to demarcate the boundary between the neighboring
countries ``in accordance with existing colonial border treaties,''
under the Eritrean plan.
	   At the news conference, Isaias said ``We believe the boundaries
are the most clearly defined boundaries ever in Africa, and there
is no controversy. But let's give our Ethiopian colleagues the
benefit of the doubt to come with a claim on the boundaries.''
	   The border conflict that broke out in early May has claimed
hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea,
wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

After ping-pong diplomacy with China, soccer diplomacy with Iran?

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Twenty years of hostility can't be set
aside with the tweet of a referee's whistle. Yet when the United
States and Iran meet in the World Cup on Sunday, it will be
something more than a soccer game and something less than the
ultimate diplomatic breakthrough.
	   It will be the latest example of two bitter enemies meeting in
sport and hoping it will encourage a thaw in official relations.
	   Last winter, a team of American wrestlers went to Tehran for a
tournament and received a warm welcome. In the spring, Iranians
wrestled in a tournament in Oklahoma. There was talk of a parallel
with the ping-pong diplomacy of the 1970s, which used U.S. sports
teams to open the doors to China.
	   But the World Cup match in Lyon, France, is somehow different,
as was underscored from the highest levels of American diplomacy
this week.
	   In a major overture, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held
out the olive branch to the Iranian government, responding to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's call for non-governmental
exchanges to improves.
	   ``As the wall of mistrust comes down, we can develop with the
Islamic republic, when it is ready, a road map leading to normal
relations,'' Albright said in a speech this week in New York.
	   It came just four days before the Iran-U.S. game, the first time
these allies-turned-adversaries have met on a soccer field. On
Thursday, President Clinton made a direct link between the game and
an easing of political tensions.
	   ``I hope it can be another step toward ending the estrangement
between our nations,'' Clinton said.
	   Shortly after Khatami's overture to Washington last year, the
wrestlers became the first American athletes to visit Iran since
the Islamic revolution and taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy
in 1979. Competing in the international Takhti tournament in
February, they got a rousing welcome from Iranian fans and VIP
treatment by the Iranian government.
	   ``We had a lot of trepidation,'' said Larry Sciacchetano,
president of USA Wrestling. ``I fully respect that religious groups
didn't want us there. But they respected the fact that we were
there for sports, not politics.''
	   The visit broke a taboo on high-profile U.S. visits to Iran, and
a week later a group of American academics went to Iran to attend a
conference.
	   The sports thaw has not been entirely without friction. When
Iranian wrestlers went to compete in the United States in April,
instead of getting a taste of American hospitality they were
photographed and fingerprinted by immigration authorities on
arrival at O'Hare Airport in Chicago.
	   Iran's foreign minister was not amused.
	   Sports exchanges may have helped Iran-U.S. relations. But the
road ahead might be long, because there is still a lot of animosity
in the 20-year standoff between Iran and the United States.
	   Iranians can't forgive the United States for supporting the
dictatorial rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown
in the revolution led by the late Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   Washington severed ties with the new revolutionary government
after militants loyal to Khomeini stormed the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   For Americans, there is the unforgettable image of the militants
parading blindfolded and handcuffed U.S. hostages before television
cameras.
	   Iranians can't forget that a U.S. warship, USS Vincennes, shot
down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988,
killing 290 people. The naval captain said the plane was shot down
by mistake.
	   Despite the conflict between governments, many Iranians never
truly hated Americans, and have largely welcomed their president's
calls for better relations.
	   Iran's World Cup coach, Jalal Talebi, said his team will go out
of its way to show its goodwill to U.S. players on the day of the
match. Asked what he would do, he said: ``Let me surprise you.''
	   With soccer fans around the world watching the televised match,
Iranian players are expected to hand out flowers to the U.S. team,
as they did with Yugoslav players in their last match.
	   In Tehran, hard-line opponents of Khatami have demanded that the
government instruct players not to exchange jerseys with the
Americans after the game. But Talebi put that concern to rest.
	   ``If an American player comes up to an Iranian player after the
game and wants to exchange T-shirts, I don't think we'll say no.
We'll be more than happy to do that,'' he said in fluent English.
	   It is probably no coincidence that Talebi, an acquaintance of
U.S. team coach Steve Sampson, is Iran's World Cup coach.
	   Talebi, chosen less than a month ago to head Iran in its first
World Cup appearance in 20 years, has a home in California where he
has lived off and on since 1983 with his Iranian wife and three
sons.
	   Low key, professional and relaxed around Americans, Talebi
represents one aspect of Iran that the government has chosen to
portray.
	   ``We have come here to play soccer, and to show that we have no
problems with anyone,'' he said.

Historian Rene Remond elected to Academie Francaise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rene Remond, a historian who headed a commission to
investigate files on Jews compiled by French police during World
War II, has been elected to the Academie Francaise.
	   Remond, who turns 80 this year, is best known for lively
historical analyses that take into account a wide range of
political, religious, social and cultural factors.
	   The Academie Francaise, or French Academy, gathers the nation's
top intellectuals. Its members are viewed as watchdogs who
safeguard the French language and culture.
	   A graduate of the elite Ecole Normale Superieure, Remond taught
history at the Sorbonne and the prestigious Institut des Sciences
Politiques.
	   He established his reputation with a study of French rightist
political parties.
	   But he is perhaps best known for being named, in 1996, to study
the Jewish files compiled by French police to track, arrest and
deport Jews from the Paris area between 1940-44.
	   He first became a household name in 1989, when Lyon's Cardinal
Albert Decourtray asked him to open an investigation into the Roman
Catholic Church's role in sheltering Paul Touvier, the French
militia chief who worked with the Gestapo during World War II.
	   Under Remond's supervision, the church's archives were opened
for the first time.
	   Touvier, who lived in hiding for more than 40 years before
police arrested him in a Catholic monastery, was convicted of
crimes against humanity in 1994.

World Cup: Romania closes ranks before England game 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) - Never talkative or open to media requests
for interviews, Romanian players and officials have decided that
the best strategy for the upcoming game against England is total
discretion.
	   ``They closed up like an oyster,'' said a frustrated Romanian
reporter, trying to get a glimpse through a metal fence of the
team's practice Friday, closed to the media for the second
consecutive day.
	   French gendarmes and national police, which guard the entrance
to the secluded La Reserve Hotel where the team is based, turned
away a reporter Friday who was trying to get details of the team's
schedule.
	   ``They don't have time to talk to journalists. You should go to
the stadium where they practice,'' a French policeman said.
	   At the stadium, police said the practice was closed to the
media. A photographer, preparing his long lens for photographs, was
told by a French security guard that no photos were allowed.
	   And press center officials in nearby Toulouse invariably tell
reporters they have no news about Romania.
	   ``If they don't tell us anything, what can we do? Perhaps you
can find something on the Internet,'' said an official who declined
to give her name.
	   The secrecy reflects the special importance with which the
Romanian team, which beat Colombia 1-0 in a Group G opener early
this week, views the game against England on 22 June.
	   A victory or a draw, coupled with another victory over Tunisia
on June 26, could propel Romania, the seeded team in its group, to
the top of the standings.
	   If it finishes in first place, Romania would then be paired
against the second-placed team in Group H, probably Argentina or
Croatia.
	   If Romania comes second it will face the winner of Group H.
	   The Romanians have continued their preparations with the team in
mostly good health.
	   Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, who had a bruised right leg, and
striker Adrian Ilie, who scored Romania's goal against Colombia and
pulled a muscle in his left leg, both took part in the practice
Friday. Also fit to play was defender Tibor Selymes of Anderlecht,
who missed the Colombia game with a sprained ankle.
	   The only player who is more seriously injured is forward
Gheorghe Craioveanu who plays in Spain for Real Sociedad. The
30-year-old pulled a muscle during practice recently and the doctor
has recommended that he take several days rest before resuming
training.
	   The Romanians will rest on Saturday. On Sunday, they will travel
to Toulouse for their last practice on the stadium which will host
the game against England on Monday.

Russian jewelry merchant formally charged with embezzlement name to Kozlyonok, sted Kozlenok. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with specific charges, CORRECTS transliteration of
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A jewelry merchant suspected of engineering a
fraudulent scheme that cost Russia dlrs 180 million in stolen gold
and gems was formally charged with embezzlement and other crimes
Friday, a news report said.
	   The charges against Andrei Kozlyonok include embezzlement of
dlrs 180 million worth of jewelry, fraud, illegal currency
transactions, illegal arms possessions and tax evasion, Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Kozlyonok, 38, was extradited Wednesday from Greece, where he
had been in custody since his arrest in January. He had fought
extradition by claiming his life would be in danger in Russia, but
Greek courts rejected the appeals.
	   After being flown to Moscow, Kozlyonok was taken directly to the
city's Matrosskaya Tishina prison for questioning, Russian media
said. Prosecutors have ordered additional security for Kozlyonok
and for a day refused to say where exactly he is being held.
	   Kozlyonok is accused of embezzling more than dlrs 183 million in
gold, diamonds and silver. He is accused of making a fake jewelry
production contract with the Russian State Committee on Metals and
Gems on behalf of a San Francisco-based company, Golden ADA Inc.
	   The Russian government filed a lawsuit in San Francisco in 1995,
claiming Golden ADA sold the metals and gems without permission
instead of returning them to Russia after processing. The
government says the company used the money to buy yachts, a
business jet, luxury cars and a mansion.
	   A U.S. court trustee ruled in April that dlrs 40 million in
remaining Golden ADA assets will be divided among the Russian
government, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and creditors.
	   Prosecutors believe that Kozlyonok might give fresh evidence
against some former senior government officials involved in the
scheme. But the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday that
Kozlyonok was refusing to answer investigators' questions.
	   The suspects include Yevgeny Bychkov, the former head of the
State Committee on Metals and Gems, who was fired by President
Boris Yeltsin in February 1996 after the scandal broke. Bychkov has
already faced charges, but was granted an amnesty.
	   Another suspect in the scheme, Sergei Dovbysh, a former Russian
Interior Ministry official, was found dead in February in a
courthouse cell in Moscow. His death was officially ruled a
suicide.

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military faction
_ low on ammunition and apparently on the run _ launched a dawn
artillery strike Friday on that country's battered capital, the
Senegalese military says.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties in the nearly
deserted city, but aid workers say the bodies of victims from
previous attack are still strewn on the streets.
	   Firing 155-milimeter shells, the rebel troops launched at least
12 rounds on the city, sending the few remaining civilians
scurrying for cover.
	   The attack came one day after proposed peace talks collapsed and
clandestine rebel radio warned of an assult on the capital, Bissau.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony on Africa's western
tip, has been descending into civil war with regional side-effects
since former military chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane launched a
mutiny garrison in Bissau, the country's capital, on June 7.
	   The rebels, reportedly ousted from their stronghold at the
military garrison of Bra on Bissau's outskirts, are running low on
artillery and mortar rounds, a Senegalese military commander said
on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said Senegalese troops fighting on behalf of President Joao
Bernardo Vieira were closing in on Bissau's international airport,
which is now controlled by the rebels.
	   ``We hope to free the airport to allow reliefs supplies to come
in,'' the commander said.
	   Thousands of villagers, meanwhile, have been fleeing a barrage
of rocket and artillery shells in northern Guinea-Bissau, heading
for the Senegalese border.
	   The intense assault, which began Wednesday night and continued
into Thursday, was directed at Ingore and Bula, villages just miles
south of the Senegalese border.
	   It was not clear who launched the attack, although the
Senegalese army had been firing artillery across the border in
recent days.

World Cup: Beat Yugoslavia, win World Cup _ German motto 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ For Germany, the formula seems simple: beat
Yugoslavia, win the World Cup.
	   That's what has happened each time it won the title in 1954,
1974 and 1990.
	   In 1954, Germany beat Yugoslavia 2-0 en route to its first
title. In 1974, Yugoslavia was also a 2-0 victim along the way.
	   And many still remember the 4-1 victory that launched Germany's
victorious march to the title in Italy in 1990.
	   One of them is Lothar Matthaeus, then German captain who scored
two goals.
	   ``It was one of my best games for the national team and it was
the beginning of a great German success,'' Matthaeus said Friday.
	   On Sunday in Lens, the two teams clash again in a match that
could decide the winner of Group F.
	   History speaks for Germany: of five World Cup matches, it has
won four, including a 1-0 win in 1958. It lost only once, 1-0, in
the quarterfinals in 1962. Overall, Germany has a 14-7 winning
record, with three draws.
	   Political clouds will be over this game just as they will be
over the clash the same day in Lyon between the United States and
Iran.
	   Many Yugoslavs believe Germany's hasty recognition of Croatia
helped cause the violent breakup of old Yugoslavia.
	   With violence in Kosovo flaring up, some German politicians had
called for the exclusion of Yugoslavia from this World Cup, the
country's first since 1990. Yugoslavia, now consisting of Serbia
and tiny Montenegro, is back after eight years without major
competitions because of sanctions.
	   Politics won't play a role on the field, according to officials
from both sides.
	   Who exactly will be playing on the field was a matter of
conjecture in the German camp Friday. Coach Berti Vogts bantered
with reporters, raising the possibility of ``option 6a'' or
``option 5b'' and various other plans that had nearly every German
player possibly in the lineup.
	   One thing seems clear: Vogts is unlikely to use two offensive
midfielders, like he did in the 2-0 victory over the United States,
even though Yugoslavia struggled to a 1-0 victory over Iran in its
opener.
	   ``We can't give them that much room,'' Vogts said. ``It's
technically a very skilled team with fast forwards. Along with
Nigeria, Yugoslavia is for me a secret tip to win the title.''
	   ``But we have a strong team and we'll be tough to beat. Playing
defensively would be wrong against them, because they seem a bit
exposed in the defense. But I don't think they have real
weaknesses,'' Vogts said.
	   Whatever option Vogts picks, Matthaeus could be in it. Vogts
likes to spring surprises in his lineup before big games and one
theory is that Matthaeus will be libero with Olaf Thon moving into
midfield.
	   Even just a minute of playing time would give the 37-year-old
veteran a World Cup record of 22 matches.
	   ``I don't want any gifts. But every player wants to play and
that's what I am trying to show in training. I am ready to play,
but I'll accept any decision by the coach,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus said this German team reminded him of the 1990 side.
``We have quality characters, just as we did in 1990.''
	   ``We have a great team spirit, we laugh, we joke, we even drink
a bit of wine. We are very relaxed,'' he said.
	   So relaxed that the Germans got the morning off Friday, rather
than having to work off their team dinner the night before in the
Hermitage hotel in Monte Carlo.

Bjorkman through to semifinals 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman, the only seeded
player left in the Eastbourne grass-court tennis tournament, moved
into the semifinals with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 win over Grant Stafford
on Friday.
	   The No. 2 seed broke the South African's serve in the first game
of the match. He held the break until he was serving for the set at
5-4 before Stafford broke back and forced the set to a tiebreaker.
	   After seven mini breaks, the Swede served out for a 7-5
advantage with his second set point.
	   The second set went with serve until the eighth game when
Bjorkman broke for a 5-3 lead and then served out the match.
	   Bjorkman, who has recently recovered from a serious virus, said
he was confortable playing on grass and could be a chance at
Wimbledon where he is seeded No. 11.
	   ``It's been a big goal for 1998 to do well at Wimbledon,'' he
said. ``The way I'm playing now _ if guys want to beat me _ they're
going to have to play at their very best.
	   Australian Scott Draper, who won last weekend's grass-court
warmup at Queen's, was to play Jerome Golmard, of France, in the
second quarterfinal Friday.
	   In other quarterfinals, Italy's Gianluca Pozzi played No.7 seed
Byron Black and New Zealand's Brett Steven played Sargis Sargsian
of Armenia.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Swiss biologist, a Japanese mathematician and an
American artist have won the 1998 Kyoto Prizes, a Japanese award
for advances in the arts and sciences.
	   The winners _ Dr. Kurt Wuthrich of Switzerland, Dr. Kiyoshi Ito
of Japan and Nam June Paik, a Korean-born American _ were announced
Friday by the Inamori Foundation, which gives the prizes.
	   The advanced technology prize went to Wuthrich, a biologist, for
his work in establishing a new methodology for studying structural
biology.
	   The prize for basic science went to Ito for establishing a
mathematical theory that is now used in a variety of areas ranging
from physics to economics.
	   Paik was given the award in creative arts for achievements in
the field of video art, which he introduced over 30 years ago.
	   The foundation was established in 1984 by Kazuo Inamori,
chairman of Kyocera Corp., a manufacturer of industrial ceramics.
The prizes include a gold medal and 50 million yen (dlrs 435,000).
The awards were first presented in 1985.
	   The prizes will be awarded at a ceremony to be held in the
western Japan city of Kyoto on Nov. 10.

Pakistani foreign minister: Israel helped India carry out tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel helped India carry out its nuclear tests
in May, the foreign minister of Pakistan alleged in remarks
published Friday in an Israeli newspaper.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai Bazak,
denied the charges, saying Israel did not have any role in India's
nuclear tests.
	   Israel maintains relations with India, but not with Pakistan,
the first Muslim country to go nuclear. Pakistan also carried out
nuclear tests last month, in response to India.
	   In an interview with the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot, Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub charged that there was close military
cooperation between India and Israel.
	   ``In the nuclear tests which India conducted on the 11th and
13th of last month, Israel supplied India with the devices for
carrying out simultaneous tests, at an interval of one thousandth
of a second,'' Ayub said. ``Only America and Israel have this
apparatus, and we know that it came from Israel.''
	   Last month's rival nuclear tests by the South Asian neighbors,
who have fought three wars in the last 50 years, heightened fears
of a new nuclear arms race that could ultimately spread to other
aspiring nuclear nations.
	   Israel has been especially concerned about nuclear know-how
reaching Iran, one of its most implacable foes. However, Ayub said
Israel did not have to worry about Pakistan passing on its secrets.
	   ``We have not transferred knowledge, and we won't transfer it,''
Ayub told Yediot reporter Orly Azulai-Katz in his office in
Islamabad.
	   The foreign minister also said that Pakistan had ``many, many
bombs,'' a claim disputed this week by Jane's Intelligence Weekly,
a respected military magazine published in London.
	   Jane's said Pakistan exhausted a significant part of its meager
arsenal in last month's tests _ and the poor performance of its
weapons revealed the country's strategic nuclear weakness.
	   Ayub said Pakistan had evidence that India tried to destroy the
Pakistani reactor to prevent Pakistan from carrying out its own
tests.
	   Pakistani officials initially claimed that Israel tried to help
India in the alleged plot, but Ayub said in Friday's interview that
Israel played no role. ``It was India's plan,'' he said.

Retail workers walkouts continue for wage hikes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Some 12,000 retails workers, demanding
up to 4.5 percent pay increases, held a mix of short warning
walkouts and day-longs strikes in five German states this week to
push their demands, union officials said Friday.
	   With employers offering increases of 1.5 percent, workers at 60
businesses in Hesse, Baden-Wuerttemberg, North-Rhine Westphalia,
Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein states took part in the
strikes, HBV union spokeswoman Franziska Wiethold said.
	   She said the strikes would continue on Saturday, and into next
week if the employers don't come up with a realistic offer.
	   ``For us there is no recognizable sincere effort from the
employers to quickly end the wage dispute,'' Wiethold said.
	   According to the union, 90 percent of 55,000 retail workers at
180 businesses polled have voted for all-out strikes if wage
negotiations remain deadlocked.

Air Europe flight, Oslo to Malaga, makes safe emergency landing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ An Air Europe flight from Oslo,
Norway, to Malaga, Spain, made a safe emergency landing Friday at
Copenhagen's international airport after it had reported problems
with the hydraulic system to the wheels.
	   The pilot of the Boeing 737, which had 151 passengers aboard,
requested the emergency landing shortly after takeoff from
Gardermoen airport near Oslo.
	   While ambulances, fire department vans and other rescue staff
waited ready on the ground, the aircraft circled above Copenhagen's
Kastrup Airport to use up fuel before the final approach. No one
was injured.

World Cup: Japan needs goal against Croatia to stay alive With Sports-Soccer-Croatia-Japan 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Japan raised some eyebrows at the World
Cup with its finely tuned defense against Argentina. Now, they're
determined to deliver a true shocker by defeating Croatia.
	   ``We didn't just come here to play. We came to win. We will
definitely win tomorrow,'' said midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi after
practice Friday in Nantes, where Japan takes on Croatia Saturday.
	   Having lost to Argentina 1-0, despite a surprisingly credible
defense against Gabriel Batistuta, Japan desperately needs a win
this time to cling to any hopes of advancing to the next round. In
its first game, Croatia beat Jamaica 3-1.
	   ``To achieve our goal of going to the second round, tomorrow's
match is critical,'' said coach Takeshi Okada. ``In our second
match, we just have to give it all we've got,'' he said.
	   Okada said that the game couldn't be tougher than its opener
against Argentina.
	   Still, if they want to win, Japan must score. And that has been
a major challenge for the team, which has repeatedly stumbled in
the final touches essential for scoring.
	   ``We can't win if we don't score, so, yes, I want to go for the
win,'' said 26-year-old midfielder Hiroaki Morishima, who has
scored seven goals in 36 international games.
	   ``I want to stay calm and keep up with the fast players,'' said
defender Eisuke Nakanishi. ``Defense comes first. We have to defend
and then seize the few opportunities that arise.''
	   Whether Japan can score _ let alone win _ is uncertain. But
whoever can achieve Japan's first World Cup goal is guaranteed to
become a national hero back home.
	   When asked to speak by a foreign TV crew, Okada replied in
halting English with conviction in his voice: ``Tomorrow, we will
try to do our best to win.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup organizers attacked ticket fraud by going
after officials from two companies Friday, in the wake of bogus
sales and the reported theft of tickets.
	   Barely a week into the World Cup, ticket scandals had embittered
thousands of fans, prompting the image-conscious organizers to
fight back with fraud probes and legal action.
	   In the latest ticket scandal, World Cup organizers said they had
questions about the reported theft Wednesday of up to 15,000
tickets from the U.S. distributor Prime Sports International.
	   Spokesman Bruno Travade said Friday that, while PSI listed an
undetermined number of tickets for Thursday night's France-Saudi
Arabia match among those stolen, a check at the Stade de France
found the seats ``duly occupied by spectators.''
	   He said the organizers had not received complaints from people
who purchased tickets and did not receive them from PSI, which had
bought 504 tickets for the Thursday night match.
	   ``It is PSI that says it (the tickets) has been stolen,''
Travade said.
	   Travade said the World Cup organizing committee, the CFO, was
still waiting, after two requests, for PSI to identify those who
purchased the tickets, the games they were to attend and their
seats.
	   The spokesman said the CFO would remain in contact with French
judicial authorities about the alleged stolen tickets and that it
would ``verify match-by-match if the seats given to PSI were taken
or not.''
	   Repeated telephone messages Friday to PSI officials went
unanswered.
	   One of 17 World Cup-approved travel agencies, PSI was already
under investigation after a Madrid travel agency complained it
never received more than 1,000 tickets it bought from PSI.
	   Prime Sports International on Thursday offered a ``no questions
asked reward'' of 1 million francs _ about dlrs 160,000 _ to
recover the tickets stolen overnight. It also promised to reimburse
buyers of undelivered tickets.
	   Travade also said the organizers had filed a complaint with
prosecutors against ISL France, a subsidiary of the World Cup's
marketing company ISL Worldwide. It was the first step toward
seeking damages in a ticket fraud case involving a consultant to
the subsidiary.
	   ``We can't accept that anyone casts aspersions on the very
thorough work of the CFO in the preparations for the World Cup,''
the spokesman said.
	   Three people _ including the president of the French affiliate
of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's exclusive marketing partner _ were
arrested in a separate investigation into ticket fraud.
	   The arrests Wednesday were a response to the 12,000 Japanese
fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   The CFO also said it was pursuing allegations a France Telecom
worker leaked a phone number that allowed thousands of World Cup
tickets to be bought unfairly.
	   The head of the world soccer federation FIFA, promised to
rethink World Cup ticketing, after the ticket fraud and reports
that that at least some phone-in ticket sales were rigged.
	   ``This whole World Cup ticketing operation must be reviewed for
the next time, in 2002,'' Joseph Blatter said on France Info radio
Thursday. ``But we need to take action now.''
	   Black-market sales, including some by national federations who
sell off their surplus tickets, are ``something that shocks us,''
Blatter said. ``Our disciplinary commission has the power to
intervene and even ... to sanction them.''
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

Bailmakers forced to forfeit after British woman jumps bail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Bailmakers for a British woman facing
charges of theft of U.N. property have been ordered to forfeit 2.5
million shillings (dlrs 41,000) after she jumped bail, her attorney
said Friday.
	   Ishan Kapila said the prosecution told him there are plans to
try to extradite Kerry Page of Bradford, West Yorkshire, although
her whereabouts are not known.
	   The case will be mentioned again on July 20.
	   Page, 29, failed to appear at the opening of her trial May 18.
Kapila told the court he had received anonymous calls saying she
had left Kenya.
	   Chief Magistrate Jesee Lesitt issued a warrant for Page's arrest
for failing to appear before the court.
	   Kapila said he still did not know where his client was.
	   Page was the first of two people charged with stealing and
receiving property stolen from the United Nations worth 20 million
Kenya shillings (dlrs 333,000 dollars).
	   The trial of the second accused, Kenyan Mohammed Ali Malizon,
has not yet begun.
	   According to the charges, the goods, belonging to the U.N.
peacekeeping operation in Somalia or UNOSOM, were stolen at Kenya's
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa after they had been shipped there from
Somalia.
	   Page was the manager of Samaust Co., which was involved in the
shipment as a subsidiary of Morris Catering Co., which had been
contracted by UNOSOM.
	   Conviction on the charges could carry a 25-year jail sentence.
	   Although the names of Arran David Morris and Robert Bruce
McViker appear on the police charge sheet, neither was subsequently
arrested nor formally charged.

Portuguese rail services paralyzed by national strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rail workers went on strike Friday,
paralyzing most of the country's trains and snarling rush-hour
traffic into major cities for the third time in three weeks.
	   The series of one-day strikes have caused ``considerable''
financial losses for Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses, the debt-laden
state rail company, according to its spokesman Pedro Vaz. He did
not provide figures.
	   The rail company contracted some 200 buses to replace train
services, including international routes, but long traffic jams
built up on expressways into Lisbon and the second-largest city
Oporto during the morning rush-hour.
	   Two suburban train lines, including one to the Expo 98 world's
fair in Lisbon, were not affected, Vaz said.
	   Workers in charge of train operations, including safety and
signaling crews, called the strike to press their demands for
increased productivity bonuses and new career advancement
qualifications.
	   Jose Oliveira of the Federation of Rail Workers Unions claimed
nearly all the company's 11,600 workers heeded the strike call.
Neither the federation nor the company provided specific figures.
	   The railroad is being broken up into two separate companies
covering rail infrastructure and train services in a bid to reduce
its debts, estimated at more than 200 billion escudos (dlrs 1.1
billion), and to prepare the company for privatization.

fans who were left ticketless for the World Cup.
	   The CFO also said it was pursuing allegations a France Telecom
worker leaked a phone number that allowed thousands of World Cup
tickets to be bought unfairly.
	   The head of the world soccer federation FIFA, promised to
rethink World Cup ticketing, after the ticket fraud and reports
that that at least some phone-in ticket sales were rigged.
	   ``This whole World Cup ticketing operation must be reviewed for
the next time, in 2002,'' Joseph Blatter said on France Info radio
Thursday. ``But we need to take action now.''
	   Black-market sales, including some by national federations who
sell off their surplus tickets, are ``something that shocks us,''
Blatter said. ``Our disciplinary commission has the power to
intervene and even ... to sanction them.''
	   Critics have said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in the
host country, while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rail workers went on strike Friday,
paralyzing most of the country's trains and snarling rush-hour
traffic into major cities for the third time in three weeks.
	   The series of one-day strikes have caused ``considerable''
financial losses for Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses, the debt-laden
state rail company, according to its spokesman Pedro Vaz. He did
not provide figures.
	   The rail company contracted some 200 buses to replace train
services, including international routes, but long traffic jams
built up on expressways into Lisbon and the second-largest city
Oporto during the morning rush-hour.
	   Two suburban train lines, including one to the Expo 98 world's
fair in Lisbon, were not affected, Vaz said.
	   Workers in charge of train operations, including safety and
signaling crews, called the strike to press their demands for
increased productivity bonuses and new career advancement
qualifications.
	   Jose Oliveira of the Federation of Rail Workers Unions claimed
nearly all the company's 11,600 workers heeded the strike call.
Neither the federation nor the company provided specific figures.
	   The railroad is being broken up into two separate companies
covering rail infrastructure and train services in a bid to reduce
its debts, estimated at more than 200 billion escudos (dlrs 1.1
billion), and to prepare the company for privatization.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy
announced Friday night that his party is withdrawing from the
campaign for next month's general election because it would not be
free and fair.
	   The party might rejoin the election process if international
pressure succeeded in forcing the government of Hun Sen to improve
conditions, but he said he was not optimistic.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Bangkok, he said his Sam Rainsy
party would continue with political activity, including a
demonstration planned for Sunday in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh,
to call for a fair election.
	   The statement was clearly aimed at making the world take a close
look at its qualified support for the elections, scheduled for July
26.
	   Sam Rainsy and fellow opposition figure Son Soubert said in a
statement earlier Friday that killings of opposition activists
continue to mount and that politically motivated murders have
consistently gone unpunished.
	   Opposition party organizers in the provinces are being
threatened and intimidated by ``thugs'' within Cambodian leader Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party, they charged, and legal
institutions remain stacked in favor of the country's strongman.
	   The two politicians called on the government to provide main
opposition parties fair and equitable access to the electronic
media, saying that so far, ``media access is doled out in token
amounts (to opposition political parties) while the ruling party
has free rein.''
	   They also demanded the right to assemble, and said citizens who
have been left out of the registration process _ allegedly
supporters of the opposition _ must be given an opportunity to
vote.
	   Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a
coup one year ago, shattering a tense dual premiership formed after
U.N.-brokered elections in 1993.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been held back after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to
proceed with a new election on July 26. Under pressure from foreign
aid donors, he allowed Ranariddh to return to participate.
	   San Rainsy's announcement of the boycott came as the so-called
Friends of Cambodia, a grouping of Western and Asian countries
seeking an end to Cambodia's political unrest, were preparing to
meet this weekend in Bangkok.
	   The group is expected to consider whether or not the electoral
process is so flawed that free and fair polls are not possible.
	   Sam Rainsy said he believed the group intended to endorse the
July 26 election.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan expressed regret at the
boycott.
	   ``We have not gone that far yet, but that's unfortunate,'' he
said. Surin said Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon would
meet Sam Rainsy later Friday night.
	   The foreign ministers of Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia
make up the so-called ASEAN Troika, representing the ten-nation
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in its efforts to mediate an
end to Cambodia's conflicts. The group, which coordinates
activities with the Friends of Cambodia, was holding a dinner
meeting as Sam Rainsy made his announcement.
	   In the joint San Rainsy-Son Soubert statement earlier Friday,
the two threatened a boycott. Sam Rainsy did not explain in Bangkok
why he had so quickly moved from threat to action.

Mindful of Kosovo, Albania stages air exercise 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian military jets zoomed low over
the capital Friday in a display of air power designed to show the
nation's readiness if Kosovo violence spills over its border.
	   Six aging Chinese and Russian planes, including MiG-15s, MiG-17s
and MiG-19s, made air figures as Prime Minister Fatos Nano, Defense
Minister Luan Hajdarage, Western diplomats and reporters watched.
	   ``Our military aviation is now able to fulfill its military
tasks,'' said Astrit Jaupi, deputy chief of the Air Defense Force.
	   Five Albanian aircraft will join NATO planes in a joint military
exercise expected to take place next month, he said.
	   Last year, when the country slipped into chaos caused by the
collapse of pyramid schemes, angry mobs attacked and looted army
depots and the country's three military air bases in Rinas, Gjader
and Kucova.
	   Western television images showed civilians ransacking the base
at Kucova and towing MiG-19s down the national road behind their
cars.
	   ``I can't believe that in a few months we managed to make this
base function again, after last year's looting,'' said the
commander of the Rinas air base, Col. Murat Arra.

Four men win Spain's big prize for fighting poverty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ A Bangladeshi philanthropist and three
Spaniards who administer aid programs in Africa and India won a
prestigious Spanish prize Friday for relieving poverty.
	   Lauding their ``struggle against poverty in the world,'' the
Prince of Asturias Prize jury awarded its Concord Prize to Mohammad
Yunus of Bangladesh and Spaniards Vicente Ferrer, Nicolas
Castellanos and Joaquin Sanz Gadea.
	   Yunus, 58, was cited for founding the Grameen Bank 20 years ago.
Since then, it has loaned dlrs 1.5 billion to 2.1 million borrowers
in 36,000 villages.
	   Yunus' bank introduced the concept of ``microloans'' to help the
poor start small businesses. He also launched a project last year
to put at least one cellular phone in each of Bangladesh's 65,000
villages within six years.
	   Missionaries Ferrer and Castellanos were honored for their work
in India, while Sanz was praised for medical work in several
hospitals in Congo.
	   The Prince of Asturias Prize ranks nearly as high in the
Spanish-speaking world as the Nobel Prize. Awards are given in
several fields, including science, the arts and sports.
	   The Concord Prize is the seventh of eight Prince of Asturias
prizes being granted this year.
	   Crown Prince Felipe of Asturias will present the winners 5
million pesetas (dlrs 34,000) and a sculpture by Spanish artist
Joan Miro during an October ceremony in this northern Spanish city.

Government fines TV for airing interview with Macau's gang boss 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's Broadcasting Authority on Friday
fined a local television network 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 12,820) for screening an interview with a reputed gang leader
in the neighboring Portuguese enclave of Macau.
	   It said the interview with Wan Kuok-koi, also known as ``Broken
Tooth'' Koi, glorified the powers of the ``triads'', or Chinese
gangs.
	   The discussion on Wan's gambling habits and how he acquired his
wealth had a bad influence on young viewers, it said.
	   Television Broadcast Ltd. (TVB) screened the interview before
Wan was arrested in Macau last month in connection with the bombing
of the car of Macau's police chief Dr. Antonio Marques Baptista.
	   A TVB statement said it has conducted an internal review of the
matter and has strengthened monitoring procedures.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, has been hit
by a wave of gang violence over the gambling industry in the past
two years. The territory returns to Chinese rule next year.

Belarus cuts water and power to ambassadors' residence 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The government of Belarus acted on its
threats Friday, cutting water and power to a diplomatic compound in
an effort to evict ambassadors from the U.S., France, Germany and
other nations.
	   The government has been trying to force the ambassadors out of
their homes in a pleasant pine woods on the outskirts of the
capital Minsk, claiming the compound is badly in need of sewer and
plumbing repairs.
	   The ambassadors have refused, saying the order violates the
Vienna Convention which designates ambassadors' homes as territory
of their countries.
	   The move comes two days after President Alexander Lukashenko's
government reached a reported compromise with the ambassadors,
saying diplomats could stay if they are ready to face some
``inconvenience.''
	   At noon on Friday, water and electricity to the compound were
cut of, surprising the diplomats.
	   ``We thought that wouldn't happen after the compromise we
reached,'' German Ambassador Horst Winkelman told reporters.
	   Workers also dug a ditch immediately inside the compound's
gates, preventing ambassadors' cars from entering. French
Ambassador Bernard Fassier took a bicycle from his car's trunk to
ride to his residence, while others walked.
	   Diplomats were given temporary IDs valid until the end of the
year to enter their residences.
	   They were also told they would have to ask Lukashenko's security
service for special permission if they want to invite someone to
the grounds, or even walk from one residence to another to meet
their neighbors, a Lithuanian diplomat said.
	   In response to the government's action, ambassadors met at the
British Embassy on Friday to discuss a coordinated response.
Countries of the European Union are considering recalling their
ambassadors, diplomats told reporters after the consultations.
	   ``The situation is probably without precedent in the recent
history of world diplomatic relations,'' Fassier told reporters.
``Our government is taking the situation very seriously.''
	   Lukashenko claims the diplomatic residences are his own
property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard has said that envoys would
prefer to remain in the complex during the repairs. He noted that
he has had no problems with either his water or sewage systems in
the year his family has lived in the complex.
	   U.S. Embassy declined to comment on Friday's developments.
	   Lukashenko lashed out at the media and unidentified political
circles on Friday for drumming up what he described as a trivial
incident.
	   ``Ouch! We're hurting diplomats!'' he said sarcastically to
reporters.

Leftist ally says vote of confidence won't be necessary 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti stuck to his
anti-NATO position Friday, but said he didn't think the Parliament
vote next week on the alliance's eastward expansion would lead to
the government falling.
	   There were fears that if the government loses its majority on
the issue, it could face a vote of confidence.
	   ``Even if we do go to a vote of confidence,'' Bertinotti said,
``naturally we are ready to vote in favor of the government because
we are part of this majority.''
	   However, Bertinotti said he was convinced the center-right
opposition would bail out Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
coalition government by voting in favor of the measure.
	   Without backing from Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party,
Prodi lacks a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   Opposition leader and former premier Silvio Berlusconi has
expressed support for the expansion, but has asked Prodi to step
down in exchange for his votes.
	   Massimo D'Alema, leader of the government's largest party, also
said he was convinced the measures would pass. But he added: ``We
can't pretend that nothing has happened.''
	   D'Alema said the coalition needed to meet and develop a more
united policy for the future, to strengthen the government and
``allow it to overcome the challenges it must face.'' D'Alema heads
the Democratic Left party.
	   Prodi's government nearly collapsed last year when Bertinotti
voted against plans to send Italian troops to quell unrest in
Albania, but the opposition bailed him out.

Suharto not to return to politics, says brother 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former president Suharto will not
return to politics because he is no longer trusted and supported by
the people, a relative was quoted Friday as saying.
	   ``Rumors that Suharto will return and seize the presidency with
the armed forces are not true,'' the ex-president's half-brother,
Probosutedjo, was quoted as saying by the official Antara news
agency Friday.
	   Probosutedjo, a banker and entrepreneur, who like many
Indonesians uses only one name, said the Indonesian military would
not support Suharto, who resigned May 21 amid students protests and
violence.
	   On Thursday, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto described the
rumor of a Suharto comeback was ``misleading and unfounded'' and
was aimed at destroying public confidence in the government.
	   Several newspapers have said that the rumor has been circulating
within the ruling Golkar party, which is to hold its extraordinary
party congress next month.
	   News reports indicated a rift among the party leaders, and there
are allegations that the organizers of the July 9-11 congress are
Suharto's supporters.
	   Suharto himself is still chairman of Golkar's board of patrons.
His eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and second son Bambang
Trihatmodjo senior officials of the party, which has dominated
every election since 1971.
	   Probosutedjo also challenged those accusing the former president
of corruption to provide evidence.
	   ``Show us where the Suharto wealth is. I have asked him myself
about this and he told me that there is no such account,''
Probosutedjo said.
	   The Attorney General's Office is launching a nationwide
investigation on alleged corruption by the government under
Suharto.
	   Democracy activists are demanding an investigation into the
Suharto clan's money, estimated at dlrs 40 billion.

Kournikova out with thumb injury; Sanchez Vicario into final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Kournikova quotes
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario is into the
final of the Eastbourne grass-court tournament, but another
Wimbledon favorite Anna Kournikova is out with a thumb injury.
	   Sanchez Vicario beat American Serena Williams in three sets
Friday to reach the semifinals. Kournikova withdrew to rest a right
thumb she injured in her quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf on
Thursday.
	   The Russian was to have played Sanchez Vicario in Friday's
seminfinals.
	   In the other quarterfinal, Jana Novotna advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-4, 7-5 win over fifth seed Irina Spirlea of
Romania. The top-seeded Czech was to meet Natasha Zvereva of
Belarus in the other semifinal later Friday.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, beat Graf 6-7
(4-7), 6-3, 6-4 but fell during the match and injured her right
thumb.
	   The 17-year-old Russian said X-rays had shown there were no
problems but, as a precaution, she withdrew from a doubles
quarterfinal Thursday and the singles Friday.
	   ``I'm going to do everything possible to be ready to play at
Wimbledon. I'll be in treatment for 24 hours a day,'' Kournikova
said. ``I just have to rest, like for all injuries, but it's just a
minor sprain. I've pulled out as a precaution. The doctor told me
it wasn't worth putting pressure on it.
	   ``And actually I think I've played enough this week so I think
it's good for me to rest a little bit. I'm not going to lose my
timing or my feeling in two days.''
	   ``For sure it's a disappointment,'' added Kournikova, who won
the junior event here last year. ``I've never lost here and it
seems like a lucky tournament for me. I've never lost to Arantxa so
I think I had a great chance against her.''
	   Kournikova is in arguably the toughest section of the Wimbledon
draw, along with the Williams sisters and Mirjana Lucic.
	   ``I wouldn't say it's the toughest section,'' she said. ``All
players are tough, from number one to 128 or 132. They're all
tough. You don't have to think who's on the other side of the net.
You just play your own game.''
	   Third-seeded Sanchez Vicario completed her quarterfinal match
against Williams Friday after the match was tied 1-1 when rain
stopped play Thursday.
	   Sanchez Vicario's experience proved the difference in her 4-6,
6-4, 6-4 win over the teen-age American, who was playing her first
tournament on grass.
	   It was Williams' third loss this year to Sanchez Vicario and
followed a tense battle at the French Open in which Sanchez Vicario
accused the 16-year-old of showing no respect for other players.
	   The Spaniard broke to lead 4-3 in the third set but was broken
back in the next game after holding three game points. She
responded by breaking serve to love to lead 5-4, and claimed a two
hour 12 minute victory with a pass as a desperate Williams rushed
the net.
	   Although Williams tested Sanchez Vicario with a fierce forehand,
the Spaniard responded and both players were often at full stretch
in several fiercely contested rallies.
	   But Williams was often careless with her volleys, one of which
missed the court and had spectators at the back diving for cover.
	   Williams had her right thigh strapped, and also received
treatment to her lower right calf during play Thursday.
	   ``It's a little serious in some areas,'' Williams said. ``I had
my knee taped today, and my ankle and the side of my leg.''
	   ``It would have been tough for me to continue on in the next
rounds, but I'll definitely be all right for Wimbledon.''
	   Despite the nagging injuries on grass, Williams said she was
growing accustomed to it.
	   ``I'm getting used to it and feeling very comfortable on it,''
she said.
	   ``I'm playing pretty well on it and like the grass a lot. It's
definitely going to be one of my favorite surfaces.''
	   Williams said grass forced a player to attack and that was good
for her game.
	   ``It forces me to come forward a little more and that's exactly
what I need. At Wimbledon, whatever I do I have to always play my
game,'' she said.
	   `` I know if I do what I'm told I will come out victorious.''

Former WWII concentration camp commander maintains innocence 
</HEADLINE>
By EUGENE BRCIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dinko Sakic, who once headed Croatia's
most notorious World War II concentration camp, does not believe he
committed war crimes, his lawyer said Friday.
	   ``My client does not feel guilty,'' Sakic's state-appointed
attorney, Ivan Kern, told reporters after a preliminary court
arraignment.
	   Kern said Sakic denies that crimes were committed during his
command, and that he committed any crimes.
	   Sakic, accused of committing crimes against humanity and
international law, was extradited Wednesday from Argentina, where
he had lived quietly for more than a half century.
	   No formal charges have yet been filed against Sakic.
	   Appearing Friday before magistrate Zdenko Konjic in a closed
hearing, Sakic made no statement, Kern said. No other details were
released.
	   Sakic is expected to not testify during court proceedings.
	   The court now has six months to gather evidence and formally
charge Sakic. So far, 12 witnesses have given statements to
prosecutors.
	   State prosecutor Radovan Santek said he expects to collect
enough evidence to begin the trial in about three months.
	   A court warrant issued in April accused Sakic of committing
``grave and fatal'' criminal acts during his 1942-45 command of the
Jasenovac concentration camp, later known as the ``Auschwitz of the
Balkans.''
	   The court said tens of thousands of people were detained,
tortured and killed in the camp. Most of those killed were Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies or anti-fascists.
	   Sakic faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if
convicted.
	   In an April 6 interview with a Buenos Aires television station
that brought him to international attention, Sakic denied any
wrongdoing and said no prisoners were killed under his command.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Soon after, Sakic waived his right to fight extradition and
surrendered to Argentine police, confident he could disprove
charges raised against him.
	   Sakic's trial is expected to polarize sentiments in the
fledgling nation, which has yet to deal with its Nazi past.
	   Croats largely welcomed the establishment of the quisling regime
in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old dreams for an
independent state. However, many also fought alongside
anti-fascists to bring about it's demise four years later.
	   Only a handful of die-hard ultra-nationalists singing Nazi-era
songs greeted Sakic upon his arrival. The prevailing public
sentiment is that Sakic should be tried for his alleged crimes.

Kwasniewski vows to veto administrative divisions approved in upper house Kwasniewski quote, details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Kwasniewski, Buzek to meet still Friday,
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski vowed
Friday to veto a map of new administrative districts supported by
the Solidarity prime minister and approved in a late-night session
by Poland's upper house.
	   The veto sends Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, on a collision
course with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who has recommended the new
map of 15 provinces to replace the existing 49, a holdover from the
highly bureaucratic communist era.
	   Kwasniewski wants a leftists plan that would reduce the number
of provinces to 17, and add the central city of Kielce and the
Baltic coast city of Koszalin to the list of provincial capitals.
	   He argues the division into 17 provinces ``takes into
consideration the social expectations and provides political
support for the administrative reform.''
	   Kwasniewski and Buzek are to meet later Friday to see if a
compromise can be worked out. The pair have rarely met since Buzek
took over as head of the Solidarity-run government last fall.
	   Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski called the veto pledge
``very bad news'' and said it was a ``step toward blocking the
whole administrative reform.''
	   The bill needs the approval of the lower chamber of parliament
and of the president to take effect.
	   The administrative reform is part of Poland's efforts to get its
laws and procedures in line with European standards for eventual
admission into the European Union.
	   The government initially proposed 12 provinces, but added a few
following protests from cities that would lose their current status
of provincial capital.

Yugoslav minister commits to dialogue; Says Belgrade wants to join EU 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Yugoslavia's foreign minister on Friday
committed his government to a peaceful solution of the Kosovo
crisis and surprised his Luxembourg hosts by saying Belgrade
aspires to join the European Union.
	   Yugoslavia ``is determined to pursue a policy of dialogue'' to
quell separatist sentiments in the province of Kosovo, said
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad Jovanovic. ``There are
practically no other ways and means to do so than through
democratic and peaceful ones.''
	   Jovanovic met with Jacques Poos, his Luxembourg opposite, for
three hours to discuss the Kosovo standoff.
	   At a joint press conference, both men condemned terrorism by
Kosovo forces and stressed the province cannot become an
independent state.
	   Jovanovic ``emphasized the importance we attach to cooperation''
between Boris Yeltsin and Slobodan Milosevic, the Russian and
Yugoslav presidents, to resolve the crisis and prevent possible
military action by the NATO alliance.
	   He said to that end Belgrade has made concessions by allowing
foreign envoys to enter Kosovo and urging Kosovo leaders back to
the negotiating table, an invitation that has been rejected as
Yugoslav security forces remain in the southern province.
	   ``I am optimistic that the dialogue will be resumed,'' Jovanovic
said.
	   Jovanovic, officials said, surprised Poos by giving a long
explanation of his government's aspirations to someday join the EU
although relations could hardly be worse than they are now.
	   The EU has imposed economic and other sanctions against Belgrade
because of the crackdown in Kosovo. One Luxembourg diplomat, who
asked not to be named, termed Jovanovic's presentation ``rather
surrealistic given what is going on right now in that country ...
He was citing economic growth figures!''
	   The EU will only entertain membership applications from
countries that have market economies, are firmly democratic and
have no border disputes with their neighbors.
	   Jovanovic said he thought it was important West European nations
``are informed bout Yugoslavia's strategy of European integration
... and good neighborly relations which Yugoslavia pursues with
Europe.''
	   Poos said he could not ``imagine a normalization of relations
(with Yugoslavia) without a just resolution of the Kosovo crises.''

Malaysia asks for financial help from World Bank and U.S. details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir confirming asking for a World Bank loan,
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad
said Friday his government is applying for a dlrs 700 million loan
from the World Bank to aid Malaysians suffering from the regional
economic crisis.
	   He said that this loan, together with the World Bank loan of
dlrs 300 million approved earlier, would not be used for economic
reform.
	   The government would instead use these funds to maintain
spending in sectors such as education and health, while increasing
spending to help the poor in rural and urban areas, Mahathir told
reporters.
	   The prime minister also called on the United States to help
shore up Malaysia's sliding currency, which has brought the country
its worst economic crisis in a decade.
	   The United States and Japan intervened to halt the yen's
free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing the
dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   Mahathir asked for similar treatment.
	   ``It's so easy to revalue the yen. Simply by Japan and U.S.
getting together,'' he said. ``Please ask them (the U.S.) to work
with us to revalue our ringgit.''
	   The dollar dipped slightly in Friday afternoon trading to 136.84
yen, down 0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo.
	   Malaysia's currency has lost nearly 40 percent of its value
since last year, when Asian economies were battered and stock
markets crumbled.
	   Mahathir's call for help was unusual, coming hours after he had
made a scathing attack on the West, blaming ``foreign forces'' for
trying to topple Malaysia's leadership and ruin the nation's
newly-acquired prosperity.
	   Mahathir has previously accused Western currency traders of
leading an assault on the Malaysian ringgit and trying to
impoverish the nation.
	   ``Why help only Japan? Japan is a rich country. Malaysia is in
deficit,'' he said.
	   The appreciation of the yen has, however, led to some amount of
recovery for the Malaysian ringgit, which had slid to more than
four to a dollar earlier this week. On Friday, it traded at 3.9330
to the dollar.

Residents in Louise Woodward's hometown giving her breathing space 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with new detail
By ROBIN ESTRIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward may never again lead the
life of an ordinary citizen, but she'll begin to adjust to freedom
much sooner if everyone _ including her neighbors _ leaves her
alone, villagers said Friday.
	   The former au pair convicted of killing a child in her care
returned to this north England village Thursday after two years in
Massachusetts, freed at last from the criminal courts.
	   Friday, a knot of reporters and camera crews continued to stake
out her house, but neighbors tried to give her some breathing room.
	   ``I think we should just leave her alone and let her get on with
her life and treat her like we've always treated her,'' resident
Glen Fletcher said.
	   	   Many of the yellow ribbons that covered trees, fences and
signposts were ripped down Friday in an effort to return the town
to normalcy.
	   ``It's over with,'' said David Smith, as he took down yellow
ribbons from trees near The Rigger pub, unofficial base for Ms.
Woodward's supporters. ``It needs to be back to normal.''
	   The ribbons, Fletcher said, had made their point. ``They're just
going to keep reminding her of what she's been through,'' he said.
	   Massachusetts' highest court cleared the way for Ms. Woodward's
homecoming Tuesday, ruling that a lower court judge was within his
authority when he reduced a jury's second-degree murder verdict to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she already had
served.
	   She still faces a wrongful death suit by the parents of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen, who died Feb. 9, 1997.
	   Soon after arriving on British soil, the 20-year-old told
hundreds of journalists she did not kill the boy and insisted she
did not get a fair trial.
	   Many in her hometown believe her, and say they will continue to
support her emotionally and financially _ including giving her
space and time.
	   ``If you're going to get a normal life, this is the best place
to get it,'' resident Celia Jackson said.

Police: Insurgents kill 25 Hindus in Kashmir ambush 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BATOTE, India (AP) _ Five armed men swooped on a group of Hindu
revelers returning from a wedding, killing 25 people in a
mountainous village, Kashmir's police chief said Friday.
	   Gurbachan Jagat said said Muslim terrorists were suspected in
the Friday attack, but gave no reason for the suspicion.
	   Jagat said six people of the group of 36 were injured in the
massacre at Chapnali village, 190 kilometers (115 miles) northeast
of the state's winter capital of Jammu and had been rushed to a
hospital.
	   The five attackers emerged from a thick forest as the group was
resting by a mountain stream, and started firing indiscriminately,
the police official quoted eyewitnesses as saying.
	   The bride survived but the groom was killed on the spot, he
said.
	   None of Kashmir's separatist outfits _ fighting Indian security
forces for nine years to either carve out an independent state of
Kashmir or merge with Pakistan _ claimed responsibility for the
attack.
	   The Hizb-ul-Mujahedeen and the Harkat-ul-Ansar, two of a string
of separatist groups, have their strongholds in the region, Jagat
said.

Egyptian beheaded in Saudi Arabia for rape, murder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ An Egyptian was beheaded Friday for
raping and murdering a woman, the Saudi Interior Ministry said.
	   Ali Mohammed Hamed Ahmed was convicted of fatally hitting the
woman on her head with a rock and raping her, the ministry said in
a statement. The woman's name and age were not revealed.
	   Ahmed was executed in the northwestern city of Tabuk.
	   His death brings to 12 the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year. Last year, the 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Thailand electricity demand hits a three-decade low 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Bangkok, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's peak electricity demand
dropped for the first time in more than three decades because of
the country's deepening economic crisis, a senior electricity
official said Friday.
	   ``I've never seen anything like this since ... 1963,'' Siridat
Glankwahmdee, assistant governor of the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand, told Dow Jones news services.
	   The company was established in 1963.
	   He attributed the drop in the demand to Thailand's economic
downturn.
	   The peak demand seen so far this year is 14,200 megawatts,
compared to 14,500 last year, said Siridat. EGAT had estimated
demand for electricity in Thailand would peak at 14,900 megawatts.
	   Demand for electricity in Thailand generally peaks in summer,
which is between April to June.
	   ``There's no way we'll achieve that forecast level of demand,''
said Siridat.
	   The Thai government forecast the country's gross domestic
product would sink as much as 5.5 percent this year, its worst
performance in decades.
	   In some boom years, demand for electricity in Thailand soared as
much as 100 percent.
	   EGAT has been forced to delay purchases of electricity from
several private operators, many of whom are happy to postpone their
projects as the economic slump has made it difficult to raise funds
for investment.

Canada extends huge aid offer to jobless, bitter fish workers 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Seeking to defuse anger in Canada's poorest
region, the federal government said Friday it will spend another
dlrs 730 million (dlrs 496 million U.S.) to aid East Coast
fishermen and fish-plant workers who lost jobs when cod stocks
collapsed.
	   The fish workers _ most of them in Newfoundland _ have staged
repeated protests in recent months as the government tried to cut
short the original dlrs 1.9 billion (dlrs 1.3 billion U.S.) relief
program.
	   The original five-year program, known as TAGS (The Atlantic
Groundfish Strategy), ran short of money because more people than
expected qualified for extended benefits after the government
ordered a near-total halt to the cod fishery in 1993.
	   About 40,000 fish workers in the Atlantic provinces lost their
jobs because of the cod moratorium, and about half remain eligible
for benefits.
	   The aid package announced Friday, after weeks of political
wrangling, includes lump-sum relief packages to some jobless fish
workers, funding for non-fishery economic development projects,
money for job training and dlrs 250 million (dlrs 170 million U.S.)
for the government to buy back some commercial fishing licenses.
	   Three federal Cabinet ministers announced the aid package at a
news conference disrupted by angry fishermen in St. John's,
Newfoundland. Several people ripped up copies of the program
summary and threw them at the officials.
	   Fred Mifflin, who is minister of Veterans Affairs and
Newfoundland's senior representative in the federal government,
told the audience the province must accept the fact that the cod
fishery will not make a quick comeback.
	   ``I must say bluntly that with few exceptions, the fish have not
returned and they're not likely to return in the foreseeable
future, perhaps for a generation,'' he said. ``This plan includes
definite measures to reduce the size of the fishery and provide
opportunities for people to leave the fishery.''
	   Some fishermen expressed concern they wouldn't receive enough
money for living expenses. Others were unsure if they would qualify
for aid.
	   ``There's going to be some demonstrations ... there's going to
be chaos,'' said fisherman Lawrence Kieley.
	   The collapse of the cod fishery has devastated many small
coastal towns in Newfoundland, where the jobless rate for the past
few years has been close to 20 percent.
	   But a few success stories have emerged out of the relief
program. Newfoundland's shellfish industry has grown, some former
fish workers have switched to well-paying high-tech jobs, and a
handful of ex-fishermen have attracted attention by switching to
goat-farming.

Germany begins reluctant farewell to D-mark after 50 years 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN MADER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germans commemorate 50 years of the
Deutsche mark Saturday but also begin a reluctant farewell to the
money they will give up for a new Europe-wide currency.
	   For Germans, the mark is much more than the familiar notes and
coins.
	   It's a symbol of the country's postwar economic miracle and a
monetary policy that staved off one of Germany's biggest fears:
inflation.
	   The mark, like the Italian lira, French franc and other
currencies giving way to the euro, will circulate until 2002. But
with their exchange rates locked as of Jan. 1, the 11 founding
currencies essentially dissolve into one at the end of this year.
	   ``After Jan. 1, when it says `mark' on the note, we should
actually stamp the word `euro' on it,'' said economist Gerhard
Grebe of Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government emphasizes that the new
central bank that will control the euro will adopt many of the
policies of Germany's trusted Bundesbank, including the focus on
currency stability.
	   Not everyone agrees. Euro critics, including Bavarian Governor
Edmund Stoiber, note that the bank's officers also will represent
countries that traditionally place jobs ahead of currency
stability. They fear the new bank won't be as committed to fighting
inflation and that Germany will have to transfer money to weaker
economies to keep the euro afloat.
	   Campaigners to save the mark are trying to capitalize on
nostalgia surrounding its 50th anniversary to push their cause. One
group took out full-page ads during the past week publicizing a new
anti-euro party, Initiative Pro-D-Mark.
	   Another, the Association of Free Citizens, will hand out
anti-euro flyers Saturday in front of Frankfurt's Paulskirche
church, while Kohl and other dignitaries commemorate the mark with
speeches inside.
	   ``Giving up the mark is like suddenly taking a successful
product off the market. Who would ever do that?'' said economist
Bernd-Thomas Ramb of Association of Free Citizens.
	   But the fight to save the mark already is all but lost.
	   Germany's two major political parties are behind the euro, which
has been approved by parliament and the European Union. Germany's
highest court rejected a euro challenge by four economic experts.
	   Kohl, who has staked his reputation on the euro, maintains it
will cement Germany's place in a united continent.
	   He and many mainstream German politicians and business leaders
insist the euro will be at least as strong as the mark and a rival
for the dollar. They say it will consolidate Europe's economic
power to better compete with North American and Asian trade blocs.
	   ``I'm assured that the success story of the German mark will
continue as a success story for the euro,'' Kohl has said.
	   Still, opposition persists among a quiet majority of Germans.
The respected Emnid Institute's latest poll this month said 56
percent of Germans opposed the euro. The margin of error was two
percentage points.

World Cup: Troubled Yugoslavs look for joy with win against Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ Yugoslavia will not only be playing
for World Cup points when it meets Germany, star defender Sinisa
Mihajlovic said Friday. It will also be looking for ``some joy''
for its politically-troubled people.
	   ``There will be millions of people watching us on TV back in our
country,'' Mihajlovic said. ``Our victory would be the only joy for
those poor people troubled by the Kosovo (ethnic strife) and
numerous other problems.''
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant ethnic Albanian fighters in southern Kosovo since the
authorities launched a crackdown on the last day of February.
	   NATO has threatened air strikes if the crackdown doesn't stop.
	   ``Of course the players are preoccupied by the events in our
country,'' Mihajlovic said. ``But we'll try to help the people in
Yugoslavia to forget their problems at least for a while. To bring
them some joy.''
	   Germany and Yugoslavia, the favorites in Group F with three
points each, play next Sunday in Lens. The other teams in the
group, the United States and Iran, have yet to pick up a point and
will face each other the same day in Lyon.
	   A victory against Germany would be especially sweet for the
Yugoslavs because the two nations have been historic adversaries.
	   Many Yugoslavs believe that the German government has been
biased against the Serb-led Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis, as
well as during the Bosnian and Croatian wars.
	   Yugoslavia has a history of losses against Germany at big soccer
championships. Germany leads Yugoslavia 14-7, with 3 ties overall.
The last time Yugoslavia beat Germany at the World Cup was in 1962
in Chile, 1-0.
	   But this time, the star-studded Yugoslav team is bent on
changing history in its favor.
	   ``Every tradition must come to an end,'' said Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac. ``I think this is our chance as we have a lot to
gain, but nothing to lose in the match against Germany.''
	   He was referring to a calculation under which even if the
Yugoslavs lose against favored Germany, they would qualify for the
second round by beating the United States in the last group match
on June 25.
	   ``We are technically superior to the Germans, and if we can
equal their running and play with discipline, I think we have a
good chance,'' said Mihajlovic, who scored the only goal from a
free kick in Yugoslavia's 1-0 opening victory against Iran.
	   Against Germany, Santrac is likely to field a more defensive
lineup than the one that started against Iran, by replacing striker
Savo Milosevic with 19-year-old midfielder Dejan Stankovic. That
would leave star striker Predrag Mijatovic alone in the Yugoslav
attack.
	   Meanwhile, some Belgrade tabloids have reported rifts among
Montenegrin and Serb players _ the two remaining increasingly
hostile Yugoslav republics _ who make up the Yugoslav team.
	   ``It's a complete fabrication, just trash,'' said Mijatovic, a
Montenegrin. ``We get along perfectly,'' he added.

Armenia denies plans to ``annex'' Nagorno-Karabakh 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's Foreign Ministry firmly denied
a news report Friday that Armenia has threatened to annex the
disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh _ an enclave inside Azerbaijan that is
populated largely by ethnic Armenians _ declared independence in
early 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Despite a 1994 truce, occasional skirmishes have broken out.
Internationally brokered talks to end the conflict have stalled.
	   Armenia has not officially recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as an
independent country, but insists that Azerbaijan negotiate with the
enclave. Azerbaijan does not recognize the separatists and wants to
negotiate with Armenia.
	   Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said Thursday that if
Azerbaijan refuses to change its stance in the next few years,
Armenia may decide to support Nagorno-Karabakh's requests for union
with Armenia.
	   Some news reports have interpreted Oskanian's remarks to mean
that Armenia is planning to annex Nagorno-Karabakh if Azerbaijan
refuses to budge.
	   ``This is apparently a misinterpretation of the minister's
words,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Areg Hovanesian confirmed to
The Associated Press on Friday. ``The word `annexation' was never
used.''
	   ``The point is that Armenia is making a very serious compromise,
being interested in the establishment of long-lasting peace in the
region, and does not insist today on full independence for
Nagorno-Karabakh or its union with Armenia,'' Hovanesian said.
	   Armenia is worried that oil-rich Azerbaijan is deliberately
stalling on reaching a peace settlement, hoping to use its new oil
income to build a strong army and regain control over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   ``If Azerbaijan tries to solve the question through military
methods, we will have nothing left to do but form a joint field of
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to ensure the safety of the enclave's
residents,'' Hovanesian said.

Former WWII concentration camp commander maintains innocence 
</HEADLINE>
By EUGENE BRCIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The man who once headed Croatia's most
notorious World War II concentration camp denies he committed war
crimes, his lawyer said Friday.
	   ``My client does not feel guilty,'' Dinko Sakic's
state-appointed attorney, Ivan Kern, told reporters after a
preliminary court arraignment.
	   Sakic, accused of committing crimes against humanity and
international law, was extradited Wednesday from Argentina, where
he had lived quietly for more than a half century.
	   Kern said Sakic denies that crimes were committed during his
command, and that he committed any crimes. No formal charges have
yet been filed against Sakic.
	   Appearing Friday before magistrate Zdenko Konjic in a closed
hearing, Sakic made no statement, Kern said. No other details were
released.
	   Sakic is expected to not testify during court proceedings.
	   The court now has six months to gather evidence and formally
charge Sakic. So far, 12 witnesses have given statements to
prosecutors.
	   State prosecutor Radovan Santek said he expects to collect
enough evidence to begin the trial in about three months.
	   A court warrant issued in April accused Sakic of committing
``grave and fatal'' criminal acts during his 1942-45 command of the
Jasenovac concentration camp, later known as the ``Auschwitz of the
Balkans.''
	   The court said tens of thousands of people were detained,
tortured and killed in the camp. Most of those killed were Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies or anti-fascists.
	   Sakic faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if
convicted.
	   In an April 6 interview with a Buenos Aires television station
that brought him to international attention, Sakic denied any
wrongdoing and said no prisoners were killed under his command.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Soon after, Sakic waived his right to fight extradition and
surrendered to Argentine police, confident he could disprove
charges raised against him.
	   Sakic's trial is expected to polarize sentiments in the
fledgling nation, which has yet to deal with its Nazi past.
	   Croats largely welcomed the establishment of the quisling regime
in 1941 as an incarnation of centuries-old dreams for an
independent state. However, many also fought alongside
anti-fascists to bring about its demise four years later.
	   A handful of die-hard ultra-nationalists singing Nazi-era songs
greeted Sakic upon his arrival. The prevailing public sentiment is
that Sakic should be tried for his alleged crimes.

Speechmaking over, envoys hunker down to negotiate new war crimes tribunal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The speeches are over, the battle lines are drawn.
Now envoys to a marathon U.N. conference are hunkering down to
negotiate the nuts and bolts of a treaty on the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal.
	   In the next four weeks, delegates from 159 countries will bicker
over hundreds of points that must be resolved if they hope to
produce an agreement.
	   Sweeping issues of law, justice, and politics _ both domestic
and international _ are at play as the negotiators maneuver for
position behind the now-closed doors of the conference.
	   Their fights will be large and small, ranging from the
definition of a war crime to the placement of a comma in a passage
of dense legal text.
	   It took more than three years of intense preliminary
negotiations to get this far, but such huge differences remain that
no one is willing to say yet whether the talks will succeed or
fail.
	   In speeches over the past few days, envoys have laid out opening
positions. None dared say that creating the tribunal _ a
long-cherished dream of many in the international community _ was a
bad idea.
	   Instead, those hostile to a strong, independent court dished out
a mixture of high-minded praise for the idea leavened with
proposals to weaken it or to tangle the talks into a hopeless knot.
	   Despite the work that still lies ahead and the deep disputes
that remain, the general outlines of an international criminal
court are in place.
	   It would try individuals. It would have no death penalty. It
would be located in The Hague. It would step in only if national
courts are unable or unwilling to act and then only in the most
serious cases: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   But those crimes must still be defined in precise legal language
in the treaty. Negotiators still must agree on how a case gets to
the court in the first place, on the role the U.N. Security Council
will play, and a host of other fundamental issues.
	   One of the most cohesive factions at the talks is a group of
nearly 50 countries allied with a vast network of human rights
organizations. The so-called ``like-minded'' group, led by Canada,
is lobbying for a prosecutor with the power to open investigations
on his or her own.
	   The United States finds itself on the other side of the fence
from this group, which includes many close allies, including most
of the European Union. The Americans have said they flatly oppose
an independent prosecutor.

Yeltsin ex-bodyguard to publish new Kremlin memoir 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A year after his first ``sip and tell'' book about
Boris Yeltsin, the president's former bodyguard is planning
another, a news report said Friday.
	   Alexander Korzhakov's first book portrayed the president as a
suicidal heavy drinker who is unfit to govern. However, his claims
were treated skeptically by many Russians, who believed he was
motivated largely by revenge for Yeltsin's decision to fire him.
	   Korzhakov, the former head of the presidential security service
and Yeltsin's closest confidant for 11 years, was ousted in a
Kremlin power struggle in June 1996. Ever since, he has been
threatening to tell scandalous stories about the country's
political and business elite, including Yeltsin.
	   The first book, titled ``Boris Yeltsin: From Dawn Till Dusk,''
contained little new information about Russian politics and its
scandalous chapters mostly involved tales of Yeltsin's heavy
drinking.
	   Korzhakov did not specify what his new book would cover or when
it might come out, according to the Interfax news agency, which
reported the publication plans.

Del Piero ready for ``real'' World Cup debut 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero is ready for his
``real'' World Cup debut: a full match against Austria on Tuesday.
	   The 23-year-old Italian striker, who has just recovered from a
thigh strain, played 25 minutes as a second half substitute against
Cameroon last Wednesday, but that was not the way the star had
hoped to start in the competition in which he's expected to rival
Ronaldo in popularity and attention.
	   ``I'm looking forward to start from the first minute against the
Austrians and begin my full-time duties in the World Cup,'' Del
Piero said at Italy's training camp Friday.
	   The self-confidence of the young striker to regain his place in
the team for Italy's third Group B match seemed to indicate that
Roberto Baggio was heading toward the substitutes bench.
	   Coach Cesare Maldini was elusive, as usual, about who may start
in the match against Austria at Saint-Denis.
	   However the coach said his policy was to start fit players in
good form.
	   ``I am fit and in good form,'' Del Piero joked Friday before
traveling to Paris along with his teammates to enjoy a half day off
in the French capital.
	   Baggio, 31, is nursing leg bruises suffered in the 65 minutes he
played against Cameroon before being replaced by Del Piero.
	   In the absence of Del Piero, Baggio started in the first match
against Chile and scored with a late penalty to tie the match at
2-2.
	   ``It's a boost of confidence for me to hear that Roberto
(Baggio) has said that he's here as my substitute and that this is
going to be my World Cup,'' said Del Piero, who has not played a
full match since the May 20 Champions Cup final against Real
Madrid, where he felt a thigh strain in the final minutes.
	   Del Piero, expected to pair with striker Christian Vieri against
Austria, said he was looking forward to an offensive match by the
Italian side.
	   ``We must not think of the outcome of the other match (between
Chile and Cameroon). We must play with personality. We must win to
qualify as Group B winners to avoid a second round clash with
Brazil,'' he said.
	   ``Austria is physically strong and its late goals (in the two
previous matches) are an indication of great determination. As all
teams they have weak points. We will try to take advantage of them
Tuesday,'' he said.
	   Italy enters Tuesday's match as Group B leader with four points
from two matches. Austria and Chile are tied with two points, with
Cameroon on one point.
	   Del Piero on the starting 11 may not be the only novelty of the
Italian team, as Maldini suggested the possible inclusion of a
different midfielder to partner Luigi Di Biagio.

Kournikova out with injury; Sanchez Vicario-Novotna in final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Novotna reaching final against Sanchez Vicario
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario is into the
final of the Eastbourne grass-court tournament, but another
Wimbledon favorite Anna Kournikova is out with a thumb injury.
	   Sanchez Vicario beat American Serena Williams in three sets
Friday in the quarterfinals. She was to have played Kournikova, but
the Russian teen-ager withdrew to rest a right thumb she injured in
her quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf on Thursday.
	   The third-seeded Sanchez Vicario will face No. 1 seed Jana
Novotna in Saturday's final.
	   On Friday, Novotna won her quarterfinal match 6-4, 7-5 over
fifth seed Irina Spirlea of Romania. She then beat Natasha Zvereva
of Belarus in the semifinals 6-2, 6-1.
	   Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year, beat Graf 6-7
(4-7), 6-3, 6-4 but fell during the match and injured her right
thumb.
	   The 17-year-old Russian said X-rays had shown there were no
problems but, as a precaution, she withdrew from a doubles
quarterfinal Thursday and the singles Friday.
	   ``I'm going to do everything possible to be ready to play at
Wimbledon. I'll be in treatment for 24 hours a day,'' Kournikova
said. ``I just have to rest, like for all injuries, but it's just a
minor sprain. I've pulled out as a precaution. The doctor told me
it wasn't worth putting pressure on it.
	   ``And actually I think I've played enough this week so I think
it's good for me to rest a little bit. I'm not going to lose my
timing or my feeling in two days.''
	   ``For sure it's a disappointment,'' added Kournikova, who won
the junior event here last year. ``I've never lost here and it
seems like a lucky tournament for me. I've never lost to Arantxa so
I think I had a great chance against her.''
	   Kournikova is in arguably the toughest section of the Wimbledon
draw, along with the Williams sisters and Mirjana Lucic.
	   ``I wouldn't say it's the toughest section,'' she said. ``All
players are tough, from number one to 128 or 132. They're all
tough. You don't have to think who's on the other side of the net.
You just play your own game.''
	   Third-seeded Sanchez Vicario completed her quarterfinal match
against Williams Friday after the match was tied 1-1 when rain
stopped play Thursday.
	   Sanchez Vicario's experience proved the difference in her 4-6,
6-4, 6-4 win over the teen-age American, who was playing her first
tournament on grass.
	   It was Williams' third loss this year to Sanchez Vicario and
followed a tense battle at the French Open in which Sanchez Vicario
accused the 16-year-old of showing no respect for other players.
	   The Spaniard broke to lead 4-3 in the third set but was broken
back in the next game after holding three game points. She
responded by breaking serve to love to lead 5-4, and claimed a two
hour 12 minute victory with a pass as a desperate Williams rushed
the net.
	   Although Williams tested Sanchez Vicario with a fierce forehand,
the Spaniard responded and both players were often at full stretch
in several fiercely contested rallies.
	   But Williams was often careless with her volleys, one of which
missed the court and had spectators at the back diving for cover.
	   Williams had her right thigh strapped, and also received
treatment to her lower right calf during play Thursday.
	   ``It's a little serious in some areas,'' Williams said. ``I had
my knee taped today, and my ankle and the side of my leg.''
	   ``It would have been tough for me to continue on in the next
rounds, but I'll definitely be all right for Wimbledon.''
	   Despite the nagging injuries on grass, Williams said she was
growing accustomed to it.
	   ``I'm getting used to it and feeling very comfortable on it,''
she said.
	   ``I'm playing pretty well on it and like the grass a lot. It's
definitely going to be one of my favorite surfaces.''
	   Williams said grass forced a player to attack and that was good
for her game.
	   ``It forces me to come forward a little more and that's exactly
what I need. At Wimbledon, whatever I do I have to always play my
game,'' she said.
	   `` I know if I do what I'm told I will come out victorious.''

Mechanical malfunctioning suspected in JAL accident in Manila: Report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A faulty electrical or hydraulic system was
probably what caused a Japan Airlines jetliner to swerve off a
runway during a landing last week in Manila, a news report said
Friday.
	   At least 23 passengers were injured while being evacuated from
the plane after the accident, which occurred as JL Flight 745 from
Tokyo carrying 264 people was making its second landing approach.
	   Nobody died, but two Japanese and a Filipino were hospitalized,
and the runway was closed for nearly 12 hours.
	   After reviewing flight records, airline officials discovered
that the right engine of the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 plane failed
to reverse, confirming what the plane's pilot, Capt. Minami
Takahashi, said shortly after the accident, Japan's national
broadcaster NHK reported.
	   When he reversed the thrust of the two engines to slow the plane
after touching down he felt the left engine reverse, but not the
right one, Takahashi has said. That forced the plane to swerve to
the left on the wet runway, he said.
	   The lever that activates the thrust transmits an electrical
signal to the hydraulic system which causes the engine to go into
reverse, slowing down the aircraft after initial touchdown.
	   JAL suspects a malfunctioning of the electric or hydraulic
system as a possible cause of the problem, NHK said. The airline
will further investigate the case.
	   The plane's left and central landing gear veered off the runway
and into the mud. The plane came to a halt with its left wing and
engine about a foot (30 centimeters) from the ground.

Yugoslav minister commits to dialogue; Says Belgrade wants to join EU 
</HEADLINE>

With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Yugoslavia's foreign minister on Friday
committed his government to a peaceful solution of the Kosovo
crisis and surprised his Luxembourg hosts by saying Belgrade
aspires to join the European Union.
	   Yugoslavia ``is determined to pursue a policy of dialogue'' to
quell separatist sentiments in the province of Kosovo, said
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. ``There are
practically no other ways and means to do so than through
democratic and peaceful ones.''
	   Jovanovic met with Jacques Poos, his Luxembourg opposite, for
three hours to discuss the Kosovo standoff.
	   At a joint press conference, both men condemned terrorism by
Kosovo forces and stressed the province cannot become an
independent state.
	   Jovanovic ``emphasized the importance we attach to cooperation''
between Boris Yeltsin and Slobodan Milosevic, the Russian and
Yugoslav presidents, to resolve the crisis and prevent possible
military action by the NATO alliance.
	   He said to that end Belgrade has made concessions by allowing
foreign envoys to enter Kosovo and urging Kosovo leaders back to
the negotiating table, an invitation that has been rejected as
Yugoslav security forces remain in the southern province.
	   ``I am optimistic that the dialogue will be resumed,'' Jovanovic
said.
	   Jovanovic, officials said, surprised Poos by giving a long
explanation of his government's aspirations to someday join the EU
although relations could hardly be worse than they are now.
	   The EU has imposed economic and other sanctions against Belgrade
because of the crackdown in Kosovo. One Luxembourg diplomat, who
asked not to be named, termed Jovanovic's presentation ``rather
surrealistic given what is going on right now in that country ...
He was citing economic growth figures!''
	   The EU will only entertain membership applications from
countries that have market economies, are firmly democratic and
have no border disputes with their neighbors.
	   Jovanovic said he thought it was important West European nations
``are informed bout Yugoslavia's strategy of European integration
... and good neighborly relations which Yugoslavia pursues with
Europe.''
	   Poos said he could not ``imagine a normalization of relations
(with Yugoslavia) without a just resolution of the Kosovo crises.''

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA Luxembourg, grafs 15-16 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote from Yugoslav foreign minister in
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Serbia continuing to build up
its forces in Kosovo, the top ethnic Albanian leader called Friday
for direct NATO intervention in the volatile province to ``prevent
further massacres.''
	   Despite a NATO show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have refused calls by Western leaders to
scale back the army and special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated
by NATO sources at 45,000 to 50,000.
	   Instead, Serb police and the Yugoslav army have been reinforcing
positions with convoys of tanks and armored vehicles, especially
along a main north-south artery between Pristina, the provincial
capital, and Prizren, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army may be hoping to cut the road off, as it did the
main east-west highway to Pec, further hampering the ability of
Serb forces to move through the province.
	   Serbian government spokesman Aleksandar Vucic said the forces
could not be withdrawn as long as the Kosovo Liberation Army
continues to fight.
	   ``To pick up and leave would not be an (adequate) response to
their attacks,'' Vucic told reporters in Pristina.
	   Yugoslavia has said that international mediation efforts further
the militants' cause.
	   The Kosovo Albanians' top political leader, Ibrahim Rugova,
called the situation ``very grave.''
	   At a brief news conference, he called on NATO to ``undertake all
possible measures to prevent further massacres and protect the
people in Kosovo.''
	   He also sought to downplay the significance of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, calling it an assemblage of ``small groups of
people fighting to protect their homes.''
	   The militants have been gaining popular support from villagers
frustrated with Rugova's policy of peaceful resistance, and claim
to control a large part of western Kosovo.
	   The militants want total independence for Kosovo _ a demand not
supported by the West, which supports the more moderate Rugova.
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.
	   Yugoslavia ``is determined to pursue a policy of dialogue,''
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said after meeting in Luxembourg
with Jacques Poos, his Luxembourg opposite, for three hours to
discuss Kosovo.
	   ``There are practically no other ways and means to do so than
through democratic and peaceful ones,'' Jovanovic said.
	   Meanwhile, there was more evidence in the Serbian capital
Belgrade that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was losing
support for his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Demonstrations by parents of Serb soldiers serving in the
explosive province continued. On Thursday, hundreds of parents had
blocked traffic in front of army headquarters.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and militant KLA fighters since the authorities launched a
crackdown on the last day of February.
	   Six Yugoslav army soldiers have been killed in the past month
and a half.
	   In Vienna, the International Helsinki Federation urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to immediately allow human rights
investigators into Kosovo.
	   The investigation is particularly urgent following reports that
up to 200 ethnic Albanian men may be held in a detention facility
in the Decani region, members told reporters.
	   International aid and human rights organizations have been
prevented from entering the province.

Turkish president tells EU not to allow Greece to hinder ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel on Friday urged
14 European Union nations not to allow fellow member Greece to
block ties with Turkey.
	   The call followed a EU summit meeting earlier this week, where
Greece objected to a clear statement that Turkey is in line to join
the EU.
	   ``It is your business, but you are becoming a tool of Greece's
enmity,'' Demirel said at a conference on Turkey-EU relations.
``Unintentionally, you are participating in unjust acts towards a
country, as demanded by another country.''
	   Turkey's relations with the union have been strained since
December when the EU invited Cyprus and 10 East European nations
for membership talks, but kept Turkey at bay, citing human rights
problems and disputes with Greece.
	   The EU was hoping that the summit in Cardiff, Wales, would
reverse that decision and mend ties with Turkey.
	   Greece, which has long-standing territorial disputes with
Turkey, maintains a veto on EU aid worth dlrs 400 million.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking bank workers stormed a
shareholders' meeting Friday to force the cancellation of a vote on
the sale of Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the meeting could begin. Protesters
ripped at the clothes of the bank's governor, Haris Stamatopoulos.
	   The bank's management had refused to discuss worker demands for
job and pension guarantees at the meeting.
	   The efforts to sell Ionian Bank is an important test of the
Socialist government's resolve to reform the banking sector and
bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   Failure to sell the bank or making major concessions to strikers
could be considered a major blow to the government of Premier
Costas Simitis.
	   Government officials said efforts would be made to hold the
shareholders' meeting later Friday. Law requires that it take place
within 20 days.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank.
	   An Athens court called for an immediate investigation into the
incidents, asking for video footage from television channels
covering the events in order to identify the troublemakers.
	   A prosecutor ordered the violent protesters to be arrested and
brought court within 24 hours, where they will face charges of
illegal violence and damaging property.
	   Meanwhile, a court Friday issued additional rulings deeming the
strike illegal. Ionian union officials will be liable for fines of
500,000 drachmas (dlrs 1,650) for each additional strike day, the
court ruled.
	   Workers have not heeded three previous court decisions banning
the strike.
	   Shares at the Athens Stock Exchange, which had opened higher on
upbeat expectations about the sale's approval, slipped after the
clashes broke out.

Russian economic officials prepare for IMF talks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Finance Ministry spokesman saying Russia expects
to get up to dlrs 10 billion more from IMF. TRIMS pvs.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects to get another dlrs 9 billion to
dlrs 10 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize its financial markets, a Finance Ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   An IMF delegation is due in Moscow on Monday for talks.
	   Russia will likely receive dlrs 6 billion to dlrs 7 billion in
the form of an extension of its existing dlrs 9.2 billion
three-year support loan, said Oleg Zhukov, spokesman for Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov.
	   He said the Central Bank will likely get dlrs 3 billion to boost
its foreign currency reserves, to protect against any future run on
the ruble.
	   The Central Bank and the IMF were unavailable for comment on
Zhukov's remarks, made only hours after President Boris Yeltsin
said that Russia wanted moral support, more than money, from
Western financial institutions.
	   ``What we really need is not their money, but their trust,''
Yeltsin said during a visit to the central Russian region of
Kostroma.
	   ``The situation is very grave, but we are holding up,'' Yeltsin
told reporters in Kostroma, about 320 kilometers (200 miles)
northeast of Moscow. ``Even such a strong country as Japan has been
gripped by a crisis, but we are holding up.''
	   Russia's newly appointed liaison to international financial
organizations tried to play down the IMF's decision Wednesday to
delay the latest installment on the dlrs 9.2 billion loan.
	   Anatoly Chubais told the NTV television channel late Thursday
that Russian officials have been preparing for ``big talks'' with
the IMF on a ``big credit.'' Earlier in the day, he had said dlrs
10 billion to 15 billion would be necessary to stabilize Russia's
battered economy.
	   The visit by an IMF delegation next week will give the
government an opportunity to ``resolve those issues that have
arisen in connection with this installment of the existing
credit,'' Chubais said.
	   He will meet with the acting chairman of the International
Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In Washington, an IMF spokesman said Thursday that the loan
installment was being delayed until next week.
	   According to Western bankers, the IMF has been playing tough
with Russia in part because it wants to be sure that the government
is sufficiently motivated to overhaul taxation and slash spending.
	   For its part, Russia wants an infusion of financial resources
that could restore investor confidence, Chubais told the RTR
television station Thursday night.
	   He said that because of the ``serious world financial crisis,''
Russia had to ``act vigorously, aggressively and assertively.''
	   The Russian Central Bank reported Thursday that combined foreign
currency and gold reserves were dlrs 15.7 billion on June 12, up
from dlrs 15 billion June 5. Since foreign investors are estimated
to hold around dlrs 20 billion worth of Russian ruble-denominated
government bonds, the size of the reserves has been a key concern
for investors.

Six who fear disease from growth hormone win damages 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LINCOLN, England (AP) _ Six people who fear they may develop a
fatal brain disease because they were treated with defective human
growth hormone won substantial damages from the government Friday.
	   The six were all treated as children and say they have developed
psychiatric problems as a result of being told that they may be
incubating the Creutzfeld-Jakob disease agent.
	   The awards ranged from 3,500 pounds (dlrs 5,800) to 300,000
pounds (dlrs 500,000).
	   Judge Michael Morland, presiding at the Crown Court in Lincoln,
said the psychiatric illnesses suffered by the six stemmed from
rational fears of ``succumbing to a ghastly lingering death from
CJD.''
	   ``No amount of psychotherapy or counselling can obliterate the
truth. Each plaintiff remains indefinitely at risk of CJD which is
inevitably fatal and not subject to amelioration or treatment.''
	   He added: ``For an individual plaintiff the risk may be remote
or, if it eventuates, may not occur for decades. But it is a real
risk.''
	   They were representative cases from a group of 35 people treated
with growth hormone extracted from corpses after July 1, 1977, and
who now fear they will contract the incurable CJD.
	   Between 1959 and 1985, nearly 2,000 children in the United
Kingdom whose growth was stunted because of a growth hormone
deficiency were treated with hormones.
	   The program was stopped in May, 1985, after several children who
had been treated in the United States died of CJD.
	   One form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been tentatively
linked to bovine spongiform encephalpathy, or ``mad cow disease.''

Mindful of Kosovo, Albania stages air exercise With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian military jets zoomed low over
the capital Friday in a display of air power designed to show the
nation's readiness if Kosovo violence spills over its border.
	   Six aging Chinese and Russian planes, including MiG-15s, MiG-17s
and MiG-19s, made air figures as Prime Minister Fatos Nano, Defense
Minister Luan Hajdarage, Western diplomats and reporters watched.
	   ``Our military aviation is now able to fulfill its military
tasks,'' said Astrit Jaupi, deputy chief of the Air Defense Force.
	   Five Albanian aircraft will join NATO planes in a joint military
exercise expected to take place next month, he said.
	   Last year, when the country slipped into chaos caused by the
collapse of pyramid schemes, angry mobs attacked and looted army
depots and the country's three military air bases in Rinas, Gjader
and Kucova.
	   Western television images showed civilians ransacking the base
at Kucova and towing MiG-19s down the national road behind their
cars.
	   ``I can't believe that in a few months we managed to make this
base function again, after last year's looting,'' said the
commander of the Rinas air base, Col. Murat Arra.

Mubarak says he turned down offer to buy nuclear bomb 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Egypt was offered nuclear weapons for sale
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Israeli peace activists on
Friday quoted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as telling them.
	   Mubarak said he turned down the offer because he did not want
his country to join the nuclear arms race, according to Motti
Awerbach, one of six members of the Israeli Peace Now group who met
with Mubarak on June 9 in Cairo.
	   During the two-hour meeting, Mubarak was asked by his visitors
whether he was concerned about last months nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan.
	   Mubarak proposed that the international community propose a plan
to destroy all weapons of mass destruction over the next 15 to 20
years, according to Awerbach, who took notes in the meeting.
	   ``It is easy to buy nuclear weapons,'' Awerbach quoted Mubarak
as saying.
	   ``After the fall of the Soviet bloc, I could have bought a bomb.
I was offered one, and I refused,'' he quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   Mubarak did not say who offered him the nuclear weapons.

England hits back after Rhodes's century 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with tea score
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The see-sawing test between England and South
Africa at Lord's swung back in England's favor with the second new
ball Friday but not before Jonty Rhodes scored a brilliant century.
	   Rhodes ended a five-year wait for a test century with a
well-timed 117 on the second day of the second test.
	   His second test century and a record-fifth wicket stand with
skipper Hansie Cronje rescued the Proteas' innings from a
precarious 46 for four to a more commanding 302 for seven by tea on
the second day.
	   Mark Boucher and Lance Klusener survived 20 minutes to remain
unbeaten on 10 and 15, respectively.
	   Medium-pacer Dominic Cork removed Shaun Pollock to claim his
second five-wicket haul in as many matches, as South Africa slumped
from 230 for four to 283 for seven.
	   It was a frustrating morning session for England, which had to
wait until after lunch to dislodge the defiant fifth-wicket
alliance between Cronje and Rhodes.
	   Mark Ealham, who came into the attack for the first time after
lunch, forced Cronje to hit a catch to Mark Ramprakash at cover.
	   Cronje, who hadn't scored a half century in nine previous tests
against England, scored 81 in just under four hours.
	   The 184-run stand from 322 balls was a South African record for
the fifth wicket, surpassing the 157 between Tony Pithey and John
Waite, also against England at the Wanderers in 1964/65.
	   Rhodes, denied a century in the first test at Edgbaston when
dismissed for 95, survived a confident appeal for lbw on 95 and
then was hit on the helmet two balls later by Dean Headley.
	   He eventually reached the century, his first in 43 innings,
flicking Headley for three through midwicket. His only other
century, an unbeaten 101, came in his fifth test against Sri Lanka
at Moratuwa in 1993/94.
	   Rhodes, who was dropped by Mike Atherton on 10, was finally
caught behind off Angus Fraser. He was one of the two victims of
the second new ball, which was taken in the 83rd over.
	   Rhodes scored more than half his runs with boundaries, hitting
14 boundaries and a big six in his 117.
	   Cork and Nasser Hussain combined to dismiss Pollock with the
10th delivery with the second new ball _ Cork getting a thick edge
and Hussain taking a brilliant catch at second slip.
	   Cork has followed up his 5-93 in Edgbaston with 5-99 while
Fraser and Ealham have picked up a wicket each.

World Cup: French midfielder suspended for two matches 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France received a blow to its World Cup hopes
Friday when star playmaker Zinedine Zidane was handed a two-match
suspension.
	   FIFA's disciplinary commission issued the ban after Zidane was
given a red card for planting his studs in the side of Saudi Arabia
captain Fouad Amin in a match Thursday at Stade de France. France
won 4-0 to clinch a spot in the second round.
	   The ban was confirmed by French soccer federation spokesman
Philippe Tournon. It means Zidane will miss the France-Denmark
match next Wednesday in Lyon, its last of the opening round, and
France's second-round match against an undecided opponent on June
28.
	   ``This is a very harsh decision. This inexcusable act deserved a
one-match ban,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet. ``No one will
replace Zidane. The French team will organize itself in a different
way.
	   The red card was one of five issued in two games Thursday as
referees answered an order from newly elected FIFA president Sepp
Blatter to crack down on fouls.
	   ``This red card is harsh, even though you shouldn't argue with
the referee's decision,'' Zidane said Friday before he heard the
news from the disciplinary committee.
	   ``I dragged my leg and Amin fell under it,'' he said. ``It
wasn't very bad. I saw the images on TV, and it looked worse.''
	   ``Logic dictates that I will be suspended only one match,'' the
Juventus star said before the decision.
	   The FIFA disciplinary committee did not agree, and in addition
to the suspension Zidane was fined 5,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 7,450).

Pakistan accused in killing of 25 Hindus in Kashmir ambush EDS : UPDATES thruout. ADDS byline. 
</HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BATOTE, India (AP) _ Five men armed with weapons swooped on a
group of Hindu revelers returning from a wedding, killing 25 people
in a mountainous village, Kashmir's police chief said Friday.
	   Police had identified a member of the outlawed militant Islamic
Hizb-ul-Mujahideen outfit among the assailants, Gurbachan Jagat
said in a telephone interview from the provincial capital Srinagar.
	   He said six people of the group of 36 were also injured in the
massacre at Chapnali village, 190 kilometers (115 miles) northeast
of the Himalayan state's winter capital of Jammu.
	   Kashmir's chief minister Farooq Abdullah charged Pakistan-backed
terrorist groups in the attack, an official spokesman said.
	   The five attackers emerged from a thick forest as the group was
resting by a mountain stream, and started firing indiscriminately,
the police official quoted eyewitnesses as saying.
	   The bride survived but the groom was killed on the spot.
	   None of Kashmir's separatist outfits _ fighting Indian security
forces for nine years to either carve out an independent state of
Kashmir or merge with Pakistan _ claimed responsibility.
	   The Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and the Harkat-ul-Ansar have their
strongholds in the region, Jagat said. Twenty five Hindus were
killed in the same region by Muslim terrorists in April this year.
	   Within hours of the massacre, Abdullah spoke on the phone to the
federal Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani, a hardliner in the
ruling coalition who has accused Pakistan with patronizing the
insurgency in Kashmir and threatened it with tough Indian
retaliation.
	   Abdullah urged the federal government to dispatch more security
forces to battle the insurgents, the spokesman said. The Indian
Army is leading the offensive against Kashmiri insurgents with help
from the paramilitary and the local police force.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since
gaining freedom from colonial British rule in 1947 and the dispute
remains the most contentious in a list of disagreements between New
Delhi and Islamabad.
	   The frontier Himalayan territory is now divided between the two
countries with both staking claim to the whole province.

Doctors amputate hand and foot of convicted thief 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Four doctors, their faces hidden
behind surgical masks, amputated the right hand and left foot of a
convicted thief Friday before a crowd of about 2,000 people.
	   The thief, Bashir Ahmed, was a soldier in the Taliban religious
army when he robbed three people of dlrs 500 near the front line in
northeastern Afghanistan, said an unidentified religious scholar,
who oversaw the amputation.
	   The Taliban religious army has imposed a strict brand of Islamic
justice in the 85 percent of Afghanistan under its control.
	   It calls for the amputation of limbs of convicted thieves,
execution of murderers and the public beating of criminals
convicted of lesser crimes, including women who do not wear the
required covering from head to toe.
	   Public punishments are held in the sports stadium almost weekly.
	   Outside the stadium, dozens of boys played soccer.
	   Asked why he wasn't watching the amputation, Abdul Jamil said
``everyone is tried of these things.''
	   Instead, he wanted to play soccer, having heard on radio about
the World Cup soccer championship being played in France.
	   The Taliban is fighting an opposition alliance, made up mostly
of the country's minorities, on three different battlefields north
of the capital.
	   The alliance accuses the Taliban of following strict tribal
tradition, rather than the Muslim holy book, the Koran.

Yeltsin: Russia doesn't need Western money, only trust

	   KOSTROMA, Russia (AP) _ Russia is holding up fine despite its
economic problems, and would rather get a vote of confidence from
the West than its money, President Boris Yeltsin said Friday.
	   Yeltsin's upbeat comments echoed what his government was saying
during last month's market plunge _ but contrasted sharply with new
efforts by Kremlin officials to gain an infusion of Western cash.
	   The finance minister's spokesman said Russia expected dlrs 9
billion to dlrs 10 billion in new aid from the International
Monetary Fund next week. The man Yeltsin appointed to work with
international financial organizations confirmed Russia was
preparing for ``big talks'' for ``big credits.''
	   ``The situation is very grave, but we are holding up,'' Yeltsin
acknowledged during a visit to the central Russian city of
Kostroma.
	   He insisted that a simple vote of confidence from international
financial organizations would suffice to keep foreign investors in
Russia and prevent markets from collapsing.
	   ``We don't need money,'' Yeltsin told reporters in Kostroma,
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Moscow. ``We need
their trust in Russia .... And a statement to that effect would be
decisive for all investors and for all banks in the world.''
	   The hugely unpopular Anatoly Chubais, who was brought back into
Yeltsin's inner circle this week after twice being fired, said that
Russia needed dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion to stabilize its
battered economy.
	   A spokesman for Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the IMF
is likely to extend Russia's existing dlrs 9.2 billion, three-year
support loan by dlrs 9 billion to dlrs 10 billion.
	   Oleg Zhukov said the Central Bank will likely get a dlrs 3
billion boost in the form of a special reserve facility. The
Central Bank says it has combined foreign currency and gold
reserves of dlrs 15.7 billion. But it's estimated that foreign
investors hold around dlrs 20 billion of ruble-denominated
government bonds.
	   Neither the Central Bank nor the IMF were available to comment.
	   Chubais will meet Tuesday and Wednesday with the acting chairman
of the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer.
	   Besides the new aid, the two men are expected to discuss the IMF
decision to delay the latest installment on the existing dlrs 9.2
billion loan. Western bankers say the IMF wants to be sure that
Russia is committed to improving tax collections, slashing spending
and carrying out other reforms.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin told students in Kostroma that he would not
seek a third term because ``the constitution would not permit
that.''
	   Though Yeltsin has repeatedly denied that he would run for
president, his aides have kept speculation alive by hinting that
the 67-year-old leader may change his mind.
	   The Russian constitution limits presidents to two terms, but
aides have suggested Yeltsin's first term shouldn't count because
it began during Soviet times.
	   Lawmakers opposed to Yeltsin mustered enough votes in the lower
house of parliament Friday to begin preparing an impeachment
motion. But the State Duma gave itself 18 months to launch the
proceedings, suggesting the effort might lose steam like several
previous attempts.
	   However, the Communist-initiated vote was the first time that
the Duma has managed to set up a panel to prepare a formal
indictment.
	   The Communists and their allies accuse Yeltsin of a range of
transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the
country's economy.

FC Copenhagen buys own stadium for dlrs 20 million

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ FC Copenhagen, which finished third
in this year's Danish soccer league, has bought the national Parken
stadium for 138 million kroner (dlrs 20 million), the club
management said Friday.
	   The stock-listed Copenhagen club would partly pay for the
purchase of its own stadium, which also is the home turf of
Denmark's national team, by a share issue that is expected to bring
in some 60 million kroner (dlrs 8.6 million).
	   FC Copenhagen. which would take over as of July 1, purchased the
soccer arena and not the conference facility that is part of the
downtown stadium.#
	   Parken has been the home of FC Copenhagen since the club was
born from the merger of the city's two main teams _ B1903 and KB
merged _ in 1992.

Swiss banks' dlrs 600 million settlement offer meets angry response 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An offer by Swiss commercial banks of
dlrs 600 million to settle claims by Holocaust victims brought an
angry response Friday from Jewish representatives in the
negotiations.
	   ``My 31,000 clients will not stand for this,'' said Edward
Fagan, attorney for a class-action claim in New York to dormant
accounts in Swiss banks.
	   The co-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization
called the offer to settle claims for money allegedly stolen from
dormant accounts opened before the end of World War II ``very
humiliating.''
	   ``Our people were killed because we were perceived and accused
of being the rich man of Europe,'' Avraham Burg told APTV in
Jerusalem.
	   Swiss banks, meanwhile, prosper ``from all this money and gave
back very little from what they took and looted from our brothers
and sisters and other Holocaust victims,'' Burg said.
	   ``It is no-go ... that we will be robbed as rich people and paid
as poor beggars.''
	   Both sides accused the other of violating a confidentiality
agreement.
	   The banks issued a statement saying they were breaking their
silence on two months of negotiations, held under the auspices of
U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, because of repeated
blatant news leaks by Jewish organizations and the plaintiffs'
lawyers.
	   But the World Jewish Congress said it was the banks that were
breaking the accord by going public with their statement.
	   Recent reports from New York citing sources close to the talks
have said the banks _ Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse _ were offering dlrs 1 billion or more.
	   The dlrs 600 million offered by the banks would include dlrs 70
million already paid into a Swiss fund to help needy Holocaust
survivors, the statement said.
	   Friday's exchange of accusations left unclear the future of the
banks' negotiations with Jewish organizations and lawyers for
claimants in a multi-billion-dollar suit filed in New York.
	   The banks' statement ``expressed continued interest to reach a
fair settlement.''
	   But they claimed that ``the World Jewish Congress and the
plaintiffs' lawyers are seriously jeopardizing the settlement
negotiations.''
	   ``Negotiations could continue if the banks will finally make the
full offer they promised,'' Fagan said.
	   WJC President Edgar Bronfman has instructed the organization's
representatives to meet with New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi
and Eizenstat to determine the future of the negotiations,
spokesman Elan Steinberg said in a statement.
	   Hevesi has spearheaded threats by U.S. cities and states to
impose sanctions on the Swiss banks in the dispute. The threats
were suspended for the negotiations.
	   Jewish organizations say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks when the Nazis were gaining power in
Europe.
	   Plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their
heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or
demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to
relatives of those who died in concentration camps.
	   Friday's statement is the first time the banks have named a
figure for a possible settlement.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' they said.
``The banks view this offer to be at the upper limit of what can be
justified, based on the facts and circumstances.''
	   The banks said they ``would not entertain unfounded and
excessive payments above this amount.''
	   The Swiss Federation of Hebrew Congregations, which has often
been critical of action against the banks in the United States,
declined to comment on the offer.
	   Martin Rosenfeld, the organization's general secretary, said the
negotiations were a private affair between the banks and the
plaintiffs.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler has met for
the first time with a number of Western ambassadors, telling them
Nigeria's relations with the outside world will be ``based on
mutual respect and esteem,'' according to a government statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar met Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador
William Twaddel, British envoy Graham Burton and French Ambassador
Phillipe Peltier.
	   The envoys told Abubakar that they want him to quickly return
Nigeria to democratic rule, Western diplomatic sources said.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Defense chiefs from the three-nation East
African Cooperation were in northeastern Kenya Friday to oversee
the first joint military exercises involving Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania.
	   The maneuvers, called Exercise Natural Fire 98, are sponsored by
the U.S. Central Command, and include about 1,700 regional troops
and 450 U.S. troops.
	   The chiefs _ Tanzania's Edgar Maukola Majogo, Uganda's Amama
Mbabazi and Kenya's Gideon Ndambuki _ travelled to a training camp
at Lodwar, 480 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of Nairobi. They
were accompanied by senior military officers.
	   The exercise is intended to provide training in regional peace
keeping.
	   On Thursday, the ministers agreed on the implementation of an
EAC memorandum that is expected to culminate in a defense pact
among the three nations.
	   The defense chiefs said they would next meet in October in the
Ugandan capital of Kampala.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Squatters invaded three farms owned by
whites and demanded land, but the government immediately condemned
the action.
	   Farm leaders said Friday about 140 people, evidently led by
veterans of the war that let to independence in 1980, occupied the
properties Thursday near Marondera, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east
of Harare.
	   They were protesting delays in a controversial government
program to seize white-owned farms and hand them over to landless
black peasants.
	   Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai, speaking at a business
convention in the northwestern resort of Victoria Falls, said
police will be ordered to remove the squatters if they do not leave
the properties voluntarily.
	   Last year the government said it would start resettling peasants
in June on the first of nearly 1,500 farms targeted for seizure.
	   ``When the farms have been acquired and are ready, people will
be resettled in an orderly manner,'' Kangai told business leaders.
	   -----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Relatives of dictator Kamuzu Banda, who
died in November at age 99, have filed an application asking a
court to disband a trust he set up to look after his money.
	   In the latest twist of the battle over Banda's will, the
independent Nation newspaper said the relatives want to strip
former police minister John Tembo, uncle of Banda's longtime
companion Cecilia Kadzamira, of control over some of the assets.
	   Relatives, the Malawi Congress party founded by Banda and a
private high school he built allege the trust headed by Tembo was
blocking funds Banda intended for them.
	   Family members who received little in the will allege Kadzamira
forced Banda to make her the main beneficiary of the private
fortune he amassed during his 30-year dictatorship.
	   Banda was ousted in the first democratic elections in 1994.
Several claims contesting his will have been filed in the High
Court.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana will seek to strengthen military
cooperation with China, President Jerry Rawlings told a visiting
delegation from the Asian nation.
	   Ghana could learn a lot from China's military and would soon
engage in joint military exercises similar to ones organized in
conjunction with the United States, Rawlings told reporters
Thursday, the second day of a visit by Chinese army officials to
this West African nation.
	   Delegation leader Gen. Fang Zuqi underlined the importance of
sub-regional peace and urged West African nations to help
themselves rather than rely on foreign support.
	   Zuqi praised Rawlings for his leadership towards political and
economic independence and pledged military support in the form of
training and logistics.
	   Ghana and China have enjoyed warm relations dating back to the
1960's, with the latter lending major support in areas of
agriculture, technology and education.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ Congolese frozen food retailers have
threatened a strike to protest a recently imposed value added tax.
	   In a letter to the government Thursday, the Association of
Frozen Fish and Meat Sellers warned that they would go on strike if
the government did not review the tax, which is currently pegged at
18.5 percent.
	   The vendors urged authorities to make a special allowance for
frozen food produce, as has been done for cement.
	   In hopes of reviving the construction industry after last year's
5 month civil war, the government reduced the VAT on cement to 12
percent.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Neo-Nazi leader Eugene
TerreBlanche repeated his willingness to accept full responsibility
for any political crimes committed by his followers before the
nation's first all-race election in 1994.
	   In a statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission _ the
panel investigating apartheid era political crimes _ TerreBlanche
supported amnesty for former Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)
commandant Abie Fourie, one of 10 AWB members applying for amnesty
for a pre-election bombing blitz.
	   More than 30 AWB members were arrested after the blasts killed
21 people. Eventually, 14 AWB members were convicted of various
crimes.
	   ``As political head of the AWB I accept political and moral
responsibility for the acts that have been committed,''
TerreBlanche said.
	   TerreBlanche, who also has applied for amnesty, has been
sentenced to six years in jail for attempted murder and other
charges stemming from attacks on two black men.
	   He had said in April he would accept responsibility.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms dotted the local
coastal waters throughout much of the night, moving west near 15
mph. A few of these affected the Virgin Islands and east and
southeast sections of Puerto Rico. However, showers began to end
across the Virgin Islands and our eastern coastal waters around 4
a.m.
	   Satellite photos early this morning revealed the reason for the
end to showers across east sections of our area overnight. Dry low
level air occurring just ahead of an approaching tropical wave
could be seen moving west across the northeast Caribbean and into
the Virgin Islands. This is not an unusual occurrence for a
tropical wave, to have this dry air just ahead of it, and this
drier air should dominate our area today. However, a narrow and
elongated upper level trough across our region for a week or so
will persist across our vicinity through saturday to maintain
unstable middle to upper atmospheric conditions. This will allow
those showers and thunderstorms that do develop today to become
intense, particularly across the mountainous interior and western
sections of Puerto Rico.
	   Increasing cloudiness with scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms are expected into the Virgin Islands shortly after
sunset today to bring an abrupt change in the weather. This
weather, associated with the tropical wave, is then expected to
reach eastern Puerto Rico around midnight. Showers and
thunderstorms developing across the local coastal waters at that
time will produce gusty winds, locally rough seas and very low
visibilities. Small craft should remain alert for threatening or
hazardous marine conditions this evening through Saturday as the
tropical wave passes through and to the south of our region.
 &UR; San Juan and north sections of Puerto Rico

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military faction
_ low on ammunition and apparently on the run _ launched a dawn
artillery strike Friday on the country's battered capital, the
Senegalese military says.
	   At least a dozen 155-millimeter shells rained down on the city,
where the streets were still strewn with the bodies of victims from
previous attacks.
	   A billowing cloud of black smoke was seen from the northern side
of the city, a Senegalese military commander said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The attack came one day after proposed peace talks collapsed and
clandestine rebel radio warned of an assault on the capital,
Bissau.
	   In another broadcast, the rebels accused the government of
creating a humanitarian crisis.
	   ``The fighting is affecting the people,'' said Maj. Manuel De
Santos Gomes in a broadcast monitored in the Senegalese bordertown
of Mpak. ``We are trying to help the people and bring justice to
our country.''
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane staged a failed
coup bid earlier this month to oust President Joao Bernardo Vieira
after accusing him of widespread corruption.
	   A peace envoy, Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe,
returned to his country aboard a French naval ship after failing to
meet with Mane.
	   Almost two weeks after launching the unsuccessful coup, Mane's
renegade forces are on the run, reportedly ousted from their
stronghold at the military garrison of Bra on Bissau's outskirts.
	   Senegalese troops fighting on behalf of Vieira were closing in
on Bissau's international airport, which is now controlled by the
rebels.
	   ``We hope to free the airport to allow reliefs supplies to come
in,'' the commander said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people have reportedly fled Bissau,
setting the stage for a massive humanitarian crisis if food and
drinking water do not reach large groups of internal refugees, the
regional office of the Senegalese Red Cross said.
	   ``There are thousands of people suffering,'' said Red Cross
representative Jerome Da Sylva. ``They are in urgent need of food
and water and shelter.''
	   Although fewer in number than in previous days, refugees from
Guinea-Bissau continued to pour across the border into the
Senegalese town of Mpak.
	   The army here sealed the border earlier this week, but have
allowed some refugees to cross.
	   Reports of a yellow fever outbreak and cases of meningitis in
Guinea-Bissau have triggered concerns that the diseases may spread
quickly thorough the refugee communities.
	   Vaccinations tables have been set up at Mpak, where most of the
refugees are arriving.
	   Toting burlap sacks with all they could carry, hundreds of
refugees have crossed the border over the past two days, but
authorities here say their numbers are dropping because there are
no vehicles left to carry people in Guinea-Bissau to the border.
	   ``The people are arriving in very bad condition,'' said
Senegalese Health Department worker Bayo Bodian said.
	   For many, the plight was made worse by heavy shelling in the
northern towns of Ingore and Bula, just a few kilometers from the
Senegalese frontier.
	   Senegal's army has sent troops and artillery fire across the
border, and troops from the Republic of Guinea, south of
Guinea-Bissau, have been fighting for the loyalists.

Ukrainian president signs economic decrees to stave off crisis

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Saying Ukraine's finances are approaching a
crisis, President Leonid Kuchma has eased taxes and other payments
to the state, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
	   Kuchma signed 10 emergency economic decrees Thursday night after
a nationally broadcast address in which he said the country's
parliament was too ``paralyzed'' to act.
	   He warned that Ukraine's heavy international borrowing was
nearing the critical mark, and that the crisis could undermine the
stability of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   Kuchma halved the obligatory payments by employers to a
government fund dealing with the consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear disaster. Now they will pay a sum amounting to 5 percent of
their workers' salaries.
	   He also introduced a single tax on agricultural produce to
replace 10 existing taxes. He allocated 1.25 billion hryvna (dlrs
625 million) to pay overdue wages, pensions and social benefits,
Interfax said.
	   Several other orders allow the government to introduce new
excise and import tariffs, restructure or cancel debts by
agricultural enterprises and set up ``special economic zones'' in
the coal-producing Donetsk region, it said.
	   First deputy premier Serhiy Tihipko said Friday the government
was preparing 10 more economic decrees for Kuchma to sign. He said
Cabinet also would propose that Kuchma approve the revised 1998
budget, which slashed the planned deficit, by decree in view of
parliament's inability to act.
	   Kuchma's attempts at market reforms have long been stalled by
parliament. The current Verkhovna Rada, elected in March, is
dominated by Communists and centrist opponents.
	   A senior U.S. official endorsed Kuchma's steps but said Ukraine
needed fundamental reforms to overcome its economic woes.
	   ``Ukraine has very serious financial difficulties right now and
actions will have to be taken to avert a financial crisis in the
future,'' said Ambassador Richard Morningstar, President Clinton's
adviser for the former Soviet republics.
	   ``We hope very much and expect that the actions taken by
President Kuchma and overall, the actions that will be taken over
the next weeks, will create a positive situation,'' he told a news
conference in Kiev.
	   Morningstar said aid from the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund would be important for Ukraine _ but not enough. The
country must also take steps to raise economic growth, make
structural reforms in the tax system, and create private
agricultural and energy sectors, he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Market intervention to stop the yen's fall may work
for now, but Japan needs to clean up its troubled banking system
quickly to support its currency for the long term, a top U.S.
financial official said Friday.
	   Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met with
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga and both welcomed
effects of the joint U.S.-Japan action to aid the ailing yen _ a 7
yen gain against the dollar in three days.
	   But to restore the yen's strength in the long run, Summers urged
Japan to restore the health of its financial system. Japan's banks
are saddled with 76 trillion yen (dlrs 563 billion) in bad debt,
officials said.
	   ``What is important for currencies over time is fundamentals,
and fundamentals depend on policies,'' a U.S. official traveling
with Summers's delegation said on condition of anonymity.
	   Summers described the talks in Tokyo as ``very good.'' But the
U.S. delegation also made it clear that Japan should move to spur
economic growth, according to the U.S. official.
	   And though officials said that the United States was ready to
help again to shore up the yen, Kyodo News also reported that
Summers said there was a the Japanese currency could plunge again
without decisive action by Tokyo.
	   Summers and other U.S. finance officials were hastily dispatched
to Tokyo over fears a weakened yen _ and entire Japanese economy _
could plunge Asia into an even deeper financial morass.
	   The government announced last week that the Japanese economy
shrank in 1997 for the first time in 23 years, heightening fears
Tokyo is not doing enough to get its house in order.
	   The visit also comes at a precarious time for Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose Liberal Democratic Party is
juggling financial crisis and an upcoming election for the upper
house of Parliament.
	   Hashimoto's Cabinet has taken the brunt of the blame for Japan's
feeble economy. A poll this week by the Yomiuri newspaper showed
support for his government at an all-time low of 29.9 percent.
	   Fears about the health of Japan's banks rose Friday after a
downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked frantic selling of
the stock of a major bank _ Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   After his meetings with U.S. officials, Matsunaga called an
impromptu press conference that seemed designed to stop those fears
from spreading.
	   ``There is no evidence that a Japanese bank might fail,'' he
said.
	   And he reassured investors and depositors that his ministry
would ``take all possible measures to stabilize the financial
system.''
	   In a move that could help boost the economy and his standing in
the polls, Hashimoto reportedly has decided to slash corporate and
income taxes. Hashimoto made the decision after a telephone
conversation Wednesday with President Clinton, the Mainichi
newspaper reported.
	   The report said Hashimoto plans to announce his decision before
the July 12 election.
	   In Washington, Clinton said Hashimoto had pledged to come out
with a statement soon on actions the government would take, but no
timetable was set.
	   ``I said to him ... that no short-term efforts would work unless
there was a serious, long-term, very comprehensive commitment to
economic reform,'' Clinton said.
	   Hashimoto told Clinton that ``they were prepared to issue a
statement that would be clear and specific about what they intended
to do in a timely fashion,'' the U.S. president added.
	   Earlier Friday, the chief of Japan's central bank, Masaru
Hayami, told Summers that disposing of soured loans is vital to
sparking an economic recovery, the Bank of Japan said in a
statement. It did not specify measures to dispose of those loans,
however.
	   Rampant lending during Japan's speculative ``bubble'' economy of
the late 1980s has saddled banks with mountains of bad loans.
	   In a luncheon meeting, Summers and senior officials of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party discussed strategies such as
creating an institution to take over the loans, the Nikkei news
service reported.
	   Summers also said it is more important for Japan to stimulate
the economy than to put the country's finances in order by
tightening spending, the Nikkei said.
	   The yen plummeted this week to an eight-year low against the
dollar, raising fears of another bout of Asian currency
devaluations. The United States and Japan intervened to halt the
yen's free-fall on Wednesday, buying up the currency and pushing
the dollar down more than 5 yen from the previous day's levels in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar bought 136.84 yen in afternoon trading Friday, down
0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo.
	   At the first of Friday's high-level meetings, Summers joined
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi in applauding the success of
the joint intervention to stop the yen's slide.
	   Japan will host a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday of finance
officials from around the world to discuss the Asian economic
situation. Summers will attend that meeting as well.

Riot police fire into air as Yemenis protest hike in oil prices 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Riot police fired into the air Friday to
disperse hundreds of Yemenis protesting against a 40 percent hike
in fuel prices, a security official said.
	   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully from the main square of
the capital, San`a, and there were no reports of casualties, the
official said.
	   The protesters called on the government to reverse its decision,
announced Thursday and implemented Friday, to raise the prices of
gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by about 40 percent.
	   The cost of public transport in the capital jumped by nearly 100
percent Friday morning.
	   The hikes were in line with the requirements of the
International Monetary Fund for the government to remove subsidies
on petroleum products and other commodities like flour and sugar by
the end of 1998.
	   On Thursday, an official with the state-run Yemen Oil Company
said one gallon (3.8 liters) of gasoline would cost 133 riyals (dlr
1), up from 95 riyals (69 cents) and one gallon (3.8 liters) of
kerosene would sell for 57 riyals (41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals
(30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles would cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from
150 riyals (dlrs 1.1), said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The government raised the price of petroleum products by 25
percent in July 1997.
	   The monthly salaries of civil servants range between 1,880
riyals (dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200).
	   The increase in oil prices was scheduled for January, but was
never carried out because of conflicts over political and economic
policies between the former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in this impoverished
country.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than one year in office, was replaced
by Abdel-Karim al-Iryani in May.
	   The government has already cut back other subsidies and stepped
up privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the
requested reforms.
	   The IMF's other recommendations for rebuilding the economy
include floating Yemen's currency, the riyal and a cut in public
spending.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.
	   Yemen currently produces 380,000 barrels of oil a day, earning
31 billion riyals (dlrs 235 million) a year from exports.

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A gunbattle in Karachi's ethnically
divided eastern district left four people dead Friday, all of them
caught in the crossfire, said police officials.
	   That brought Friday's death toll in ethnic-related violence in
Karachi to seven.
	   Earlier Friday, policemen discovered the mutilated bodies of two
men in an abandoned car and another man was killed in Orangi
district of Karachi. .
	   Police and paramilitary troops also have stepped up security
throughout the congested city of 14 million people, after four days
of violence that has resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen
people.
	   Officials linked Friday's killings to bitter fighting between
rival factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement.
	   The tortured bodies of the two unidentified men were found in
central Nazimabad, a stronghold of the largest Altaf Hussein
faction, named for its exiled leader.
	   An activist with the rival Haqiqi faction had been gunned down
outside his home late Thursday.
	   Also Thursday, two people were gunned down and three policemen
were injured when their vehicle was fired upon; and two bombings
injured 10 people, prompting increased security outside all
government and public buildings.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held a series of meetings with
senior officials in Karachi seeking an end to the relentless
violence.
	   ``This situation has to come to an end,'' he told reporters in
Karachi.
	   In recent years Karachi has been wracked by violence, much of it
between the rival groups.
	   Police have arrested dozens of militants from both factions, but
have been unsuccessful in stopping the carnage.
	   The Mohajir Qami Movement represents Indian Muslims who settled
in Pakistan when the British left the subcontinent in 1947 and
created Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of the region.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fearful that Serbian forces are
readying new attacks in Kosovo despite Western demands that they
withdraw, the top ethnic Albanian leader in the province appealed
Friday for direct NATO intervention.
	   ``NATO should undertake all possible measures to prevent further
massacres and protect the people of Kosovo,'' Ibrahim Rugova said
at a news conference in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Ignoring NATO's show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have been reinforcing their army and
special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated by NATO sources at
45,000 to 50,000.
	   Serbian forces have sealed the border with Albania _ cutting off
an escape route for refugees _ while reportedly continuing to
attack border villages they claim are havens for the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Convoys of armored vehicles have also been seen taking positions
along a main north-south artery between Pristina and Prizren, near
the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the militants may be
hoping to cut it, as it did the main east-west highway to Pec,
further hampering the ability of Serb forces to move through the
province.
	   The NATO flights over Albania and Macedonia this week were
intended to force Serbia to scale down its forces in Kosovo so that
negotiations between the two sides could resume.
	   But the Serbian government insists its deployment is legitimate
to combat the ``terrorists,'' who train across the border in
Albania and smuggle in weapons and supplies.
	   ``All international pressures on Serbia (to withdraw) ... are a
direct help to separatists,'' Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic
was quoted Friday as saying by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and KLA fighters since the authorities began a crackdown on Feb.
28.
	   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians also have been driven from
their homes in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Geneva, Kris Janowski, said at least 13,000
had sought refuge in Albania, but that the flow dried up this week
when the Serbs clamped down on the border.
	   ``This does not mean that there are no people in Kosovo who
would like to cross,'' he said. ``Some people may actually be
caught in the mountains, unable to go back to the villages and
towns and at the same time afraid of crossing the border.''
	   He said U.N. officials _ like foreign journalists _ were not
being allowed into the region to investigate.
	   Rugova, however, called the situation ``very grave.''
	   Sources in Pristina close to him and his party claimed that Serb
forces were shelling at least 10 villages Friday west of Djakovica,
which is 75 kilometers (about 50 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serbian crackdown has swollen the ranks of the militants,
who control a large part of western Kosovo. Their new spokesman has
dismissed Rugova's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the
crisis and called for Albanian politicians to join the armed
struggle.
	   Rugova, however, sought to downplay the KLA's political
significance, calling them ``small groups of people fighting to
protect their homes.''
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said, the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.

Stewart dances to first-round lead at Open updated AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Carnevale's first bogey of tournament; will be
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart was the only one who really
felt like dancing at the U.S. Open.
	   The other eight players who managed to break par in the first
round Thursday were either too surprised to see their names on the
leaderboard or simply relieved to get off the course before it
caught up with them.
	   ``Always be satisfied with making par,'' said Stewart, who
speaks from experience of having won this championship seven years
ago at Hazeltine.
	   On a day when The Olympic Club beat up so many others, Stewart
shook his body in celebration on the 17th green when a 45-foot
(13.72-meter) putt fell, the centerpiece of a masterful
birdie-birdie-birdie finish.
	   That gave him a 4-under-par 66 and a one-stroke lead over Mark
Carnevale. Another stroke back were Tom Lehman, Jose Maria Olazabal
and Bob Tway _ all past major championship winners _ along with Joe
Durant, the only player to reach 5-under during the day.
	   Lehman, who has had the lead going into the final round of the
last three U.S. Opens, birdied three of the last four holes, and
Olazabal holed a 6-foot (1.83-meter) birdie putt on the 18th.
	   ``I took advantage of some breaks out there,'' Stewart said.
``When we get them, you have to take advantage of them, especially
in a U.S. Open, because you don't get that many.''
	   Carnevale was the only player who went the entire first round
without a bogey. That didn't last long Friday.
	   He drove into the rough on No. 2 and, with a surprisingly decent
lie, tried to go at the green on the 394-yard (360-meter) hole
instead of hitting a wedge into the fairway.
	   The approach came up short in the rough, and his sand wedge
traveled only about 20 feet (6.10 meters) into more thick stuff. He
chipped out to 35 feet (10.67 meters) and two-putted for a double
bogey, dropped him back to 1-under.
	   ``That didn't help,'' he said on the tee box at the par-3 third
hole, where he again found the rough. This time, he managed to save
par.
	   Durant, playing in the same threesome, holed a 30-foot
(9.14-meter) birdie putt on the par-5 opening hole, the easiest on
the course, but gave it back by dumping his approach on No. 2 into
the bunker and two-putting from 20 feet (6.10 meters).
	   Stewart called his 4-3-3 finish ``unheard of'' on the closing
holes of Olympic, but that wasn't the only unusual twist.
	   Amateur Paul Simson was 2-under at the turn until a spectator
ran off with his errant tee shot on the 10th hole. Not realizing
what had happened, Simson considered it lost and played a second
tee shot. He took triple bogey on his way to a 43 on the back.
	   Jesper Parnevik, who was at 69 with John Daly and Jeff Maggert,
sensed that the pin placement on No. 18 was different than what his
yardage book showed, and he was right. The USGA realized the pin
was unfair and changed it two hours into the round, although
everyone played it the same.
	   And Casey Martin made history by becoming the first player to
ride a cart in the U.S. Open. It could have used a pair of
headlights, since Martin's bogey-bogey finish for a 74 came in near
darkness.
	   ``It was overwhelming, the support I got from the crowd out
there,'' he said. ``I have to admit, I was almost crying on the
first tee. I just had to get up there and hit it quick before I
thought about what was going on.''
	   Lehman was one of many who repeated a popular phrase in majors _
they cannot be won on Thursday, only lost.
	   And several players who didn't beat Olympic didn't beat
themselves, either.
	   Colin Montgomerie never went over par in his round of 70, where
he was joined by Masters champion Mark O'Meara, Tom Kite and
happy-go-lucky amateur Matt Kuchar.
	   Those at 71 included Justin Leonard and Phil Mickelson. Fred
Couples was at 72, and the group at 73 featured Tom Watson and
58-year-old Jack Nicklaus.
	   For others, Olympic hit them before they knew what was
happening.
	   Tiger Woods was cruising along at 2-under, tied for the lead in
the early going, when he four-putted No. 9 for a double bogey. Four
more bogeys followed on the back and Woods wound up at 74.
	   Steve Pate was also at 2-under with only three holes left when
he missed the next three fairways and finished at 72.
	   ``That's the beauty of the U.S. Open,'' David Duval said after
four bogeys in the final eight holes led to a 75. ``You're never so
happy as when you're done. There's no letup.''
	   Durant also took a beating, even if he felt like a winner.
	   Durant, who has made only six of 12 cuts on the PGA Tour this
year, birdied four of the first five holes and got to 5-under with
a wedge into 1 foot (0.30 meters) on the 12th hole.
	   Carnevale was one of only five players to make birdie on No. 17
_ a 468-yard (428-meter), par 4 that is the toughest at Olympic. He
hit a 2-iron into 6 inches (15 centimeters).

Cabin attendants sue Qantas over ending contracts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Twelve Japanese former contract workers with Qantas
Airways on Friday sued the Australian carrier, demanding their old
jobs and some 35 million yen (dlrs 260,000) in back-wages, a news
report said.
	   According to the suit, the former cabin attendants and other
contract workers were told that the company would not renew their
contracts unless they accepted a drastic wage cut last July, Kyodo
News agency reported.
	   The plaintiffs' contracts were terminated after they refused the
proposal, the suit said, the report said.
	   The 12 plaintiffs claim they were told when joining the company
that they would be taken on as full employees in the future. The
report added that their contracts, under which their working
conditions and treatment did not differ from full employees, had
been renewed continuously.
	   The plaintiffs claim that as their contracts had no set period,
the company's decision to fire them, as in the case of full
employees, has no just reasons and is invalid.
	   An official from Qantas' branch in Japan was quoted as saying by
Kyodo that the company had not received written notice of the suit.

Pope returns to a divided Austrian church 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: AMs, recasts, UPDATES with Mass, new quotes

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Declaring ``I belong to Austria for the
next three days,'' Pope John Paul II reached out to his flock
Friday in a bid to calm a crisis in his church that has been rocked
by sexual scandal and dissent.
	   The frail 78-year-old John Paul, stooped and using a cane, began
the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine nation, historically a
pillar of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Small crowds came out to greet him on an overcast day. Some
school children held up signs saying ``We are with you.''
	   In the only open show of dissent, two young men on his motorcade
route held up cardboard placards reading ``Papa Go Home'' and ``We
Want the Dalai Lama.''
	   During Mass in Salzburg's 14th century cathedral, he told
Catholics that ``this office (the papacy) is not a human invention,
in order to exert power in the cure of souls.''
	   ``Conscious of my mission, linked with my office as the
successor of St. Peter, I have come to you in Austria to bring you
words of appreciation and encouragement.''
	   Several times during his homily, the pope was interrupted by
strong applause. He was particularly loudly cheered when he said he
was confident that young people ``can again put a Christian face on
the old Europe.''
	   Still, dissent is an issue that Austrians have made clear won't
go away. John Paul has never showed any intention of making major
changes in church policy.
	   ``The pope is old, I find it hard to identify with him,'' said
Anne Pichler, a 21-year-old psychology student, interviewed in
front of a loden coat store in the cathedral square as she headed
off to class. She echoed other young people.
	   Since John Paul's last visit ten years ago, a half million
Austrians have signed petitions demanding that the church drop its
celibacy requirement for priests, allow women into the priesthood
and give lay people more voice in running the church.
	   The Vatican estimates that some 6 million of Austria's 8 million
people are Catholic, although polls have shown only 20 percent of
the Catholics are active church-goers.
	   Vienna Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, who has moved to placate
angry Catholics, was among those welcoming the pope at the airport.
	   Meeting later with reporters, Schoenborn said he hopes the
pope's visit will show that, despite its problems, ``the Austrian
church is not sick, that it is alive and well and full of
vitality.''
	   Schoenborn had made a public apology for any harm done by his
predecessor, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys. The pope relieved Groer of all his duties in
April and forced him to go into exile into Germany, but critics
charge the Vatican was silent too long.
	   John Paul also touched on one of his favorite themes, that in
the building of a united Europe ``many hands will be needed, but
especially hearts, which not only beat for careers and money, but
also for God and mankind.''

Mexico City takes steps to contain World Cup celebrations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ City officials will send hundreds of extra
police and inspectors into the streets on Saturday as soccer fans
gather to celebrate Mexico's World Cup match with Belgium,
newspapers reported Friday.
	   Some 40 people were treated for cuts and bruises due to scuffles
and out-of-control celebrations around the Monument to Independence
following last week's 3-1 victory over South Korea.
	   Some of the police will be assigned to protect the monument,
which rises from a grassy traffic circle on the Paseo de la Reforma
boulevard in central Mexico City. The monument, topped with a
gilded angel, holds the bones of several of Mexico's independence
heroes.
	   It also has become the traditional gathering place for Mexican
soccer celebrations.
	   The chief of the district where the monument is based, Jorge
Legorreta, told the newspaper La Jornada that officials near the
site would try to ban the sales of glass or metal soft drink
containers, as well as the aerosol foam that fans spray on one
another.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects to get another dlrs 9 billion to
dlrs 10 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize its financial markets, a Finance Ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   An IMF delegation is due in Moscow on Monday for talks.
	   Russia will likely receive dlrs 6 billion to dlrs 7 billion in
the form of an extension of its existing dlrs 9.2 billion
three-year support loan, said Oleg Zhukov, spokesman for Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov.
	   He said the Central Bank will likely get dlrs 3 billion to boost
its foreign currency reserves, to protect against any future run on
the ruble.
	   Worries about whether IMF aid will be forthcoming pushed stocks
2.1 percent lower Friday. The ruble was also down slightly.

World Cup: Arab qualification hopes may be pinned on Morocco 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ If the pressure of making it to
the second round of the World Cup is not enough, Morocco's Atlas
Lions are also shouldering an additional burden _ the hopes of the
Arab world.
	   ``We're not just carrying the hopes of 30 million Moroccans, but
those of at least 150 million Arabs on our shoulders,'' Atlas Lions
striker Abdeljilil Hadda said Friday. ``It's not an easy burden to
bear.''
	   Morocco, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia all are coming off defeats
with the Saudis already out and the Tunisians needed a victory over
Colombia to effectively avoid joining them. But the Moroccans, the
only ones of the three to gain a point so far, still have a chance
of making it to round two thanks to a 2-2 tie with Norway which was
close to being a victory.
	   While Tuesday's 3-0 loss to Brazil was expected, even by the
players, the real disappointment for fans came in that the team
failed to play with the same skill and determination as in its
opening match against Norway.
	   ``If they had scored even one goal, then we (the Arabs) could
have walked proud, knowing that we held our own against Brazil,''
said Faisal Khalifa, an Egyptian who owns a sandwich shop in this
picturesque town located 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of
Marseille.
	   ``Still, a win against Scotland show that Arab soccer is nothing
to take lightly,'' said Khalifa, commenting on the June 26 match
which is Morocco's last chance to make it to the final 16.
	   Morocco surprised World Cup competitors, and fans, in almost
defeating a much-feared Norwegian squad. And with fellow World Cup
Arab competitors Tunisia and Saudi Arabia showing little promise of
qualifying, Arab eyes quickly focused on the Atlas Lions as being
able to deliver what other Arab and African teams have failed to do
repeatedly - compete well against European and South American
teams.
	   But at time when the players should be focusing on preparing for
the match physically and psychologically in order to avoid making
the same mistakes that have cost them matches before, traces of
discontent have emerged from one player on the reserve team.
	   According to rumors inside the Moroccan team, Rachid Neqrouz, a
defender who plays for Italy's Bari, complained that he should have
been allowed to play during the match against Brazil because he had
played against Brazilian striker Ronaldo before in club
competitions.
	   But Neqrouz, who has not played in either of Morocco's World Cup
matches, denied that he had reservations about coach Henri Michel's
decision.
	   ``I'm always waiting for the chance to defend the Moroccan
national jersey in the same way that I defend the Bari jersey,''
Neqrouz said. ``I am just one of 22 players, and the coach is the
one who makes the decisions.''
	   Michel, in a press conference Thursday, denied that there were
rifts between the players, but said that any differences ``were
normal, just as in any other team.''
	   Differences or not, what the fans - and ultimately, the team -
care about is results.
	   ``We want to take control of the match (against Scotland) from
the start,'' said Atlas Lions star midfielder Moustafa Hadji.
	   ``We have the aspirations of all Moroccans and Arabs on our
minds.''

Russia's `oligarchs' and government form joint council 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's most powerful businessmen, the so-called
``oligarchs,'' have formed a council to encourage investment and
review other economic problems, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The new Council for Mutual Economic Assistance seeks no
governing role, said Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of the board of
directors of the huge Russian gas monopoly, Gazprom.
	   Vyakhirev attended a meeting of business and industry leaders
with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko that decided to form the
council on Thursday.
	   ``I don't think the council will become a body which will make
decisions,'' Vyakhirev said.
	   He said the council's tasks would include demonstrating the
investment potential in Russia, determining the most promising
investment fields and explaining Russia's economic and financial
policies.
	   The businessmen have held several meetings with President Boris
Yeltsin and his top aides since Russia's markets went into a steep
skid last month.

Swiss banks' dlrs 600 million settlement offer meets angry response 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with new reaction.
By ERNST E. ABEGG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An offer by Switzerland's three
biggest commercial banks of dlrs 600 million to settle claims by
Holocaust victims brought an angry response Friday from Jewish
representatives in the negotiations.
	   ``My 31,000 clients will not stand for this,'' said Edward
Fagan, attorney for a class-action claim in New York for money
allegedly stolen from dormant accounts opened before the end of
World War II.
	   The announcement by Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union
Bank of Switzerland marked the first time the banks have specified
a figure for a possible settlement. The dlrs 600 million, they
said, would include dlrs 70 million already paid into a fund to
help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' the banks
said in their joint statement. The banks said they ``would not
entertain unfounded and excessive payments above this amount.''
	   Jewish groups, which have estimated the banks still hold
billions of dollars in dormant wartime accounts, were outraged.
	   The co-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization
called the offer ``very humiliating.''
	   ``Our people were killed because we were perceived and accused
of being the rich man of Europe,'' Avraham Burg told APTV in
Jerusalem.
	   The New York-based group tries to ensure that property and money
lost or looted during World War II is returned to Jews.
	   Swiss banks, meanwhile, prospered ``from all this money and gave
back very little from what they took and looted from our brothers
and sisters and other Holocaust victims,'' Burg said.
	   Both sides accused the other of violating a confidentiality
agreement.
	   The banks said they were breaking their silence on two months of
negotiations, held under the auspices of U.S. Undersecretary of
State Stuart Eizenstat, because of repeated blatant news leaks by
Jewish organizations and the plaintiffs' lawyers.
	   But the World Jewish Congress said it was the banks that were
breaking the accord by going public with their statement.
	   Recent reports from New York citing sources close to the talks
have said the three banks were offering dlrs 1 billion or more.
	   Friday's exchange of accusations left unclear the future of the
banks' negotiations with Jewish organizations and lawyers for
claimants in a multibillion-dollar suit filed in New York.
	   The banks' statement ``expressed continued interest to reach a
fair settlement.''
	   But they claimed that ``the World Jewish Congress and the
plaintiffs' lawyers are seriously jeopardizing the settlement
negotiations.''
	   ``Negotiations could continue if the banks will finally make the
full offer they promised,'' Fagan said.
	   WJC President Edgar Bronfman has instructed the organization's
representatives to meet with New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi
and Eizenstat to determine the future of the negotiations,
spokesman Elan Steinberg said in a statement.
	   Hevesi has spearheaded threats by U.S. cities and states to
impose sanctions on the Swiss banks in the dispute. The threats
were suspended for the negotiations.
	   Jewish organizations say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks when the Nazis were gaining power in
Europe.
	   Plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their
heirs after World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or
demanding nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to
relatives of those who died in concentration camps.
	   The Swiss Federation of Hebrew Congregations, which has often
been critical of action against the banks in the United States,
declined to comment on the offer.
	   Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve approved a merger of the
U.S. operations of the Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corp. The new entity will be the second-largest bank in the world,
with assets of dlrs 627 billion, behind Japan's Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   Regulators had held up approval because of complaints that the
banks were dragging their feet on releasing the Holocaust records.

Christie's coach says the athlete was drug free 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The man who coached Linford Christie to the 1992
Olympic 100-meter gold medal and the 1995 world championship said
allegations the sprinter used performance enhancing drugs were a
``fairytale''.
	   Ron Roddan testified Friday as a witness at the High Court in
Christie's libel hearing against robber turned author John McVicar.
	   Christie is sueing McVicar over allegations in the September
1995 issue of the now-defunct Spiked magazine that the athlete used
drugs to achieve success.
	   Roddan said Christie's success and his physique were a result of
training and hard work and not performance enhancing drugs.
	   The man Christie describes as ``my coach, my best friend and my
second father'' rejected a suggestion that Christie's arrogance and
self-confidence was the result of taking drugs.
	   ``It's rubbish. Anyone who is positive enough to do what they
want to do will do it but it's not by taking drugs. Their own mind
tells them they can do it and they do it,'' he said.
	   ``Athletes want to win _ second or third place is not enough.''
	   Responding to questions about an athlete's level of
competitiveness before a major event, he said competiveness was
within top athletes.
	   In the article, McVicar questioned Christie's ``uncanny quick
recovery'' from an injury sustained in Sweden in 1995. McVicar
suggested Christie faked the severity of the injury to obtain drugs
to enhance his performance.
	   However, the British team doctor Malcolm Brown told the court he
did not believe Christie took performance enhancing drugs or that
he faked the initial injury.
	   The hearing will continue Monday.

Train strike to continue after talks with government fail

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Striking train engineers failed to reach
agreement with the government on Friday and said they will continue
their three-day-old pay strike that has idled more than 55 percent
of the nation's trains.
	   A union, representing 14,000 of Poland's 22,000 train engineers
refused to sign a document prepared during negotiations overnight
and early Friday. It threatened to escalate protests. Also bus
drivers, who have been providing links where trains were idled,
vowed to start strikes at midnight.
	   ``The strike will continue,'' said union leader Jan Zaborowski.
``We conceded 66 percent but the government wants everything.''
	   The bone of contention was the demand to limit retirement age
for train drives to 55, from current 65.
	   The leftist Union of Train Engineers is demanding pay raises and
early retirement options. The right-wing Solidarity trade union,
which represent more than 60,000 of all railway workers, has not
joined the strike, which it says is politically motivated.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek has declared the strike illegal
because strikers did not follow correct negotiating procedures
before walking off the job at midnight Tuesday. Eight railway
officials were fired on Thursday.
	   The government has estimated that 4,600 engineers have stopped
work, idling more than half of the nation's passenger trains and
two-thirds of the cargo trains just ahead of school holidays.
	   The strikers pledge to let the trains run that carry children on
vacation.
	   Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski issued the first three
licenses, ahead of schedule, to private cargo rail companies, as
``a crucial step toward breaking the monopoly of railway
transport,'' the ministry's press office said.
	   The strikers are demanding a 300-zloty (dlr-88) increase in the
current average monthly pay of 1,600 zlotys (dlrs 470) and the
right for workers with 20 years of service to retire at age 55.
	   Railway officials estimated the losses so far at 7 million
zlotys (dlrs 2 million). The Polish rail carries 1.1 million
passengers and some 600,000 tons of goods daily.

Czech elections at a glance 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Czech parliamentary elections on Friday and Saturday at a
glance.
	   ___
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE:
	   Four-year terms for 200 deputies in the lower house of
parliament and the chance to form a new Cabinet.
	   ___
	   LEADING CANDIDATES:
	   Latest polls indicate Milos Zeman's center-left opposition
Social Democratic Party leads with more than 20 percent, ahead of
the the center-right Civic Democratic Party, chaired by ex-Premier
Vaclav Klaus.
	   ___
	   OTHER CANDIDATES:
	   They pose no threat to the leaders, but could play a key role in
forming the ruling coalition. Most likely partners in a Social
Democrat-led government coalition are the center-right Christian
Democratic Party. With the center-right Freedom Union ruling out
cooperation with Social Democrats, the populist-left Pensioners for
Secure Living are key to forming a Social Democrat-led government.
	   Both the old-guard Communists and the extreme nationalist
Republicans are publicly rejected as coalition partners across the
board.
	   ___
	   REGISTERED VOTERS:
	   Over 8 million in population of 10.5 million.
	   ___
	   ISSUES: The elections are being held two years early, after the
minority government of former Premier Vaclav Klaus collapsed.
	   Czechs hope to resolve a two-year-old political stalemate,
strengthen the economy and ensure entry into NATO and European
Union.
	   ___
	   POLLS:
	   Polls are open from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (8 a.m. to 4 p.m. EDT) on
Friday and and 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. (1 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT) on Saturday.
	   ___
	   RESULTS:
	   First exit polls expected when voting ends Saturday, with
preliminary word from the election commission on Sunday. Official
final results expected by Monday.

Armenia denies plans to ``annex'' Nagorno-Karabakh 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Azerbaijani reaction, TRIMS.
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's Foreign Ministry firmly denied
a news report Friday that Armenia has threatened to annex the
disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh _ an enclave inside Azerbaijan that is
populated largely by ethnic Armenians _ declared independence in
early 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Despite a 1994 truce, occasional skirmishes have broken out.
Internationally brokered talks to end the conflict have stalled.
	   Armenia has not officially recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as an
independent country, but insists that Azerbaijan negotiate with the
enclave. Azerbaijan does not recognize the separatists and wants to
negotiate with Armenia.
	   Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian said Thursday that if
Azerbaijan refuses to change its stance in the next few years,
Armenia may decide to support Nagorno-Karabakh's requests for union
with Armenia.
	   Some news reports have interpreted Oskanian's remarks as
suggesting that Armenia is planning to annex Nagorno-Karabakh if
Azerbaijan refuses to budge.
	   ``This is apparently a misinterpretation of the minister's
words,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Areg Hovanesian told The
Associated Press on Friday. ``The word `annexation' was never
used.''
	   Azerbaijan reacted strongly Friday to Oskanian's remarks,
calling it ``an attempt to dictate terms'' of peace negotiations,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Armenia is worried that oil-rich Azerbaijan is deliberately
stalling on reaching a peace settlement, hoping to use its new oil
income to build a strong army and regain control over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   ``If Azerbaijan tries to solve the question through military
methods, we will have nothing left to do but form a joint field of
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to ensure the safety of the enclave's
residents,'' Hovanesian said.

World Cup: Ikpeba give Nigerians 1-0 lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Victor Ikpeba finished a three-man combination by
sliding the ball under Zdravko Zdravkov in the 27th minute Friday,
giving Nigeria a 1-0 halftime lead over Bulgaria and moving the
Africans within hailing distance of the second round of the World
Cup.
	   Jay-Jay Okocha sent a ball to the top right corner of the
penalty area where Daniel Amokachi side-foot touched it to Ikpeba
in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco midfielder eluded Trifon Ivanov, who fell, and
rolled the ball just under Zdravkov.
	   A victory would give Nigeria six points and keep it atop Group
D. Paraguay played Spain later Friday in Saint-Etienne, where a
victory or draw by the South Americans would clinch Nigeria's place
in the second round.
	   Ikpeba had two more chances later in the half, just missing wide
of the right post in the 29th and put a header into Zdravkov in the
39th.
	   Despite the 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat, Nigeria
pushed from the opening kickoff and clearly had the more numerous
and dangerous chances.
	   Bulgaria, appearing to play a slower and more deliberate pace,
only came close to scoring three minutes before halftime when
Krassimir Balkov's chip over Nigerian keeper Peter Rufai just
bounced wide of the left post.
	   Nigeria did take a casualty in the first half when Uche
Ukechukwu was shown a yellow card in the 43rd minute. The caution
was his second in two games, meaning combined with the yellow he
was issued in the African's 3-2 opening victory over Spain, he will
have to miss Nigeria's last group game against Paraguay.

Prime minister stakes government on budget vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A reluctant parliament appeared ready Friday
to endorse tax hikes proposed by Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik, who had threatened to step down if the proposal was
rejected.
	   ``It's more important to keep this government than vote
against'' the measure, Carl Hagen, leader of the Progressive Party,
told reporters at about 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   His support appeared to ensure the measure would pass. The vote
was set for later Friday.
	   Bondevik's three-party coalition, which includes the Center and
Liberal parties, controls just 42 seats in the 165-seat parliament,
and needs the support of other parties to enact its policies.
	   The Conservative Party endorsed the package. The Progressive
Party supported most of it, but wanted to vote against hiking an
environmental tax on carbon dioxide emissions by industries. The
proposed increase of 85 million kroner (11.3 million dollars) is a
tiny fraction of the roughly 436 billion kroner (58.9 billion
dollar) 1998 budget.
	   Bondevik said the measures, including tax hikes, are needed to
prevent the booming, oil export-based economy from overheating.
	   The Labor Party had said all along it would vote against the
package. By insisting on a vote of confidence, Bondevik forced
Hagen to choose between accepting the government's proposal or
toppling the centrist coalition, possibly opening the way for a
left-wing Labor government.
	   The Conservative and Progressive parties control 48 votes in
parliament. That tally added to the government's 42 would provide
sufficient support for the measure to pass.

Crime up, tourism down on Crimean Peninsula 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Tourism on the Crimean Peninsula, a top
resort area in Soviet times, has dropped by 30 percent from 1997,
Ukrainian officials said Friday.
	   Tourism officials blamed the rundown state of many resorts, a
20-percent tax for Ukrainians buying travel packages and the fact
that residents of the former Soviet Union now are free to travel
abroad.
	   Crime could be a factor in at least one Crimean city, Kerch,
where the police chief said it's such a problem that nine people
affiliated with criminal groups have become city council members.
	   Crimea's parliament speaker Leonid Grach said at a news
conference in Kiev that many city and regional leaders in Crimea
were linked to crime.
	   Crimea's deputy premier Viktor Antypenko said the tourist season
in the Black Sea peninsula in May was a ``failure'' while in June
``we don't have the same picture as in 1996 and 1997.''
	   The number of tourists registered in Crimea's hotels and other
resorts fell by 30 percent from 1997, he said.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a
veteran of a 30-year struggle for his nation's independence, Friday
said war is no solution to his country's border conflict with
Ethiopia.
	   ``We don't have any intention of escalating this war,'' he said.
``Any battle you would call the mother of battles, the mother of
wars, will never happen. It's bluffing.''
	   ``Let's put our alliance back in place so that we contribute to
each other's stability and to the stability of the region,'' he
said.
	   But the spokesman for a team of African leaders trying to
mediate the crisis said Friday in neighboring Ethiopia that their
shuttle diplomacy had been unsuccessful since Eritrea continued to
reject a four-point proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda as a basis for direct talks.
	   ``The Eritrean side stated clearly the facilitation process was
over. From this point of view, therefore, the delegation was not
able at this juncture to make headway with respect to the
facilitators' recommendations,'' Salim A. Salim, secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity, told reporters.
	   But Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, a member of the OAU
team, told The Associated Press the team had received assurances of
restraint from both sides.
	   ``We've got a commitment from both sides that they accept to
restrain from hostility while the mission of the OAU is trying to
get a solution,'' Bizimungu said.
	   The OAU delegation met both Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and Isaias Thursday, then returned to Addis Ababa. Bizimungu
said committees would be set up to study the core problems and that
heads of state would return to the region in a month.
	   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso are also on the team.
	   ``It is very unrealistic to expect that there would be dramatic
change overnight or in a matter or hours,'' Isaias told reporters,
adding the talks were ``exciting and fruitful'' despite the impasse
in the 6-week border conflict between the two countries that has
resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.
	   Ethiopia has agreed to the four-point proposal, which includes a
provision that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas before peace
talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Isaias also condemned Ethiopia for failing to honor a
U.S.-brokered moratorium on air strikes and the threat of air
strikes. Despite the Sunday agreement, Ethiopia is reported to have
told airlines this week that they must advise Ethiopia 10 minutes
before entering Eritrean air space, a civil aviation source said.
	   In a proposal outlined Thursday to the OAU delegation, Isaias
called for demilitarization of conflict zones within a month,
monitored by foreign observers and representatives of both sides.
Troops would be pulled out of the hotly contested Badme region
first.
	   Ethiopians have demanded that their armed militiamen patrol
areas they believe are rightfully theirs.
	   The U.N. Cartographic Section, or other appropriate body, would
have six months to demarcate the boundary between the neighboring
countries ``in accordance with existing colonial border treaties,''
under the Eritrean plan.
	   At the news conference, Isaias said ``We believe the boundaries
are the most clearly defined boundaries ever in Africa, and there
is no controversy. But let's give our Ethiopian colleagues the
benefit of the doubt to come with a claim on the boundaries.''
	   The border conflict that broke out in early May has claimed
hundreds of lives on three fronts and in air attacks.
	   Ground fighting has subsided since June 11.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
rebels overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991. Eritrea,
wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

World Cup: Mission impossible for Norway against Brazil? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Mission impossible?
	   Although they have never lost to Brazil, the Norwegians probably
need another victory against the defending world champions to reach
the second round round for the first time ever.
	   ``I think this one will be a totally different match, but I'm
glad Brazil has qualified already,'' said striker Tore Andre Flo,
who was dubbed ``Flonaldo' after his two goals helped Norway to a
4-2 win over Ronaldo and company a year ago in Oslo.
	   ``Brazil doesn't need to win. The only thing we can concentrate
about is ourselves and do our best. We just have one more chance
and that's to get two points against Brazil.''
	   Fourth on FIFA's rankings before the World Cup, Norway has been
a disappointment in France, drawing Morocco 2-2 and Scotland 1-1 in
their first Group A games.
	   Flo, at 1.93 meters (6-foot-4) one of the tallest strikers in
the tournament, scored against the Saudis and Danesin warmup games.
He also had one in a 3-3 draw with World Cup host France late
February in Marseille, the site of Tuesday's Brazil-Norway match.
	   However, Flo, who turned 25 Monday and did not play four years
ago when Norway was eliminated after the first round in the United
States, did not look sharp in his first two World Cup matches.
	   And what has happened to the side that beat fellow Cup teams
Denmark, Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2 before going to
France?
	   ``It's not easy to explain,'' said Flo, a (European) Cup
Winners' Cup champion with Chelsea against VfB Stuttgart last month
in Stockholm, Sweden. ``We're not satisfied so far either. I just
think that everybody has to say to themselves that we have to do
better than we've done so far.
	   ``Now we just have one more chance and that's to get three
points against Brazil. We have to do 100 percent.''
	   Some Brazilians have talked about ``getting revenge'' from a
year ago, ``but I don't care,'' Flo said. ``We just have to think
about ourselves and not what the Brazilians are saying.''
	   Norway's no-frills approach -- disciplined defending, long balls
and aerial attacks -- has been criticized as predictable and
somewhat boring. But if that's what the players are good at, why
force them play another style?
	   ``We can play differently, but we also know that a lot teams
here are better technically than we are, so we have to beat them on
other things,'' Flo said.
	   Flo's older brother, Jostein, limped off the training field at
Saint-Andre-des-Eaux with a banged-up thigh after colliding with a
teammate during Friday's practice.
	   Team doctor Trygve Kase said he would not be able to determine
if it's a serious injury until later this weekend, but Flo said he
expected to be back soon in training. All other players on the
22-man squad are healthy.
	   Jostein Flo was one of Norway's key players in the '94 Cup, but
has not seen action here so far.
	   Scotland and Morocco, who both have one point and are a point
behind Norway, meet in the other Group A match in Saint-Etienne.

Vatican says it brought aid to North Korea 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican said Friday a delegation to
North Korea brought a ``substantial contribution'' to help the
victims of the country's acute food shortages.
	   The delegation, led by a senior Vatican diplomat, returned
Thursday after meeting with North Korea's deputy foreign minister
and Catholic representatives.
	   The Vatican officials visited aid projects and gathered
information on the people's suffering, the Vatican said. It was the
third visit by Vatican representatives since 1996.
	   The amount of aid given was not specified.
	   Severe drought wrecked crops, economic decay and flooding in
recent years have brought on a food crisis in the Communist nation.

Ukrainian bank signs deal with foreign investors 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A top Ukrainian bank announced a dlrs 13
million deal with two foreign investors Friday.
	   Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), along
with the Washington-based International Financial Corporation
(IFC), a member of the World Bank group, invested dlrs 6.5 million
each into the First Ukrainian International Bank in exchange for 10
percent of shares each.
	   The bank is considered to be among the top 10 banks in Ukraine.
The deal culminated two years of talks and the two investors now
join their Dutch counterparts, altogether holding a 50 percent
package of the bank's shares.
	   ``We hope that the signals sent by IFC and DEG investments in a
leading Ukrainian bank will contribute to encouraging further
foreign investment in Ukraine and to strengthening the banking
sector,'' said IFC representative Mary Ellen Iskenderian.

<TEXT>
	   BATOTE, India (AP) _ Five men armed with weapons swooped on a
group of Hindu revelers returning from a wedding on Friday, killing
25 people in a mountainous village, Kashmir's police chief said.
	   Police had identified a member of the outlawed militant Islamic
Hizb-ul-Mujahideen outfit among the assailants, Gurbachan Jagat
said in a telephone interview from the provincial capital Srinagar.
	   He said six people of the group of 36 were also injured in the
massacre at Chapnali village, 190 kilometers (115 miles) northeast
of the Himalayan state's winter capital of Jammu.
	   Kashmir's chief minister Farooq Abdullah charged Pakistan-backed
terrorist groups in the attack, an official spokesman said.
	   The five attackers emerged from a thick forest as the group was
resting by a mountain stream for tea on there way back from the
wedding, and started firing indiscriminately, the police official
quoted eyewitnesses as saying.

U.S. promises reformist Serb government $17 million 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United States pledged
millions of dollars in aid Friday to assist the reformist
government in the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   In an agreement signed by the Unites States Agency for
International Development and Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb's
pro-Western prime minister, dlrs 17.7 was pledged to rebuild
infrastructure.
	   The money will be used in the Bosnian Serb's administrative
center, Banja Luka, as well as some other places in western Bosnia.
	   Work will be done on electric power lines, water supply systems,
several bridges, a high school and a hospital.
	   ``We can hereby refute all those who said the international
community would never help us _ there is really a lot being done,''
Dodik told reporters after the signing.
	   A hospital in Zvornik funded by USAID was opened Thursday.
	   The West has welcomed the new moderate Bosnian Serb government
that in January replaced hard-line supporters of Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb war-time leader indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

Eds: ADDS quarterfinal results in last graf
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman, the only seeded
player left in the Eastbourne grass-court tennis tournament, moved
into the semifinals with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 win over Grant Stafford
on Friday.
	   The No. 2 seed broke the South African's serve in the first game
of the match. He held the break until he was serving for the set at
5-4 before Stafford broke back and forced the set to a tiebreaker.
	   After seven mini breaks, the Swede served out for a 7-5
advantage with his second set point.
	   The second set went with serve until the eighth game when
Bjorkman broke for a 5-3 lead and then served out the match.
	   Bjorkman, who has recently recovered from a serious virus, said
he was confortable playing on grass and could be a chance at
Wimbledon where he is seeded No. 11.
	   ``It's been a big goal for 1998 to do well at Wimbledon,'' he
said. ``The way I'm playing now _ if guys want to beat me _ they're
going to have to play at their very best.
	   Bjorkman will meet Jerome Golmard in the semifinals Saturday
after the Frenchman beat Australia's Scott Draper 6-4, 6-3 in a
quarterfinal Friday.
	   In other quarterfinals, Zimbabwe's Byron Black defeated Gianluca
Pozzi 7-5, 6-2, and Sargis Sargsian of Armenia defeated No. 6 seed
Brett Stevens 7-6 (10-8), 6-2.

Kournikova out with injury; Sanchez Vicario-Novotna in final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMS RECASTS lead, edits
<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Friday was a bad day for Russian
tennis starlet Anna Kourikova, but a good one for Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario and Jana Novotna as they reached the finals of the
Eastbourne grass-court tournament.
	   The final Saturday between the defending French Open champion
and Novotna is a repeat of last year's Eastbourne final, which was
cut short by rain as the two shared the title.
	   On Friday, Novotna won her quarterfinal 6-4, 7-5 over fifth seed
Irina Spirlea of Romania. She then beat Natasha Zvereva of Belarus
in the semifinals 6-2, 6-1.
	   Sanchez Vicario beat American Serena Williams in three sets
Friday in the quarterfinals. She was to have played Kournikova, but
the Russian teen-ager withdrew to rest a right thumb she injured in
her quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf on Thursday.
	   The 17-year-old Kournikova, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year,
beat Graf 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-4 but fell during the match and injured
her right thumb.
	   X-rays showed there were no problems but, as a precaution, she
withdrew from a doubles quarterfinal Thursday and the singles
Friday.
	   ``I'm going to do everything possible to be ready to play at
Wimbledon. I'll be in treatment for 24 hours a day,'' Kournikova
said. ``I just have to rest, like for all injuries, but it's just a
minor sprain. I've pulled out as a precaution. The doctor told me
it wasn't worth putting pressure on it.
	   ``And actually I think I've played enough this week so I think
it's good for me to rest a little bit. I'm not going to lose my
timing or my feeling in two days.''
	   ``For sure it's a disappointment,'' added Kournikova, who won
the junior event here last year. ``I've never lost here and it
seems like a lucky tournament for me. I've never lost to Arantxa so
I think I had a great chance against her.''
	   Kournikova is in arguably the toughest section of the Wimbledon
draw, along with the Williams sisters and Mirjana Lucic.
	   ``I wouldn't say it's the toughest section,'' she said. ``All
players are tough, from number one to 128 or 132. They're all
tough. You don't have to think who's on the other side of the net.
You just play your own game.''
	   Third-seeded Sanchez Vicario completed her quarterfinal match
against Williams Friday after the match was tied 1-1 when rain
stopped play Thursday.
	   Sanchez Vicario's experience proved the difference in her 4-6,
6-4, 6-4 win over the teen-age American, who was playing her first
tournament on grass.
	   It was Williams' third loss this year to Sanchez Vicario and
followed a tense battle at the French Open in which the Spaniard
accused the 16-year-old of showing no respect for other players.
	   Although Williams tested Sanchez Vicario with a fierce forehand,
the Spaniard responded and both players were often at full stretch
in several fiercely contested rallies.
	   But Williams was often careless with her volleys, one of which
missed the court and had spectators at the back diving for cover.
	   Williams had her right thigh strapped, and also received
treatment to her lower right calf during play Thursday.
	   ``It's a little serious in some areas,'' Williams said. ``I had
my knee taped today, and my ankle and the side of my leg.''
	   ``It would have been tough for me to continue on in the next
rounds, but I'll definitely be all right for Wimbledon.''
	   Despite the nagging injuries on grass, Williams said she was
growing accustomed to it.
	   ``I'm getting used to it and feeling very comfortable on it,''
she said.
	   ``I'm playing pretty well on it and like the grass a lot. It's
definitely going to be one of my favorite surfaces.''
	   Williams said grass forced a player to attack and that was good
for her game.
	   ``It forces me to come forward a little more and that's exactly
what I need. At Wimbledon, whatever I do I have to always play my
game,'' she said.
	   `` I know if I do what I'm told I will come out victorious.''

World Cup: Spanish police arrest three fans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SALOU, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police arrested three Scottish
soccer fans in this northeastern tourist resort town after a night
of disturbances involving 60 rowdy supporters.
	   Fighting started in a pub between a Scottish and English fans. A
little later a group of Scots were arrested for insulting passersby
and smashing up cars after being banned from entering a
discotheque, Civil Guard spokesman said.
	   France has asked police in neighboring Spain to keep a special
eye on British soccer fans vacationing along the Spanish coast but
crossing the border to watch their teams play in the World Cup.
	   Last weekend, English fans were involved in several clashes with
locals in the buildup to the England-Tunisia game at Marseille.
Police detained 80 people, many of them English, and 50 people were
injured.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the
site of Pakistan's nuclear tests Friday, his first since they were
conducted last month, and warned that solving the Kashmir crisis
was critical in light of the regional nuclear arms race.
	   ``I felt very proud,'' standing at the mouth of the tunnel where
last month six separate nuclear devices were sealed and exploded,
he told reporters upon his arrival in the southern port city of
Karachi, several hundred kilometers (miles) from the test site in
Baluchistan province.
	   Sharif, the chief ministers of Pakistan's four provinces and
several scientists _ including Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, who is the
man credited with developing Pakistan's nuclear program _ visited
the site for about two hours.
	   Asked about possible radioactive leakages from the underground
tests, Sharif said ``if we believed there was any radiation in the
area we would not have gone there.''
	   Before making the arduous road journey over desert plains to the
Chagai hills in the rugged southwestern Baluchistan province,
Sharif spoke to an estimated 7,000 cheering supporters who
collected at Dal Bandi, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the
test site.
	   He said that a solution to the 51-year-old Kashmir dispute is
critical now that both Pakistan and India are nuclear powers.
	   ``If peace and security are to be guaranteed in our region it is
necessary to solve the core issue of Kashmir,'' Sharif told the
rally.
	   He urged the world's major powers to get involved in the
dispute. India has refused to accept international mediation in the
Kashmir dispute, which has been the flash point of two previous
wars between the uneasy neighbors.
	   A third war was fought in 1971 when the eastern half of Pakistan
ceded and became known as Bangladesh.
	   Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has warned that another war on the
subcontinent would surely escalate into a nuclear war.
	   Pakistan's underground explosions were conducted in the desolate
Chagai hills two weeks after India tested five nuclear devices on
May 11 and 13.
	   The test results from the explosions still have not been made
public.
	   Sharif refused to say when the test results would be released.

Bosnia to have Balkans' first convertible currency 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Although still splintered
politically, international officials hope to unite Bosnia
economically with next week's introduction of a common currency, a
leading economic expert said Friday.
	   ``Money will indeed talk louder then nationalistic rhetoric,''
said Didier Foa, the economic expert in the office of Carlos
Westendorp, Bosnia's top international official.
	   The so-called convertible mark will replace the four currencies
currently circulating in the country.
	   ``From Monday, Bosnia-Herzegovina will have a strong currency,''
said Peter Nicholl, Bosnia's Central Bank governor.
	   The new currency will be linked 1-to-1 with the German mark, and
their value will rise and fall in lockstep.
	   The Bosnian mark also will be convertible, and will be backed up
by 130 million (dlrs 73 million) German marks.
	   The Bosnian mark was printed in France, which donated 7 million
marks (dlrs 3.9 million) for the printing and transport.
	   The new currency arrived in Bosnia two weeks ago, and has been
distributed to 14 locations. People will have two to three weeks to
exchange local currency for Bosnian marks.
	   After that time, businesses will still be able to accept the
local currencies, but must pay taxes and duties in Bosnian marks.
	   Planning for the Bosnian mark has been in the works for months.
First, ethnic leaders could not agree on a design and argued for
months whether national symbols should be used.
	   Four currencies have circulated in the country for years. The
Bosnian Serb half used the Yugoslav dinar. Regions under Bosnian
Croats control used the Croatian kuna, while areas under Muslim
control used the Bosnian Dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   Westendorp finally imposed two neutral designs for the Bosnian
mark for the two halves of Bosnia _ the Bosnian Serb entity and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   The Bosnian Serb version will have portraits of well-known
Bosnian Serbs and Cyrillic writing will dominate.
	   The version used in the federation will have portraits of famous
Croats and Muslims, with Latin letters above the Cyrillic.
	   The name of Bosnian Serb Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andric was
misspelled on the 5 mark note. Nicholl ordered it to be reprinted,
but the other bills will go into circulation Monday.
	   ``It has taken longer then expected, but I think we have a very
good currency in the end,'' Nicholl said.
	   The new currency is expected to improve trade and capital flows
between the two parts of the country and give it credibility
abroad.
	   ``Bosnia-Herzegovina will be the only country of this region of
Europe with a hard currency,'' Foa said.

Security Council reaches tentative agreement on Iraqi spare parts deal 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council reached tentative
agreement Friday on a resolution to let Iraq spend dlrs 300 million
of oil-for-food revenues to buy spare parts for its oil industry to
meet increased, U.N.-approved export targets.
	   A vote was expected later in the day.
	   But Iraq strongly opposes the proposal, arguing that the
language of the resolution transforms oil-for-food into an ongoing
program as long as economic sanctions remain in effect.
	   The resolution would in effect reduce the political leverage
Iraq has in its campaign to force the Security Council to lift
sanctions. Under the current system, Iraq submits a plan for
distributing food and medicine purchased with oil revenues every
six months when the program is renewed.
	   But the current resolution provides that if no plan is
submitted, the previous one remains in force.
	   Iraq had in the past held up submitting the plan and suspended
oil sales as part of an overall strategy to whittle away at support
for the sanctions.
	   It was unclear, however, whether some amendments in the language
of the resolution would satisfy Iraq. Last Monday, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, threatened to stop oil sales entirely if
the resolution were approved.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in March that the
council let Iraq buy the parts with revenues from oil-for-food
sales to boost capacity to meet the new U.N.-authorized export
ceiling.
	   The draft resolution was introduced Wednesday by Britain, Japan,
Slovenia, Costa Rica, Portugal and Sweden and has been undergoing
largely cosmetic word changes in hopes of satisfying all 15
members.
	   The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan,
planned to leave for Baghdad late Friday to spend two weeks in Iraq
studying the condition of Iraq's oil industry.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program, which enables
Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months,. But the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In Baghdad, Denis Halliday, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for Iraq, said further delays in the spare parts would ``have
serious consequences for the whole program.''
	   But U.N. officials in New York, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say low oil prices make it unlikely that Iraq will
benefit from the increased ceiling, regardless of the spare parts.
	   If Iraq can pump 1.6 million barrels a day at a price of dlrs 10
a barrel, it would earn only dlrs 2.88 billion over six months _
well below the dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling. One-third of the dlrs 2.88
would have to go to war victims and U.N. expenses.
	   Industry experts say Iraq could raise its daily output to 1.8
million or 1.9 million barrels if the spare parts are delivered.
That would still make little difference without a sharp rise in
world oil prices, analysts say.

U.S. promises reformist Serb government dlrs 17 million 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United States pledged
millions of dollars in aid Friday to assist the reformist
government in the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   In an agreement signed by the Unites States Agency for
International Development and Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb's
pro-Western prime minister, dlrs 17.7 was pledged to rebuild
infrastructure.
	   The money will be used in the Bosnian Serb's administrative
center, Banja Luka, as well as some other places in western Bosnia.
	   Work will be done on electric power lines, water supply systems,
several bridges, a high school and a hospital.
	   ``We can hereby refute all those who said the international
community would never help us _ there is really a lot being done,''
Dodik told reporters after the signing.
	   A hospital in Zvornik funded by USAID was opened Thursday.
	   The West has welcomed the new moderate Bosnian Serb government
that in January replaced hard-line supporters of Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb war-time leader indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

World Cup: South Africans shaking their heads over strange match 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ A day after the strangest match so far of
the World Cup, South African players could only shake their heads
over the 1-1 draw with Denmark that kept alive their hopes to
advance to the second round.
	   The most perplexed was midfielder Quinton Fortune, whose
last-minute rocket from outside the penalty area hit the crossbar,
denying Bafana Bafana their first World Cup victory.
	   ``It was so close,'' Fortune said Friday as he headed for a
jacuzzi after South Africa's 90-minute training session.
	   Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel appeared to get a hand on the
shot to make sure it didn't dip below the bar, according to
Fortune, who plays for Atletico Madrid.
	   ``I watched it over and over (on videotape) and it looked like
he touched it,'' he said of the towering Manchester United player.
``He's such a great goalie.''
	   Others were still puzzled by the decisions of Colombian referee
John Jairo Toro Rendon, who flashed three red cards in the second
half. Toro Rendon sent off two Dutch and one South African to
plunge the match into disarray and evoke a torrent of jeers from
the crowd at Stade Municipal in Toulouse.
	   FIFA officials in Paris acknowledged Friday the three red cards
and seven yellow cards may have been an over-reaction to comments
earlier in the week by FIFA president Sepp Blatter that referees
had been too lenient.
	   The draw was an improvement for South Africa after its 3-0 loss
to France in its World Cup debut last week. It left Bafana Bafana
with one point in Group C and a mathematical chance of advancing to
the second round.
	   France has two victories and six points after beating Saudi
Arabia 4-0 on Thursday night, while Denmark has four points from
its earlier 1-0 victory over the Saudis and its draw with South
Africa.
	   With the first two teams in each group advancing, South Africa
must beat Saudi Arabia and France must defeat Denmark next week for
Bafana Bafana to tie the Danes on points. Then it comes down to
goal differential, with Denmark now holding a four-goal advantage
at plus-one compared to South Africa's minus-three.
	   Coach Philippe Troussier outlined one scenario for South Africa
to advance _ identical 2-0 victories for South Africa over the
Saudis and France over Denmark on Wednesday.
	   Fortune was still thinking about how different things would be
if his shot was just a few centimeters (inches) lower.
	   ``It would have meant victory. South Africa would be
celebrating,'' he said.
	   Shaking his head.

U.N.: signs of sexual misconduct by staff in U.S. women's prisons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. investigator has found signs of widespread
sexual misconduct by staff in U.S. women's prisons, especially in
Michigan, a statement said Friday.
	   Radhika Coomaraswamy, the United Nations' special investigator
into violence against women who just completed an 18-day visit to
the United States, also received ``serious allegations of sexual
misconduct'' in California, the statement said.
	   Details will be available only at the end of this year when a
report is published, it said.
	   Ms. Coomaraswamy, however, praised Georgia and Minnesota for
steps they have taken to combat sexual misconduct in women's
prisons.
	   She visited federal and state prisons as well as immigration
detention centers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Georgia,
California and Minnesota.
	   Her ``preliminary investigations point to the fact that sexual
misconduct by prison staff is widespread in American women's
prisons,'' the statement said. ``Sexual misconduct appears to be
pervasive particularly in the state of Michigan.''
	   It added that Ms. Coomaraswamy was unable to check the Michigan
situation more closely because Gov. John Engler at the last minute
blocked her investigation.
	   She had made extensive plans to meet with officials of the state
Department of Corrections and also hoped to visit women's prisons.
	   Ms. Coomaraswamy ``considers this refusal particularly
disturbing since she had received very serious allegations of
sexual misconduct'' in three prisons _ Florence Crane and Camp
Branch in Coldwater and Scott in Plymouth, the statement said.
	   She ``regrets that she was not able to have a constructive
dialogue with Michigan State authorities in connection with these
allegations,'' it added.
	   Ms. Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan lawyer appointed in 1994 by the
53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission, has investigated abuse of
women in a number of countries, going back as far as the Japan
military's use of sex slaves in World War II.

Pope returns to a divided Austrian church 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Mass, new quotes
With AP Photos
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Declaring ``I belong to Austria for the
next three days,'' Pope John Paul II reached out to his flock
Friday in a bid to calm a crisis in his church that has been rocked
by sexual scandal and dissent.
	   The frail 78-year-old John Paul, stooped and using a cane, began
the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine nation, historically a
pillar of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Small crowds came out to greet him on an overcast day. Some
school children held up signs saying ``We are with you.''
	   In the only open show of dissent, two young men on his motorcade
route held up cardboard placards reading ``Papa Go Home'' and ``We
Want the Dalai Lama.''
	   During Mass in Salzburg's 14th century cathedral, he told
Catholics that ``this office (the papacy) is not a human invention,
in order to exert power in the cure of souls.''
	   Several times during his homily, the pope was interrupted by
strong applause. He was particularly loudly cheered when he said he
was confident that young people ``can again put a Christian face on
the old Europe.''
	   Still, dissent is an issue that Austrians have made clear won't
go away. John Paul has never showed any intention of making major
changes in church policy.
	   ``The pope is old, I find it hard to identify with him,'' said
Anne Pichler, a 21-year-old psychology student, interviewed in
front of a coat store in the cathedral square as she headed off to
class. She echoed other young people.
	   Since John Paul's last visit ten years ago, a half million
Austrians have signed petitions demanding that the church drop its
celibacy requirement for priests, allow women into the priesthood
and give lay people more voice in running the church.
	   The Vatican estimates that some 6 million of Austria's 8 million
people are Catholic, although polls have shown only 20 percent of
the Catholics are active church-goers.
	   Vienna Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, who has moved to placate
angry Catholics, was among those welcoming the pope at the airport.
	   Meeting later with reporters, Schoenborn said he hopes the
pope's visit will show that, despite its problems, ``the Austrian
church is not sick, that it is alive and well and full of
vitality.''
	   Schoenborn had made a public apology for any harm done by his
predecessor, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys. The pope relieved Groer of all his duties in
April and forced him to go into exile into Germany, but critics
charge the Vatican was silent too long.
	   John Paul also touched on one of his favorite themes, that in
the building of a united Europe ``many hands will be needed, but
especially hearts, which not only beat for careers and money, but
also for God and mankind.''

	   The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan,
planned to leave for Baghdad late Friday to spend two weeks in Iraq
studying the condition of Iraq's oil industry.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program, which enables
Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months, but the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In Baghdad, Denis Halliday, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for Iraq, said further delays in the spare parts would ``have
serious consequences for the whole program.''
	   But U.N. officials in New York, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say low oil prices make it unlikely that Iraq will
benefit from the increased ceiling, regardless of the spare parts.
	   If Iraq can pump 1.6 million barrels a day at a price of dlrs 10
a barrel, it would earn only dlrs 2.88 billion over six months _
well below the dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling. One-third of the dlrs 2.88
billion would have to go to war victims and U.N. expenses.
	   Industry experts say Iraq could raise its daily output to 1.8
million or 1.9 million barrels if the spare parts are delivered.
That would still make little difference without a sharp rise in
world oil prices, analysts say.

World Cup: Romania closes ranks before England game 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with detail of Saturday practice, last graf
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) - Never talkative or open to media requests
for interviews, Romanian players and officials have decided that
the best strategy for the upcoming game against England is total
discretion.
	   ``They closed up like an oyster,'' said a frustrated Romanian
reporter, trying to get a glimpse through a metal fence of the
team's practice Friday, closed to the media for the second
consecutive day.
	   French gendarmes and national police, which guard the entrance
to the secluded La Reserve Hotel where the team is based, turned
away a reporter Friday who was trying to get details of the team's
schedule.
	   ``They don't have time to talk to journalists. You should go to
the stadium where they practice,'' a French policeman said.
	   At the stadium, police said the practice was closed to the
media. A photographer, preparing his long lens for photographs, was
told by a French security guard that no photos were allowed.
	   And press center officials in nearby Toulouse invariably tell
reporters they have no news about Romania.
	   ``If they don't tell us anything, what can we do? Perhaps you
can find something on the Internet,'' said an official who declined
to give her name.
	   The secrecy reflects the special importance with which the
Romanian team, which beat Colombia 1-0 in a Group G opener early
this week, views the game against England on 22 June.
	   A victory or a draw, coupled with another victory over Tunisia
on June 26, could propel Romania, the seeded team in its group, to
the top of the standings.
	   If it finishes in first place, Romania would then be paired
against the second-placed team in Group H, probably Argentina or
Croatia.
	   If Romania comes second it will face the winner of Group H.
	   The Romanians have continued their preparations with the team in
mostly good health.
	   Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, who had a bruised right leg, and
striker Adrian Ilie, who scored Romania's goal against Colombia and
pulled a muscle in his left leg, both took part in the practice
Friday. Also fit to play was defender Tibor Selymes of Anderlecht,
who missed the Colombia game with a sprained ankle.
	   The only player who is more seriously injured is forward
Gheorghe Craioveanu who plays in Spain for Real Sociedad. The
30-year-old pulled a muscle during practice recently and the doctor
has recommended that he take several days rest before resuming
training.
	   The Romanians will rest on Saturday morning. In the evening,
they will travel to Toulouse for a practice on the Municipal
Stadium which will host the game against England on Monday. The
practice will be followed by a press conference, Romanian Football
Federation officials said.

U.S. promises reformist Serb government millions in aid

Eds: RETRANSMITTING to eliminate dollar sign in overline
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United States pledged
millions of dollars in aid Friday to assist the reformist
government in the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   In an agreement signed by the Unites States Agency for
International Development and Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb's
pro-Western prime minister, dlrs 17.7 was pledged to rebuild
infrastructure.
	   The money will be used in the Bosnian Serb's administrative
center, Banja Luka, as well as some other places in western Bosnia.
	   Work will be done on electric power lines, water supply systems,
several bridges, a high school and a hospital.
	   ``We can hereby refute all those who said the international
community would never help us _ there is really a lot being done,''
Dodik told reporters after the signing.
	   A hospital in Zvornik funded by USAID was opened Thursday.
	   The West has welcomed the new moderate Bosnian Serb government
that in January replaced hard-line supporters of Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb war-time leader indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with U.N. quotes on refugees
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fearful that Serbian forces are
readying new attacks in Kosovo despite Western demands that they
withdraw, the top ethnic Albanian leader in the province appealed
Friday for direct NATO intervention.
	   ``NATO should undertake all possible measures to prevent further
massacres and protect the people of Kosovo,'' Ibrahim Rugova said
at a news conference in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Ignoring NATO's show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have been reinforcing their army and
special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated by NATO sources at
45,000 to 50,000.
	   Serbian forces have sealed the border with Albania _ cutting off
an escape route for refugees _ while reportedly continuing to
attack border villages they claim are havens for the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Convoys of armored vehicles have also been seen taking positions
along a main north-south artery between Pristina and Prizren, near
the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the militants may be
hoping to cut off the road, as it did the main east-west highway to
Pec, further hampering the ability of Serb forces to move through
the province.
	   The NATO flights over Albania and Macedonia this week were
intended to force Serbia to scale down its forces in Kosovo so that
negotiations between the two sides could resume.
	   But the Serbian government insists its deployment is legitimate
to combat the ``terrorists,'' who train across the border in
Albania and smuggle in weapons and supplies.
	   ``All international pressures on Serbia (to withdraw) ... are a
direct help to separatists,'' Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic
was quoted Friday as saying by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   More than 300 people have died in clashes between Serb forces
and KLA fighters since the authorities began a crackdown on Feb.
28.
	   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians also have been driven from
their homes in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Geneva, Kris Janowski, said at least 13,000
had sought refuge in Albania, but that the flow dried up this week
when the Serbs clamped down on the border.
	   ``This does not mean that there are no people in Kosovo who
would like to cross,'' he said. ``Some people may actually be
caught in the mountains, unable to go back to the villages and
towns and at the same time afraid of crossing the border.''
	   He said U.N. officials _ like foreign journalists _ were not
being allowed into the region to investigate.
	   Sources in Pristina close to Rugova claimed that Serb forces
were shelling at least 10 villages Friday west of Djakovica, which
is 75 kilometers (about 50 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serbian crackdown has swollen the ranks of the militants,
who control a large part of western Kosovo. Their new spokesman has
dismissed Rugova's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the
crisis and called for Albanian politicians to join the armed
struggle.
	   Rugova, however, sought to downplay the KLA's political
significance, calling it an assemblage of ``small groups of people
fighting to protect their homes.''
	   If a settlement is reached, Rugova said, the KLA would have to
support it. Asked how he would persuade them to do so, he admitted
it would be difficult.
	   ``We will certainly try to control them, but we cannot do it
until the Serbian military regime stops its attacks,'' Rugova said.

Dutch carrier signs cooperation pact with Malaysian Airlines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Friday it has signed a commercial cooperation agreement with
Malaysia Airlines.
	   The agreement follows a memorandum of understanding signed in
December. KLM said the carriers will ``intensively'' study options
for further cooperation in several areas like schedule
coordination, loyalty programs, marketing and sales.
	   They will also consider the possibility of involving their
current partners in the new cooperation agreement.
	   The cargo divisions of the two carriers have already cooperated
since mid-1996, KLM said.
	   The two airlines said they expect the cargo business to grow
further owing to the new facilities available at the new KLIA
airport near Kuala Lumpur.
	   Malaysia Airlines, KLM said, has plans to develop this new
airport, which will be opened July 1, into a major hub in then
Asia-Pacific region.
	   Dries van Luyk, executive vice president of KLM's Passenger
Division, said the Dutch carrier considered the agreement to be an
``important step forward in our efforts to strengthen our position
in the Asia-Pacific region.''

World Cup: Beat Yugoslavia, win World Cup _ German motto 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REPEATING to change slug to confirm to digest
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ For Germany, the formula seems simple: beat
Yugoslavia, win the World Cup.
	   That's what has happened each time it won the title in 1954,
1974 and 1990.
	   In 1954, Germany beat Yugoslavia 2-0 en route to its first
title. In 1974, Yugoslavia was also a 2-0 victim along the way.
	   And many still remember the 4-1 victory that launched Germany's
victorious march to the title in Italy in 1990.
	   One of them is Lothar Matthaeus, then German captain who scored
two goals.
	   ``It was one of my best games for the national team and it was
the beginning of a great German success,'' Matthaeus said Friday.
	   On Sunday in Lens, the two teams clash again in a match that
could decide the winner of Group F.
	   History speaks for Germany: of five World Cup matches, it has
won four, including a 1-0 win in 1958. It lost only once, 1-0, in
the quarterfinals in 1962. Overall, Germany has a 14-7 winning
record, with three draws.
	   Political clouds will be over this game just as they will be
over the clash the same day in Lyon between the United States and
Iran.
	   Many Yugoslavs believe Germany's hasty recognition of Croatia
helped cause the violent breakup of old Yugoslavia.
	   With violence in Kosovo flaring up, some German politicians had
called for the exclusion of Yugoslavia from this World Cup, the
country's first since 1990. Yugoslavia, now consisting of Serbia
and tiny Montenegro, is back after eight years without major
competitions because of sanctions.
	   Politics won't play a role on the field, according to officials
from both sides.
	   Who exactly will be playing on the field was a matter of
conjecture in the German camp Friday. Coach Berti Vogts bantered
with reporters, raising the possibility of ``option 6a'' or
``option 5b'' and various other plans that had nearly every German
player possibly in the lineup.
	   One thing seems clear: Vogts is unlikely to use two offensive
midfielders, like he did in the 2-0 victory over the United States,
even though Yugoslavia struggled to a 1-0 victory over Iran in its
opener.
	   ``We can't give them that much room,'' Vogts said. ``It's
technically a very skilled team with fast forwards. Along with
Nigeria, Yugoslavia is for me a secret tip to win the title.''
	   ``But we have a strong team and we'll be tough to beat. Playing
defensively would be wrong against them, because they seem a bit
exposed in the defense. But I don't think they have real
weaknesses,'' Vogts said.
	   Whatever option Vogts picks, Matthaeus could be in it. Vogts
likes to spring surprises in his lineup before big games and one
theory is that Matthaeus will be libero with Olaf Thon moving into
midfield.
	   Even just a minute of playing time would give the 37-year-old
veteran a World Cup record of 22 matches.
	   ``I don't want any gifts. But every player wants to play and
that's what I am trying to show in training. I am ready to play,
but I'll accept any decision by the coach,'' Matthaeus said.
	   Matthaeus said this German team reminded him of the 1990 side.
``We have quality characters, just as we did in 1990.''
	   ``We have a great team spirit, we laugh, we joke, we even drink
a bit of wine. We are very relaxed,'' he said.
	   So relaxed that the Germans got the morning off Friday, rather
than having to work off their team dinner the night before in the
Hermitage hotel in Monte Carlo.

Bosnia to have Balkans' first convertible currency 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Although still splintered
politically, international officials hope to unite Bosnia
economically with next week's introduction of a common currency,
economic officials said Friday.
	   ``Money will indeed talk louder then nationalistic rhetoric,''
said Didier Foa, the economic expert in the office of Carlos
Westendorp, Bosnia's top international official.
	   The mark will replace the four currencies currently circulating
in the country.
	   ``From Monday, Bosnia-Herzegovina will have a strong currency,''
said Peter Nicholl, Bosnia's Central Bank governor.
	   The new currency will be linked with the German mark, and their
value will rise and fall in lockstep.
	   The Bosnian mark also will be convertible, and will be backed up
by 130 million (dlrs 73 million) German marks.
	   The Bosnian mark was printed in France, which donated 7 million
marks (dlrs 3.9 million) for the printing and transport.
	   The new currency arrived in Bosnia two weeks ago, and has been
distributed to 14 locations. People will have two to three weeks to
exchange local currency for Bosnian marks.
	   After that time, businesses will still be able to accept the
local currencies, but must pay taxes and duties in Bosnian marks.
	   Planning for the Bosnian mark has been in the works for months.
First, ethnic leaders could not agree on a design and argued for
months whether national symbols should be used.
	   Four currencies have circulated in the country for years. The
Bosnian Serb half used the Yugoslav dinar. Regions under Bosnian
Croats control used the Croatian kuna, while areas under Muslim
control used the Bosnian Dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   Westendorp finally imposed two neutral designs for the Bosnian
mark for the two halves of Bosnia _ the Bosnian Serb entity and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   The Bosnian Serb version will have portraits of well-known
Bosnian Serbs and Cyrillic writing will dominate.
	   The version used in the federation will have portraits of famous
Croats and Muslims, with Latin letters above the Cyrillic.
	   The name of Bosnian Serb Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andric was
misspelled on the 5 mark note. Nicholl ordered it to be reprinted,
but the other bills will go into circulation Monday.
	   ``It has taken longer then expected, but I think we have a very
good currency in the end,'' Nicholl said.
	   The new currency is expected to improve trade and capital flows
between the two parts of the country and give it credibility
abroad.
	   ``Bosnia-Herzegovina will be the only country of this region of
Europe with a hard currency,'' Foa said.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman, the only seeded
player left in the Nottingham Open grass-court tennis tournament,
moved into the semifinals with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 win over Grant
Stafford on Friday.
	   The No. 2 seed broke the South African's serve in the first game
of the match. He held the break until he was serving for the set at
5-4 before Stafford broke back and forced the set to a tiebreaker.
	   After seven mini breaks, the Swede served out for a 7-5
advantage with his second set point.
	   The second set went with serve until the eighth game when
Bjorkman broke for a 5-3 lead and then served out the match.
	   Bjorkman, who has recently recovered from a serious virus, said
he was confortable playing on grass and could be a chance at
Wimbledon where he is seeded No. 11.
	   ``It's been a big goal for 1998 to do well at Wimbledon,'' he
said. ``The way I'm playing now _ if guys want to beat me _ they're
going to have to play at their very best.
	   Bjorkman will meet Jerome Golmard in the semifinals Saturday
after the Frenchman beat Australia's Scott Draper 6-4, 6-3 in a
quarterfinal Friday.
	   In other quarterfinals, Zimbabwe's Byron Black defeated Gianluca
Pozzi 7-5, 6-2, and Sargis Sargsian of Armenia defeated No. 6 seed
Brett Stevens 7-6 (10-8), 6-2.

Russia recalls NATO envoy to protest Kosovo air maneuvers inaccurate. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with complaints that NATO information was
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's envoy to NATO, who was recalled to Moscow
earlier this week as a protest against the western alliance's air
exercises in the Balkans, will not be returning to Brussels any
time soon, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
	   Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin returned to the Russian capital for
consultations following NATO's announcement that it would go ahead
with the exercises over Albania and Macedonia on the day before
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was due to meet with
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow.
	   The exercises on Monday were intended to demonstrate the West's
readiness to use force to stop Yugoslavia's violent campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   Col.-Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, said Zavarzin would not be
returning to NATO headquarters in Brussels in the next few days.
	   ``We need to coordinate our approach to our mutual relations
with the North Atlantic bloc, including in light of the latest
events _ the NATO air force exercises,'' Ivashov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   If NATO ``resorts to any violent action to resolve the Kosovo
conflict without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, this
would be the start of a new Cold War in Europe and will determine
Russia's conflict,'' Ivashov warned.
	   He said political means to solve the crisis had not been
exhausted, and that the military option was the ``1,001st one,''
Interfax reported.
	   Ivashov also complained about the advance warning Russia
received on the air exercises. He said Russia was notified a day
and a half before they took place and that ``50 percent of the
information was, to put it mildly, untrue,'' Interfax reported.
	   Moscow received ``distorted reports on the number of aircraft to
be involved in the exercises and on the missiles and bombs with
which they were equipped,'' he said.
	   Ivashov also warned of an ``explosive'' military imbalance in
Bosnia, where Serbs allegedly are unable to arm themselves because
of economic and geographic regions, while the U.S.-led effort to
arm the Muslims and Croats is continuing apace.

New Zealand's Stephen Scahill storms into Madeira lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MACHICO, Madeira (AP) _ Stephen Scahill of New Zealand scorched
into the lead of the Madeira Island Open on Friday when he fired an
11-under-par 61 in the second round of play, shattering the Santo
da Serra course record by two shots.
	   Scahill leaped into a three-stroke lead ahead of Sweden's Mats
Lanner, who went round in 66, and Germany's Thomas Gogele, who
carded 68.
	   ``This is easily my lowest-ever round of golf,'' Scahill said.
	   ``The key today was my approach shots. I was pin-high at almost
every hole and then my putter got hot.''
	   Scahill, 28, who last year lost his European Tour card, found
form to pot 10 birdies and an eagle three at the 521-yard third
hole.
	   He took only one bogey, at the 17th, where he three-putted from
25 feet.
	   Most of the leading European players are competing in the US
Open this week, giving lower-ranked players a far greater chance of
winning the Madeira Island Open which is being staged at the same
time.

With France-World Cup-Tickets Nantes braces for arrival of ticketless Japanese 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ The town of Nantes braced Friday for the
arrival of some 15,000 supporters of Japan's World Cup team -- some
10,000 of them ticketless but hoping to find a way to watch the
match against Croatia.
	   The city made excuses in 30,000 notices printed in Japanese to
be distributed to Japan supporters as they arrive in the nearly one
dozen TGV fast trains due in Saturday morning and the some 200
buses converging on Nantes between Friday night and Saturday.
	   The ticketless Japanese were victims of a fraud scandal that has
embarrassed World Cup organizers.
	   The western city just south of Brittany has erected four giant
screens to accommodate the arrivals and put up signs in Japanese in
the train station and around town to direct them to the screens.
	   Still, hope that a stadium ticket could be procured was high --
along with prices. Scalpers were selling tickets for between 6,000
francs and 10,000 francs (about dlrs 1,000-1,700), according to
numerous accounts.
	   Up to 12,000 Japanese soccer fans have been left ticketless in
an apparent fraud scandal that has drawn indignation and prompted
an investigation.
	   Three people _ including the head of the French affiliate of ISL
Worldwide, FIFA's exclusive marketing partner _ were arrested
Wednesday in the investigation.

Security Council reaches tentative agreement on Iraqi spare parts deal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES top 3 grafs with council approval, edits to conform
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council unanimously agreed
Friday to allow Iraq to spend dlrs 300 million of oil-for-food
revenues to buy spare parts for its oil industry to meet increased,
U.N.-approved, export targets.
	   Iraq strongly opposed the resolution, arguing that it transforms
oil-for-food into an ongoing program as long as economic sanctions
remain in effect.
	   The resolution would, in effect, reduce the political leverage
Iraq has in its campaign to force the Security Council to lift
sanctions.
	   Under the current system, Iraq submits a plan for distributing
food and medicine purchased with oil revenues every six months when
the program is renewed. But the current resolution provides that if
no plan is submitted, the previous one remains in force.
	   Iraq had in the past held up submitting the plan and suspended
oil sales as part of an overall strategy to whittle away at support
for the sanctions.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the resolution ensures no
further gaps in Iraqi oil sales.
	   In a letter to the council this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf expressed opposition to the resolution. He
said Iraq ``strongly'' wants the current phase of the plan, which
expires in November, to be the last and that the eight-year
sanctions should be ended.
	   It was unclear whether amendments made Friday would satisfy
Iraq. Last Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon,
threatened to stop oil sales entirely if the resolution were
approved.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council approved the oil-for-food program, which enables
Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and
humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months, but the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in March that the
council let Iraq buy the parts with revenues from oil-for-food
sales to boost capacity to meet the new U.N.-authorized export
ceiling.
	   The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan,
planned to leave for Baghdad late Friday to spend two weeks in Iraq
studying the condition of Iraq's oil industry.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only forms of weekend worship. For the faithful, it is a way of
life, a solace for the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for
holy war. And the heavy gold cup is its holy grail.

Outspoken Cambodian opposition leader announces poll boycott

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian opposition politician Sam
Rainsy announced Friday night that his party is withdrawing from
the campaign for next month's general election because it would not
be free and fair.
	   ``If I accept to participate, it will be a betrayal of my
supporters,'' he said at a news conference in Bangkok. ``Cambodia
deserves more respect, not a second-class election.''
	   He said his party might rejoin the election process if minimum
conditions for a free and fair poll could be put in place before
the election date. These conditions would relate to technical
issues and timing, he said.
	   Rainsy is an outspoken critic of the government and was the
apparent target of an assassination attempt last year, when a
grenade attack on a demonstration he was leading killed more than a
dozen of his supporters and injured about 100.
	   It was widely believed that Co-Premier Hun Sen, now the
country's strongman, was behind the attack.
	   What effect the boycott would have on the election process was
difficult to predict, since the royalist FUNCINPEC party _ the main
opposition group _ remains in the campaign.
	   Sam Rainsy's statement was clearly aimed at making the
international community take a close look at its qualified support
for the elections, scheduled for July 26.
	   He said he believed the so-called Friends of Cambodia _ a
grouping of Western and Asian countries seeking an end to the
country's continuing political unrest_ were intending to announce
their endorsement of the July 26 election at their meeting this
weekend in Bangkok.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, informed of Sam Rainsy's
remarks, expressed regret.
	   ``We have not gone that far yet but that's unfortunate,'' he
said. Surin said Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon would
meet Sam Rainsy later Friday night.
	   Sam Rainsy and fellow opposition figure Son Soubert said in a
statement earlier Friday that killings of opposition activists
continue to mount and that politically motivated murders have
consistently gone unpunished.
	   Opposition party organizers in the provinces are being
threatened and intimidated by ``thugs'' within Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party, they charged, and legal institutions remain stacked
in favor of the ruling party.
	   Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert of the Son Sann party called on the
government to provide main opposition parties fair and equitable
access to the electronic media, saying that so far, ``media access
is doled out in token amounts (to opposition political parties)
while the ruling party has free rein.''
	   ``After five years of total control, they give us five minutes
of air time,'' Sam Rainsy complained in Bangkok.
	   Sam Rainsy said he and his Sam Rainsy party would continue with
political activity despite the election boycott. He said they would
go ahead with a demonstration to call for a fair election planned
for Sunday in Phnom Penh.
	   He said FUNCINPEC shared his concerns but had come to a
different conclusion about what to do.
	   FUNCINPEC is led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was ousted by
his co-premier Hun Sen in a coup d'etat one year ago, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-brokered elections in
1993.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been held back after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to
proceed with a new election on July 26. Under pressure from foreign
aid donors, he allowed Ranariddh to return to participate.
	   ``Prince Ranariddh is not clever enough to understand that he is
being trapped,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``By participating in the mockery
of an election, he will only add to the legitimacy of Hun Sen.''

World Cup: FIFA suspends five players for Thursday's red cards 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Africa's Alfred Phiri was banned for three
games and French star Zinedine Zidane and Denmark's Miklos Molnar
for two each Friday as FIFA followed up ``Red Card Day'' with
suspensions.
	   Five players were ordered off in two games Thursday as South
Africa tied 1-1 with Denmark and France crushed Saudi Arabia 4-0.
	   The flurry of red cards followed complaints by new FIFA
president Sepp Blatter that referees weren't doing their job
properly after only four red cards in the first 20 games.
	   Phiri got a three match suspension for elbowing aside Thomas
Helves, FIFA ruling it ``very dangerous play''. The South African
will miss the South Africa_Saudi Arabia match Wednesday and second
round and quarterfinal matches, if South Africa qualifies.
	   In that same match two Danes got red cards as well from
Colombian referee John Jairo Toro Rendon. Substitute Molnar was
sent off in the 67th minute after knocking over South African
captain Lucas Radebe. The red card earned him a two match
suspension and Molnar will miss Wednesday's France-Denmark and a
second round match if the Danes get that far.
	   The Danes will also have to miss another Danish substitute,
Morten Wieghorst, who got a red card three minutes after entering
the game for bumping Benni McCarthy from behind and knocking him
down. Wieghorst only got a one match suspension.
	   In the France-Saudi game also on Thursday two players saw red.
Zidane was suspended for two matches for ``violence against another
player'' after putting his foot into Saudi captain Fouad Amin's
side, which Mexican referee Arturo Brizio interpreted as stamping.
Zidane will miss Wednesday's France-Denmark game and France's first
second round match.
	   Saudi Arabia's Mohammed al Khilaiwi will miss his team's game
against South-Africa. He got a one match suspension for ``very
dangerous play'' hauling down Bixente Lizarazu in full flight after
only 19 minutes.

World Cup: Nigeria advances to second round with 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria added itself to the round of 16 Friday,
using a first-half goal by Victor Ikpeba to beat Bulgaria 1-0 and
become the third team to secure a place in the second round of the
World Cup.
	   Victor Ikpeba finished a three-man combination by sliding the
ball under Zdravko Zdravkov in the 27th minute. Jay-Jay Okocha sent
a ball to the top right corner of the penalty area where Daniel
Amokachi side-foot touched it to Ikpeba in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco midfielder eluded Trifon Ivanov, who fell, and
rolled the ball just under Zdravkov.
	   The victory gave Nigeria six points from two games and kept it
atop Group D. Bulgaria, which reached the semifinals in 1994, was
left with one point and a remaining game against Spain.
	   Despite the 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat, Nigeria
pushed from the opening kickoff and clearly dominated the first
half with the more numerous and dangerous chances.
	   But the second half was more Bulgaria's as the Africans seemed
content to defend, only going forward occasionally.
	   The Bulgarians missed their best chance in the 42nd minute when
Krassimir Balakov's chip over Nigerian keeper Peter Rufai just
bounced wide of the left post.
	   Balakov wasted another chance in th 73rd, sending a free kick
wide of the left post by a meter and again when Peter Rufai blocked
away Emil Kostandinov's sharp-angled shot with three minutes
remaining.
	   Nigeria twice missed its chance to put the game away in the
second half. George's touch off a cross from Rasheed Yekini the the
81st didn't have enough pace to get past Zdravkov, and the ball
twice had to be cleared from the line two minutes later.
	   Besides his goal, Ikpeba had two more chances in the first half,
just missing wide of the right post in the 29th and put a header
into Zdravkov in the 39th.
	   Nigeria did take a casualty when Uche Ukechukwu was shown a
yellow card in the 43rd minute. The caution was his second in two
games, meaning combined with the yellow he was issued in the
African's 3-2 opening victory over Spain, he will have to miss
Nigeria's last group game against Paraguay.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC;

Russia welcomes American overture to Iran 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia welcomed Friday new indications that the
United States wants better relations with Iran.
	   ``We believe that a resolute turn for the better in relations
between Washington and Tehran would undoubtedly contribute to a
better political climate in the Middle East and to more stability
and security in the rest of the world,'' the Foreign Ministry said
in a statement.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Iran on Wednesday to
join the United States in drawing a ``road map leading to normal
relations.'' President Clinton said Thursday he is convinced Iran
is ``changing in a positive way'' that could lead to a
reconciliation and a return to normal relations.
	   ``We trust that Washington's positively charged statements will
be followed by practical steps,'' the statement said.
	   It said Russia hoped that United States ``will no longer bar
other states from developing normal ties with Iran in various
spheres that do not fall under restrictions imposed by
international accords.''
	   Congress is considering sanctions on Russia for selling nuclear
technology to Iran.

Prince William challenges the press on privacy issue GMT 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: dashed-off material below 7th graf is embargoed until 2301
By JENNY E. HELLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince William and a tabloid newspaper have
``amicably resolved'' a complaint he lodged personally about a
supplement published a week before his 16th birthday that he
considered inaccurate and intrusive, Buckingham Palace said Friday.
	   The prince filed a formal complaint with the Press Complaints
Commission earlier this week, decrying The Mail on Sunday's
extensive speculation about his thoughts and feelings, commission
spokesman Guy Black confirmed.
	   Buckingham Palace spokeswoman Sandy Henney said the palace
especially objected to the paper's assertion that William would
evaluate certain young women and then tell his private secretary to
invite them to tea.
	   ``He is still only a young man,'' Ms. Henney said. ``We felt
that the suppositions had been intrusive to his privacy by printing
things that were inaccurate.''
	   After Princess Diana's Aug. 31 death, the British press agreed
to allow her sons, William and his 13-year-old brother Harry, to
grow up out of the limelight. In January, the commission revamped
the newspaper code of conduct, including a clause protecting the
privacy of celebrities' children.
	   Lord Wakeham, chairman of the press commission, issued a
statement Friday noting that as William becomes older, ``articles
and features about the prince are increasingly likely to contain
personal details about him which would over time undermine the
significant respect for his privacy that we have built up.''
	   The Mail on Sunday said it would not be publishing an apology or
retraction in relation to William's complaint, but editors there
would not comment further.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Though the palace zealously guards the privacy of the future
king, it did consent to allow William to answer written questions
from Press Association, the domestic British news agency.
	   William told PA he will celebrate Sunday's birthday _ his first
since his mother's death _ quietly with friends, talking to his
family on the phone.
	   A techno music fan and avid reader, William said he plans to
study geography, biology and art history at Eton, the elite
preparatory school he has attended since 1996.
	   The prince, described as gifted academically, said he has not
yet decided which university he will attend after graduation.
Historically, members of the royal family have received degrees
from Oxford.
	   Recently, the tall, blond prince, who bears an uncanny
resemblance to his mother, has assumed a new role as the pin-up of
adoring, teenage women _ adulation which, William admitted, makes
him uncomfortable.
	   Quite the sportsman, William said he enjoys rugby, soccer,
swimming, water polo and tennis.

Yeltsin says Japan's proposals on Kuril Islands interesting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that
Japan's proposals for the disputed Kuril Islands are ``very
interesting,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made new proposals
when he and Yeltsin met in Japan in April.
	   They have not been made public, but Japanese media say Tokyo
proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing Russian to
retain control for some time.
	   The dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain, seized by the
Soviet Union at the end of World War II, has prevented the two
countries from signing a peace treaty.
	   The proposals ``are very interesting, but it is risky to reply
to me friend Ryu out of hand,'' Yeltsin said in the central Russian
city of Kostroma.
	   ``We will study the issue of Hashimoto's proposals, taking into
account the overall development of relations.''

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A day after six Russian peacekeepers
were injured in a mine blast in breakaway Abkhazia, the Russian
Defense Ministry on Friday ordered the force to start using weapons
if the troops' safety is threatened.
	   The peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier struck a road mine
in the Ghali district, the site of recent fighting between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.
	   ``This is already the fifth case of illegal terrorist or
diversionary acts against the peacekeepers or the United Nations
observers,'' said a statement by the peacekeepers' press service,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, despite repeated protests by the peacekeepers'
command, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides are not taking the
necessary measures for ensuring the normal functioning of the
peacekeeping force in the region,'' the statement said.
	   While allowing the peacekeepers to use weapons would not have
prevented the mine blast, Interfax said the Defense Ministry cited
the incident as grounds for its orders to ``tighten the regime of
carrying out service'' and to use weapons in case of a ``real
threat'' to peacekeepers' safety.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
Russian peacekeepers' presence.
	   Meanwhile, Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, held talks with Georgian and
Abkhazian leaders in an effort to jumpstart peace efforts.
	   He visited the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi and met with Abkhazian
leader Vladislav Ardzinba, before traveling to the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, and conferring with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
	   Berezovsky said new proposals were discussed, but he declined to
elaborate.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Malta could be facing an election nearly
two years after the socialists took power in the Mediterranean
island nation.
	   A dispute over a marina development threatens the Labor Party
government of Prime Minister Alfred Sant. A Parliament vote on the
project could come Friday night.
	   The Labor Party has maintained ties in the past with Libya, and
has sought to distance Malta from the European Union.
	   Sant's government backs the marina. Former Labor leader Dominic
Mintoff opposes the project, saying it would deny public access.
	   The Labor Party has a one-seat majority in Parliament over the
Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami.
If Mintoff breaks ranks and the measure fails, Sant has said he
will call new elections.
	   The Labor government has been under pressure, with two recent
ministerial resignations and recent defeats in Parliament.
	   The proposed port, a 6 million pound (dlrs 21 million) project,
falls in the Cottonera waterfront area on the island's southern
shore and within the district represented by the 81-year-old
Mintoff since World War II.
	   Officials here have said an American company, Abonmarche of
Dearborn, Michigan, is involved in the project.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Declaring ``I belong to Austria for the
next three days,'' Pope John Paul II reached out to his flock
Friday in a bid to calm a crisis in his church that has been rocked
by sexual scandal and dissent.
	   The frail 78-year-old John Paul, stooped and using a cane, began
the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine nation, historically a
pillar of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Small crowds came out to greet him on an overcast day. Some
school children held up signs saying ``We are with you.''
	   In the only open show of dissent, two young men on his motorcade
route held up cardboard placards reading ``Papa Go Home'' and ``We
Want the Dalai Lama.''
	   The pope left Salzburg belatedly aboard a special plane at 7.30
(1730 gmt) for Vienna where he was to spend the night at the
nuncio's residence.

Judge suspended amid charges of misconduct in media finances probe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ One of Spain's most important judges was
told to clear his desk Friday until charges against him of judicial
misconduct are cleared up.
	   Judge Javier Gomez de Liano is accused of unjustified severity
during a pretrial investigation he headed into alleged corporate
wrongdoings by the Sogecable Cable TV company.
	   The judge can now expect at least a year's suspension before the
Supreme Court case against him reaches the trial stage, unless his
initial appeal prospers and he is reinstated almost immediately.
	   The Supreme Court's Wednesday announcement that it had initiated
proceedings against Gomez de Liano coincided with the separate
revelation that the case against Sogecable had been shelved.
	   Sogecable, a subsidiary of Spain's largest media conglomerate
Grupo Prisa, was accused of misusing more than 23 billion pesetas
(dlrs 164 million) collected from pay-TV subscribers.
	   Allegations of Gomez de Liano's bias during the investigation
are based primarily on a 200 million-peseta (dlrs 1.3 million) bail
order and ban on leaving the country he imposed on Grupo Prisa's
president, Jesus de Polanco.
	   Polanco claimed a government-backed conspiracy to punish his
media group for its close ties to the Socialist Party of former
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. The party was voted out of office
in 1996 after 13 years and replaced by the Popular Party that was
allegedly close to the judge.
	   Gomez de Liano is one of 16 judges at the National Court _ a
court reserved for cases of national importance such as terrorism,
drug trafficking or major financial scandals.
	   He is the sixth Spanish judge to be suspended since the new
judicial system was fully established in 1980, following the
transition to democracy after Gen. Francisco Franco's 40-year
dictatorship.
	   If found guilty the 51-year-old judge could be banned from
holding public office for six years, the spokeswoman said.
	   As well as Sogecable, Grupo Prisa owns French pay-TV giant Canal
Plus, the daily newspaper El Pais and the Radio Ser network.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cleanup crews at World Cup stadiums are finding
little to do in areas used by Japanese players and fans.
	   After the Argentina-Japan match last Sunday, Toulouse stadium
personnel went to clean the stands where Japanese fans sat and
found the areas spotless, the sports daily L'Equipe reported
Friday.
	   Japanese fans had brought along their own garbage bags to the
stadium and left with them too. Not a stray paper was found in the
stands, according to L'Equipe. Some fans even had pocket ashtrays
with them.
	   The fans example was followed by the Japanese players who left
the locker room spotless, as well, the newspaper said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's not that he likes soccer and she doesn't.
Instead, a Parisian couple got into a fight over which World Cup
team to root for.
	   An unidentified woman lodged a complaint against her husband at
a police station in the 14th arrondissement in Paris earlier this
week, Le Parisien newspaper said Friday.
	   The woman said that her husband had hit her during a dispute
over which team to root for in one of Monday's three matches:
Germany-USA, Romania-Colombia, England-Tunisia.
	   Police didn't release their names or other details of the
altercation.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ In its latest fashion statement, France is telling
supporters to go heavy on the make-up.
	   To get the fans in the right mood and the right colors during
matches at the Stade de France, a mobile makeup car drives around
offering war paint.
	   The rainbow colored van carries professional make-up artists,
who offer face paint in the teams' colors to spectators.
	   Thursday's offering for the France-Saudi Arabia match was red,
white and blue for French fans and green, white and black for Saudi
Arabia.
	   The makeup van was such a big hit among fans during the
Holland-Belgium game Saturday that they ran out of paint.
	   ``Color makes a party, the more color, the more celebrations,''
said the unidentified clown driving the van.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The World Cup match Sunday between the
United States and Iran hasn't generated much interest among
Lebanon's pro-Iran Shiite Muslims.
	   A single Iranian flag was spotted dangling from a sixth floor
balcony in the Shiite-majority district of Hay-El-Lijah in west
Beirut on Friday.
	   Flags of other nations taking part in the World Cup flew from
buildings, cars and even fruit stalls, but there was no marked
partiality toward Iran.
	   Mustafah Hajji, the manager of a flag factory in the Ouzai
suburb of southern Beirut, another Shiite-majority area, said the
match in Lyon, France, had not created a rush for Iranian flags.
	   ``This is sports, not a political event. I hope sports remains
clean and uncorrupted by politics,'' he said.
	   Many of the Shiites living in Beirut are considered pro-Iran, a
Shiite-majority country. The Shiites form the largest of the 17
religious sects among Lebanon's 3.2 million people.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ When French police emptied the bag of
Denmark's former international Preben Elkjaer at the World Cup
press center in Toulouse, the Dane reacted with ire as he did in
the 1980s when he received a warning from a referee.
	   The former striker known for his rough-and-tough playing style
left his bag with personal belongings at the press center's
information counter while helping a French hostess who assist
reporters.
	   The hostess went out for lunch without telling her replacement
about the bag which carried Eljkaer's name, the Politiken newspaper
said Friday. The replacement spotted the bag and called police
believing it could contain a bomb.
	   Officers ``smashed'' its contents and emptied it, Elkjaer told
the daily after police tracked him down as being the owner of the
bag.
	   ``It's only in here that something is ticking,'' Elkjaer said,
pointing at his chest. ``And it ticks very strongly because I'm
furious'' about being a suspected bomber.
	   The hot-temperedd Dane, chiefly remembered at home for sending
the ball above the Spanish goal in a penalty kick during the
European Championship in France in 1984, accepted the French
official's apology.
	   Elkjaer, now a sports commentator on television, scored 38 times
during his 69 matches on the national squad. He was a key player on
the red-and-white team in the 1980s when Denmark qualified for the
European Championships in France and the World Cup in Mexico.

Jalabert sprints to stage win, closes gap on Rebellin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VARESE, Italy (AP) _ France's Laurent Jalabert closed the gap on
Tour de Suisse leader Davide Rebellin Friday by winning the fourth
stage in a sprint finish.
	   Jalabert, who also won Tuesday's prologue, moved within 17
seconds of Rebellin thanks to the 10 bonus seconds he gained for
the win.
	   The Italian, sixth on Thursday, has held the overall lead since
his solo win Wednesday.
	   The French rider covered the 208.8 kilometers (129.8 miles) from
Oberwald to Varese in 4 hours 59 minutes 42 seconds.
	   Switzerland's Beat Zberg finished a wheel-length behind. Stefano
Garzelli of Italy was third, closely followed by 1996 Tour de
France winner Bjarne Riis of Denmark.
	   Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany,
started the sprint 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the finishing
line.
	   The racers crossed the Alps, climbing to the 2,478 meter (8,130
foot) Nufenenpass before descending to the shores of Lake Maggiore
in Italy.
	   Saturday's fifth of 10 stages moves the race back to the
mountains. Starting from Malpensa, near Milan, it takes in 225.8
kilometers (140.3 miles) and finishes at Lenzerheide in the Swiss
Alps.

Labor leader demands police reopen attempted murder case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A labor leader seriously wounded in an
assassination attempt last year on Friday said police have dropped
the case.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary general of the main labor
federation, said his organization's own investigators traced the
identity of three people suspected of attacking him Dec. 11, two
days after he led a national strike against tax increases.
	   The names were submitted Friday to Attorney General Patrick
Chinamasa with a demand police reopen the case.
	   Seven assailants assaulted Tsvangirai in his downtown Harare
office in December, beating him unconscious and leaving him with
severe head injuries.
	   Officials of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions he heads
alleged the assailants attempted to push Tsvangirai from a tenth
floor window during the assault.
	   The strike forced the government to lift a package of tax
measures aimed at paying pensions to veterans of the bush war that
led to independence in 1980.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions and government
corruption is posing the most serious threat to President Robert
Mugabe, who has ruled this former British colony since 1980.
	   Food riots in January left six people dead after prices soared
by more than 30 percent following a 60 percent crash in the value
of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar.
	   A second national strike led by Tsvangirai in March shut down
most of the economy for two days.

Sudanese rebels say they attacked border posts, not Eritreans 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with rebels claiming attacks
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has accused Eritrea of bombarding
seven of its border posts, but Sudanese rebels said Friday their
forces carried out the attack.
	   Eritrean forces carried out ``an intensive shelling of seven
border points using all sorts of heavy artillery and tanks'' on
Thursday, the Sudanese army said in a statement broadcast on
state-run television.
	   Sudanese troops repulsed the attack, killing a number of
Eritrean soldiers and seizing artillery, ammunition and food, the
statement added.
	   The independent Sudanese newspaper Akhbar Al-Youm said Friday
that Eritrean forces shelled a ``number of inhabited villages on
the border,'' killing a number of civilians, including children.
	   Neither the military statement nor the newspaper said where the
attack occurred. They also did not give casualty figures.
	   Eritrean officials could not be reached for comment Friday.
	   But a Sudanese rebel spokesman in the Eritrean capital of Asmara
dismissed the Khartoum government allegations and said insurgents
had attacked the frontier posts.
	   The military's statement was a matter of ``lies,'' the
secretary-general of the opposition Umma Party, Omar Nur el-Dayem,
told The Associated Press in Cairo in a phone interview.
	   Forces of the National Democratic Alliance had attacked five _
not seven _ government garrisons in the eastern province of
Kassala, killing at least 54 government soldiers, el-Dayem said.
	   At least two rebels were killed and 15 others wounded, he added.
	   The rebels seized firearms, vehicles, ammunition, grenades, and
food supplies, el-Dayem said.
	   El-Dayem denied that any civilians were attacked.
	   The rebels attacked the el-Qerdah garrison, south of Kassala
city, and the Hufrat garrison, just north of Kassala, el-Dayem
said.
	   He said he could not say where the other three attacks occurred
as he was waiting for reports from the insurgent groups that
carried them out.
	   The alliance is an umbrella group for Sudanese opposition
parties. Five of the alliance's factions _ the Umma Liberation Army
(the armed wing of the Umma Party), the Democratic Unionist Party,
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the Beja Congress and Federal
Party _ took part in the attacks, el-Dayem said.
	   The fighting on the Sudanese-Eritrean border comes amid nearly
six weeks of conflict between Eritrean and Ethiopian forces.
Eritrea and Ethiopia dispute the location of their border, and
hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting.
	   Sudan has severed its relations with both Eritrea and Ethiopia,
and accuses the two states of harboring insurgents.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting the government for the past
two years in eastern Sudan and since 1983 in southern Sudan, where
the mainly Christian and animist population seeks autonomy from the
Muslim north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war and
ensuing famines.

Angolan president to visit Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos will
head to Russia on Sunday for a two-day state visit at the
invitation of President Boris Yeltsin, according to a statement
issued by Dos Santos's office Friday.
	   Talks were to center on Angola's debt to Russia, estimated at
dlrs 1.5 billion, and Russian investment here.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria, but a slump in world oil prices has cut revenue stymied
its efforts to keep up with interest payments on its foreign debt.
	   Dos Santos and Yeltsin will also discuss Russian investment in
Angola's lucrative diamond-mining sector.
	   Russia, along with the United States and Portugal, is one of the
observer countries overseeing the delayed implementation of
Angola's 1994 peace agreement, which ended a two-decade civil war
with UNITA rebels.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking bank workers stormed a
shareholders' meeting Friday to force the cancellation of a vote on
the sale of Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the meeting could begin. Protesters
ripped at the clothes of the bank's governor, Haris Stamatopoulos.
	   The bank's management had refused to discuss worker demands for
job and pension guarantees at the meeting.
	   The effort to sell Ionian Bank is an important test of the
Socialist government's resolve to reform the banking sector and
bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   Failure to sell the bank or a need to make major concessions to
strikers could be considered a major blow to the government of
Premier Costas Simitis.
	   Government officials said efforts would be made to hold the
shareholders' meeting later Friday. Law requires that it take place
within 20 days.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank.
	   An Athens court called for an immediate investigation into
Friday's disruptions, asking for video footage from television
channels covering the events. A prosecutor ordered the protesters
arrested and brought to court, where they will face charges of
illegal violence and damaging property.
	   Meanwhile, a court Friday issued ruled that the strike was
illegal. Ionian union officials will be liable for fines of 500,000
drachmas (dlrs 1,650) for each additional strike day, according to
the ruling.
	   Workers have not heeded three previous court decisions banning
the strike.
	   Shares at the Athens Stock Exchange, which had opened higher on
upbeat expectations about the sale's approval, slipped after the
clashes broke out.

Pollock and Donald have England struggling 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa withstood all the pressure England
could apply and then retaliated to gain the upper hand in the
second cricket test at Lord's Friday.
	   South Africa rallied around a brilliant Jonty Rhodes century and
a record fifth-wicket stand to complete its innings 360 all out,
then the bowlers had England's top order in tatters at 40 for three
at stumps on day two.
	   Fast bowlers Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock (2-20) combined to
knock-out England's top order, dismissing both openers and skipper
Alec Stewart before the close of play.
	   The first task at hand for England will be to score 161 and
avoid the ignominy of following on.
	   In the space of three balls Mike Atherton (0) and debutant Steve
James (10) fell to catches behind the wicket as England slid to 15
for two.
	   In the penultimate over Stewart, dropped earlier, was trapped
lbw by Pollock for 14.
	   Nasser Hussain was 10 not out and night watchman Dean Headley
yet to score.
	   Rhodes' second century and the record stand with skipper Hansie
Cronje rescued the Proteas from a precarious 46 for four to put
them on the box seat.
	   The 184-run stand from 322 balls was a South African record for
the fifth wicket, surpassing the 157 between Tony Pithey and John
Waite, also against England at the Wanderers in 1964/65.
	   Rhodes had to wait five years and 43 innings since his maiden
century _ 101 not out against Sri Lanka at Moratuwa in 1993/94 _
but it could not have come at a better time for the visitors.
	   South Africa collapsed after the record stand to the second new
ball but Mark Boucher (35) and Lance Klusener (34) added 57 for the
eighth wicket in a little over an hour.
	   Dominic Cork triggered the South African lower order collapse
and finish with 6-119 to go with his 5-93 in the drawn first test
at Edgbaston.
	   England had to wait six overs after lunch to dislodge the
defiant fifth-wicket alliance between Cronje and Rhodes after South
Africa had resumed on 135 for four.
	   Mark Ealham, who came into the attack for the first time after
lunch, forced Cronje to hit a catch to Mark Ramprakash at cover.
	   Cronje, who hadn't scored a half century in nine previous tests
against England, scored 81 in just under four hours.
	   Rhodes, denied a century in the first test at Edgbaston when
dismissed for 95, survived a confident appeal for lbw on 95 and
then was hit on the helmet two balls later by Dean Headley.
	   He eventually reached the century flicking Headley for three
through midwicket.
	   Rhodes, who was dropped by Mike Atherton on 10, was finally
caught behind off Angus Fraser. He was one of the two victims of
the second new ball, which was taken in the 83rd over.
	   Rhodes scored more than half his runs with boundaries, hitting
14 boundaries and a big six in his 117.

Eritrean-Ethiopian border dispute unresolved by mediators

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ A candlelight ceremony at sunset Friday
honored Eritrean soldiers who died in a 30-year battle for
independence from Ethiopia, as a border dispute between the nations
festered despite African leaders' efforts.
	   The mood at the Martyr's Day ceremony in a square in the
Eritrean capital was reverent, but shot through with defiance over
the conflict that broke out in early May.
	   ``We are all grateful for what they did to give our nation
independence,'' said Kibra Tekie, one of thousands who sat in the
bleachers. ``After our long struggle, we are ready to defend
ourselves against Ethiopia again, if we must.''
	   About 65,000 Eritreans died in the fight for independence, which
ended in 1991 after the Eritreans helped Ethiopian rebels oust a
Marxist dictatorship. Eritrea became independent in 1993 with the
approval of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   Earlier Friday, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, a
comrade-in-arms of Meles in the struggle, urged the two nations to
``put our alliance back in place so that we contribute to each
other's stability and to the stability of the region.''
	   But Eritrea continued to refuse to unilaterally withdraw from
disputed territory as required by a U.S.-Rwandan proposal that the
Organization of African Unity has adopted as the basis for peace
talks, said OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Eritrea insists it is rightfully on land defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885. Ethiopia, which
has accepted the U.S.-Rwanda proposal, refuses to engage in peace
talks until Eritrea withdraws.
	   ``The Eritrean side stated clearly the facilitation process was
over,'' Salim said in neighboring Ethiopia on behalf of four
African leaders trying to mediate the crisis.
	   Isaias' adviser Yemane Gebremeskel said it was unfair to blame
Eritrea for the stalemate in the talks.
	   Also, the Eritreans have agreed with much of the plan, including
a call for demilitarization of the border and demarcation of the
boundary, he said.
	   ``We should focus on common ground, not differences,'' Yemane
said.
	   The team met both Meles and Isaias Thursday, then returned to
Addis Ababa.
	   Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, a member of the OAU team,
said the team had received assurances of restraint from both sides
while the OAU is seeking a solution.
	   Bizimungu said committees would be set up to study unresolved
disputes between the one-time allies and that heads of state would
return to the region in a month.
	   Earlier, Isaias said Eritrea did not plan to escalate its 6-week
border conflict with Ethiopia, which has claimed hundreds of lives
on three fronts and in air attacks. Ground fighting has subsided
since June 11.
	   ``We don't have any intention of escalating this war,'' Isaias
said. ``Any battle you would call the mother of battles, the mother
of wars, will never happen.''

Hoddle wary of rush of red cards 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle believes the
World Cup has started all over again after Thursday's five red
cards in two games.
	   After only four were dished out in the opening 20 games spread
over eight days, both new FIFA president Sepp Blatter and World Cup
co-organizer Michel Platini said referees were being too lenient
especially with regard to the FIFA mandate on the tackle from
behind.
	   What followed was a flurry of red and yellow cards in the
Denmark-South Africa and France-Saudi Arabia games.
	   ``I thought the balance was quite good in the first games, but
it has changed very quickly,'' Hoddle said Friday, three days
before his England team faces Romania at Toulouse.
	   England, who beat Tunisia 2-0 in its opening Group G game, did
not go into action until five days after the opening match between
champion Brazil and Scotland.
	   ``We went into the tournament believing the first five days
would give us a chance to see to see what was going to happen, how
the referees were going to interpret the laws,'' Hoddle said.
	   ``But now it's almost as if we are starting out again and
certainly we learned a lot from yesterday's performances.''
	   Hoddle and his squad have been monitoring the refereeing
assiduously and have been alarmed at the way the pendulum has swung
so drastically.
	   ``We have spoken about it already and you can speak about it for
a long period of time,'' the England coach said. ``But it is
actually going out there and remembering it when it's needed and
that's in the 90 minutes of the game.
	   ``There was a bit of confusion early on and then it settled
down, but now all this has happened and we have to re-address it.
	   ``Referees are individuals who will always referee a game
differently even within the laws of the games.''
	   Hoddle was scared the tournament would be ruined by too many red
cards.
	   ``I don't think it's going to be a positive step for the World
cup if we end up with eight a side or nines versus eights. If you
do it absolutely by the letter of the law as it stands at this
moment, you could easily end up like that.
	   ``There still needs to be a little common sense from the
referee. It is a shame if the referee gets carried away, thinking
they want red cards and yellow cards.
	   ``The idea is to eradicate the tackle from behind which can only
better the game.
	   ``But possibly referees are now going into other areas. They're
looking to give yellow and red cards in situations other than
tackling from behind,'' Hoddle said. ``There were a couple of
incidents yesterday which did not warrant a sending off.
	   ``Obviously there is going to be concern with that drastic
swing.''
	   The England coach said he would not ask his player to change
their style of play.
	   ``We will set how it goes over the next few games,'' he said.
``Certainly after all the seconds games have been played we will be
able to assess it a little bit better.
	   ``The main situation is the tackle from behind, let's not get
carried away just dishing out yellows left right and center and
reds just for the sake of it because somebody wants it.''

ISU cracks down on unsanctioned events; allows use of video replays 
</HEADLINE>
By ED McCULLOUGH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The group that runs world figure
skating offered a carrot and a stick Friday to its champions who
want to compete in unsanctioned events mostly for the prize money.
	   The International Skating Union will develop revenue-producing
competitions open to professionals and amateurs alike, president
Ottavio Cinquanta said. But from now on, skaters who compete
outside the ISU will lose their eligibility for Olympic and world
championship medals.
	   ``The rules were already clear. Now they are more clear: No
reinstatement,'' Cinquanta told reporters at the end of the ISU's
biennial congress. The vote was ``almost unanimous,'' he added.
	   The ISU took action on several issues important to the sport,
including making video replays available to judges. The aim is to
help them review the short program and compulsory dances, and spot
or rule out errors, from all over the spacious rinks.
	   The arcane, often puzzling, scoring system was modified to
reduce the possibility that a late skater, possibly not even among
the top tier, nevertheless could juggle the final standings and
determine the winner. That happened at the 1996 European
championships.
	   ``This existed for 50 years. It will exist no more,'' Cinquanta
said. ``If you are in front of me, you remain in front of me,'' no
matter what lower-finishing skaters score.
	   Among other measures, the ISU ruled that drug testing will be
mandatory for recognition of new world records from now on.
	   Perhaps the most interesting proposal rejected would have
required skaters to present at least two different free programs
each season. The idea was to make performances more attractive to
TV audiences, which would pour more revenue to ISU coffers from
sale of broadcast rights.
	   ``I was defeated,'' Cinquanta, of Italy, said with a smile,
shortly after being re-elected to a second, four-year term. He
indicated he will bring it up again.
	   At the news conference, he focussed on the issue of ISU
champions competing in outside events.
	   It's a sad reality, he said, that world champions at the peak of
their ability earn peanuts, while former champions _ arguably
producing inferior performances _ can earn millions from ice shows
and other commercial venues.
	   A potential danger to the ISU is that its champions captivate
global TV audiences with graceful flourishes or an athletic triple
axel _ and then quickly leave the sport to cash in their perhaps
fleeting celebrity.
	   ``We do understand that at a certain point in a skater's
career,'' money becomes more important, and resistance builds to
grueling workouts of five and six hours a day, Cinquanta said.
	   So apart from world championship, Olympic and Grand Prix events,
``We are preparing another corridor'' to keep ISU athletes in the
sport.
	   He declined to explain how or when the professional-amateur
competitions would take place.

Serbs seal border, choking flow of guns, refugees, fighters 
</HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TROPOJA, Albania (AP) _ Serb troops dropped on to the mountains
above this border village have sealed the frontier with
secessionist Kosovo, even venturing into Albanian territory to
hammer home with bullets their message that they can choke the flow
of guns, fighters and refugees, locals and foreign observers say.
	   Militants from Kosovo's KLA separatist army were training hard
Friday to try and counteract the Serb action. More than 500 headed
to practice ranges and supply dumps on the Albanian side, but even
they admit that it's more difficult than ever even to reach the
battlefields in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province dominated by
ethnic Albanians.
	   Troops from the Serb-led Yugoslav army and Serbian
paramilitaries started sealing the border on Monday, residents of
this dusty village of 1,000 say. They report seeing three Yugoslav
army helicopters dropping off troops along the rugged mountains
above the village that day.
	   Foreign aid workers, observers and reporters saw at least two
helicopters flying that day.
	   On Tuesday, Serbian snipers ventured over a hundred meters into
Albanian territory, and shot Tropoja resident Adem Selmani dead,
his relatives said. The snipers went further, shot dead two pack
horses, wounded Selmani's companion, then dragged the bullet-ridden
corpse back into Kosovo territory to cover their tracks, they said.
	   The relatives would not say what Selmani was doing near the
border. Many Tropoja locals had earned dlrs 150 per return trip for
ferrying guns over to Kosovo militants by mule train.
	   The Yugoslavs have reported killing gun runners and mules
before. What was special about Tuesday's killing was that it
coincided with the tales of Serbian snipers actually in the hills,
shooting at refugees and gun runners alike.
	   Halil Neza, 43, a cousin of Selmani, went up into the hills to
try and recover the corpse. He and other locals say the Serbs shot
at relatives on a first attempt to get the body. Albanian border
guards who on Wednesday went to investigate the incident also were
shot at. Shepherds who wander the barren, rocky mountains each day
with their flock report seeing paramilitaries in the hills.
	   ``The Serbs are like hungry animals that want to eat
everything,'' Neza said Thursday, hours after successfully
venturing across at sunset late Wednesday and dragging his cousin's
body back into Albania.
	   The mountain path where Neza found the corpse was until this
week one of five routes used by the Kosovo Liberation Army to ferry
guns into Kosovo, and by Kosovars to escape Yugoslav army troops
sweeping through their villages that could be KLA safe havens.
	   Last week, the refugees arrived by the hundreds each day. Now,
the flow has become a trickle. On Monday and Tuesday, refugees who
did make it reported attacks on them and said thousands more were
still trapped in Kosovo, waiting in makeshift mountainside camps.
	   On Friday, 36 refugees made it across on an obscure, unguarded
mountain path. They said they had been waiting up to two weeks to
cross.
	   Albania's president, Rexhep Meidani, on Wednesday called on
Yugoslavia to stop the killing and firing across the border.
	   But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has shown no signs of
pulling his forces either back from the border, or out of Kosovo,
as the European Union and NATO demand.
	   To do so would likely to be to cede effective control of the
border and large parts of the province to the KLA, whose influence
has grown rapidly among Kosovo Albanians since Serbian police began
a crackdown in March. More than 300 people have been killed in
fighting since.

Gadhafi says he is misunderstood 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN BENEDYK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ As his aides winced, Col. Moammar Gadhafi
leaned back inside his cavernous tent and laughed when asked about
his reported madness and support for terrorism.
	   ``All prophets have been accused of madness and terrorism,'' the
Libyan leader said. ``Even Christ was crucified, but after they
crucified him, they converted to his religion.''
	   During a wide-ranging interview this week with Associated Press
Television, Gadhafi was asked whether he considered himself a
prophet, the Libyan leader said: ``No, there is a difference
between a prophet sent by God and a prophet of revolution, a
prophet of freedom and socialism.''
	   The interview took place at Gadhafi's carpeted, low-slung tent
in the center of a tightly-guarded military complex in Tripoli. The
tent lies in the shadow of the bombed-out remains of his private
residence, destroyed by U.S. warplanes in 1986.
	   Dressed in light military fatigues and wearing a large brown
headscarf to hold back his trademark black hair, Gadhafi appeared
relaxed and confident.
	   He laughed off reports of an assassination attempt earlier this
month, saying that no such attack had ever taken place. ``I only
hear rumors of these attempts. They're the same old lies.''
	   Certainly there was no sign of heightened security on the
streets of Tripoli this week. Few soldiers were visible outside
military areas, and the atmosphere in the capital appeared
easygoing. Traffic flowed normally, it was business as usual in the
crowded market district, and open-air cafes were packed with people
watching the World Cup on television.
	   During the interview, Gadhafi repeated demands that the West
lift sanctions against Libya, denied involvement in the bombing of
plane over Scotland and discussed his new book of short stories.
	   The U.N. sanctions, which ban air travel to and from Libya, are
aimed at forcing the surrender of two Libyans charged with blowing
up an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in
1988. The attack killed 270 people.
	   In a message to the families of the Lockerbie victims, Gadhafi
said: ``We send our sincere condolences. And we are sorry for this
catastrophe because we suffer likewise, for we lost our families
and children during the joint US-British raid in 1986 against our
homes while we were asleep.''
	   ``So we know the grief caused by such tragedy, and we understand
that the families of the Lockerbie victims are suffering the same
pain as we did ourselves, so we share this grief with them.''
	   Denying Libyan involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, Gadhafi
asserted that the Western powers knew the identity of the culprits.
``Certainly America and Britain know,'' he said.
	   He declined to elaborate.
	   The U.S. government has demanded that the two Lockerbie suspects
be tried either in the United States or Scotland. Libya has offered
to surrender them for trial under Scottish law but in a neutral
country.
	   Gadhafi, who as ruled Libya since 1969, also spoke at length
about his new book of short stories, entitled ``Escape To Hell.''
In the book, Gadhafi espouses a philosophy that combines
apocalyptic visions and utopian solutions with a strong
environmental theme.
	   ``This is the city: a mill that grinds down its inhabitants ...
Children are worse off than adults,'' it reads.
	   ``The earth is the only thing you cannot do without,'' reads
another excerpt. ``If you destroy other things, you might not lose
out, but beware of destroying the earth, because you will then lose
everything!''
	   Gadhafi's Canadian publisher Alain Stanke told AP in Tripoli
that he did not view the book as a political tract.
	   ``Everybody thought it was a political work,'' Stanke said. ``I
didn't publish a political work. I published a literary work.''
	   Gadhafi's next literary project is an autobiography, also to be
published by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Declaring ``I belong to Austria for the
next three days,'' Pope John Paul II reached out to his flock
Friday in a bid to calm a crisis in his church that has been rocked
by sexual scandal and dissent.
	   The frail 78-year-old John Paul, stooped and using a cane, began
the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine nation, historically a
pillar of the Roman Catholic church.
	   Small crowds came out to greet him on an overcast day. Some
school children held up signs saying ``We are with you.''
	   In the only open show of dissent, two young men on his motorcade
route held up cardboard placards reading ``Papa Go Home'' and ``We
Want the Dalai Lama.''
	   The pope left Salzburg belatedly aboard a special plane at 7.30
(1730 gmt) for Vienna where he was to spend the night at the papal
envoy's residence.

World Cup: Nigeria into second round with 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional; UPDATES with quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria clearly saved its best play for the World
Cup and again is headed to the second round.
	   Victor Ikpeba closed a swift three-man combination in the 27th
minute Friday as Nigeria, which looked so out of synch in France
'98 tuneup games, used its superior speed and surprising ball
control to outlast Bulgaria 1-0 and stay atop Group D.
	   Adding to its 3-2 victory over Spain, Nigeria has six points and
can finish no worse than second in the group. Bulgaria, a
semifinalist in 1994, has one point and a remaining game against
Spain.
	   Under 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat at the Parc des
Princes, the Africans pushed from the opening kickoff and had more
dangerous chances.
	   Bulgaria played a slower and more deliberate pace, which
Nigeria, known more for its flair than organization, managed to
handle better than it usually does. The Europeans started seven
players 29 years of age or older, compared to just two for Nigeria.
	   ``The first thing is to be in the next round. It was a difficult
game for us,'' Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said. ``I am happy
with the way we played the first half. It was difficult for
Bulgaria because they needed to win.''
	   Milutinovic is the first coach to lead four different teams to
the second round at the World Cup, after Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica
in 1990 and the United States in 1994.
	   The Yugoslavian native's job was reportedly in jeopardy, though,
after Nigeria dropped World Cup tuneups to Germany, Yugoslavia and
Netherlands by a combined 9-1.
	   On Friday, Nigeria's superior speed began to pay off midway
through the first half as its players repeatedly turned defenders
and broke into open spaces.
	   The goal came off a lightning-quick exchange.
	   Left back Celestine Babayaro brought the ball up the left flank
and slid it to Jay-Jay Okocha, who found Daniel Amokachi at the top
right corner of the penalty area. Amokachi deftly side-footed the
ball to Ikpeba in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco striker, Africa's 1997 Player of the Year, eluded
sweeper Trifon Ivanov, who fell, and rolled the ball just under
keeper Zdravko Zdravkov's right arm for his second goal in the
green-and-white.
	   Nigeria's defense, its acknowledged weak point, was far from
perfect. Goalkeeper Peter Rufai and his backs got crossed up often,
but Bulgaria _ which lost 3-0 to Nigeria in the 1994 tournament _
never was able to convert.
	   ``I think that we were the better team on the day. Tactically,
too, we were better,'' Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev said. ``We
stopped Nigeria from playing the game they wanted to play. We had
chances but were not able to put them away.''
	   Winger Emil Kostadinov nearly tied the score with three minutes
remaining, but his shot skimmed off the crossbar.
	   Krassimir Balakov had produced a strong threat in the 42nd,
splitting two defenders with a header and then sending a lob over
midfielder Mutiu Adepoju and a charging Rufai, but the ball bounced
just wide of the empty net.
	   Then Hristo Stoichkov, who shared the scoring title at the last
World Cup for Bulgaria, flicked the ball wide right of the post in
the 66th and dropped to the ground in frustration.
	   Nwankwo Kanu, 19 months removed from heart valve surgery, made
his tournament debut in the 67th minute, coming on for Amokachi.
The Inter Milan striker nearly scored with his first touch, but the
left-footed blast from the box was fisted over the crossbar by
Zdravkov.
	   Nigeria missed other chances to put the game away late. Finidi
George's touch off a cross from substitute Rasheed Yekini in the
81st didn't have enough pace to get past Zdravkov, and the ball
twice had to be cleared from the line two minutes later.
	   Nigeria did lost captain Uche Ukechukwu for its last group game,
against Paraguay. The defender was shown a yellow card, his second
of the tournament, in the 43rd.

Terry Sheringham and center-back Tony Adams and were taken off
England's casualty list Friday. But there was still a question mark
about Gary Southgate's chances of playing against Romania in
Monday's World Cup match in Toulouse.
	   ``We've only got one injury and that's Gareth, but he has
improved quite considerably and everyone else has trained today,''
head coach Glenn Hoddle said.
	   Southgate, who helped England defeat Tunisia 2-0 in last
Monday's opening Group A clash in Marseille, suffered a
re-occurence of an old ankle injury during training Tuesday.
	   Explaining the incident which sidelined the 27-year-old central
defender, Hoddle said: ``He has had a little bit of a foot problem
just under the sole of his foot which is quite painful, he ran
awkwardly on it and jarred the ankle at the same time.
	   ``The injury is responding to treatment and there are
encouraging signs he might be able to train tomorrow.''
	   Hoddle admitted Southgate's chances of playing had looked slim a
day ago.
	   ``Yesterday I would have thought, `no he won't be fit enough.'
But he is improving at this moment and is progressing very quickly.
However, I can't say what his chances of playing are until we until
we see him in a strenuous training session.''
	   Adams and Shearer, who scored one of the goals against Tunisia,
have both recovered from blistered feet caused by the sunbaked
playing surface of the Veledrome stadium. Sheringham was also back
to full-fitness following a minor hamstring strain.
	   Hoddle said his players had seen a video of Romania's 1-0
victory over Colombia and studied reports of the match prepared by
his backroom staff.
	   ``I've got the reports already in and we showed the players one
set of videos this morning,'' he said. ``We've seen the game and
studied it and we'll continue to do that.''
	   Hoddle believed Romania would provide stiff opposition.
	   ``I think they are a smashing side,'' he said. ``Let's face it,
they're the seeded side; they are the side that qualified earlier
than any other European side in the World Cup.
	   ``They are a quality side with quality players. They certainly
have got more World Cup experience than our group of players and
probably you have got to make them favorites.''
	   Hoddle was hoping for strong support from the England fans, like
in Marseille, but did not want a repetition of the violence.
	   ``The support in the stadium was magnificent and we need that
support. It encourages the players and lifts and inspires the
players. And I hope that is the reason why they are going to
Toulouse to take part in this World Cup,'' he said before turning
the the dark side of England's followers.
	   ``We don't want to see any of the problems that we had down in
Marseille. Hopefully most of the ringleaders, and its probably down
to 10 people, have been arrested.''

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only forms of weekend worship. For the faithful, it is a way of
life, a solace for the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for
holy war. And the heavy gold cup is its holy grail.

South African official's statement led to espionage charge, official says 
</HEADLINE>
By EMMANUEL CAMILLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mozambique's attorney general said a
South African official charged earlier this year with gunrunning
now faces espionage charges because of what he told investigators,
a news agency reported on Friday.
	   Interim Attorney General Antonio Namburete said the official,
Robert McBride, his wife and his attorney had invited the espionage
charge by their explanations, the Mozambique News Agency, AIM,
said.
	   McBride, a South African foreign affairs official who has been
jailed since March, has told investigators that he was conducting a
private investigation of how guns are smuggled from Mozambique into
South Africa.
	   Namburete said McBride was guilty of espionage because he
intended to share the results of his investigation with members of
a regional organization, the Southern African Development
Community, without knowledge or consent of Mozambican authorities.
	   Many weapons used in South Africa's soaring crime problem are
thought to pass through the country's largely unguarded border to
the north and east. Mozambique settled 15 years of civil war in
1992.
	   The case is major news in South Africa, where the government has
remained mostly silent but has said McBride was not on official
business in Mozambique at the time of his arrest.
	   ``His hierarchical superiors in South Africa knew nothing about
McBride's visit to Mozambique and the motives that brought him
here,'' Namburete was quoted as saying.
	   Namburete said McBride had violated a standing agreement on
security and defense issues between the two countries by operating
on his own outside a special commission set up in 1995 for this
purpose.
	   The espionage charge was made earlier this month, after a judge
requested more defined charges.
	   Mozambican law provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison for espionage and 12 years for gun running.

India inflict first home defeat on Sri Lanka in four years BY CALLISTUS DAVY 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _India inflicted the first home defeat
on Sri Lanka in four years as they trounced their hosts by 8
wickets in the opening 3-nation Independence Cup cricket encounter
Friday.
	   Needing 244 for victory, the Indians cruised home in the 44th
over when Ajay Jadeja hoisted Kumara Dharmasena for a six over
long-on at the Premadasa Stadium.
	   The target was made easy after Sachin Tendulkar gave the Indians
a rousing start with a quick-fire 65 in only 50 balls. Tendulkar
reached the half century mark in just 36 balls.
	   The former skipper blasted nine fours and shared an imposing
115-run opening stand with Saurav Ganguly as the pair smashed 99
runs in the first 15 overs.
	   Ganguly made his 65 runs in 114 balls with seven fours and a
six. He was also involved in a 96-run stand for the second wicket
with Mohammed Azharuddin who made an unbeaten 55.
	   A third wicket stand of 145 runs between Aravinda deSilva and
Marvan Atapattu earlier paved the way for Sri Lanka's 243 for 6
after skipper Arjuna Ranatunga won the toss and decided to bat
first.
	   The pair took the side from a shaky 50 for 2, as De Silva made
97 off 119 balls and Atapattu stroked 70 in 89 balls with six
fours.
	   Their stand was broken by Anil Kumble who came on for a new
spell to bowl Atapattu who attempted to square-drive a delivery.
	   De Silva was out in the 49th over caught by Mohammed Azharuddin
at mid-wicket off new fast bowler Ajit Agarkar after hitting five
fours and one six.
	   India succeeded in neutralizing the explosive opener Sanath
Jayasuriya early in the innings when Agarkar took the left hander
by surprise and clean bowled him with a faster delivery.
	   Jayasuriya made just 12 runs after smashing the first ball of
the innings from Agarkar to the cover boundary.
	   Co-opener Romesh Kaluwitharana did some lusty hitting to
overcome the setback but was out when he drove a ball from off
spinner Harbhajan Singh to be caught by Agarkar at the score of 29
runs.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Durant, Carnevale at the turn; other early play;
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart found reason to dance in the
first round of the U.S. Open, performing a shimmy during his
birdie-birdie-birdie finish that gave him the lead.
	   Friday, a waltz may be in order.
	   With the wind picking up slightly at The Olympic Club, none of
the early starters made a serious move at catching up to the
4-under-par 66 Stewart posted on Thursday.
	   Tom Lehman, who birdied three of the last four holes for a
2-under 68, started his second round with five straight pars. Jeff
Maggert had two birdies, offset by a bogey on No. 5, and was also
at 2-under.
	   And amateur Matt Kuchar, who never goes anywhere without the
smile that is quickly making him one of the most popular players,
followed six straight pars with consecutive birdies to join the
pack at 2-under.
	   Joe Durant, one of the surprise contenders of the first round
and the only player to reach 5-under at Olympic so far, also kept
it slow and simple. After a 68 on Thursday, he made the turn in 35
to keep pace.
	   He and Mark Carnevale, who shot a bogey-free 67 in the first
round, both said their nerves picked up when they saw their names
around the top of the leaderboard.
	   Only Durant fought through the nervousness Friday. Carnevale
broke his string of 19 pars with a double bogey on No. 2. He made
the turn at 39 and was 1-over for the tournament.
	   Stewart didn't tee off until early afternoon, hoping to start
Friday the way he finished on Thursday.
	   The cut will be the top 60 players and everyone within 10
strokes of the lead. Two years ago, Stewart had the first-round
lead at Oakland Hills until stumbling home over the last three
holes in the second round to let several players into weekend play.
	   That may be the only thing that saves defending champion Ernie
Els, who opened with a 75 and dropped to 6-over for the tournament
Friday through eight holes.
	   ``Always be satisfied with making par,'' said Stewart, who
speaks from experience of having won this championship seven years
ago at Hazeltine.
	   That gave him a 4-under-par 66 and a one-stroke lead over
Carnevale. Another stroke back were Lehman, Jose Maria Olazabal and
Bob Tway _ all past major championship winners _ along with Durant.
	   Lehman, who has had the lead going into the final round of the
last three U.S. Opens, birdied three of the last four holes, and
Olazabal holed a 6-foot (1.83-meter) birdie putt on the 18th.
	   ``I took advantage of some breaks out there,'' Stewart said.
``When we get them, you have to take advantage of them, especially
in a U.S. Open, because you don't get that many.''
	   Carnevale was the only player who went the entire first round
without a bogey. That didn't last long Friday.
	   He drove into the rough on No. 2 and, with a surprisingly decent
lie, tried to go at the green on the 394-yard (360-meter) hole
instead of hitting a wedge into the fairway.
	   The approach came up short in the rough, and his sand wedge
traveled only about 20 feet (6.10 meters) into more thick stuff. He
chipped out to 35 feet (10.67 meters) and two-putted for a double
bogey, dropped him back to 1-under.
	   ``That didn't help,'' he said on the tee box at the par-3 third
hole, where he again found the rough. This time, he managed to save
par, but he bogeyed the next hole and closed out his front nine
with another bogey.
	   Olazabal and Tway had later tee times Friday, as did John Daly
and Jesper Parnevik, who each opened with a 69.
	   Justin Leonard, the British Open champion and a favorite this
week because of his grinding style of play, opened with a 71 but
quickly got back in the thick of it with seven pars and a birdie on
the first eight holes.
	   Jack Nicklaus, who caused a tremor with a birdie on No. 18 for a
73, began Friday with a birdie and double bogey and was at 4 over.
	   Stewart called his 4-3-3 finish ``unheard of'' on the closing
holes of Olympic, but that wasn't the only unusual twist.
	   Amateur Paul Simson was 2-under at the turn until a spectator
ran off with his errant tee shot on the 10th hole. Not realizing
what had happened, Simson considered it lost and played a second
tee shot. He took a triple bogey on his way to a 43 on the back.
	   Parnevik sensed that the pin placement on No. 18 was different
than what his yardage book showed, and he was right. The USGA
realized the pin was unfair and changed it two hours into the
round, although everyone played it the same.
	   And Casey Martin made history by becoming the first player to
ride a cart in the U.S. Open. It could have used a pair of
headlights, since Martin's bogey-bogey finish for a 74 came in near
darkness.
	   ``It was overwhelming, the support I got from the crowd out
there,'' he said. ``I have to admit, I was almost crying on the
first tee. I just had to get up there and hit it quick before I
thought about what was going on.''
	   Lehman was one of many who repeated a popular phrase in majors _
they cannot be won on Thursday, only lost.
	   And several players who didn't beat Olympic didn't beat
themselves, either.
	   Colin Montgomerie never went over par in his round of 70, where
he was joined by Masters champion Mark O'Meara and Tom Kite.
	   Phil Mickelson was in the group at 71, Fred Couples shot 72 and
Tom Watson was at 73, scores that didn't put them on the
leaderboard but surely kept them in the back of the leaders' minds.
	   For others, Olympic hit them before they knew what was
happening.
	   Tiger Woods was cruising along at 2-under, tied for the lead in
the early going, when he four-putted No. 9 for a double bogey. Four
more bogeys followed on the back and Woods wound up at 74.
	   Steve Pate was also at 2-under with only three holes left when
he missed the next three fairways and finished at 72.

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military faction
_ low on ammunition and apparently on the run _ launched a dawn
artillery strike Friday on the country's battered capital, the
Senegalese military says.
	   At least a dozen 155-millimeter shells rained down on the city,
where the streets were still strewn with the bodies of victims from
previous attacks.
	   A billowing cloud of black smoke was seen from the northern side
of the city, a Senegalese military commander said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The attack came one day after proposed peace talks collapsed and
clandestine rebel radio warned of an assault on the capital,
Bissau.
	   In another broadcast, the rebels accused the government of
creating a humanitarian crisis.
	   ``The fighting is affecting the people,'' said Maj. Manuel De
Santos Gomes in a broadcast monitored in the Senegalese bordertown
of Mpak. ``We are trying to help the people and bring justice to
our country.''
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Anumane Mane staged a failed
coup bid earlier this month to oust President Joao Bernardo Vieira
after accusing him of widespread corruption.
	   A peace envoy, Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sedat Jobe,
returned to his country aboard a French naval ship after failing to
meet with Mane.
	   Almost two weeks after launching the unsuccessful coup, Mane's
renegade forces are on the run, reportedly ousted from their
stronghold at the military garrison of Bra on Bissau's outskirts.
	   Senegalese troops fighting on behalf of Vieira were closing in
on Bissau's international airport, which is now controlled by the
rebels.
	   ``We hope to free the airport to allow reliefs supplies to come
in,'' the commander said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people have reportedly fled Bissau,
setting the stage for a massive humanitarian crisis if food and
drinking water do not reach large groups of internal refugees, the
regional office of the Senegalese Red Cross said.
	   ``There are thousands of people suffering,'' said Red Cross
representative Jerome Da Sylva. ``They are in urgent need of food
and water and shelter.''
	   The U.N. World Food Program said Guinea-Bissau's government had
``requisitioned'' two storage complexes containing 2,700 metric
tons (2,970 tons) of U.N. food, much of it intended for hungry
refugees.
	   ``The World Food Program wants the government to give back the
two stores of food,'' spokesman Wagdi Othman said in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast.
	   The U.N. agency was worried the food would be used to feed
fighters, Othman added.

Jalabert sprints to stage win, closes gap on Rebellin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VARESE, Italy (AP) _ France's Laurent Jalabert closed the gap on
Tour de Suisse leader Davide Rebellin Friday by winning the fourth
stage in a sprint finish.
	   Jalabert, who also won Tuesday's prologue, moved within 17
seconds of Rebellin thanks to the 10 bonus seconds he gained for
the win.
	   The Italian, sixth on Thursday, has held the overall lead since
his solo win Wednesday.
	   The French rider covered the 208.8 kilometers (129.8 miles) from
Oberwald to Varese in 4 hours 59 minutes 42 seconds.
	   Switzerland's Beat Zberg finished a wheel-length behind. Stefano
Garzelli of Italy was third, closely followed by 1996 Tour de
France winner Bjarne Riis of Denmark.
	   Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany,
started the sprint one kilometer (0.62 miles) from the finishing
line.
	   The racers crossed the Alps, climbing to the 2,478 meter (8,130
foot) Nufenenpass before descending to the shores of Lake Maggiore
in Italy.
	   Saturday's fifth of 10 stages moves the race back to the
mountains. Starting from Malpensa, near Milan, it takes in 225.8
kilometers (140.3 miles) and finishes at Lenzerheide in the Swiss

United Nations denounces death of Tajik security squad commander 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United Nations mission to Tajikistan issued a
statement Friday denouncing the apparent murder of the deputy
commander of the observers' security force, a news agency reported.
	   The deputy commander, Col. Usmon Khodzhayev, was found dead on
Wednesday of gunshot wounds to the head.
	   The United Nations mission expressed condolences to Khodzhayev's
family, and demanded that the government take all measures to find
those responsible, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Seventy U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
provisions of a peace deal reached last year that ended the former
Soviet republic's civil war.
	   The observers' security force was formed last February using
both government and opposition troops _ one of many bodies
integrating their staff as part of the peace deal.

Already qualified, Brazil still has revenge for motivation 
</HEADLINE>
By JORGE E. RUEDA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ If needing a victory to qualify
for the next round can't be used by Brazil as motivation, there's
always revenge.
	   Last year's 4-2 victory by Norway in Oslo still sticks in the
minds of Brazil, and so does the unflattering comments by Norway
coach Egil Olsen.
	   Brazilian head coach Mario Zagallo is the only team member not
uttering the word ``revenge,'' although he readily admits his
players think of nothing else heading into Tuesday's final group
match in Marseille.
	   ``I know the players are still talking about that match and
they're bothered by Olsen's criticism,'' Zagallo said. ``I'm not
sure revenge is utmost on their minds, but as long as they've got
the will to win, that's fine with me.''
	   Shortly before the Cup began, Olsen stirred things up by saying
Brazil ``is not that good'' and could easily lose against two of
its group rivals. So far, Brazil beat Scotland 2-1 in the opener
and thrashed Morroco 3-0.
	   Brazil's Bebeto said the loss in Oslo was partly due to the
field's bad condition, jet lag and lack of motivation.
	   ``Everything's changed this time. We're in a World Cup, we're
well motivated and we'll show (Olsen) our true game,'' he said.
``The problems is that Olsen talked way too much after that win,
but the match that really matters is coming up.''
	   Defender Roberto Carlos thinks Olsen ``sparked the team by
criticizing Brazil, and now he'll have to face a team that's highly
motivated, in spite of having advanced.''
	   Olsen ``said many foolish things and now he'll have to eat his
words,'' said Robert Carlos, who plays for Real Madrid of Spain.

Belgian finance minister steps down to head party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian Finance Minister Philippe
Maystadt stepped down from his government post Friday to become the
president of the Parti Social Chretien, the country's
French-speaking Christian democrats.
	   An overwhelming majority of the PSC's members, 90.2 percent,
voted in favor of Maystadt's appointment.
	   The government appointed Jean-Jacques Viseur, a PSC
parliamentarian, as Maystadt's replacement at the finance ministry.
	   Maystadt was also his country's foreign trade minister and a
deputy-premier. Elio di Rupo, a member of the French-speaking
Socialist party, takes over the foreign trade portfolio, and
Defence Minister Jean-Paul Poncelet will take over Maystadt's job
as deputy-premier, on top of his own duties.
	   Maystadt has pledged to lead the PSC at least until next
spring's general election.
	   To do this, he also must relinquish the chairmanship of the
policy-making interim committee at the Washington-based
International Monetary Fund _ a post he has held since 1993.
	   Last month, Maystadt turned down an offer from European Uion
leaders to head the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
	   The most recent polls suggest the PSC would lose substantial
support if an election were held today, endangering the stability
of Belgium's coalition government between French and Dutch
Christian democrats and their Socialist counterparts.
	   Maystadt is credited with guiding Belgium out of financial
excess in the 1980s to its current status as one of 11 qualifying
nations for the launch of the single currency, the euro on Jan. 1,
1999.
	   Maystadt, who became finance minister in 1988, was the
longest-serving EU finance minister, and participated in the
Maastricht Treaty negotiations along with German counterpart Theo
Waigel.

ISU cracks down on unsanctioned events; allows use of video replays 
</HEADLINE>
By ED McCULLOUGH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The group that runs world figure
skating offered a carrot and a stick Friday to its champions who
want to compete in unsanctioned events mostly for the prize money.
	   The International Skating Union will develop revenue-producing
competitions open to professionals and amateurs alike, president
Ottavio Cinquanta said. But from now on, skaters who compete
outside the ISU will lose their eligibility for Olympic and world
championship medals.
	   ``The rules were already clear. Now they are more clear: No
reinstatement,'' Cinquanta told reporters at the end of the ISU's
biennial congress. The vote was ``almost unanimous,'' he added.
	   The ISU took action on several issues important to the sport,
including making video replays available to judges. The aim is to
help them review the short program and compulsory dances, and spot
or rule out errors, from all over the spacious rinks.
	   The arcane, often puzzling, scoring system was modified to
reduce the possibility that a late skater, possibly not even among
the top tier, nevertheless could juggle the final standings and
determine the winner. That happened at the 1996 European
championships.
	   ``This existed for 50 years. It will exist no more,'' Cinquanta
said. ``If you are in front of me, you remain in front of me,'' no
matter what lower-finishing skaters score.
	   Among other measures, the ISU ruled that drug testing will be
mandatory for recognition of new world records from now on.
	   Perhaps the most interesting proposal rejected would have
required skaters to present at least two different free programs
each season. The idea was to make performances more attractive to
TV audiences, which would pour more revenue to ISU coffers from
sale of broadcast rights.
	   ``I was defeated,'' Cinquanta, of Italy, said with a smile,
shortly after being re-elected to a second, four-year term. He
indicated he will bring it up again.
	   At the news conference, he focused on the issue of ISU champions
competing in outside events.
	   It's a sad reality, he said, that world champions at the peak of
their ability earn peanuts, while former champions _ arguably
producing inferior performances _ can earn millions from ice shows
and other commercial venues.
	   A potential danger to the ISU is that its champions captivate
global TV audiences with graceful flourishes or an athletic triple
axel _ and then quickly leave the sport to cash in their perhaps
fleeting celebrity.
	   ``We do understand that at a certain point in a skater's
career,'' money becomes more important, and resistance builds to
grueling workouts of five and six hours a day, Cinquanta said.
	   So apart from world championship, Olympic and Grand Prix events,
``We are preparing another corridor'' to keep ISU athletes in the
sport.
	   He declined to explain how or when the professional-amateur
competitions would take place.

Rafter wins twice to claim semifinal berth, Krajicek withdraws 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ No. 1 seed Patrick Rafter won two
matches Friday to advance to the semifinals of the rain-delayed
Heineken Trophy grass court tennis tournament.
	   The Australian, seeded No.6 at next week's Wimbledon, followed a
tough second round win over Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev 7-6 (7-2),
4-6, 7-6 (9-7), with an easy quarterfinal ride against Dutchman
Sjeng Schalken, 6-1, 6-4.
	   After rain all week and a total washout Thursday, organizers
scheduled two complete rounds of matches Friday to get this dlrs
500,000 ATP tourney back on track.
	   But the strain was too much for Richard Krajicek's left knee.
	   After a winning a lengthy struggle with Czech Slava Dosedel, 7-6
(7-3), 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, the Dutchman pulled out of his quarterfinal
against compatriot Dennis van Scheppingen without hitting a ball.
	   But Wimbledon will not be without its 1996 champion. Krajicek
has already left Rosmalen and intends to play.
	   The WTA women's final here Saturday will be contested by two
unseeded players, Dutchwoman Miriam Oremans and France's Julie
Halard.
	   Oremans, losing finalist here last year, played a marathon six
sets in the day, first ousting compatriot Kristie Boogert, 6-3,
2-6, 6-4, then downing American Kimberley Po, 6-1, 6-7 (7-1), 7-6
(7-2).
	   And Halard also proved her stamina, following a 7-6 (7-5), 6-7
(8-6), 6-3 win over Belgian Sabine Appelmans with a 6-3, 6-3 upset
of French No.2 seed Sandrine Testud.

World Cup: Passarella quiet about ``bothersome'' Jamaica 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ Jamaica would hardly seem to trouble
two-time World Cup champion and perennial South American power
Argentina. Yet coach Argentine coach Daniel Passarella is almost
treating Sunday's match as if it were the final.
	   Passarella is not saying much about how his team plans to play
the Caribbean islanders, who play in Group H along with fellow Cup
debutantes Croatia and Japan. Argentina leads the group with three
points from its 1-0 victory over Japan, and another win against
underdog Jamaica would put it in the second round.
	   Croatia, a 3-1 winner over Jamaica, plays Japan on Saturday in
Nantes.
	   ``I don't want to give anything away, not a centimeter,'' said
Passarella, refusing to announce even one of the starters. ``The
lineup is ready but I won't say who's in it.''
	   But in recent intrasquad scimmages, Passarella's ``A'' squad was
basically the same he fielded against Japan, with striker Gabriel
Batistuta leading the attack.
	   ``Nobody wants to give anything away, and that includes us,''
said Passarella, who's been deliberately vague with his answers to
questions about strategy or the players he'll field in Paris' Parc
de Princes. ``Last week, Japan's coach announced his lineup only 20
minutes before the match.''
	   As for Jamaica, Passarella said it will be ``a bothersome rival.
They'll come at us with everything they've got because they're
forced to win.''
	   Still, he's not fully pleased with his team's performance.
	   ``Now we have to be fully committed to establishing our own
brand of soccer,'' he said.

Swiss banks' dlrs 600 million settlement offer meets angry response Center.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An offer by Switzerland's three
biggest commercial banks of dlrs 600 million to settle claims by
Holocaust victims brought an angry response Friday from Jewish
representatives in the negotiations.
	   ``My 31,000 clients will not stand for this,'' said Edward
Fagan, attorney for a class-action claim in New York for money
allegedly stolen from dormant accounts opened before the end of
World War II.
	   The announcement by Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union
Bank of Switzerland marked the first time the banks have specified
a figure for a possible settlement. The dlrs 600 million, they
said, would include dlrs 70 million already paid into a fund to
help needy Holocaust survivors.
	   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' the banks
said in their joint statement. The banks said they ``would not
entertain unfounded and excessive payments above this amount.''
	   Jewish groups, which have estimated the banks still hold
billions of dollars in dormant wartime accounts, were outraged.
	   The co-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization
called the offer ``very humiliating.''
	   ``Our people were killed because we were perceived and accused
of being the rich man of Europe,'' Avraham Burg told APTV in
Jerusalem.
	   The New York-based group tries to ensure that property and money
lost or looted during World War II is returned to Jews.
	   Swiss banks, meanwhile, prospered ``from all this money and gave
back very little from what they took and looted from our brothers
and sisters and other Holocaust victims,'' Burg said.
	   The Los Angeles-based Simon Weisenthal Center also called the
offer unacceptable, saying a study by the banks showed that more
than dlrs 442 million in assets had been plundered _ or more than
dlrs 4 billion in today's money.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA victims 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with KLA statement, reports of clashes, three more
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fearful that Serbian forces are
readying new attacks in Kosovo despite Western demands that they
withdraw, the top ethnic Albanian leader in the province appealed
Friday for direct NATO intervention.
	   ``NATO should undertake all possible measures to prevent further
massacres and protect the people of Kosovo,'' Ibrahim Rugova said
at a news conference in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Ignoring NATO's show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have been reinforcing their army and
special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated by NATO sources at
45,000 to 50,000.
	   Serbian forces have sealed the border with Albania _ cutting off
an escape route for refugees _ while reportedly continuing to
attack border villages they claim are havens for the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Convoys of armored vehicles have also been seen taking positions
along a main north-south artery between Pristina and Prizren, near
the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the militants may be
hoping to cut it, as it did the main east-west highway to Pec,
further hampering the ability of Serb forces to move through the
province.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, close to
Rugova, said Serb forces attacked Friday five villages near the
border with Albania and four along the road south of Pristina. The
same source reported three more victims in western Kosovo, bringing
the number of killed there in the past month to 66.
	   Meanwhile, the KLA warned in a statement Friday their attacks
against ``the enemy'' will continue, and announced the possibility
of a general mobilization in Kosovo. The group said two of their
fighters have been killed and stated it held five prisoners.
	   In an apparent criticism of Rugova, the militants also called on
political parties to join them and drop ``deceiving policies.''
	   The militants also warned the international community to ``move
on from words to deeds'' in pressuring Milosevic.

World Cup: Nigeria into second round with 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria clearly saved its best play for the World
Cup and again is headed to the second round.
	   Victor Ikpeba closed a swift three-man combination in the 27th
minute Friday as Nigeria, which looked so out of synch in France
'98 tuneup games, used its superior speed and surprising ball
control to outlast Bulgaria 1-0 and stay atop Group D.
	   Adding to its 3-2 victory over Spain, Nigeria has six points and
can finish no worse than second in the group. Bulgaria, a
semifinalist in 1994, has one point and a remaining game against
Spain.
	   Under 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat at the Parc des
Princes, the Africans pushed from the opening kickoff and had more
dangerous chances.
	   Bulgaria played a slower and more deliberate pace, which
Nigeria, known more for its flair than organization, managed to
handle better than it usually does.
	   ``Bulgaria played a frustrating, irritating game,'' midfielder
Sunday Oliseh said. ``We were running; they were waiting.''
	   The Europeans started seven players 29 years of age or older,
compared to just two for Nigeria.
	   ``The first thing is to be in the next round. It was a difficult
game for us,'' Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said. ``I was happy
with the first half, but then we had to be careful not to push up
too far in the second half.''
	   He is the first coach to lead four teams to the second round at
the World Cup, after Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990 and the
United States in 1994.
	   The Yugoslavian native's job was reportedly in jeopardy, though,
after Nigeria dropped World Cup tuneups to Germany, Yugoslavia and
Netherlands by a combined 9-1.
	   On Friday, Nigeria's superior speed began to pay off midway
through the first half as its players repeatedly turned defenders
and broke into open spaces.
	   The goal came off a lightning-quick exchange.
	   Left back Celestine Babayaro brought the ball up the left flank
and slid it to Jay-Jay Okocha, who found Daniel Amokachi at the top
right corner of the penalty area. Amokachi deftly side-footed the
ball to Ikpeba in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco striker, Africa's 1997 Player of the Year, eluded
sweeper Trifon Ivanov, who fell, and rolled the ball just under
keeper Zdravko Zdravkov's right arm for his second goal in the
green-and-white and first in the World Cup.
	   ``We attack because that is the style that fits Nigeria best.
Bora has come to understand this,'' Ikpeba said, ``and to try to
change us at this time would not be wise.''
	   Nigeria's defense, its acknowledged weak point, was far from
perfect. Goalkeeper Peter Rufai and his backs got crossed up often,
but Bulgaria _ which lost 3-0 to Nigeria in the 1994 tournament _
never was able to convert.
	   ``I think that we were the better team on the day. Tactically,
too, we were better,'' Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev said. ``We
stopped Nigeria from playing the game they wanted to play. We had
chances but were not able to put them away.''
	   Winger Emil Kostadinov nearly tied the score with three minutes
remaining, but his shot skimmed off the crossbar.
	   Krassimir Balakov had produced a strong threat in the 42nd,
splitting two defenders with a header and then sending a lob over
midfielder Mutiu Adepoju and a charging Rufai, but the ball bounced
just wide of the empty net.
	   Then Hristo Stoichkov, who shared the scoring title at the last
World Cup for Bulgaria, pushed the ball wide right of the post in
the 66th and dropped to the ground in frustration.
	   ``It is not that we can be, we will be punished'' later in the
tourney for similarly poor defense, Oliseh said.
	   Nwankwo Kanu, 19 months removed from heart surgery to replace a
weak aortic valve, made his tournament debut in the 67th minute,
coming on for Amokachi. The Inter Milan striker nearly scored with
his first touch, but the left-footed blast from the box was fisted
over the crossbar by Zdravkov and Nigeria missed other chances to
put the game away late.
	   ``For people who like the spectacular, we make it spectacular,''
Milutinovic said.
	   Nigeria lost captain Uche Ukechukwu for its last group game,
against Paraguay. The defender was shown a yellow card, his second
of the tournament, in the 43rd.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Team captain Alan Shearer, co-striker
Terry Sheringham and center-back Tony Adams and were taken off
England's casualty list Friday. But there was still a question mark
about Gary Southgate's chances of playing against Romania in
Monday's World Cup match in Toulouse.
	   ``We've only got one injury and that's Gareth, but he has
improved quite considerably and everyone else has trained today,''
head coach Glenn Hoddle said.
	   Southgate, who helped England defeat Tunisia 2-0 in last
Monday's opening Group G clash in Marseille, suffered a
re-occurence of an old ankle injury during training Tuesday.

Avraham Burg lashes out at Swiss banks settlement offer 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leading representative of Holocaust victims
in their battle against the Swiss banks lashed out at the Swiss
banking establishment Friday, calling their dlrs 600 million
settlement offer a ``humiliation.''
	   Avraham Burg, co-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization said in an interview with the Associated Press that
the organization would continue its fight for more money.
	   ``The Swiss banks, at least those who are negotiating with us,
are a shame to the Swiss nation... They negotiate as closed fisted
bankers and not as humanists,'' said Burg.
	   The organization Burg chairs represents Holocaust victims and
their survivors in negotiations with three Swiss banks _ Union Bank
of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp and Credit Suisse. The negotiations
take place under the auspices of U.S. Undersecretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat.
	   Burg, who is also head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency,
which deals with relations between Israel and World Jewry, was the
first to call attention to the Nazi loot and Holocaust victims'
accounts sitting unclaimed in Swiss banks three years ago.
	   In March, it was agreed that a fund would be set up to pay off
claims linked to dormant bank accounts, slave labor and looted art
works. But, while Jewish groups have put the figure in the
billions, the amount of that fund has yet to be determined. This is
the first time the banks have named a figure for a possible
settlement.
	   ``There is no fortune in the world that can buy the
acknowledgment we deserve, but some fortunes can buy better time
for the later years of the Holocaust survivors,'' said Burg, who
called the offer a ``humiliating and cheap opening bargaining
position.''
	   ``In June 1995 the banks said `not a dime' then in September
1995 they said dlrs 52 million, and now this...and I say this is
just the beginning,'' said Burg.
	   He added that in the past year figures which were brought up in
informal negotiations between the banks and the organization were
``five or six times higher than the offer just presented.''
	   ``How do we compensate those who have seen hell in their
youth?'' asked Burg. ``The expectation now in the world is for real
compensation... not this.''
	   Burg said that once the class action suit against the three
banks was settled, he would push for the filing of claims against
Swiss banks throughout the world.

Kosovo leader calls for NATO help, admits no control over KLA victims

Eds: UPDATES with KLA statement, reports of clashes, three more
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fearful that Serbian forces are
readying new attacks in Kosovo despite Western demands that they
withdraw, the top ethnic Albanian leader in the province appealed
Friday for direct NATO intervention.
	   ``NATO should undertake all possible measures to prevent further
massacres and protect the people of Kosovo,'' Ibrahim Rugova said
at a news conference in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Ignoring NATO's show of force around Serbia's southern province
on Monday, Serbian leaders have been reinforcing their army and
special police forces in Kosovo _ estimated by NATO sources at
45,000 to 50,000.
	   Serbian forces have sealed the border with Albania _ cutting off
an escape route for refugees _ while reportedly continuing to
attack border villages they claim are havens for the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Convoys of armored vehicles have also been seen taking positions
along a main north-south artery between Pristina and Prizren, near
the border with Macedonia.
	   Recent skirmishes along the road indicate the militants may be
hoping to cut it, as it did the main east-west highway to Pec,
further hampering the ability of Serb forces to move through the
province.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, close to
Rugova, said Serb forces attacked Friday five villages near the
border with Albania and four along the road south of Pristina. The
same source reported three more victims in western Kosovo, bringing
the number of killed there in the past month to 66.
	   Meanwhile, the KLA warned in a statement Friday their attacks
against ``the enemy'' will continue, and announced the possibility
of a general mobilization in Kosovo. The group said two of their
fighters have been killed and stated it held five prisoners.
	   In an apparent criticism of Rugova, the militants also called on
political parties to join them and drop ``deceiving policies.''
	   The militants also warned the international community to ``move
on from words to deeds'' in pressuring Milosevic.
	   Serbian forces have, 4th graf pvs.

Suriname agrees to allow U.S. Coast Guard to pursue suspects in its waters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ This South American country has
signed an agreement to allow U.S. forces to pursue smuggling
suspects into Suriname's territorial waters.
	   The United States has reached similar agreements with other
Caribbean countries in an effort to strengthen its drug
interdiction efforts, but Suriname was reluctant to sign the accord
for fear it would infringe upon its sovereignty.
	   Other Caribbean countries have criticized the United States for
pressing for the so-called ``shiprider'' agreements while ignoring
the other problems of the region's small nations, including the
economic conditions that encourage smuggling.
	   In addition to drug smuggling, Suriname has experienced problems
with piracy in its waters. Pirates in speedboats have robbed
fishing boats of their catch and money and some fishermen have been
seriously wounded.

Nigeria joins Brazil, France in second round; suspensions follow red card rush UPDATED after Spain-Paraguay. AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW with Nigeria victory, suspensions; Changes byline; WILL be
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Nigeria joined defending
titlist Brazil and host France in the second round of the World Cup
on Friday.
	   A 1-0 triumph over Bulgaria at the Parc des Princes made it two
victories in as many games for the Nigerians, who underlined their
emergence as the biggest soccer power to come out of Africa.
	   Victor Ikpeba netted the only goal in the 27th minute as Nigeria
followed up its come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Spain with
another impressive victory.
	   The Nigerian performance came as coaches and players still were
debating the significance of Red Card Day _ Thursday's rush of five
red cards in two games in apparent response to criticism of the
referees by FIFA president Sepp Blatter and World Cup organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   FIFA suspended South African midfielder Alfred Phiri for three
matches, French star Zinedine Zidane and Danish striker Miklos
Molnar for two games each after Thursday's expulsions.
	   Denmark's Morten Wieghorst, sent off only three minutes after
entering the game as substitute, and Saudi Arabia's Mohammed al
Khilaiwi were banned for one game each.
	   While South African coach Philippe Troussier described the
three-game ban on Phiri as ``a bit harsh'', others were a little
alarmed how the championship appeared to have changed.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle noted how four red cards in 20 games
and eight days suddenly had switched to five in two games on one
day, immediately after Blatter and Platini had said the referees
were being too lenient.
	   ``I thought the balance was quite good in the first games, but
it has changed very quickly,'' Hoddle said Friday, three days
before his England team faces Romania at Toulouse.
	   ``We went into the tournament believing the first five days
(before England played) would give us a chance to see to see what
was going to happen, how the referees were going to interpret the
laws,'' Hoddle said.
	   ``But now it's almost as if we are starting out again and
certainly we learned a lot from yesterday's performances.''
	   Danish defender Marc Rieper criticized the comments from Blatter
and Platini.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' he said. ``Referees
have been very good so far and it is a very stupid comment that he
(Blatter) has made. I don't know if he is trying to ruin the
tournament that he made himself, and kill the football game.''
	   Zidane, an influential forward who will miss France's third
Group C game as well as its match in the second round, said he
believed the Mexican referee who sent him off, Arturo Brizio,
minterpreted his challenge on Saudi captain Fuad Amin as a
deliberate stamping.
	   ``I didn't deserve this,'' the Juventus forward said. ``I did
not mean to hurt the man. I just fell on him.''
	   The World Cup ticket scandal rumbled on Friday while the city of
Marseille was bracing itself for a repeat of the street violence
that married Monday's England-Tunisia game.
	   World Cup organizers have launched an investigation into the
theft of 15,000 tickets from the Paris office of U.S. distributor
Prime Sports International.
	   PSI listed an undetermined number of tickets for Thursday
night's France-Saudi Arabia match among those stolen. But a check
at the Stade de France found the seats occupied by spectators, said
World Cup organizers spokesman Bruno Travade.
	   He said the World Cup organizing committee, the CFO, was still
waiting, after two requests, for PSI to supply the names of the
original purchasers of the tickets that were later stolen.
	   Bar owners in Marseille's Old Port watched nervously as
orange-clad Dutch fans began arriving at their sidewalk terraces,
where last weekend riots erupted between England and Tunisia
supporters.
	   The Netherlands, whose clubs are notorious for their violent
followers, takes on South Korea Saturday at the Stade Velodrome in
the first match in Marseille since rioting by English fans led to
80 arrests and 50 injuries between Saturday and Monday.
	   ``I am just waiting,'' bar owner Olivier Ganteaume said. ``The
English fans broke tables and chairs here; they ran off without
paying for their drinks. I have another bar on the other side of
the port where they smashed windows and chairs.''

Guatemala veterans claim rebel atrocities in civil war 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Veterans of Guatemala's military, long
blamed for brutality during a 36-year civil war, presented a report
Friday accusing their former foes of wartime atrocities.
	   ``We also have the right to the truth,'' said retired Gen. Jose
Luis Quilo Ayuso as the Association of Guatemalan Military Veterans
presented a thick report to the Commission for Historical
Clarification.
	   The commission was established after a December 1996 peace
treaty between the government and leftist rebels. Some 200,000
people, mostly civilians, died in the conflict or are missing.
	   Quilo said the report recounts ``acts attributed to the
guerrillas, which include more than 7,000 murders.''
	   Human rights groups have blamed the military for most of the
killings and human rights violations, particularly during a
scorched-earth campaign in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
	   The army was heavily criticized in a 1,440-page report by the
Roman Catholic Church human rights office in late April. Bishop
Juan Gerardi, who oversaw that investigation, was murdered two days
after presenting the report.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels kidnapped a former member
of the Palestinian parliament-in-exile and longtime PLO spokesman
in Colombia nearly two months ago in a case kept quiet by
authorities, a government source said Friday.
	   Members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
kidnapped Jaime Salem on April 25 in a southern Bogota
neighborhood, said a government official familiar with the case who
spoke on condition that he not be further identified.
	   Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group, the FARC frequently
uses kidnapping as a revenue source and favors foreigners because
they tend to fetch higher ransoms.
	   Salem's family was negotiating with the FARC, which demanded a
ransom, and that Palestinian Ambassador Sabri Ateyeh traveled to
the Middle East for consultations on the issue with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, the official said.
	   Salem, a Colombian citizen, was a member of the Palestine
National Council until 1994 and chief spokesman for years in
Colombia for the PLO, the official said.
	   ``The Arab community here is very worried about this case,''
said the source.
	   Salem had a shop in Bogota, he said.
	   No other details were immediately available.

Rand drops, stocks tumble and interest rates rise 
</HEADLINE>
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The rand dropped more than 3
percent over the past week, punctuating a period of financial
uncertainty that saw stocks tumble and interest rates spike on
Friday.
	   At market's close on Friday, the rand stood at 5.48 to the
dollar, down from 5.30 a week ago.
	   Combined with a demand-induced 3.38 percent prime interest rate
hike, the dropping rand value fed a poor investment climate that
saw the All Share Index slump by 1.8 percent, or 123.40 points.
	   The interest rate's jump to 20.38 percent came after the Reserve
Bank allowed the rate to float. The size of the jump surprised
financial analysts, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   One bank followed suit by increasing its interest rates, and
others were expected to follow.
	   Mortgage rates would jump, requiring a homeowner to earn an
additional 624 rand (dlrs 114) a month to qualify for a 100,000
rand (dlrs 18,000) bond, the National Home Builders' Registration
Council said on Friday.
	   ``Naturally, very few people will now be able to afford their
new home,'' the council's managing director, Peter Allsopp, said.
	   South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said the higher
rate would be harmful for the country's anemic growth but wouldn't
push the economy into a recession.
	   ``Part of our policy is that we shouldn't allow it to be too
easy for capital outflows, and that's why the Reserve Bank will
adjust its (prime rate) allotment to prevent unnecessary liquidity
in the market,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview with Dow
Jones.
	   Starting in May, heavy selling in the bond market by overseas
investors and speculative raids sent the rand tumbling _ a total of
5.8 percent in the past month.
	   Initially, the Reserve Bank attributed the rand's weakness on
the crisis in a number of East Asian economies and adopted a policy
of selling dollars and raising interest rates to defend the rand.
	   Over the past week, however, the bank stopped propping up the
rand and reintroduced the floating rate system.
	   Stals said the bank would continue a long-term policy of trying
to restore order in the currency market.
	   ``We have to let the rand settle where it will,'' he was quoted
as saying. ``The Reserve Bank can only lean against the wind from
time to time.''
	   The financial woes have weakened hopes for 2 percent economic
growth this year.

World Cup: South Africans shaking their heads over strange match grafs 8-10 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Phiri suspension, reaction; Mark Fish quote in
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ A day after the strangest match so far of
the World Cup, South African players could only shake their heads
when thinking about the 1-1 draw with Denmark that kept alive their
hopes to advance to the second round.
	   The most perplexed was midfielder Quinton Fortune, whose
last-minute rocket from outside the penalty area hit the crossbar,
denying Bafana Bafana their first World Cup victory.
	   ``It was so close,'' Fortune said Friday as he headed for a
jacuzzi after South Africa's 90-minute training session.
	   Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel appeared to get a hand on the
shot to make sure it didn't dip below the bar, according to
Fortune, who plays for Atletico Madrid.
	   ``I watched it over and over (on videotape) and it looked like
he touched it,'' he said of the 1.91-meter (6-foot-3) Manchester
United keeper. ``He's such a great goalie.''
	   Others were still puzzled by the decisions of Colombian referee
John Jairo Toro, who issued three red cards in the second half.
Toro sent off two Dutchmen and one South African to plunge the
match into disarray and evoke a torrent of jeers from the crowd at
Stade Municipal in Toulouse.
	   FIFA officials in Paris acknowledged Friday the three red cards
and seven yellow cards may have been an over-reaction to comments
earlier in the week by FIFA president Sepp Blatter that referees
had been too lenient.
	   But FIFA's disciplinary committee later suspended South African
substitute Alfred Phiri for three games for his red card offense,
an elbow to Danish defender Thomas Helveg during a battle for the
ball.
	   South African coach Philippe Troussier called the suspension
harsh, while defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers said the
referee's calls were inappropriate.
	   ``The record books will show three send-offs and seven yellow
cards were given in this match and this would reflect a rough game,
but that is not the case as it was not a dirty game at all,'' Fish
said.
	   The draw was an improvement for South Africa after its 3-0 loss
to France in its World Cup debut last week. It left Bafana Bafana
with one point in Group C and a mathematical chance of advancing to
the second round.
	   France has two victories and six points after beating Saudi
Arabia 4-0 on Thursday night, while Denmark has four points from
its earlier 1-0 victory over the Saudis and its draw with South
Africa.
	   With the first two teams in each group advancing, South Africa
must beat Saudi Arabia and France must defeat Denmark next week for
Bafana Bafana to tie the Danes on points. Then it comes down to
goal differential, with Denmark holding a plus-one compared to
South Africa's minus-three.
	   Troussier outlined one scenario for South Africa to advance _
identical 2-0 victories for South Africa over the Saudis and France
over Denmark on Wednesday.
	   Fortune was still thinking about how different things would be
if his shot was just a few centimeters (inches) lower.
	   ``It would have meant victory. South Africa would be
celebrating,'' he said, shaking his head.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi threats to stop oil sales,
the Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow Baghdad to
spend dlrs 300 million of oil-for-food revenues to buy spare parts
for its oil industry to meet increased export targets.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad ``is not
going to accept this resolution,'' saying it could trigger the
``collapse of the whole (oil-for-food) program.''
	   But Hamdoon did not repeat his threat, made last Monday, to
cancel the program immediately and cease oil exports if the
resolution were approved.
	   Iraq has argued the resolution effectively transforms
oil-for-food into an ongoing program as long as economic sanctions
against Baghdad remain in effect.
	   Although the resolution allows Iraq to buy much-needed spare
parts, it also reduces the political leverage Baghdad has used in
its campaign to force the council to lift sanctions.
	   Under the system in effect since the program began in December
1996, Iraq would submit a plan for distributing food and medicine
purchased with oil revenues every six months each time the program
was renewed.
	   With approval of the latest resolution, if Iraq submits no plan,
the previous one remains in force.
	   Iraq had in the past held up submitting the plan and suspended
oil sales as part of an overall strategy to whittle away at support
for the sanctions.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the resolution ensures no
further gaps in Iraqi oil sales.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council allowed Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to
buy food, medicine and humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months, but the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In a letter to the council this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf expressed opposition to the resolution. He
said Iraq ``strongly'' wants the current phase of the plan, which
expires in November, to be the last and that the eight-year
sanctions should be ended.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in March that the
council let Iraq buy the parts with revenues from oil-for-food
sales to boost capacity to meet the new U.N.-authorized export
ceiling.
	   The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan,
planned to leave for Baghdad late Friday to spend two weeks in Iraq
studying the condition of Iraq's oil industry.
	   But U.N. officials say low oil prices make it unlikely that Iraq
will benefit from the increased ceiling, regardless of the spare
parts.
	   If Iraq can pump 1.6 million barrels a day at a price of dlrs 10
a barrel, it would earn only dlrs 2.88 billion over six months _
well below the dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling.
	   One-third of the dlrs 2.88 billion would have to go to war
victims and U.N. expenses.
	   Industry experts say Iraq could raise its daily output to 1.8
million or 1.9 million barrels if the spare parts are delivered.
That would still make little difference without a sharp rise in
world oil prices, analysts say.

World Cup: FIFA suspends five players for Thursday's red cards style on Toro, Amin's first name. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Troussier comment on Phiri suspension; CORRECTS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Africa's Alfred Phiri was banned for three
games and French star Zinedine Zidane and Denmark's Miklos Molnar
for two each Friday as FIFA followed up ``Red Card Day'' with
suspensions.
	   Five players were ordered off in two games Thursday as South
Africa drew 1-1 with Denmark and France crushed Saudi Arabia 4-0.
	   The flurry of red cards followed complaints by new FIFA
president Sepp Blatter that referees weren't doing their job
properly after only four red cards in the first 20 games.
	   Phiri got a three-match suspension for elbowing aside Thomas
Helves, FIFA ruling it ``very dangerous play.'' Although South
Africa coach Philippe Troussier called the sanction ``a bit
harsh'', the Vatanspor midfielder will miss South Africa's match
against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and any second-round and
quarterfinal matches, should the Bafana Bafana advance.
	   In that same match two Danes got red cards as well from
Colombian referee John Jairo Toro. Substitute Molnar was sent off
in the 67th minute after knocking over South African captain Lucas
Radebe. The red card earned him a two-match suspension and Molnar
will miss Wednesday's France-Denmark and a second round match if
the Danes get that far.
	   The Danes also will have to miss another Danish substitute,
Morten Wieghorst, who got a red card three minutes after entering
the game for bumping Benni McCarthy from behind and knocking him
down. Wieghorst received only the standard a one-match suspension
for his ejection.
	   In the France-Saudi game also on Thursday two players were shown
red. Zidane was suspended for two matches for ``violence against
another player'' after putting his foot into Saudi captain Fuad
Amin's side, which Mexican referee Arturo Brizio interpreted it as
stamping. Zidane will miss Wednesday's France-Denmark game and
France's first second round match.
	   Saudi Arabia's Mohammed al-Khilaiwi will miss his team's game
against South-Africa. He got a one match suspension for ``very
dangerous play'' hauling down Bixente Lizarazu in full flight after
only 19 minutes.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A day after six Russian peacekeepers
were injured in a mine blast in breakaway Abkhazia, the Russian
Defense Ministry on Friday ordered the force to start using weapons
if the troops' safety is threatened.
	   The peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier struck a road mine
in the Ghali district, the site of recent fighting between
Abkhazian separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's
central government.
	   ``This is already the fifth case of illegal terrorist or
diversionary acts against the peacekeepers or the United Nations
observers,'' said a statement by the peacekeepers' press service,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, despite repeated protests by the peacekeepers'
command, the Georgian and Abkhazian sides are not taking the
necessary measures for ensuring the normal functioning of the
peacekeeping force in the region,'' the statement said.
	   While allowing the peacekeepers to use weapons would not have
prevented the mine blast, Interfax said the Defense Ministry cited
the incident as grounds for its orders to use weapons in case of a
``real threat.''
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since then, despite the
Russian peacekeepers' presence.
	   Meanwhile, Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, held talks with Georgian and
Abkhazian leaders in an effort to jumpstart peace efforts.
	   He visited the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi and met with Abkhazian
leader Vladislav Ardzinba, before traveling to the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, and conferring with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
	   Berezovsky said ``undeniable progress'' was made, but announced
no concrete agreements, according to the Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Malta could be facing an election nearly
two years after the socialists took power in the Mediterranean
island nation.
	   A dispute over a marina development threatens the Labor Party
government of Prime Minister Alfred Sant. Parliament was expected
to vote on the project, on which Sant has staked his government,
but when was unclear. After debate Friday night, the legislature
adjourned until Saturday.
	   The Labor Party has maintained ties in the past with Libya, and
has sought to distance Malta from the European Union.
	   Sant's government backs the marina. Former Labor leader Dominic
Mintoff opposes the project, saying it would deny public access.
	   The Labor Party has a one-seat majority in Parliament over the
Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami.
If Mintoff breaks ranks and the measure fails, Sant has said he
will call new elections.
	   The Labor government has been under pressure, with two recent
ministerial resignations and recent defeats in Parliament.
	   The proposed port, a 6 million pound (dlrs 21 million) project,
falls in the Cottonera waterfront area on the island's southern
shore and within the district represented by the 81-year-old
Mintoff since World War II.
	   Officials here have said an American company, Abonmarche of
Dearborn, Michigan, is involved in the project.

Grains, soybeans rise sharply on hot weather worries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices soared Friday to
their highest level in weeks on the Chicago Board of Trade on fears
hot, dry weather settling over the Midwest would hurt crop yields.
	   The National Weather Service on Friday predicted that
temperatures will rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees
Celsius) next week in some Midwestern regions _ that could affect
the corn crop as it goes through the crucial pollination period.
	   Hot, dry weather normally would be good for corn, soybean and
spring wheat growth, but persistent rains this spring may have left
the crops with only shallow root systems that would be unable to
reach water farther down in the ground.
	   That could sharply reduce yields for what is expected to be a
record soybean crop and the second-largest corn crop in recorded
history.
	   Already, some investors believe the heavy rains early in the
growing season, which is forcing some farmers to replant crops,
have reduced yields. The U.S. Agriculture Department last week also
reported declining crop conditions, although it has yet to lower
estimates for production.
	   The warm weather helped market participants shrug off the
National Weather Service's prediction that temperatures in July and
August will be normal to below-normal, while precipitation is
expected to be above-normal. Investors said such long-range
forecasts are notoriously unreliable.
	   Wheat for July delivery rose 4 1-4 cents to dlrs 2.88 a bushel;
July corn rose 8 cents to dlrs 2.53 1-2 a bushel; July oats rose 1
3-4 cents to dlrs 1.22 1-2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 23 1-4
cents to dlrs 6.22 1-4 a bushel. Prices reached their highest since
mid-May.

World Cup: Spain, Paraguay 0-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert made
a stunning, one-handed save and defender Celso Ayala cleared the
rebound off Juan Pizzi's toe as Spain was held to 0-0 by Paraguay
at halftime of Friday's World Cup game.
	   Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez wriggled clear of the defense and
shot from eight meters only for Chilevert to dive to his right to
got his hand to the ball. Pizzi ran in to try and force the ball
home but Ayala got in a tackle to sweep the ball away.
	   The near misses in the final minute of the half was the best
action of the opening 45 minutes of the Group D game, which
followed Nigeria's 1-0 victory over Bulgaria at Parc des Princes.
	   Spanish coach Javier Clemente made five changes after the 3-2
loss to Nigeria when his team twice lost the lead.
	   A chance fell to Spanish striker Juan Pizzi in the 21st minute
when the Paraguayan defense failed to clear a cross. The striker
headed powerfully goalwards from 12 meters by 'keeper Jose Luis
Chilavert punched the ball acrobatically behind for a corner.
	   After Zubizarreta had punched away a powerfully-struck 25-meter
shot from Benitez, Paraguay won a free kick 30 meters out and
'keeper Chilavert, who has scored three times for his country,
moved up to take a shot at goal.
	   His well-hit free kick hit the defensive wall and deflected to
Francisco Arce whose 12-meter shot was deflected for a corner.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta; Rafael Alkorta, Abelardo Fernandez,
Sergi Barjuan, Carlos Aguilera; Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Hierro,
Guillermo Amor, Luis Enrique Martinez, Joseba Exteberria; Juan
Pizzi.
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking bank workers stormed a
shareholders' meeting Friday to force the cancellation of a vote on
the sale of Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the meeting could begin. Protesters
ripped at the clothes of the bank's governor, Haris Stamatopoulos.
	   The bank's management had refused to discuss worker demands for
job and pension guarantees at the meeting.
	   The shareholders and management reconvened late Friday and were
expected to approve the sale.
	   The efforts to sell Ionian Bank is an important test of the
Socialist government's resolve to reform the banking sector and
bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   Failure to sell the bank or making major concessions to strikers
could be considered a major blow to the government of Premier
Costas Simitis.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank.
	   An Athens court called for an immediate investigation into the
disruption, asking for video footage from television channels
covering the events in order to identify the troublemakers.
	   A prosecutor ordered the violent protesters to be arrested and
brought court within 24 hours, where they will face charges of
illegal violence and damaging property.
	   Meanwhile, a court Friday issued additional rulings deeming the
strike illegal. Ionian union officials will be liable for fines of
500,000 drachmas (dlrs 1,650) for each additional strike day, the
court ruled.
	   Workers have not heeded three previous court decisions banning
the strike.
	   Shares at the Athens Stock Exchange, which had opened higher on
upbeat expectations about the sale's approval, slipped after the
clashes broke out.

Security Council reaches tentative agreement on Iraqi spare parts deal threats; EDITS throughout to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Iraqi comment, raises reference to Iraq
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi threats to stop oil sales,
the Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow Baghdad to
spend dlrs 300 million of oil-for-food revenues to buy spare parts
for its oil industry to meet increased export targets.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad ``is not
going to accept this resolution,'' saying it could trigger the
``collapse of the whole (oil-for-food) program.''
	   But Hamdoon did not repeat his threat, made last Monday, to
cancel the program immediately and cease oil exports if the
resolution were approved.
	   Iraq has argued the resolution effectively transforms
oil-for-food into an ongoing program as long as economic sanctions
against Baghdad remain in effect.
	   Although the resolution allows Iraq to buy much-needed spare
parts, it also reduces the political leverage Baghdad has used in
its campaign to force the council to lift sanctions.
	   Under the system in effect since the program began in December
1996, Iraq would submit a plan for distributing food and medicine
purchased with oil revenues every six months each time the program
was renewed.
	   With approval of the latest resolution, if Iraq submits no plan,
the previous one remains in force.
	   Iraq had in the past held up submitting the plan and suspended
oil sales as part of an overall strategy to whittle away support
for the sanctions.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the resolution ensures no
further gaps in Iraqi oil sales.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council allowed Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to
buy food, medicine and humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months, but the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In a letter to the council this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf expressed opposition to the resolution. He
said Iraq ``strongly'' wants the current phase of the plan, which
expires in November, to be the last and that the eight-year
sanctions should be ended.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in March that the
council let Iraq buy the parts with revenues from oil-for-food
sales to boost capacity to meet the new U.N.-authorized export
ceiling.
	   The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan,
planned to leave for Baghdad late Friday to spend two weeks in Iraq
studying the condition of Iraq's oil industry.
	   But U.N. officials say low oil prices make it unlikely that Iraq
will benefit from the increased ceiling, regardless of the spare
parts.
	   If Iraq can pump 1.6 million barrels a day at a price of dlrs 10
a barrel, it would earn only dlrs 2.88 billion over six months _
well below the dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling.
	   One-third of the dlrs 2.88 billion would have to go to war
victims and U.N. expenses.
	   Industry experts say Iraq could raise its daily output to 1.8
million or 1.9 million barrels if the spare parts are delivered.
That would still make little difference without a sharp rise in
world oil prices, analysts say.

World Cup: Bergkamp returns, Kluivert out as Dutch take on South Korea lineup; RECASTS lead to reflect starting lineup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Hiddink announcing his starting
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Without Patrick Kluivert, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink
is scrambling.
	   A two-game suspension to the AC Milan striker, the result of his
elbow to Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens, is causing Hiddink to
juggle his starting 11.
	   ``The change was forced on me by Patrick Kluivert's absence,''
Hiddink said Friday after his team trained at Marseille's Stade
Velodrome stadium.
	   Kluivert will miss the Netherlands' Saturday match against South
Korea, the first of his two-game ban.
	   It means Arsenal forward Dennis Bergkamp, who has been sidelined
for six weeks with a hamstring injury and only came in midway
through the second half of the 0-0 draw with Belgium, will get to
start and Phillip Cocu will move from midfield to the front.
	   Cocu's shift to the striking role means a place in the starting
lineup for Edgar Davids, giving him his first start for the Oranje
in a competitive match since being sent home from Euro '96 for
insulting Hiddink.
	   Wim Jonk, an 80th-minute substitute against Belgium, also will
move from the bench to the field to provide long, accurate passes
intended to run the speedy South Koreans ragged, Hiddink said.
	   As expected, Nottingham Forest striker Pierre van Hooijdonk will
start on the bench and will likely be brought on late as the
well-organized, defensive-minded Koreans tire.
	   ``The Koreans have a very high work rate, but they get tired
late in games. That is the time to send in a new weapon,'' Hiddink
said in a reference to Van Hooijdonk, who the Dutch use as a late
``super sub'' to take advantage of fatigued defenses.
	   The Koreans have not won a World Cup finals mat in 11 attempts,
and coach Cha Bum-kun isn't holding out much hope of breaking the
dubious streak in Marseille's Stade Velodrome.
	   ``Our chances now are very, very slim,'' Cha said. ``I expect a
draw with Holland. There is little pressure on my team. Nobody is
expecting much.''
	   Mexico, which takes on Belgium Saturday, stands atop Group E
after beating South Korea 3-1. The Netherlands and Belgium both
have one point.
	   Hiddink will use wide midfielders on both flanks to exploit the
one weak link in the Korean defense.
	   ``The flanks is where the Koreans leave room,'' he said. ``That
is where we can be creative.''
	   Marc Overmars will stay on the left and Ronald de Boer will
replace Clarence Seedorf on the right wing. Jonk will take over for
De Boer in midfield.
	   ``We must keep our strong positions strong. Marc is at his most
effective on the left,'' Hiddink said.
	   South Korea also is lacking firepower; its goal-scoring threat
in the opening match, Ha Seok-ju, was ejected in the 30th minute
for a tackle from behind and will not be available Saturday.
	   Also out is Korea's leading scorer Hwang Sun-hong, who has a
knee injury. Hwang has 45 goals in 79 internationals.
	   Cha also has tinkered with his starting lineup. Striker Choi
Yong-soo will replace Kim Do-hoon up front. Kim will play behind
Choi.
	   The speedy Seo Jung-won will play on the left midfield after
recovering from chicken pox. Choi Sung-yong has recovered from a
twisted ankle and will start.
	   But Cha, who played for South Korea at the 1986 Mexico World Cup
finals and twice won the UEFA Cup with German teams during his
playing career, said his remaining players will do their best
against the fancied Dutch.
	   ``We will take it as though it is our last chance and play our
very best match,'' he said.
	   Hiddink also is not allowing his players any room for
complacency.
	   ``They are quick little men and we must play a very concentrated
game against them,'' he said.
	   ``But I think we can do something against them in the final
phase. We know that they get tired late on.''

Puerto Rico governor firm on privatization as strike enters second day complaint 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with government filing unfair labor practices
By SANDRA IVELISSE VILLERRAEL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello vowed to press
ahead with plans to sell a controlling interest in the state-owned
telephone company as a protest strike entered its second day
Friday.
	   ``The transaction is already done,'' Rossello said, discounting
any chance that the telephone workers' strike could derail the dlrs
1.9 billion sale to private investors led by GTE Corporation.
	   On Friday morning, the PRTC management filed a complaint with
the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Board, alleging that the strike was
a violation of the company's bargaining agreements with its two
unions. The PRTC asked the board to order the strikers back to
work.
	   Crowds were smaller on picket lines Friday, and by midday there
was no repeat of Thursday's clashes between strikers and police.
Union leaders met with Police Chief Pedro Toledo to discuss ways to
prevent more violence.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale of 50 percent plus one
share of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company on Thursday, the same
day 6,400 company workers went on strike in protest. Union leaders
fear layoffs under GTE control.
	   The House of Representatives is expected to approve the sale
next week.
	   Rossello, whose administration has sold hotels and a shipping
company and has courted private investment in the power industry,
says a state-owned telephone company cannot compete in the
newly-open Puerto Rico market.
	   PRTC had a monopoly in this U.S. commonwealth of 3.8 million
people until 1996. Now it faces competition from private firms and
has been forced to cut rates.
	   PRTC employees were threatened with disciplinary actions by both
sides in the labor conflict.
	   The company's management has said workers could be disciplined
for participating in what it called an ``illegal strike.'' Union
leaders, meanwhile, threatened to impose fines of up to dlrs 5,000
for members who don't honor picket lines.
	   Strikers also protested outside some branches of Banco Popular,
Puerto Rico's largest bank. Its parent, Popular Inc., is part of
the GTE-led consortium.

World Cup: Soccer championship enthralls its global followers category code AP Special Correspondent

Eds: CORRECTS day of US-Iran match in graf 8. Also moved with ``i''
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only forms of weekend worship. For the faithful, it is a way of
life, a solace for the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for
holy war. And the heavy gold cup is its holy grail.
	   Nagayuki Miyara, a Tokyo salesman, stood outside Toulouse
stadium clutching what seemed to be the things dearest to him: his
wife, Midori, and two tickets to Japan's opening game with
Argentina.
	   ``Japan is going to win for sure,'' he pronounced, clearly
convinced, although oddsmakers had easily predicted Argentina's
victory. ``I'm here to see my team play.''
	   Nearby, Ruben Carpio, watched for scalpers. A businessman from
Cordoba, he came without tickets, hoping for the best. Asked why,
he seemed surprised at the question. ``Because,'' he explained,
``I'm from Argentina.''
	   As a rule, soccer fans are seldom more specific. Their passions
range from patriotism to puppy love. Handsome, dashing players are
heart throbs. Teams draped in national colors fight surrogate wars
with traditional rivals. Honor hangs in the balance.
	   When the United States and Iran, long at political loggerheads,
play Sunday in Lyon, the larger implications are obvious enough.
Scotland plays as Scotland, not some element of Great Britain. On
the soccer field, nations like Bulgaria and Paraguay share center
stage with the heavyweights of global power politics.

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say 
</HEADLINE>
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ British police said Friday that the best
security measures can't prevent hooliganism at next week's World
Cup match pitting England against Romania if trouble-makers are
numerous and determined.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' said Tim Hollis, the top British police
officer advising the French.
	   Hollis told a news conference that 200 hooligans who rampaged in
Marseille ahead of and during England's Monday match against
Tunisia have been identified and so-call British ``spotter'' police
would be on the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   Authorities in the southern city of Montpellier on Thursday
arrested an English fan linked to the three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 50 people were injured, 80 detained and the Old
Port section of the city torn up. The suspect was identified by
English police.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Officials in this southwest French town have set up a battery of
bans to help head off any new trouble.
	   Starting Thursday and through Monday, cafes and bars are forced
to close at 11 p.m., instead of 2 a.m. The nationwide music
festival has been postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it,
a series of other festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of a
scuffle during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   Meanwhile, Alain Bidou, the prefect of the Haute-Garonne region
where Toulouse is located said Friday night that fences would not
be installed at the stadium to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against using fences on the grounds
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise and tend to
breed enmity. FIFA head Sepp Blatter agreed.
	   French authorities had been considering using fences to control
any rowdiness by hooligans.
	   Marseille authorities also planned increased security for
Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-business.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold an hour
later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain
open until 4 a.m.
	   In Paris, officials announced Thursday that possession and
consumption of alcohol would be banned on the streets around the
Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris on match days.
	   Area bars would be ``asked to close'' on those days, the police
statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ His aides winced. But Col. Moammar Gadhafi
simply leaned back inside his cavernous tent and laughed when
questioned about American claims that he supports terrorism and is
mentally unstable.
	   ``I expect that I will go down in history as a person who has
been misunderstood,'' the Libyan leader said.
	   Gadhafi suggested the world would eventually come to accept his
views. ``All prophets have been accused of madness and terrorism,''
he said. ``Even Christ was crucified, but after they crucified him,
they converted to his religion.''
	   Gadhafi spoke this week in an interview with Associated Press
Television in a carpeted, low-slung tent in the center of a tightly
guarded military complex in Tripoli. The tent stood in the shadow
of the bombed-out remains of his private residence, destroyed by
U.S. warplanes in 1986.
	   Dressed in light military fatigues and wearing a large brown
head scarf to hold back his hair, Gadhafi appeared relaxed and
confident throughout the 45-minute conversation.
	   He laughed off reports of an assassination attempt earlier this
month, saying that no such attack had ever taken place. ``I only
hear rumors of these attempts. They're the same old lies.''
	   Certainly there was no sign of heightened security on the
streets of Tripoli this week. Few soldiers were visible outside
military areas, and the atmosphere in the capital appeared
easygoing. Traffic flowed normally, it was business as usual in the
crowded souk, or market district, and open-air cafes were packed
with people watching the World Cup on television.
	   During the interview, Gadhafi repeated demands that the West
lift sanctions against Libya, denied involvement in the Lockerbie
bombing, and belittled Western suggestions that he plans military
uses for a desert pipeline.
	   The U.N. sanctions, which ban air travel to and from Libya, are
aimed at forcing the surrender of two Libyans charged with blowing
up an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in
1988. The attack killed 270 people.
	   Asked if he had any message for the families of the Lockerbie
victims, Gadhafi said: ``We send our sincere condolences. And we
are sorry for this catastrophe because we suffer likewise, for we
lost our families and children during the joint US-British raid in
1986 against our homes while we were asleep.''
	   Denying Libyan involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, Gadhafi
asserted that the Western powers knew the identity of the culprits.
``Certainly America and Britain know,'' he said.
	   Asked to expand on this, he declined. ``No, this is not my
responsibility. I only defend myself as we are innocent. But they
know who did it.''
	   The U.S. government has demanded that the two Lockerbie suspects
be tried either in the United States or Scotland. Libya has offered
to surrender them for trial under Scottish law but in a neutral
country.
	   Gadhafi made clear he would not hand over the pair in advance of
a ruling on the issue from the International Court of Justice in
The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Asked whether he was prepared to surrender them to the United
Nations or the World Court, he replied: ``On what basis? It is not
clear where and before which court they will be tried. These are
human beings, not tins of tomatoes.''
	   Gadhafi, who came to power in September 1969, also spoke at
length about his new book of short stories, titled ``Escape To
Hell.'' In the book, Gadhafi espouses a philosophy that combines
apocalyptic visions and utopian solutions with a strong
environmental theme.
	   ``This is the city: a mill that grinds down its inhabitants. ...
Children are worse off than adults,'' it reads in part.
	   ``You can leave everything, except the earth,'' reads another
excerpt. ``The earth is the only thing you cannot do without. If
you destroy other things, you might not lose out, but beware of
destroying the earth, because you will then lose everything!''

Eds: SUBS graf 8 to correct US-Iran match to Sunday, not Saturday.
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ One recent afternoon, working people who
had flown 20 hours from opposite directions looked desperately for
someone they could pay dlrs 2,000 each for the privilege of
watching some guys kick around a ball for 90 minutes.
	   At the World Cup, that is mere routine.
	   Soccer is no more only a sport than Islam or Christianity are
only forms of weekend worship. For the faithful, it is a way of
life, a solace for the spirit. At the extreme, it is grounds for
holy war. And the heavy gold cup is its holy grail.
	   Nagayuki Miyara, a Tokyo salesman, stood outside Toulouse
stadium clutching what seemed to be the things dearest to him: his
wife, Midori, and two tickets to Japan's opening game with
Argentina.
	   ``Japan is going to win for sure,'' he pronounced, clearly
convinced, although oddsmakers had easily predicted Argentina's
victory. ``I'm here to see my team play.''
	   Nearby, Ruben Carpio, watched for scalpers. A businessman from
Cordoba, he came without tickets, hoping for the best. Asked why,
he seemed surprised at the question. ``Because,'' he explained,
``I'm from Argentina.''
	   As a rule, soccer fans are seldom more specific. Their passions
range from patriotism to puppy love. Handsome, dashing players are
heart throbs. Teams draped in national colors fight surrogate wars
with traditional rivals. Honor hangs in the balance.
	   When the United States and Iran, long at political loggerheads,
play Sunday in Lyon, the larger implications are obvious enough.
Scotland plays as Scotland, not some element of Great Britain. On
the soccer field, nations like Bulgaria and Paraguay share center
stage with the heavyweights of global power politics.

Demonstrators and police clash for second day in Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A disorganized crowd of a few hundred
anti-government protesters clashed with police for a second day in
the center of this capital city, eyewitnesses reported Friday.
	   Virtually all businesses in the center of the city were closed
Friday and most had protective metal plates covering their doors
and windows.
	   Scuffles broke out between police and the protesters, who
chanted anti-government slogans, and several demonstrators were
arrested.
	   Police fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowds, estimated
at about 350 people and growing in the early afternoon.
	   Information on the number of people arrested and reports of
injuries was not immediately available.
	   The violence erupted Thursday over a breakdown in power-sharing
talks between the opposition People's National Congress and
President Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party.
	   The opposition party, which is backed by Guyanese of African
descent, claims the Dec. 15 elections were rigged by Jagan's party,
which has its power base among the East Indian ethnic majority. An
audit by the 15-member Caribbean Community economic bloc on June 2
said the vote was fair.
	   Although most businesses were protected from vandalism by metal
plates, protesters did smash an unprotected plate glass window at
one of the three Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in the city.

No pitch inspections, WIndies chief says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ West Indies Cricket Board president Pat
Rousseau says he will oppose any inspections of the Sabina Park
pitch before next year's Test match against Australia.
	   Inspect all Test pitches or inspect none, Rousseau said this
week of International Cricket Council plans to check the turf at
Sabina Park before allowing any Tests there.
	   Monday's announcement by the WICB that Sabina will host the
third Test match of the Aussies' four-Test series was a surprise to
cricket followers in light of the debacle against England in
January.
	   The England match at Sabina was abandoned shortly before lunch
on the first day after several English batsmen were struck.
Officials ruled that the pitch was not up to Test standard, making
it the first time in the 121-year history of Test cricket that a
match was abandoned because of an unsuitable pitch.

Arafat postpones Cabinet reshuffle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat failed
to reshuffle his Cabinet Friday, despite warning that such inaction
would result in a no-confidence vote in the Palestinian Legislative
Council.
	   Last month, the 88-member legislature gave Arafat two weeks to
respond to complaints about widespread corruption and inaction and
to reshuffle his Cabinet or face his first no-confidence motion.
The date was then postponed until this Friday.
	   After Friday's meeting, PLO executive committee member Suleiman
Najab said Arafat had briefed the council members and asked for a
further delay.
	   ``Chairman Arafat has held consultations over the past few days,
but he needs more time to conduct further consultation,'' said
Najab, who added that names of new Cabinet members were not
mentioned by Arafat.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
passed away this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one
current minister was never approved by the legislature.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Maggert shooting 69, quote; Price and Lehman
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The Olympic Club began to strike back today
at the U.S. Open, but it couldn't wipe the smile off the face of
amateur Matt Kuchar.
	   An hour before Payne Stewart took his 4-under-par 66 into cool,
breezy conditions, most of those hoping to challenge his
first-round lead were in full retreat.
	   ``They've got a lot of front pins, so there's a lower margin for
error,'' said Joe Durant, who opened with a 68 on Thursday and
found himself pleased today at 1-over 141 after a 73.
	   With more than half of the field on the course, only Bob Tway
managed to catch Stewart at 4-under by making birdie on the short
seventh hole. Olympic took two strokes back from him over the next
two holes, putting the 1986 PGA champion at 2-under through 11
holes.
	   Jeff Maggert, who challenged at Congressional last year until
the final holes, had a 69 for the second straight day and finished
two rounds at 2-under 138.
	   ``It's a test of patience, it's a test of will,'' Maggert said.
``It suits my game. Surprisingly, I'm having a lot of fun out
there. This is my kind of golf.''
	   The strongest move of the day came from Nick Price, who chipped
in for eagle on the first hole and was at 3-under for the day until
a bogey at the tough 17th.
	   He finished with a 2-under 68, the lowest score among the early
starters.
	   Kuchar, the U.S. Amateur champion whose smile lit up Augusta
National at the Masters, is proving he can be a factor anywhere.
	   Kuchar, who had a 70 on Thursday, began today with six pars and
two birdies through eight holes. His round was nearly derailed on
the 14th when it took him two shots from a greenside bunker to get
on the green where he two-putted for double bogey.
	   Then, on the par-3 15th, he wound up in the deep rough behind
the flagstick. No problem. Kuchar chopped out with a sand wedge,
and the ball rammed into the pin and into the cup for birdie.
	   He finished with a 1-under 69 and was at 139.
	   ``I'm definitely playing the weekend, right?'' Kuchar asked. ``I
made my main goal. I wanted to be out here for Father's Day and my
birthday.''
	   Kuchar turns 20 on Sunday.
	   Tom Lehman, who has had at least a share of the lead going into
the final round of the last three U.S. Opens, was steady at 2-under
today but shot a 39 on the back for a 75 for 3-over 143.
	   Durant and Mark Carnevale were two surprising names on the
leaderboard. Carnevale birdied the tough 17th hole in his first
round of 67.
	   Carnevale broke his string of 19 pars with a double bogey on No.
2. He made the turn at 39. He fought back with a 34 on the back and
wound up with a 73, even-par 140 for two rounds and was 1-over for
the tournament.
	   Stewart didn't tee off until early afternoon, hoping to start
today the way he finished on Thursday.
	   The cut will be the top 60 players and everyone within 10
strokes of the lead. Two years ago, Stewart had the first-round
lead at Oakland Hills until stumbling home over the last three
holes in the second round to let several players into weekend play.
	   That may be the only thing that saves defending champion Ernie
Els, who opened with a 75 and dropped to 6-over for the tournament
today through eight holes. But Els responded in fashion, making
eagle from the fairway on the 10th hole. That led to a 32 on the
back and a 5-over 145 for the tournament.
	   Carnevale was the only player who went the entire first round
without a bogey. That didn't last long today.
	   He drove into the rough on No. 2 and, with a surprisingly decent
lie, tried to go at the green on the 394-yard hole instead of
hitting a wedge into the fairway.
	   The approach came up short in the rough, and his sand wedge
traveled only about 20 feet into more thick stuff. He chipped out
to 35-feet and two-putted for a double bogey, the start of his
quick descent.
	   Justin Leonard, the British Open champion and a favorite this
week because of his grinding style of play, opened with a 71 but
quickly got back in the thick of it with seven pars and a birdie on
the first eight holes.
	   But he ballooned to a 40 on the back for a 75, putting him at
146.
	   Stewart called his 4-3-3 finish ``unheard of'' on the closing
holes of Olympic, but that wasn't the only unusual twist.
	   Amateur Paul Simson was 2-under at the turn until a spectator
ran off with his errant tee shot on the 10th hole. Not realizing
what had happened, Simson considered it lost and played a second
tee shot. He took a triple bogey on his way to a 43 on the back.
	   Jesper Parnevik sensed that the pin placement on No. 18 was
different than what his yardage book showed, and he was right. The
USGA realized the pin was unfair and changed it two hours into the
round, although everyone played it the same.
	   And Casey Martin made history by becoming the first player to
ride a cart in the U.S. Open. It could have used a pair of
headlights, since Martin's bogey-bogey finish for a 74 came in near
darkness.
	   ``It was overwhelming, the support I got from the crowd out
there,'' he said. ``I have to admit, I was almost crying on the
first tee. I just had to get up there and hit it quick before I
thought about what was going on.''
	   For others, Olympic hit them before they knew what was
happening.
	   Tiger Woods was cruising along at 2-under, tied for the lead in
the early going, when he four-putted No. 9 for a double bogey. Four
more bogeys followed on the back and Woods wound up at 74.
	   ``That's the beauty of the U.S. Open,'' David Duval said after
four bogeys in the final eight holes led to a 75. ``You're never so
happy as when you're done. There's no letup.''

World Cup: Spain on brink of elimination after 0-0 tie 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Spain stood on the brink of first
round elimination from the World Cup Friday after it was held to a
0-0 tie by Paraguay.
	   The Spaniards, strongly favored to reach the quarterfinal at
least, forced Paraguay's star goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert to
make several top-class saves.
	   But Juan Pizzo, Luis Enrique and Raul Gonzalez couldn't find the
target and Javier Clemente's team is in serious danger of going out
in the opening round.
	   Having already lost 3-2 to Nigeria, the Spaniards have only one
point but at least moved up to third above Bulgaria on goals
scored.
	   The result means that the Nigerians, who downed Bulgaria 1-0 at
Parc des Princes earlier Friday, clinch first place in Group D
while the Paraguayans, who haven't seen a goal scored in two 0-0
ties, are best placed to join them in round two.
	   Paraguay has two points and Bulgaria and Spain have one each
while the Nigerians have already qualified for the second round
after two victories.
	   In the final group games next Wednesday, Spain meets Bulgaria t
Lens and Paraguay faces Nigeria at Toulouse.
	   Clemente made five changes after the 3-2 loss to Nigeria when
his team twice lost the lead.
	   But Paraguay, which was held to a 0-0 tie by Bulgaria, created
the first danger in the 15th minute when a low, 25-meter (yard)
free kick by Miguel Angel Benitez got through the defensive wall.
	   The shot was confidently held by 'keeper Andoni Zubizarreta who
was fortunate to stay on the team after his blunder gifted Nigeria
its second goal.
	   A chance fell to Spanish striker Juan Pizzi in the 21st minute
when the Paraguayan defense failed to clear a cross. The striker
headed powerfully goalwards from 12 meters by 'keeper Jose Luis
Chilavert punched the ball acrobatically behind for a corner.
	   After Zubizarreta had punched away a powerfully-struck 25-meter
shot from Benitez, Paraguay won a free kick 30 meters out and
'keeper Chilavert, who has scored three times for his country,
moved up to take a shot at goal.
	   His well-hit free kick hit the defensive wall and deflected to
Francisco Arce whose 12-meter shot was deflected for a corner.
	   Aristides Rojas then got through on goal but was foiled by a
well-timed tackle by Carlos Aguilera as the forward was about to
shoot from 10 meters.
	   In the final minute of the first half, Spanish striker Raul
wriggled clear of the defense and shot from eight meters only for
Chilavert to dive to his right to got his hand to the ball.
	   Pizzi ran in to try and force the ball home but Celso Ayala got
in a tackle to sweep the ball away.
	   Early in the second half, Zubizarreta saved a low shot from the
ever dangerous Benitez and then dived full stretch to his left to
keep out a curling shot from the same player in the 63rd minute.
	   At the other end, Chilavert pushed a shot from Luis Enrique over
the bar and the Spanish midfielder came up with a close range
header which the Paraguayan 'keeper again tipped over the top.
	   Coach Clemente made three changes in the second half including
replacing Raul with Atletico Madrid's Kiko Narvaez.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta; Rafael Alkorta, Abelardo Fernandez
(Alberto Celades, 56th), Sergi Barjuan, Carlos Aguilera; Raul
Gonzalez (Kiko Narvaez 66th), Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor, Luis
Enrique Martinez, Joseba Exteberria; Juan Pizzi (Francisco
Morientes, 53rd).
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Denis Caniza, Roberto Acuna (Julio
Cesar Yegros, 74th), Miguel Angel Benitez, Julio Cesar Enciso;
Aristides Rojas (Cesar Ramirez, 84th), Jorge Campos (Carlos
Paredes, 46th).
	   Referee _ Ian McLeod, South Africa.

World Cup: Nigeria into second round with 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Spain-Paraguay result, Nigeria clinching group in
graf 3.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria clearly saved its best play for the World
Cup and again is headed to the second round.
	   Victor Ikpeba closed a swift three-man combination in the 27th
minute Friday as Nigeria, which looked so out of synch in France
'98 tuneup games, used its superior speed and surprising ball
control to outlast Bulgaria 1-0 and stay atop Group D.
	   Adding to its 3-2 victory over Spain, Nigeria has six points and
with Paraguay and Spain's goalless draw Friday night, clinched
first place in Group D. Bulgaria, a semifinalist in 1994, has one
point, dropped to last place, and with a remaining game against
Spain, has little chance of advancing.
	   Under 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat at the Parc des
Princes, the Africans pushed from the opening kickoff and had more
dangerous chances.
	   Bulgaria played a slower and more deliberate pace, which
Nigeria, known more for its flair than organization, managed to
handle better than it usually does.
	   ``Bulgaria played a frustrating, irritating game,'' midfielder
Sunday Oliseh said. ``We were running; they were waiting.''
	   The Europeans started seven players 29 years of age or older,
compared to just two for Nigeria.
	   ``The first thing is to be in the next round. It was a difficult
game for us,'' Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said. ``I was happy
with the first half, but then we had to be careful not to push up
too far in the second half.''
	   He is the first coach to lead four teams to the second round at
the World Cup, after Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990 and the
United States in 1994.
	   The Yugoslavian native's job was reportedly in jeopardy, though,
after Nigeria dropped World Cup tuneups to Germany, Yugoslavia and
Netherlands by a combined 9-1.
	   On Friday, Nigeria's superior speed began to pay off midway
through the first half as its players repeatedly turned defenders
and broke into open spaces.
	   The goal came off a lightning-quick exchange.
	   Left back Celestine Babayaro brought the ball up the left flank
and slid it to Jay-Jay Okocha, who found Daniel Amokachi at the top
right corner of the penalty area. Amokachi deftly side-footed the
ball to Ikpeba in the middle of the box.
	   The AS Monaco striker, Africa's 1997 Player of the Year, eluded
sweeper Trifon Ivanov, who fell, and rolled the ball just under
keeper Zdravko Zdravkov's right arm for his second goal in the
green-and-white and first in the World Cup.
	   ``We attack because that is the style that fits Nigeria best.
Bora has come to understand this,'' Ikpeba said, ``and to try to
change us at this time would not be wise.''
	   Nigeria's defense, its acknowledged weak point, was far from
perfect. Goalkeeper Peter Rufai and his backs got crossed up often,
but Bulgaria _ which lost 3-0 to Nigeria in the 1994 tournament _
never was able to convert.
	   ``I think that we were the better team on the day. Tactically,
too, we were better,'' Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev said. ``We
stopped Nigeria from playing the game they wanted to play. We had
chances but were not able to put them away.''
	   Winger Emil Kostadinov nearly tied the score with three minutes
remaining, but his shot skimmed off the crossbar.
	   Krassimir Balakov had produced a strong threat in the 42nd,
splitting two defenders with a header and then sending a lob over
midfielder Mutiu Adepoju and a charging Rufai, but the ball bounced
just wide of the empty net.
	   Then Hristo Stoichkov, who shared the scoring title at the last
World Cup for Bulgaria, pushed the ball wide right of the post in
the 66th and dropped to the ground in frustration.
	   ``It is not that we can be, we will be punished'' later in the
tourney for similarly poor defense, Oliseh said.
	   Nwankwo Kanu, 19 months removed from heart surgery to replace a
weak aortic valve, made his tournament debut in the 67th minute,
coming on for Amokachi. The Inter Milan striker nearly scored with
his first touch, but the left-footed blast from the box was fisted
over the crossbar by Zdravkov and Nigeria missed other chances to
put the game away late.
	   ``For people who like the spectacular, we make it spectacular,''
Milutinovic said.
	   Nigeria lost captain Uche Ukechukwu for its last group game,
against Paraguay. The defender was shown a yellow card, his second
of the tournament, in the 43rd.

Delacroix work sets artist's record on 200th year of his birth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An oil on canvas by Eugene Delacroix, ``The Strike
of Arab Horsemen,'' was sold Friday for 46.5 million francs (dlrs
7.75 million) -- a record price for the painter -- to an American
buyer, the Drouot auction house said.
	   The record came as France fetes with major exhibits the 200
anniversary since the birth of Delacroix.
	   The sale ``pulverized'' the previous high price for a Delacroix
-- dlrs 5.5 million for the oil entitled ``Natchez'' sold in 1989
at Christie's auction house in New York, according to Drouot.
	   The statement by Drouot did not name the buyer, saying only it
was an American.
	   Delacroix, inspired by the time he spent in Morocco, specialized
in painting combat scenes of robed Arabs, often on horseback.
	   Including fees, a total of 51.5 million francs (about dlrs 8.6
million) was paid out for the record-setting work, Drouot said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Under heavy security following violent
protests from strikers, shareholders of Greece's fourth-largest
bank approved a privatization plan Friday seen as a key test of the
government's debt-cutting resolve.
	   The vote to seek a private buyer for Ionian Bank came nearly 12
hours after strikers stormed a meeting to vote on the sale.
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the vote was called off. Protesters
ripped at the clothes of the bank's governor, Haris Stamatopoulos.
	   The bank's management had refused to discuss worker demands for
job and pension guarantees at the meeting. Riot police guarded the
offices of Commercial Bank, Ionian's parent company, while the
later vote took place.
	   The efforts to sell a 51.4 percent stake in the bank is an
important test of the Socialist government's commitment to reform
the banking sector and bring Greece in line with fiscal guidelines
to join Europe's single currency club by 2001.
	   Failure to sell the bank or granting major concessions to
strikers would have been considered a major blow to the government
of Premier Costas Simitis.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank.
	   An Athens court called for an immediate investigation into the
disruption, asking for video footage from television channels
covering the events in order to identify the troublemakers.
	   A prosecutor ordered the violent protesters to be arrested and
brought court within 24 hours, where they will face charges of
illegal violence and damaging property.
	   Meanwhile, a court Friday issued additional rulings deeming the
strike illegal. Ionian union officials will be liable for fines of
500,000 drachmas (dlrs 1,650) for each additional strike day, the
court ruled.
	   Workers have not heeded three previous court decisions banning
the strike.
	   Shares at the Athens Stock Exchange, which had opened higher on
upbeat expectations about the sale's approval, slipped after the
clashes broke out.

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ British police said Friday that the best
security measures can't prevent hooliganism at next week's World
Cup match pitting England against Romania if trouble-makers are
numerous and determined.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' said Tim Hollis, the top British police
officer advising the French.
	   Hollis told a news conference that 200 hooligans who rampaged in
Marseille ahead of and during England's Monday match against
Tunisia have been identified and so-call British ``spotter'' police
would be on the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   Authorities in the southern city of Montpellier on Thursday
arrested an English fan linked to the three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 50 people were injured, 80 detained and the Old
Port section of the city torn up. The suspect was identified by
English police.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Officials in this southwest French town have set up a battery of
bans to help head off any new trouble.
	   Starting Thursday and through Monday, cafes and bars are forced
to close at 11 p.m., instead of 2 a.m. The nationwide music
festival has been postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it,
a series of other festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of a
scuffle during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   Meanwhile, Alain Bidou, the prefect of the Haute-Garonne region
where Toulouse is located said Friday night that fences would not
be installed at the stadium to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against using fences on the grounds
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise and tend to
breed enmity. FIFA head Sepp Blatter agreed.
	   French authorities had been considering using fences to control
any rowdiness by hooligans.
	   Marseille authorities also planned increased security for
Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners who said the measures were ``anti-business.''
	   Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be sold an hour
later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants could remain
open until 4 a.m.
	   In Paris, officials announced Thursday that possession and
consumption of alcohol would be banned on the streets around the
Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris on match days.
	   Area bars would be ``asked to close'' on those days, the police
statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.

Demonstrators and police clash for second day in Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A disorganized crowd of a few hundred
anti-government protesters clashed with police for a second day in
the center of this capital city, eyewitnesses reported Friday.
	   Virtually all businesses in Georgetown were closed Friday and
most had protective metal plates covering doors and windows.
Protesters chanted anti-government slogans, and several
demonstrators were arrested. Police fired tear gas to try to
disperse the crowds, estimated at about 350 people and growing in
the early afternoon.
	   Information on the number of people arrested and reports of
injuries was not immediately available.
	   The violence erupted Thursday over a breakdown in power-sharing
talks between the opposition People's National Congress and
President Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party.
	   The opposition party, backed by Guyanese of African descent,
claims the Dec. 15 elections were rigged by Jagan's party, which
has its power base among the East Indian ethnic majority. An audit
by the 15-member Caribbean Community economic bloc on June 2 said
the vote was fair.

Nigeria joins Brazil, France in second round; suspensions follow red card rush, Spain-Paraguay tie AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Spain-Paraguay 0-0 tie
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Nigeria joined defending
titlist Brazil and host France in the second round of the World Cup
on Friday.
	   A 1-0 triumph over Bulgaria at the Parc des Princes made it two
victories in as many games for the Nigerians, who underlined their
emergence as the biggest soccer power to come out of Africa.
	   Victor Ikpeba netted the only goal in the 27th minute as Nigeria
followed up its come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Spain with
another impressive victory.
	   By contrast, Friday's other game was a disappointing 0-0 tie
between Spain and Paraguay and the Spaniards, strongly favored to
reach the quarterfinal at least, are in real danger of going out in
the first round.
	   They lie third behind Nigeria and Paraguay and have only one
point, the same as last place Bulgaria. The Spain-Paraguay
stalemate at Saint-Etienne means that Nigeria clinched first place
in Group D and will play at Saint-Denis in its second round game
June 28.
	   The Paraguayans, who haven't seen a goal scored in two 0-0
games, have two points and face Nigeria in Toulouse next Wednesday
when Spain meets Bulgaria at Lens.
	   While Group D finished its second round of games, coaches and
players still were debating the significance of Red Card Day _
Thursday's rush of five red cards in two games in apparent response
to criticism of the referees by FIFA president Sepp Blatter and
World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   FIFA suspended South African midfielder Alfred Phiri for three
matches, French star Zinedine Zidane and Danish striker Miklos
Molnar for two games each after Thursday's expulsions.
	   Denmark's Morten Wieghorst, sent off only three minutes after
entering the game as substitute, and Saudi Arabia's Mohammed al
Khilaiwi were banned for one game each.
	   While South African coach Philippe Troussier described the
three-game ban on Phiri as ``a bit harsh'', others were a little
alarmed how the championship appeared to have changed.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle noted how four red cards in 20 games
and eight days suddenly had switched to five in two games on one
day, immediately after Blatter and Platini had said the referees
were being too lenient.
	   ``I thought the balance was quite good in the first games, but
it has changed very quickly,'' Hoddle said Friday, three days
before his England team faces Romania at Toulouse.
	   ``We went into the tournament believing the first five days
(before England played) would give us a chance to see to see what
was going to happen, how the referees were going to interpret the
laws,'' Hoddle said.
	   ``But now it's almost as if we are starting out again and
certainly we learned a lot from yesterday's performances.''
	   Danish defender Marc Rieper criticized the comments from Blatter
and Platini.
	   ``I think what they said was ridiculous,'' he said. ``Referees
have been very good so far and it is a very stupid comment that he
(Blatter) has made. I don't know if he is trying to ruin the
tournament that he made himself, and kill the football game.''
	   Zidane, an influential forward who will miss France's third
Group C game as well as its match in the second round, said he
believed the Mexican referee who sent him off, Arturo Brizio,
minterpreted his challenge on Saudi captain Fuad Amin as a
deliberate stamping.
	   ``I didn't deserve this,'' the Juventus forward said. ``I did
not mean to hurt the man. I just fell on him.''
	   The World Cup ticket scandal rumbled on Friday while the city of
Marseille was bracing itself for a repeat of the street violence
that married Monday's England-Tunisia game.
	   World Cup organizers have launched an investigation into the
theft of 15,000 tickets from the Paris office of U.S. distributor
Prime Sports International.
	   PSI listed an undetermined number of tickets for Thursday
night's France-Saudi Arabia match among those stolen. But a check
at the Stade de France found the seats occupied by spectators, said
World Cup organizers spokesman Bruno Travade.
	   He said the World Cup organizing committee, the CFO, was still
waiting, after two requests, for PSI to supply the names of the
original purchasers of the tickets that were later stolen.
	   Bar owners in Marseille's Old Port watched nervously as
orange-clad Dutch fans began arriving at their sidewalk terraces,
where last weekend riots erupted between England and Tunisia
supporters.
	   The Netherlands, whose clubs are notorious for their violent
followers, takes on South Korea Saturday at the Stade Velodrome in
the first match in Marseille since rioting by English fans led to
80 arrests and 50 injuries between Saturday and Monday.
	   ``I am just waiting,'' bar owner Olivier Ganteaume said. ``The
English fans broke tables and chairs here; they ran off without
paying for their drinks. I have another bar on the other side of
the port where they smashed windows and chairs.''

World Cup: Gomez decides against striker's return 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LA TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Colombia coach Hernan Gomez will
not allow striker Faustino Asprilla back on the squad, even though
Asprilla apologized for remarks that got him dismissed.
	   Gomez said Friday the case is closed and he is pleased with the
way his team weathered a stormy week that also included a loss to
Romania. Gomez also was criticized by Colombian club presidents,
who asked that Gomez be dismissed.
	   But he says the team survived the worst and is focusing on
Monday's Group G match against Tunisia.
	   ``We had a very complicated week, but everything improved and
there's a sense of solidarity on the team,'' Gomez said at Friday's
practice. ``Some say the team is a disaster, but that only hurts
us.
	   ``The players were able to deal with the situation and overcame
it. Now they're getting ready for a win against Tunisia. We're
still quite alive.''
	   Asprilla's dismissal for publicly criticizing Gomez and some of
his teammates is irreversible, Gomez said.
	   ``At no time did I consider the possibility of reversing the
painful measure I took against my friend ... almost my son,'' Gomez
said Friday.
	   ``There was great pressure'' to take back Parma's striker, but
Gomez refused to say who pressured him.
	   ``What happened was best for Faustino and for us,'' he said.
	   Team captain Carlos Valderrama also said the situation has
steadied on the Colombian squad.
	   ``We've forgotten our troubles and now we're thinking about only
Tunisia,'' the Miami Fusion midfielder said. ``We're in the hunt.''

Bus plunges into gorge, 36 pilgrims die 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A bus winding along a mountain route lost
control and hurtled down into a deep gorge in India's northern
Kashmir state Friday, killing 36 pilgrims and injuring 18 others
returning from a Hindu religious shrine, police said.
	   Few other details were available about the accident in Nandni,
about 25 kilometers north of the state's summer capital of Jammu, a
police spokesman said.
	   The pilgrims were returning from Katra town at the foot of a
sacred mountain that houses the cave shrine of goddess Vaishno
Devi, visited each year by millions of pilgrims who climb 14
kilometers (nine miles) uphill to reach the shrine.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Under heavy security following violent
protests from strikers, shareholders of Greece's fourth-largest
bank approved a privatization plan Friday that was seen as a key
test of the government's debt-cutting resolve.
	   The vote to seek a private buyer for Ionian Bank came nearly 12
hours after strikers stormed a meeting to vote on the sale.
	   Strikers overturned tables, dismantled microphones and assaulted
Ionian Bank management before the vote was called off. Protesters
also ripped at the clothes of the bank's governor, Haris
Stamatopoulos.
	   The bank's management had refused to discuss worker demands for
job and pension guarantees at the meeting. Riot police guarded the
offices of Commercial Bank, Ionian's parent company, while the
later vote took place.
	   The efforts to sell a 51.4 percent stake in the bank were seen
as an important test of the Socialist government's commitment to
reform the banking sector and bring Greece in line with fiscal
guidelines to join Europe's single currency club by 2001.
	   Failure to sell the bank or the need to grant major concessions
to strikers would have been considered a major blow to the
government of Premier Costas Simitis.
	   Ionian workers walked off the job May 8 to protest government
plans to privatize the state-owned bank.
	   An Athens court called for an immediate investigation into
Friday's disruption, asking for video footage from television
channels covering the events. A prosecutor ordered the violent
protesters arrested and brought to court, where they will face
charges of illegal violence and damaging property.
	   Also Friday, a court ruled that the strike was illegal. Ionian
union officials will be liable for fines of 500,000 drachmas (dlrs
1,650) for each additional strike day, according to the ruling.
	   Workers have not heeded three previous court decisions banning
the strike.
	   Shares at the Athens Stock Exchange, which had opened higher on
upbeat expectations about the sale's approval, slipped after the
clashes broke out.

Iran dismisses report it bought chemical weapons from an Israeli 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iran dismissed as baseless Friday an Israeli
court's finding that it bought weapons components from an Israeli
businessman, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   An Israeli court convicted Nachum Manbar on Wednesday of
illegally selling chemical and biological weapon components to Iran
for dlrs 16 million.
	   Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
reports of an Israeli businessman selling weapons ingredients to
Iran were ``baseless,'' the news agency said in a report monitored
by the British Broadcasting Corporation and received in Cairo.
	   The reports reflected Israel's concern about ``Iran's diplomatic
efforts ... to curb the danger posed by Israel's nuclear weapons,''
Mohammadi said.
	   The spokesman accused Israeli officials of ``spreading false
rumors'' about Iran.
	   Manbar, whose trial was held behind closed doors, is due to be
sentenced July 15.

Police separate Protestant marchers, Catholic protesters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police ensured
that about 4,000 Protestant marchers avoided predominantly Catholic
areas of north Belfast, defusing a sectarian confrontation Friday
night.
	   A government-appointed commission tasked with defusing
confrontations over annual Protestant marches banned on Monday the
Orange Order, the largest Protestant fraternal group, from entering
Catholic turf during their biennial ``Tour of the North'' parade.
	   Orange leaders reluctantly accepted the restrictions. They
handed a letter of protest to the police commander as the parade
reached a row of riot police blocking their intended path.
	   As they turned away to continue their parade on an alternative
route, the Orangemen were heckled by a few hundred harder-line
Protestants who were picketing the police lines. These protesters,
mostly women and youths, held banners that read: ``Loyalists have
rights too.''
	   On the other side of the line Catholic youths threw stones at
the police, who were protected by flak jackets, helmets and
shields. No injuries were reported as darkness fell.
	   When the ``Tour of the North'' parade was last held in 1996,
authorities let Orangemen take their traditional route _ through
neighborhoods that a generation ago were predominantly Protestant,
but are now overwhelmingly Catholic.
	   Catholic protesters led by the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party tried
to block the roadway in several places two years ago. This led to
running street battles with police and retaliatory burnings of
Protestant and Catholic homes near the so-called ``peace line'' of
fences that separate the two sides of the community.
	   The annual marches commemorate a variety of events important to
Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority, ranging from
17th-century victories over Catholics to Protestant casualties in
World War I. The Orangemen say that Catholic protesters are denying
their right to public assembly.
	   But Catholic protesters complain that the marches are
deliberately provocative, with their drum-thumping ``kick the
pope'' bands, and designed to make Catholics feel like second-class
citizens. In recent years police have clashed violently with both
sides in efforts to keep them apart.
	   The next potential flashpoint is July 5 in Portadown, southwest
of Belfast, where Catholic resistance to an Orange march has
triggered widespread rioting for the past two years.

U.S. aware of Iraq smuggling oil into Turkey despite embargo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ About 45,000 barrels of oil a day are smuggled
into Turkey from Iraq in an operation that has gone on for years,
the State Department said Friday.
	   The smuggling violates U.N. sanctions imposed eight years ago.
	   But spokesman James P. Rubin avoided any criticism of Turkey, a
NATO ally and a member of the U.S.-led coalition that forced Iraq
to reverse its occupation of Kuwait in the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
	   He said Turkey had played a major role in allied efforts to
contain Iraq and in talks with U.S. officials had expressed ``a
willingness to work on bringing this illicit trade under the U.N.
sanctions regime.''
	   Rubin referred to an easing of strictures on trade with Iraq to
permit limited oil sales provided the proceeds are used for food
and medicine for the Iraqi people.
	   ``This is a situation that we've been dealing with for some
years now,'' Rubin said of the smuggling of oil into Turkey.
	   Over all, though, he said the boycott had cost President Saddam
Hussein dlrs 15 billion a year. Rubin said it was the ``most
leak-proof and longest-lasting set of sanctions in their
comprehensiveness in history.''
	   Other officials placed the value of the oil smuggled into Turkey
as dlrs 100 million a year.

After ping-pong diplomacy with China, soccer diplomacy with Iran? D'ARDIERES, France-dated story from U.S. camp.

EDS: REPEATING and changing slug to avoid confusion with SAINT-JEAN

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Twenty years of hostility can't be set
aside with the tweet of a referee's whistle. Yet when the United
States and Iran meet in the World Cup on Sunday, it will be
something more than a soccer game and something less than the
ultimate diplomatic breakthrough.
	   It will be the latest example of two bitter enemies meeting in
sport and hoping it will encourage a thaw in official relations.
	   Last winter, a team of American wrestlers went to Tehran for a
tournament and received a warm welcome. In the spring, Iranians
wrestled in a tournament in Oklahoma. There was talk of a parallel
with the ping-pong diplomacy of the 1970s, which used U.S. sports
teams to open the doors to China.
	   But the World Cup match in Lyon, France, is somehow different,
as was underscored from the highest levels of American diplomacy
this week.
	   In a major overture, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held
out the olive branch to the Iranian government, responding to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's call for non-governmental
exchanges to improves.
	   ``As the wall of mistrust comes down, we can develop with the
Islamic republic, when it is ready, a road map leading to normal
relations,'' Albright said in a speech this week in New York.
	   It came just four days before the Iran-U.S. game, the first time
these allies-turned-adversaries have met on a soccer field. On
Thursday, President Clinton made a direct link between the game and
an easing of political tensions.
	   ``I hope it can be another step toward ending the estrangement
between our nations,'' Clinton said.
	   Shortly after Khatami's overture to Washington last year, the
wrestlers became the first American athletes to visit Iran since
the Islamic revolution and taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy
in 1979. Competing in the international Takhti tournament in
February, they got a rousing welcome from Iranian fans and VIP
treatment by the Iranian government.
	   ``We had a lot of trepidation,'' said Larry Sciacchetano,
president of USA Wrestling. ``I fully respect that religious groups
didn't want us there. But they respected the fact that we were
there for sports, not politics.''
	   The visit broke a taboo on high-profile U.S. visits to Iran, and
a week later a group of American academics went to Iran to attend a
conference.
	   The sports thaw has not been entirely without friction. When
Iranian wrestlers went to compete in the United States in April,
instead of getting a taste of American hospitality they were
photographed and fingerprinted by immigration authorities on
arrival at O'Hare Airport in Chicago.
	   Iran's foreign minister was not amused.
	   Sports exchanges may have helped Iran-U.S. relations. But the
road ahead might be long, because there is still a lot of animosity
in the 20-year standoff between Iran and the United States.
	   Iranians can't forgive the United States for supporting the
dictatorial rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown
in the revolution led by the late Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   Washington severed ties with the new revolutionary government
after militants loyal to Khomeini stormed the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   For Americans, there is the unforgettable image of the militants
parading blindfolded and handcuffed U.S. hostages before television
cameras.
	   Iranians can't forget that a U.S. warship, USS Vincennes, shot
down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988,
killing 290 people. The naval captain said the plane was shot down
by mistake.
	   Despite the conflict between governments, many Iranians never
truly hated Americans, and have largely welcomed their president's
calls for better relations.
	   Iran's World Cup coach, Jalal Talebi, said his team will go out
of its way to show its goodwill to U.S. players on the day of the
match. Asked what he would do, he said: ``Let me surprise you.''
	   With soccer fans around the world watching the televised match,
Iranian players are expected to hand out flowers to the U.S. team,
as they did with Yugoslav players in their last match.
	   In Tehran, hard-line opponents of Khatami have demanded that the
government instruct players not to exchange jerseys with the
Americans after the game. But Talebi put that concern to rest.
	   ``If an American player comes up to an Iranian player after the
game and wants to exchange T-shirts, I don't think we'll say no.
We'll be more than happy to do that,'' he said in fluent English.
	   It is probably no coincidence that Talebi, an acquaintance of
U.S. team coach Steve Sampson, is Iran's World Cup coach.
	   Talebi, chosen less than a month ago to head Iran in its first
World Cup appearance in 20 years, has a home in California where he
has lived off and on since 1983 with his Iranian wife and three
sons.
	   Low key, professional and relaxed around Americans, Talebi
represents one aspect of Iran that the government has chosen to
portray.
	   ``We have come here to play soccer, and to show that we have no
problems with anyone,'' he said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on
Friday criticized Turkey's growing ties with Israel, saying they go
against the interests of both the Arabs and the Turkish people.
	   ``We have historical relations with Turkey and we respect the
Turkish people,'' Hariri told reporters. ``But we feel sorry for
the rapproachment between Israel and Turkey. We think this is not
only against the Arab interesta but also it is against the
interests of the Turkish people.''
	   Despite Arab opposition, Turkey and Israel have been moving to
improve their commercial ties and improve bilateral relations.
	   An agreement that foresees the establishment of a free trade
zone by Jan. 1, 2000 went into effect last year. Turkish officials
said last month that the two countries are on course to triple
trade to 2 dlrs billion in the coming years.
	   Iran and Arab nations have also criticized Turkey's military
agreements with Israel, including joint military maneuvers last
January with U.S participation.
	   ``We hope that one day Turkey will find out that their relations
are with the Arab world, not with Israel,'' Hariri said.
	   Hariri, speaking to reporters after a meeting with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, also denied allegations that the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is operating out of bases in
Lebanon.
	   The PKK has been fighting Turkish troops since 1984 to win
autonomy for the minority Kurds in southeastern Turkey.
	   Independent reports say the group has military camps in eastern
Lebanon, where the Syrian army has thousands of troops. This has
been denied by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is believed to
shuttle between Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley and neighboring
Syria.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it,'' Hariri said of the PKK.
``They are not based in Lebanon and the Turkish administration,
they know that. They know it very well.''
	   Hariri said Lebanon ``is very clean of any act against any other
friendly country.''

Puerto Rico governor firm on privatization as strike enters second day practices complaint, more details; CHANGES byline

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello vowed Friday to
press ahead with plans to sell a controlling interest in the
state-owned telephone company as a protest strike entered its
second day.
	   ``The transaction is already done,'' Rossello said, discounting
any chance that the telephone workers' strike could derail the dlrs
1.9 billion sale to private investors led by GTE Corporation.
	   On Friday morning, the management of Puerto Rico Telephone
Company filed a complaint with the country's Labor Relations Board,
alleging that the strike was a violation of the company's
bargaining agreements with its two unions. The PRTC asked the board
to order the strikers back to work.
	   Crowds were smaller on picket lines Friday, and by midday, there
was no repeat of Thursday's clashes between strikers and police.
Union leaders met with police Chief Pedro Toledo to discuss ways to
prevent more violence.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale of 50 percent plus one
share of the telephone company on Thursday, the same day 6,400
company workers went on strike. Union leaders fear layoffs under
GTE control.
	   The House of Representatives is expected to approve the sale
next week.
	   Rossello, whose administration has sold hotels and a shipping
company and has courted private investment in the power industry,
says a state-owned telephone company cannot compete in the newly
open Puerto Rico market.
	   PRTC had a monopoly in this U.S. commonwealth of 3.8 million
people until 1996. Now it faces competition from private firms and
has been forced to cut rates.
	   PRTC employees were threatened with disciplinary actions by both
sides in the labor conflict.
	   The company's management has said workers could be disciplined
for participating in what it called an ``illegal strike.'' Union
leaders, meanwhile, threatened to impose fines of up to dlrs 5,000
for members who don't honor picket lines.
	   Strikers also protested outside some branches of Banco Popular,
Puerto Rico's largest bank. Its parent, Popular Inc., is part of
the GTE-led consortium.

India and Pakistan show no signs of abandoning nuclear programs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCLUDES material from India-Credit. EDITS to conform
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government on Friday
downplayed U.S. sanctions levied in response to nuclear tests it
conducted last month, and neither it nor Pakistan showed any signs
of reconsidering their nuclear programs.
	   India denounced the sanctions as ``coercive'' interference with
free trade.
	   The Pakistani government had no immediate reaction. But a
statement issued hours before the sanctions were published Thursday
said Islamabad would pursue its nuclear program to maintain the
balance with India.
	   India exploded five underground nuclear devices last month,
prompting neighboring Pakistan to retaliate with what it said were
six nuclear tests a few weeks later.
	   Elaborating on sanctions announced earlier by President Bill
Clinton, Washington said Thursday it was canceling nonhumanitarian
aid to India and Pakistan, suspending delivery of defense material
and dual-use items, prohibiting bank loans to the governments, and
blocking new credit guarantees for private loans.
	   The State Department estimated the two countries would lose a
total of dlrs 4 billion in international bank loans.
	   Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called the sanctions ``a
minor roadblock'' toward better U.S.-Indian relations, but said it
was too early to assess the impact. Commerce Minister Ramakrishna
Hegde said trade would be unaffected.
	   The U.S. government wants India and Pakistan to put their
nuclear programs on hold and refrain from deploying nuclear-capable
missiles.
	   ``These sanctions are less harsh than what we were
anticipating,'' said Pakistani stock broker Farhan Mahmood in
Karachi. ``People feared heavy trade sanctions. That could have
been disastrous.''
	   But Mahbub-ul Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister who now
heads an independent development research center, said tough
sanctions could force Islamabad to sell nuclear technology for
cash.
	   ``There's nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately poor
nation to the economic brink,'' he said.
	   Rajesh Shah, president of the influential Confederation of
Indian Industry, cautioned India not to retaliate against U.S.
companies operating in India.
	   The two companies that would be hit hardest by the denial of
U.S. loan guarantees are Enron Corp., which is building a massive
power project in western India, and Boeing, which is bidding to
upgrade Air India's fleet. Both could raise capital in
international financial markets at marginally higher costs,
industrialists said.
	   The sanctions will affect cash-strapped Pakistan more than
India, which has a comfortable reserve of foreign exchange.
	   Pakistan declared a state of emergency to combat the sanctions.
It may default on payments of its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt if
the International Monetary Fund is blocked from extending future
loans, financial analysts have said.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc., the company that publishes
ratings on companies according to their ability to repay their
debts, lowered India's sovereign credit rating Friday after the
United States unveiled the sanctions _ but the government preached
calm.
	   ``There is no need to panic,'' Sinha said.
	   ``Perhaps some countries want to bring us under the defense
umbrella and do you want us to kneel down?'' Sinha was quoted as
saying by Press Trust of India. ``The world will not come crashing
down because of such downgradings.''

Hariri criticizes Turkish-Israeli rapproachment

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on
Friday criticized Turkey's growing ties with Israel, saying they go
against the interests of both the Arabs and the Turkish people.
	   ``We have historical relations with Turkey and we respect the
Turkish people,'' Hariri told reporters. ``But we feel sorry for
the rapproachment between Israel and Turkey. We think this is not
only against the Arab interesta but also it is against the
interests of the Turkish people.''
	   Despite Arab opposition, Turkey and Israel have been moving to
improve their commercial ties and improve bilateral relations.
	   An agreement that foresees the establishment of a free trade
zone by Jan. 1, 2000 went into effect last year. Turkish officials
said last month that the two countries are on course to triple
trade to 2 dlrs billion in the coming years.
	   Iran and Arab nations have also criticized Turkey's military
agreements with Israel, including joint military maneuvers last
January with U.S participation.
	   ``We hope that one day Turkey will find out that their relations
are with the Arab world, not with Israel,'' Hariri said.
	   Hariri, speaking to reporters after a meeting with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, also denied allegations that the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is operating out of bases in
Lebanon.
	   The PKK has been fighting Turkish troops since 1984 to win
autonomy for the minority Kurds in southeastern Turkey.
	   Independent reports say the group has military camps in eastern
Lebanon, where the Syrian army has thousands of troops. This has
been denied by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is believed to
shuttle between Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley and neighboring
Syria.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it,'' Hariri said of the PKK.
``They are not based in Lebanon and the Turkish administration,
they know that. They know it very well.''
	   Hariri said Lebanon ``is very clean of any act against any other
friendly country.''

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Seeking to defuse anger in Canada's poorest
region, the federal government said Friday it will spend another
dlrs 730 million (dlrs 496 million U.S.) to aid East Coast
fishermen and fish-plant workers who lost jobs when cod stocks
collapsed.
	   The government also announced a dlrs 400 million (dlrs 272
million U.S.) program for the reeling salmon industry on Canada's
Pacific Coast. The money will be used to promote conservation of
dwindling salmon stocks and buy back fishing licenses to reduce the
number of fishermen.
	   The East Coast fish workers _ most of them in Newfoundland _
have staged repeated protests in recent months as the government
tried to cut short the original dlrs 1.9 billion (dlrs 1.3 billion
U.S.) relief program.

Prince William challenges the press on privacy promises protect privacy, agreement reached. EDITS to conform. Material below dash is embargoed until 2301 GMT

Eds: RECASTS lead to raise reference to 16th birthday, pledge to
By JENNY E. HELLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As his 16th birthday approaches, Prince William
feels some of the attention he is getting from Britain's press is
just too personal.
	   After Princess Diana died in a car crash while paparazzi pursued
her, the British press pledged to respect the privacy of William,
her eldest son, and his brother, 13-year-old Harry.
	   On Friday, Buckingham Palace said that William and a tabloid
newspaper had ``amicably resolved'' the first complaint lodged by
the young prince against the media.
	   The offending article: William was angered by a supplement
published in The Mail on Sunday that speculated at length about his
private thoughts and feelings. Royal spokeswoman Sandy Henney said
the palace especially objected to the newspaper's assertion that
William would evaluate young women and then tell his private
secretary to invite some to tea.
	   Henney said that simply wasn't true.
	   ``He is still only a young man,'' Ms. Henney said. ``We felt
that the suppositions had been intrusive to his privacy by printing
things that were inaccurate.''
	   The Mail on Sunday said it would not be publishing an apology or
retraction in relation to William's complaint, but editors there
would not comment further.
	   In January, in the wake of the furor following Diana's Aug. 31
death in a Paris car crash, the commission revamped the newspaper
code of conduct _ including a clause protecting the privacy of
celebrities' children.
	   The code may offer some protection for William against Britain's
raucous tabloids, which will be under pressure _ from both
politicians and from some of their readers _ not to break the code,
but it is unlikely to offer much defense against international
paparazzi who sell pictures worldwide.
	   And William is already shaping up to be as big a celebrity as
Diana. The prince, whose height, rosy cheeks and coy smile have
reminded some of his mother, wowed teen-age girls who wolf-whistled
him when William visited Canada in March with Prince Harry and
father Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
	   Lord Wakeham, chairman of the press commission, issued a
statement Friday noting that as William becomes older, ``articles
and features about the prince are increasingly likely to contain
personal details about him which would over time undermine the
significant respect for his privacy that we have built up.''
	   ____
	   Though the palace zealously guards the privacy of the future
king, it did consent to allow William to answer written questions
from Press Association, the domestic British news agency.
	   William told PA he will celebrate Sunday's birthday _ his first
since his mother's death _ quietly with friends, talking to his
family on the phone.
	   A techno-music fan and avid reader, William said he plans to
study geography, biology and art history at Eton, the elite
preparatory school he has attended since 1996.
	   The prince, described as gifted academically, said he has not
yet decided which university he will attend. Historically, members
of the royal family have received degrees from Oxford.
	   Quite the sportsman, William said he enjoys rugby, soccer,
swimming, water polo and tennis.

Yemeni tribesmen hold seven Italian tourists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen are holding seven Italian
tourists hostage and are demanding the financing of local projects
in return for their release, officials said Friday.
	   Five armed tribesmen kidnapped the tourists Thursday while the
group was traveling through Shabwa, 530 kilometers (329 miles)
southeast of the capital San`a, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The abductors, from the al-Marazeeq tribe, initially kidnapped
nine Italian tourists in total _ 5 men and 4 women _ but later
freed two of the women who had fallen ill, the officials said.
	   The women received medical attention and were on their way to
San`a.
	   The kidnapping was planned by Mohammed Haidarah Mashhour, a
prominent member of the tribe, and the tourists were being held in
a mountainous area in Shabwa, the officials said. The identities
and ages of the tourists were not revealed.
	   Officials from the Italian embassy were not available for
comment.
	   Yemeni tribes have frequently kidnapped tourists, oil workers
and diplomats to press their demands for money or government
financing of projects. The tourists have all been released
unharmed.
	   Yemen, a country on the southwest corner of the Arabian
Peninsula, is one of the Arab world's poorest countries.

World Cup: Spain on brink of elimination after 0-0 tie 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Spain stood on the brink of a
humiliating first round elimination from the World Cup Friday after
it was held to a 0-0 tie by Paraguay.
	   The Spaniards, strongly favored to reach the quarterfinal at
least, forced Paraguay's star goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert to
make several top-class saves.
	   But Juan Pizzi, Luis Enrique and Raul Gonzalez couldn't find the
target and Javier Clemente's team is in serious danger of going out
in the opening round.
	   Having already lost 3-2 to Nigeria, the Spaniards have only one
point but at least moved up to third place in Groupn D, above
Bulgaria on goals scored.
	   ``It still depends on us,'' said coach Javier Clemente.
``Wednesday will be like the final. But if we beat Bulgaria and
Nigeria do what they did to us against Paraguay, we can still make
it.''
	   The result means that the Nigerians, who downed Bulgaria 1-0 at
Parc des Princes earlier Friday, clinch first place while the
Paraguayans, who haven't seen a goal scored in two 0-0 ties, are
best placed to join them in round two.
	   ``It was a very difficult game for both teams,'' said Paraguay's
coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani. ``Spain was under a lot of pressure.
But we had a few chances and I think it was a just result.
	   ``Now we play the best team in the group, Nigeria, and we will
go all out for the best result for Paraguay, that is to win,'' said
the Brazilian.
	   Paraguay has two points and Bulgaria and Spain have one each
while the Nigerians have already qualified for the second round
after two victories.
	   In the final group games next Wednesday, Spain meets Bulgaria at
Lens and Paraguay faces Nigeria at Toulouse.
	   ``We now we depend on others. It hurts but that's the way the
competition goes,'' said Spanish forward Kiko Narvaez.
	   Clemente made five changes after the 3-2 loss to Nigeria when
his team twice lost the lead but they still didn't pay off.
	   ``I think we're as strong as we can be but just missing spark,''
he said.
	   Clemente described the players as being ``infuriated'' by what
has happened.
	   ``We played our hearts out against Nigeria and lost. Today we
took a battering although we dominated. Let's hope on Wednesday
luck finally shines for us,'' said the 48-year-old Basque.
	   A chance fell to Pizzi in the 21st minute when the Paraguayan
defense failed to clear a cross. The striker headed powerfully
goalwards from 12 meters but Chilavert punched the ball
acrobatically behind for a corner.
	   After Zubizarreta had punched away a powerfully-struck 25-meter
shot from Benitez, Paraguay won a free kick 30 meters out and
'keeper Chilavert, who has scored three times for his country,
moved up to take a shot at goal.
	   His well-hit free kick hit the defensive wall and deflected to
Francisco Arce whose 12-meter shot was deflected for a corner.
	   In the final minute of the first half, Spanish striker Raul
wriggled clear of the defense and shot from eight meters only for
Chilavert to dive to his right to got his hand to the ball.
	   Pizzi ran in to try and force the ball home but Celso Ayala got
in a tackle to sweep the ball away.
	   Early in the second half, Zubizarreta saved a low shot from the
ever dangerous Benitez and then dived full stretch to his left to
keep out a curling shot from the same player in the 63rd minute.
	   At the other end, Chilavert pushed a shot from Luis Enrique over
the bar and the Spanish midfielder came up with a close range
header which the Paraguayan 'keeper again tipped over the top.
	   Coach Clemente made three changes in the second half including
replacing Raul with Atletico Madrid's Kiko Narvaez.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta; Rafael Alkorta, Abelardo Fernandez
(Alberto Celades, 56th), Sergi Barjuan, Carlos Aguilera; Raul
Gonzalez (Kiko Narvaez 66th), Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor, Luis
Enrique Martinez, Joseba Exteberria; Juan Pizzi (Francisco
Morientes, 53rd).
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Denis Caniza, Roberto Acuna (Julio
Cesar Yegros, 74th), Miguel Angel Benitez, Julio Cesar Enciso;
Aristides Rojas (Cesar Ramirez, 84th), Jorge Campos (Carlos
Paredes, 46th).
	   Referee _ Ian McLeod, South Africa.

	   LONDON (AP) _ As his 16th birthday approaches, Prince William

Demonstrators and police clash for second day in Guyana throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quote from PNC leader Desmond Hoyte; EDITS
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A disorganized crowd of a few hundred
anti-government protesters clashed with police for a second day in
the center of this capital city, eyewitnesses reported Friday.
	   The opposition People's National Congress party announced Friday
evening that it would begin organizing and sponsoring the protests,
which to date have been sporadic and disorganized.
	   ``The PNC, though it did not organize these marches, will adopt
the people's protests and give some order to these
demonstrations,'' said Desmond Hoyte, the party president and
losing candidate in the December presidential election.
	   The violence initially erupted Thursday over a breakdown in
power-sharing talks between the PNC and President Janet Jagan's
People's Progressive Party.
	   The opposition party, which is backed by Guyanese of African
descent, claims the Dec. 15 elections were rigged by Jagan's party,
which has its power base among the East Indian ethnic majority. An
audit by the 15-member Caribbean Community economic bloc on June 2
said the vote was fair.
	   Virtually all businesses in the center of the city were closed
Friday and most had protective metal plates covering their doors
and windows.
	   Scuffles broke out between heavily armed police and protesters,
who chanted anti-government slogans, and several demonstrators were
arrested.
	   Police fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowds, estimated
at about 350 people and growing in the early afternoon.
	   Information on the number of people arrested and reports of
injuries was not immediately available.
	   ``Businesses are hurting very much,'' said Chandradatt Mohabir,
manager of the Sears store downtown, which was heavily barricaded.
``I haven't done anything today or yesterday.''

World Cup: Spain on brink of elimination after 0-0 tie 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Spain started out among the
favorites. Only two games into the World Cup it looks close to
being among the first to go home.
	   In a match that left they dangling on the edge of first round
elimination, the Iberians found themselves snarled in a 0-0 draw
against South American underdog Paraguay who proved more than
capable of neutralizing the so-called `Red Fury' of Spain.
	   Being close to home in the southern half of France, the
Spaniards had a majority of the near 36,000 crowd at the
Geoffroy-Guichard stadium cheering in support at the start of the
game. At the end they heard deafening farewell booing as they left
the pitch while Paraguayans celebrated another goal-less tie.
	   Having already lost 3-2 to Nigeria, Spain has only one point but
at least moved up to third place in Group D, above Bulgaria on
goals scored.
	   In the final group games next Wednesday, Spain meets Bulgaria at
Lens and Paraguay faces Nigeria at Toulouse.
	   ``It still depends on us,'' said coach Javier Clemente.
``Wednesday will be like the final. But if we beat Bulgaria and
Nigeria do what they did to us against Paraguay, we can still make
it.''
	   Nigeria, who downed Bulgaria 1-0 at Parc des Princes earlier
Friday, stays first with six points while the Paraguayans, who
haven't seen a goal scored in two 0-0 ties, have two points and are
best placed to join them in round two.
	   ``It was a very difficult game for both teams,'' said Paraguay's
coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani. ``Spain was under a lot of pressure.
But we had a few chances and I think it was a just result.
	   ``Now we play the best team in the group, Nigeria, and we will

the Brazilian.
	   The Spaniards, who started the tournament as group favorites and
were tipped to make the quarterfinal at least, only rarely put
Paraguay's star goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert to work.
	   Spain started off nervous and lacking in coordination and it was
Paraguay which created the first danger in the 15th minute when a
low, 25-meter (yard) free kick by Miguel Angel Benitez got through
the defensive wall but was confidently held by 'keeper Andoni
Zubizarreta
	   Spain looked as if it might have gained some composure after the
first 20 minutes and its first clear chance came when striker Juan
Pizzi headed powerfully goalwards from 12 meters but Chilavert
punched the ball for a corner.
	   Luis Enrique Martinez and Raul Gonzalez had several other
chances but never seriously looked to worry Chilavert.
	   Clemente made five changes after the 3-2 loss to Nigeria when
his team twice gave up a lead but they still didn't pay off.
Paraguay with Celsio Ayala strong in defense and Roberto Acuna
impressive in midfield hassled Spain relentlessly.
	   But despite the never-ending penetrating runs of Benitez up
front and Francisco on the wing, the South Americans, proved farely
ineffectual in their finishing.
	   Chilavert, Paraguay's principal free kick taker, had roused
speculation he might set a cup record by being the first 'keeper to
score. But his only attempt came early in the first half when he
fired from 30 meters only to have it deflected off the wall.
	   In the final minute of the first half, Spanish striker Raul
wriggled clear of the defense and shot from eight meters but
Chilavert dived and got his right to got his hand to the ball.
	   The second half was virtual repetition.
	   In the 58th minute, Zubizarreta saved a low shot from the ever
dangerous Benitez and then dived full stretch to his left to keep
out a curling shot from the same player in the 63rd.
	   At the other end, Chilavert pushed a shot from Luis Enrique over
the bar and the Spanish midfielder came up with a close range
header which the Paraguayan 'keeper fingered over the bar.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta; Rafael Alkorta, Abelardo Fernandez
(Alberto Celades, 56th), Sergi Barjuan, Carlos Aguilera; Raul
Gonzalez (Kiko Narvaez 66th), Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor, Luis
Enrique Martinez, Joseba Exteberria; Juan Pizzi (Francisco
Morientes, 53rd).
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Denis Caniza, Roberto Acuna (Julio
Cesar Yegros, 74th), Miguel Angel Benitez, Julio Cesar Enciso;
Aristides Rojas (Cesar Ramirez, 84th), Jorge Campos (Carlos
Paredes, 46th).
	   Referee _ Ian McLeod, South Africa.

By BRUCE MEYERSON
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Whether or not this week's booster shot from the
United States helps steer the Asian economy toward recovery, the
damage to second-quarter profits is done.
	   Even as Wall Street celebrated Wednesday's move by the Federal
Reserve to bolster the Japanese yen, boosting the Dow industrials
as much as 227 points, the corporate casualties of the Asian fiscal
crisis continued to pile up.
	   With less than two weeks to go in the second quarter, 214
companies had already warned by Thursday that they won't meet Wall
Street profit forecasts for the three-month period, according to
the securities research firm First Call.
	   Considering that the pace of these company confessionals usually
picks up toward the end of every quarter, the final tally of profit
warnings seems sure to blow past last year's second-quarter total
of 223.
	   Analysts, meanwhile, have been busy tempering their
second-quarter projections: combined, the 500 companies that
comprise the Standard and Poor's 500 index are now expected to show
only 4 percent profit growth compared with the same period last
year.
	   That projection has been slashed from 12.9 percent at the
beginning of the year, 6 percent at the beginning of the quarter,
and 5.2 percent just 10 days ago, First Call said.
	   ``The two things that really concern us here is that we're
seeing an acceleration in downward revisions (by analysts) over
last couple of weeks and that the pre-announcements (by companies)
are running more negative than usual,'' said Chuck Hill, director
of research at First Call.
	   ``I try not to sound too bearish, but it's hard not to get
concerned about the impact of Asia,'' said Hill. ``We've talked
about this possibility for some time, but there's more and more of
an indication that the impact on U.S. corporate earnings may be
deeper and longer than anyone thought.''
	   No wonder, then, that Wednesday's momentum didn't carry through
to Thursday and Friday. After watching the Dow slide 207 points on
Monday, most investors were happy enough to see the market recoup
those losses so quickly.
	   But no one was pretending that Wednesday's events represented
any sudden resolution to all the worries that have been haunting
the market for months, preventing any burst of optimism from
developing into a rally.
	   The market is ``focusing on what second-quarter earnings will be
and the outlook for the remainder of the year, and that doesn't
have a lot to do with the Fed intervention,'' said Richard E.
Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore,
asserting that overseas business conditions aren't his only
concern.
	   ``Asia is being cited as a cover by a lot of companies. But
we've noticed that (domestic business) has become quite spotty,''
said Cripps. ``High-end auto sales and housing are doing very well.
But for other businesses competing on price, the sales we are
seeing are not quite as strong.''
	   For now, though, the profit outlook for U.S.-oriented businesses
remains fairly optimistic. According to First Call, retailing
companies have seen the largest number of upward revisions in
profit forecasts by industry analysts.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 100.14 to
8,712.87, closing the week 122.07 lower.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 fell 5.72 to 1,100.65 on Friday, but
still finished the week 1.81 points higher.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 8.59 to
1,781.29 on Friday, extending the week's gain to 36.24.
	   Among other popular indexes, the New York Stock Exchange
composite fell 3.57 to 563.92 on Friday, losing 2.75 for the week;
the American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.63 to 693.97, down
3.43 for the week; and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies
fell 1.32 to 438.47, a loss of 3.17 for the week.
	   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index _ which represents the
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues _
ended the week at dlrs 10.326 trillion, up dlrs 200.41 billion from
last week. A year ago, the index stood at dlrs 8.485 trillion.

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs GUYANA: Protesters clash with police for second day 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A disorganized crowd of a few hundred
anti-government protesters clashed with police for a second day in
the center of this capital city, eyewitnesses reported Friday.
	   The opposition People's National Congress party announced Friday
evening that it would begin organizing and sponsoring the protests,
which to date have been sporadic and disorganized.
	   ``The PNC, though it did not organize these marches, will adopt
the people's protests and give some order to these
demonstrations,'' said Desmond Hoyte, the party president and
losing candidate in the December presidential election.
	   Virtually all businesses in the center of the city were closed
Friday and most had protective metal plates covering their doors
and windows.
	   Scuffles broke out between heavily armed police and protesters,
who chanted anti-government slogans, and several demonstrators were
arrested.
	   Police fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowds, estimated
at about 350 people and growing in the early afternoon.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government remains firm as strike enters second day
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello vowed to press
ahead with plans to sell a controlling interest in the state-owned
telephone company as a protest strike entered its second day
Friday.
	   ``The transaction is already done,'' Rossello said, discounting
any chance that the telephone workers' strike could derail the dlrs
1.9 billion sale to private investors led by GTE Corporation.
	   On Friday morning, the PRTC management filed a complaint with
the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Board, alleging that the strike was
a violation of the company's bargaining agreements with its two
unions. The PRTC asked the board to order the strikers back to
work.
	   Crowds were smaller on picket lines Friday, and by midday there
was no repeat of Thursday's clashes between strikers and police.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Woman held on charges of violating Cuba embargo
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A Venezuelan woman who had a ticket to fly to
Greece on the day she was charged with violating the Cuban trade
embargo will get a chance to go free on bond, but at a high cost.
	   U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Brown refused to hold Dipsty
Molina Tamayo, 39, of Parkland without bond for trial as the
prosecution asked, but set dlrs 1 million bond after concluding she
didn't disclose all of her assets.
	   The planned trip to Greece was a family vacation, and Ms. Molina
would have fled earlier if she wanted to because she had been aware
of the investigation for two months, defense attorney Jonathan
Goodman argued.
	   Still, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Kozak, who said he believes
Ms. Molina is shielding assets overseas, was granted a stay. That
was so he could decide whether he would appeal the bond decision.
	   Ms. Molina and a cousin, Maritza Villavicencio, 35, of Miami,
were arrested Tuesday on charges they bought dlrs 4.8 million worth
of cement in Cuba and shipped it to Brazil through a business run
from their homes.
 &UR; SURINAME: Pact signed with U.S. to fight smuggling
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ This South American country has
signed an agreement to allow U.S. forces to pursue smuggling
suspects into Suriname's territorial waters.
	   The United States has reached similar agreements with other
Caribbean countries in an effort to strengthen its drug
interdiction efforts, but Suriname was reluctant to sign the accord
for fear it would infringe upon its sovereignty.
	   Other Caribbean countries have criticized the United States for
pressing for the so-called ``shiprider'' agreements while ignoring
the other problems of the region's small nations, including the
economic conditions that encourage smuggling.
	   In addition to drug smuggling, Suriname has experienced problems
with piracy in its waters. Pirates in speedboats have robbed
fishing boats of their catch and money and some fishermen have been
seriously wounded.

Labor announces new lords to sit in Britain's upper chamber 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Labor government announced Friday the
appointment of 27 new lords to Britain's unelected upper chamber,
helping to reduce the main opposition Conservative party's inbuilt
majority.
	   The new members of the House of Lords, 18 of which are Labor
supporters, included a 34-year-old Asian millionaire, Waheed Alli,
and Britain's best-known arts broadcaster, Melvyn Bragg. Prime
Minister Tony Blair also included businessmen and trade union
officials.
	   William Hague, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party,
nominated five new peers, including former Treasury chief Norman
Lamont. The third Liberal Democrat party nominated four new peers.
	   Labor is pledged within the next four years to strip the mainly
Conservative hereditary peers of the right to vote in the House of
Lords. Of the 772 hereditary peers in the Lords, 327 are declared
Conservatives and only 15 are Laborites. The rest belong to
minority parties or no party, and many seldom or never attend.
	   That would leave only life peers - who cannot pass the titles
onto their children - and most of them are political appointees.
Working life peers are expected to attend the House of Lords
regularly, contribute to debates and vote with their parties.

Police checking complaint from ex-girlfriend of Marlins pitcher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Investigators are waiting to talk to Florida
Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez before deciding whether to charge
him with beating his ex-girlfriend, ripping a gold chain off her
neck and holding her against her will.
	   The MVP in last year's World Series will be questioned when he
returns to Miami on Wednesday after games in New York and St.
Petersburg, police spokesman Angel Calzadilla said Friday.
	   Alina Elgarresta, 25, told officers that Hernandez ripped the
chain off her neck during an argument over car keys last Saturday
and that he had hit her in the past. She also said the pitcher kept
her in his car for three hours last Friday and at one point pulled
her into the car by her hair.
	   Hernandez's agent, Juan Iglesias, dismissed the complaints and
said Elgarresta had refused to give the player back a Porsche he
had let her use while they were dating.
	   Hernandez, 23, signed a dlrs 6.6 million contract with the
Marlins three months after defecting from Cuba in 1995.

GM to halt Mexico production for World Cup soccer match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ General Motors Corp.'s Mexican unit
said it will suspend operations at two plants Saturday to allow
employees to see Mexico play Belgium in a World Cup soccer match,
but will resume activity Monday.
	   The announcement contradicts a press report that production will
be suspended Saturday at the Silao plant in the central state of
Guanajuato due to a shortage of components caused by the strike in
the United States.
	   Production will be halted Saturday at the Guanajuato plant and
at the Ramos Arizpe plant in the northeastern state of Coahuila,
said company spokeswoman Maria Eugenia Santiago.
	   The GM unit acknowledged the strike has caused ``a chain
reaction ... throughout the organization,'' but said GM's Mexican
operations have not yet been interrupted by the strike and that
they are monitoring inventory to maintain production as long as
possible.
	   Meanwhile, Delphi Automotive Systems, a unit of GM, said it has
idled 21,397 workers at 25 plants in Mexico due to canceled orders
by GM plants in the U.S. that have been affected by the strike.
	   Some idled workers are being offered training at full-pay while
the rest receive about 50 to 60 percent of their normal salary,
Delphi spokesman Michael Hissam said. GM has about 12,000 employees
in Mexico and Delphi has about 75,000, according to the companies.

Els plans to skip a week to protect his back AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Ernie Els says his back is feeling OK, but
he plans to skip the Western Open in suburban Chicago next week
just to be sure.
	   Els withdrew from the Buick Classic last week because of back
spasms, putting in doubt his chances of defending his U.S. Open
title. But his back, which had been sore for a few weeks, has been
cooperating so far this week.
	   ``I can feel it still, but I don't want to think about it. I'm
over the worst,'' he said. ``I'll take off next week, then play the
Irish Open and the British Open. I've really got to take some rest
now. I don't want to play a major with a back problem.''
	   Els struggled in the first two rounds of the Open. He shot a
5-over 75 on Thursday, and got as high as eight over early Friday
before recovering to shoot even par for the second round.
	   Though that's not the start he had hoped for, Els figures it's
better than the last time he defended a U.S. Open title. He won in
1994, earning dlrs 320,000 when he defeated Colin Montgomerie and
Loren Roberts in a playoff.
	   The next year, he missed the cut and pocketed dlrs 1,000.
	   Els said he's been relatively satisfied with most of his game
this week at The Olympic Club, but his play on the greens has let
him down.
	   ``My putter is probably still in South Africa or something,'' he
said. ``I just haven't putted well this week.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CHANGING GREEN: &LR;  The 18th green at The Olympic Club was so hard
during Thursday's first round that golfers decided they'd play it
safe and try to play short of the hole in Friday's second round.
	   The only problem is that groundskeepers watered the green Friday
morning, making it soft and leaving approach shots short of the
hole.
	   ``It was quite strange. The green was very firm yesterday. I hit
a shot yesterday that bounced past the hole. Friday, it spun
back,'' said Jeff Maggert, who was among the leaders after two
rounds. ``Normally, you like to have the golf course play
consistently from day to day.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JACK'S PRAISE: &LR;  There has been plenty of criticism from golfers
this week about the difficulty of The Olympic Club course, with
U.S. Open competitors complaining about everything from the depth
of the rough to the placement of pins.
	   But Jack Nicklaus, who has won four Opens, said he's happy the
USGA makes the tournament such a challenge.
	   ``The U.S. Open, to me, is a complete examination,'' he said.
``Power and accuracy combined with touch is what this game is all
about _ keeping the ball in play and playing the game with
discipline. I love disciplined golf.''
	   Brad Faxon, who was one over after the first two rounds, said
there's very little separating success and failure on the course.
	   ``The difference is so small it's unbelievable. I don't think
the normal person can understand,'' he said. ``A few putts lipping
in or lipping out. A few shots just missing the fairway. There's
not much of a physical difference.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SUCCEEDING AT HOME: &LR;  Lee Porter, among the second-round leaders
in his U.S. Open debut, is not exactly a big name on the PGA Tour.
In fact, his name has much more connection with several other golf
tours.
	   Porter, from Greensboro, N.C., played on the Asian Tour in
1990-92 and 1994-96. He also has played on the Canadian Tour, the
South American Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japanese Tour and
the Nike Tour.
	   But he moved among the leaders Friday when his second shot on 18
landed about 15 feet from the cup and then rolled in for an eagle.
	   That left him at one under, a pretty impressive score from a guy
who has missed the cut in eight of his 16 PGA Tour events so far
this season.
	   ``Is this a dream or hallucination? I don't even know what to
think,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Nick Faldo already had his mind on other things, such as
the Irish Open on July 2-5, after finishing the first two rounds at
9-over 149. ``Bad putter is all you need to know,'' he said. ``I'll
see you in Ireland.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top political leader of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians appealed Friday for direct NATO intervention in
the province, fearing that Serbian forces are readying new attacks
on his people. ``NATO should undertake all possible measures to
prevent further massacres and protect the people of Kosovo,''
Ibrahim Rugova said in Pristina, the capital of the southern
Serbian province. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1. Ignoring NATO's show of force over the Balkans on Monday,
Serbian leaders have been reinforcing their army and special police
forces in the province, estimated by NATO sources at 45,000 to
50,000. Serb forces have sealed the border with Albania _ cutting
off an escape route for refugees _ while reportedly continuing to

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government on Friday
downplayed U.S. sanctions levied in response to nuclear tests it
conducted last month, and neither it nor Pakistan showed any signs
of reconsidering their nuclear programs. India denounced the
sanctions as ``coercive'' interference with free trade. The
Pakistani government had no immediate reaction. But a statement
issued hours before the sanctions were published Thursday said
Islamabad would pursue its nuclear program to maintain the balance
with India. India exploded five underground nuclear devices last
month, prompting neighboring Pakistan to retaliate with what it
said were six nuclear tests a few weeks later. Washington said
Thursday it was canceling nonhumanitarian aid to India and
Pakistan, suspending delivery of defense material and dual-use
items, prohibiting bank loans to the governments, and blocking new
credit guarantees for private loans. (NUCLEAR SANCTIONS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Next week's meeting between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin may produce a
Chinese commitment to stop exporting missile technology and parts
to countries like Iran and Pakistan, a senior administration
official said Friday. ``It's possible,'' said Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
``It's one of the issues we're working on'' in last-minute
negotiations between Beijing and Washington that could result in
one of a few important security agreements in a mostly symbolic
summit. Progress also is expected on halting the spread of chemical
and biological weapons, Roth said. (US-CHINA)
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II reached out to his
flock Friday in a bid to calm a crisis in Austria's Roman Catholic
Church, rocked by dissent and sex scandals. The frail 78-year-old
John Paul was opening the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine
nation. Small crowds throughout Salzburg, a center of European
culture, came out to greet the pope on an overcast day. In the last
decade, Austrian Catholics have led a movement demanding the church
drop its requirement that priests be celibate, allow women into the
priesthood and give greater voice to lay Catholics. The ``We are
the Church'' movement gathered a half-million signatures in Austria
in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to the United States.
Demonstrations by members of the movement were expected during the
pope's visit. John Paul has never showed any intention of making
major changes in that church policy. (AUSTRIA-POPE)
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus made good Friday on its threat to
cut water and power to a diplomatic compound in a push to evict
ambassadors from the United States, France, Germany and other
nations. The former Soviet republic has been trying to force the
ambassadors out of their homes in a pleasant wooded area on the
outskirts of the capital of Minsk, claiming the compound is badly
in need of sewer and plumbing repairs. The ambassadors have
refused, saying the order violates the Vienna Convention, which
designates homes of ambassadors as territory of their countries.
The move comes two days after President Alexander Lukashenko's
government reached a reported compromise with the ambassadors
allowing diplomats to stay if they are ready to face some
``inconvenience.'' (BELARUS-SEWER WAR)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Friday, capping a volatile
week with a 100-point loss by the Dow industrials, as investors
waited to see what Japan will do at a weekend summit on the Asian
fiscal crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average surrendered an
early 49-point gain and fell 100.14 to 8,712.87. It was the third
big swing since Monday for the Dow, which plunged 207 points to
start the week and rebounded 164 points on Wednesday. By the time
the dust settled on Friday, the Dow had lost a relatively modest
122.07 for the week. Meanwhile, fears about the health of Japan's
banking system intensified Friday after a credit downgrade by
Moody's Investors Services against a major bank. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States is ready to help the yen again if
need be, but the currency will continue to languish unless Japan
moves quickly to clean up its banking system and spur the economy,
a top U.S. financial official said Friday following urgent meetings
with the Japanese. With the Japanese economy in its worst state in
decades, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Japanese
Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga met to discuss structural
reforms. The goal, from the U.S. perspective, is to make the
Japanese economy more open, accountable and consumer-friendly _
something Washington long has been advocating, often to no avail.

	   STAMFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. is buying General Re for dlrs 22 billion worth of
stock, adding one of the world's leading insurers of insurance
companies to its portfolio. Berkshire announced Friday after the
stock market closed that it would let General Re operate
independently of its other insurance operations, National Indemnity
and GEICO. News of the deal sent General Re's stock up dlrs 52 per
share to dlrs 275 in after-hours trading. Based on Friday's closing
prices, the deal is worth dlrs 283.15 per share to General Re
shareholders. Buffett, the second wealthiest American behind
Microsoft's Bill Gates, has been attracted to insurance companies
by their ability to invest premiums that are being held to pay off
future claims. (US-BERKSHIRE-GENERAL RE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects to get another dlrs 9 billion to
dlrs 10 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize its financial markets, a Finance Ministry spokesman said
Friday. An IMF delegation is due in Moscow on Monday for talks.
Russia will likely receive dlrs 6 billion to dlrs 7 billion in the
form of an extension of its existing dlrs 9.2 billion three-year
support loan, said Oleg Zhukov, spokesman for Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov. He said the Central Bank will likely get dlrs 3
billion to boost its foreign currency reserves, to protect against
any future run on the ruble. Worries about whether IMF aid will be
forthcoming pushed stocks 2.1 percent lower Friday. The ruble was
also down slightly. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi threats to stop oil sales,
the Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow Baghdad to
spend dlrs 300 million of oil-for-food revenues to buy spare parts
for its oil industry to meet increased export targets. Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad ``is not going to accept
this resolution,'' saying it could trigger the ``collapse of the
whole (oil-for-food) program.'' Iraq has argued the resolution
effectively transforms oil-for-food into an ongoing program as long
as economic sanctions against Baghdad remain in effect. (UN-IRAQ
OIL)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Seeking to defuse anger in Canada's poorest
region, the federal government said Friday it will spend another
dlrs 730 million (dlrs 496 million U.S.) to aid East Coast
fishermen and fish-plant workers who lost jobs when cod stocks
collapsed. The government also announced a dlrs 400 million (dlrs
272 million U.S.) program for the reeling salmon industry on
Canada's Pacific Coast. The money will be used to promote
conservation of dwindling salmon stocks and buy back fishing
licenses to reduce the number of fishermen. The East Coast fish
workers _ most of them in Newfoundland _ have staged repeated
protests in recent months as the government tried to cut short the
original dlrs 1.9 billion (dlrs 1.3 billion U.S.) relief program.
(CANADA-FISH BAILOUT)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Nearly 110,000 General Motors Corp. workers
across North America faced the prospect of weeks off without
paychecks Friday as talks to end two parts plant strikes dragged on
with no hint of progress. With the closure of GM's biggest assembly
plant, in Lordstown, Ohio, the automaker's North American
production was reduced to a trickle. And with United Auto Workers
leaders in Las Vegas to prepare for next week's UAW convention,
hopes for a quick settlement were dim. The strikes by about 9,200
workers in Flint have cut off the supply of key parts and resulted
in nearly 99,300 layoffs at GM assembly and component plants in the
United States, Mexico and Canada. Thousands of other workers for
independent suppliers also have been idled. (US-GM-STRIKES)

Fake birth control pills behind at least four pregnancies in Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ At least four women are pregnant after
taking what they thought were birth control pills but were actually
flour, Globo television reported.
	   Drug manufacturer Schering said the dummy pills were used to
test new a packaging machine and had been stolen from the
laboratory before they could be destroyed, Globo reported Friday
	   The company did not know how many packages of false pills were
stolen nor how they got on the market, Globo reported. All four
women purchased the birth control pills at different drug stores.
	   No one at Schering could be reached for comment.
	   The women became pregnant in March and April. A subsequent
examination of their birth control pills revealed the packages had
no date. Instead of a serial number, there was only a single digit
repeated over and over again.
	   The women, all married with children, said they were considering
suing the manufacturer.
	   ``I don't know how the laboratory can ever compensate for us?
Unless, maybe they pay for the education of the children,'' said
one of the unidentified mothers.

World Cup: Underdog Paraguay puts Spain on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous, adds fresh quotes
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ It was a game that both Spain and
the some 36,000 spectators will want to forget fast.
	   A giant in club soccer and a team up to recently tipped to make
the World Cup quarterfinal at least, Spain found itself a hair's
breath away from first-round elimination following an 0-0 draw
Friday against South American small fry Paraguay.
	   The game and the zero scoreline exasperated the attending crowd
who gradually passed from raucous cheers of support at the
beginning to deafening boos of disapproval on the final whistle.
	   Having already lost 3-2 to Nigeria, Spain has only one point but
nonetheless moves up to No. 3 in Group D, above Bulgaria on goal
difference.
	   It's fate in the tournament depends entirely on final group
games next Wednesday when it meets Bulgaria at Lens and Paraguay
faces Nigeria at Toulouse.
	   ``Paraguay came at us with all its arms,'' said Spanish coach
Javioer Clemente. '' They are an extraordinary team. It's system
may not be ambitious but it closes doors.
	   ``It still depends on us,'' he said. ``Against Bulgaria the
players will bust their guts.''
	   Paraguay, which started out as one of the group's underdogs
playing its first World Cup finals since 1986, now looks in a
strong position to go through with Nigeria.
	   As the Spaniards left the pitch with heads down in dismay, the
Paraguayans celebrated.
	   ``Tonight's draw suited us,'' said Paraguay's coach Paulo Cesar
Carpeggiani. '' Now its depends on us to get through to the next
round.''
	   ``Now we play the best team in the group _ Nigeria _ and we will
go all out for the best result,'' said the Brazilian.
	   Nigeria, who downed Bulgaria 1-0 at Parc des Princes earlier
Friday, stays first with six points while the Paraguayans, who
haven't seen a goal scored in two 0-0 ties, have two.
	   After suffering a barrage of criticism for his playing strategy
in the Nigerian game, Clemente made five lineup changes to face
Paraguay. But the team appeared extremely unsure of itself and
lacking in crucial midfield coordination.
	   Spain went into the World Cup bubbling with confidence and with
a record of just one defeat in 34 outings but the World Cup
performances are likely to lead to calls for his dismissal.
	   Paraguay with Celsio Ayala strong in defense and Roberto Acuna
impressive in midfield hassled Spain relentlessly but will have to
sharpen up its attack if it is to puncture Nigeria.
	   Spain started off nervous and lacking in coordination and it was
Paraguay which created the first danger in the 15th minute when a
low, 25-meter (yard) free kick by Miguel Angel Benitez got through
the defensive wall but was confidently held by 'keeper Andoni
Zubizarreta
	   Juan Pizzi, Luis Enrique Martinez and Raul Gonzalez had several
chances but never seriously worried Paraguayan 'keeper Jose Luis
Chilavert.
	   For Paraguay, the never-ending penetrating runs of Benitez up
front and Francisco Arce on the wing looked impressive but equally
failed to shake veteran goalie Andoni Zubizarreta.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Dazed by weeks on the campaign
trail, politicians made a last round of crazy promises Saturday,
hours before initial results in early parliamentary elections were
expected.
	   Eduard Kremlicka, leader of the populist Pensioners for Secure
Living, vowed he would eat a live June bug if his party does not
make it to parliament. Leading Christian Democrat and current
Interior Minister Cyril Svoboda said he would shave his head.
	   Voting began Friday and was to resume at 7 a.m. Saturday until 2
p.m. (1200 GMT). Initial results were expected shortly afterward.
	   Heading into the elections, the Social Democrats, led by Milos
Zeman appeared poised to form the first left-of-center Czech
government since the collapse of Communism in 1989. The center-left
party led pre-election polls with more than 20 percent, at least 5
percent ahead of the second-place Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The elections are being held two years ahead of schedule, after
Klaus' center-right coalition collapsed and he resigned following a
party finance scandal last winter. A caretaker government under
banker Josef Tosovsky has been running the country.
	   But even if the Social Democrats win by a large margin, it most
likely won't be enough for a clear majority. There is little chance
that their leader Milos Zeman would join with his bitter rival
Klaus in a ``grand coalition'' of left and right.
	   Some 8.09 million people are eligible to vote for parties they
would like to see represented in the 200-seat lower chamber of the
parliament. Voters can improve individual candidates' chances of
sitting in the House of Deputies by circling their name.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel created a stir when he and his wife
voted together Friday at the local elementary school near his
country residence at Lany, outside of Prague. Officials said their
votes are valid, although Czech law stipulates secret balloting.
	   Havel is recovering from abdominal surgery he underwent in
April, and many wonder if he will be up to participating in
difficult negotiations to form a coalition expected to follow the
vote.
	   His spokesman Ladislav Spacek told state radio talks might begin
as early as Monday.
	   Five smaller parties are expected to clear the 5 percent
threshold needed for representation in parliament, including the
old guard Communists and the extreme Republicans. But all the
mainstream parties have rejected both as possible coalition
partners.
	   This leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels favored by Havel _ and the
Pensioners as potential partners.
	   The Social Democrats say ideally, they would form a coalition
with the centrist Christian Democrats who, in turn, suggest taking
on the Freedom Union.
	   But if the Freedom Union refuses to cooperate, the Social
Democrats could be forced to try and make a coalition with the
Pensioners and tacit support from the Communists.
	   Financial experts and analysts fear the possibility of a
left-wing government or political instability could weaken the
Czech koruna.

Parents of Yugoslav army soldiers demand pullback from Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the 11 years that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has dominated Serbia, Serbs have vowed
never let go of Kosovo province _ birthplace of their Orthodox
Church, touchstone of their culture.
	   But now, for the first time, Serbs are venting in public
feelings once voiced in private: Kosovo is lost to the province's
majority ethnic Albanians and Milosevic is largely to blame.
	   Parents of young army conscripts sent to Kosovo sent to fight
Kosovo Albanian militants are protesting outside the defense
ministry in Belgrade, and in the towns of Nis and Kragujevac. Some
parents even tried to march on a barracks in Kosovo, but were
stopped by police.
	   Albanian sources in Kosovo said Thursday that two soldiers,
ethnic Muslims, have deserted the army, unwilling to fight.
	   Earlier this month, the independent Belgrade daily Glas
published the last letter home from a conscript from Milosevic's
home town, one of six soldiers killed so far in fighting that has
claimed more than 300 lives _ mostly Kosovo Albanians _ since
March.
	   The letter confirmed parents' and conscripts' worse fears that
the army is helping police hit back at Kosovo Albanian militants,
sweeping through villages and using heavy artillery to blast
civilian homes.
	   ``I see no point, no reason for this war,'' said Dragan
Nevosavanovic, a parent protesting Friday in Belgrade.''We demand
that this absurd war stops and that our children be saved.''
	   He said he lost contact with his 20-year-old son Dusan three
weeks ago as the military stepped up operations in Kosovo. Dusan's
last letter home said simply, ``Get me out of here,'' his father
said.
	   ``It's lost,'' said Dusan's mother Gordana, of Kosovo.
	   The parents' protests are small. But they do dent Milosevic's
public claim that Serbia must defend Kosovo at all costs. Last
weekend, the Serbian Orthodox Church said Milosevic had lost
authority to negotiate any settlement for Kosovo, and indeed called
for his ouster and replacement by a ``council of national
salvation.''
	   Police have peacefully dispersed some parents' protests.
Officials have so far said little _ with the exception of extreme
nationalist Vojislav Seselj, now a deputy Serbian premier, who
scoffed that the parents' concern is unwarranted because ``the army
is not a kindergarten.''
	   The West wants government forces, estimated at 45,000 to 50,000
men, out of Kosovo.
	   But most parents don't see the West as an ally in their quest.
	   ``Ah, the West,'' sighed a mother who gave only her first name,
Mira. ``The Albanians have the West on their side and know they
won't be punished if they kill a Serb.''

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II is reaching out to
his flock in a bid to calm a crisis in Austria's Roman Catholic
Church, rocked by dissent and sex scandals.
	   The frail 78-year-old John Paul, stooped and using a cane,
opened the third visit of his papacy to this Alpine nation on
Friday.
	   Small crowds throughout Salzburg, a center of European culture,
came out to greet the pope on an overcast day. Small children
raised signs saying, ``We are with you.''
	   ``I have come to you in Austria to bring you words of
appreciation and encouragement,'' he told Catholics during Mass in
Salzburg's 14th-century cathedral.
	   Several times during his homily, the pope was interrupted by
strong applause. Cheers became especially loud when he said he was
confident that young people ``can again put a Christian face on the
old Europe.''
	   But not all young people responded enthusiastically.
	   ``The pope is old, I find it hard to identify with him,'' said
Anne Pichler, a 21-year-old psychology student.
	   After visiting Salzburg, the pope left for Vienna, where he was
to spend the night at the papal nuncio's residence.
	   In an indication of the dissent that has shaken Austria since
the pope's 1988 visit, two young men standing along the pope's
motorcade route held up cardboard placards reading ``Papa Go Home''
and ``We Want the Dalai Lama.''
	   In the last decade, Austrian Catholics have led a movement
demanding the church drop its requirement that priests be celibate,
allow women into the priesthood and give greater voice to lay
Catholics.
	   The ``We are the Church'' movement gathered a half-million
signatures in Austria in 1995 and spread elsewhere in Europe and to
the United States. Demonstrations by members of the movement were
expected during the pope's visit. John Paul has never showed any
intention of making major changes in that church policy.
	   The Austrian church also has been rocked by sexual scandal.
	   The pope forced Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, accused of sexually
molesting young boys, to relinquish all his duties in April. Groer
had to go into exile in Germany, but likely will be allowed to
return soon after the papal visit.
	   The pope is scheduled to beatify three people, including a nun,
Sister Restituta Kafka, who was beheaded by the Nazis in 1943.
Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ City officials will send hundreds of extra
police and inspectors into the streets Saturday when soccer fans
gather to celebrate Mexico's World Cup match with Belgium,
newspapers reported Friday.
	   Some 40 people were treated for cuts and bruises due to scuffles
and out-of-control celebrations around the Monument to Independence
following last week's 3-1 victory over South Korea.
	   Some of the police will be assigned to protect the monument,
which rises from a grassy traffic circle on the Paseo de la Reforma
boulevard in central Mexico City. The monument, topped with a
gilded angel, holds the bones of several of Mexico's independence
heroes.
	   It also has become the traditional gathering place for Mexican
soccer celebrations.
	   The chief of the district where the monument is based, Jorge
Legorreta, told the newspaper La Jornada that officials near the
site would try to ban the sales of glass or metal soft drink
containers, as well as the aerosol foam fans spray on one another.
	   ___
	   ATOTONILCO DE TULA, Mexico (AP) _ While much of Mexico struggles
with drought, heavy downpours forced hundreds of people in three
states to flee their homes, according to local news reports Friday.
	   Heavy rains in the southern state of Oaxaca on Friday damaged
100 houses in Santiago Amoltepec and forced the evacuation of 49
families in Tuxtepec, Notimex reported. Fourteen houses were
damaged by hail in the northern part of that state.
	   Rains and hail also damaged more than 100 poorly constructed
houses in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Notimex reported.
	   Meanwhile, in drought-stricken Torreon, 580 kilometers (360
miles) to the northwest, Roman Catholic Bishop Juan de Dios
Caballero said a mass appealing for rain before 5,000 worshippers,
including Coahuila Gov. Rogelio Montemayor.
	   ___
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname has signed an agreement to
allow U.S. forces to pursue smuggling suspects into its territorial
waters.
	   The United States has reached similar agreements with other
Caribbean countries in an effort to strengthen its drug
interdiction efforts, but Suriname was reluctant to sign the accord
for fear it would infringe upon its sovereignty.
	   Other Caribbean countries have criticized the United States for
pressing for the so-called ``shiprider'' agreements while ignoring
the other problems of the region's small nations, including the
economic conditions that encourage smuggling.
	   In addition to drug smuggling, Suriname has experienced problems
with piracy in its waters. Pirates in speedboats have robbed
fishing boats of their catch and money and some fishermen have been
seriously wounded.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A deputy state attorney general suspected of
threatening a U.S. consul has resigned, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Humberto Guevara resigned Thursday for ``family reasons,''
according to the Quintana Roo state attorney general's office.
	   Guevara was involved in a controversy over the U.S. decision to
pull consul David Van Valkenburg out of the region in June 1997
because of perceived death threats during an investigation into the
car-crash death of a U.S. citizen.
	   The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday quoted diplomats as saying
that Guevara told the consul: ``Drive very carefully. Not only
tourists die in car accidents.''
	   Guevara denied making any threat. Gov. Mario Villanueva also
insisted his administration had not threatened the consul. U.S.
officials said evidence of a threat ``was not conclusive.''

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECAPS pvs
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The best laid security plans cannot stop
a horde of determined hooligans from disrupting World Cup soccer,
according to British police helping prepare for Monday's match
between England and Romania.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' Tim Hollis, the top British police officer
advising the French, told a news conference Friday.
	   This southwestern city, site of the match, is the focus of
attention by World Cup officials, local authorities and police on
both sides of the English Channel.
	   A barrage of measures are being put into place to try to avoid
the kind of clashes that occurred before, during and after last
Monday's match in Marseille between England and Tunisia.
	   Marseille authorities were also bracing for possible violence
ahead of Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea,
increasing police strength.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be
sold an hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants
could remain open until 4 a.m.
	   In Toulouse, cafes and bars were forced to close at 11 p.m.
starting Thursday and continuing through Monday, instead of the
usual 2 a.m. closing time. The nationwide music festival has been
postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it, a series of other
festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of a
scuffle during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Hollis said that 200 hooligans who rampaged in Marseille have
been identified and so-call British ``spotter'' police would be on
the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   Authorities in the southern city of Montpellier on Thursday
arrested an English fan linked to the three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 80 people were detained. The suspect was
identified by English police.
	   Meanwhile, the prefect of Toulouse's Haute-Garonne region, Alain
Bidou, said Friday night that a decision has been made not to
install fences inside the stadium to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against using fences on the grounds
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise. The fences
themselves tend to breed enmity, the argument went. FIFA head Sepp
Blatter agreed.
	   French authorities had been considering using fences to control
any rowdiness by hooligans.
	   Stricter measures were also put in place in the French capital,
including banning alcohol consumption on the streets around Parc
des Princes stadium on match days.
	   Area bars will be ``asked to close'' on those days, the police
statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.

India and Pakistan show no signs of abandoning nuclear programs 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. sanctions levied in response to
nuclear tests conducted last month in the Asian subcontinent will
affect cash-strapped Pakistan, some officials believe, more than
India, which has a comfortable reserve of foreign exchange.
	   Mahbub-ul Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister who now heads
an independent development research center, said tough sanctions
could force Islamabad to sell nuclear technology for cash.
	   ``There's nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately poor
nation to the economic brink,'' he said Friday.
	   Last month, India exploded five underground nuclear devices,
prompting neighboring Pakistan to retaliate with what it said were
six nuclear tests a few weeks later.
	   Washington said Thursday it was canceling nonhumanitarian aid to
India and Pakistan, suspending delivery of defense material and
dual-use items, prohibiting bank loans to the governments, and
blocking new credit guarantees for private loans.
	   The State Department estimated the two countries would lose a
total of dlrs 4 billion in international bank loans.
	   The Indian government downplayed U.S. sanctions, saying they
were ``coercive'' interference with free trade. But neither it nor
Pakistan showed any signs of reconsidering their nuclear programs.
	   Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called the sanctions ``a
minor roadblock'' toward better U.S.-Indian relations, but said it
was too early to assess the impact. Commerce Minister Ramakrishna
Hegde said trade would be unaffected.
	   The two U.S. companies that would be hit hardest by the denial
of U.S. loan guarantees are Enron Corp., which is building a
massive power project in western India, and Boeing, which is
bidding to upgrade Air India's fleet. Both could raise capital in
international financial markets at marginally higher costs,
industrialists said.
	   Pakistan declared a state of emergency to combat the sanctions.
It may default on payments of its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt if
the International Monetary Fund is blocked from extending future
loans, financial analysts have said.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc., the company that publishes
ratings on companies according to their ability to repay their
debts, lowered India's sovereign credit rating Friday after the
United States unveiled the sanctions.

Juror convicted of obstructing justice for affair with defendant 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECAPS pvs adding background
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A 43-year-old Canadian woman
was convicted Friday of obstructing justice for having a love
affair with an accused killer while serving on the jury that
acquitted him of murder.
	   Gillian Guess showed no reaction as the verdict was read in a
packed courtroom by the foreman of a jury of six men and six women.
She will be sentenced later, and faces a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison.
	   The verdict concluded one of British Columbia's strangest
trials, marked by the unprecedented testimony of former jurors who
spoke about deliberations usually kept secret, as well as frequent
outbursts in court from the flamboyant Guess.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Guess fell in love with Peter Gill
during his 1995 murder trial and disrupted the case by acquiring
inside information and using it during jury deliberations.
	   Defense lawyer Peter Ritchie described Guess as a victim of
Gill's shrewd manipulations, suggesting the younger man played her
``like a fiddle'' in a bid to win his freedom.
	   Guess believed Gill and his fellow defendants were innocent
before the affair began, he said, and she didn't know she was doing
anything wrong.
	   After a six-month trial, Gill and five other men were acquitted
in 1995 of charges of murdering two men in what police called a
feud between rival drug gangs.
	   Police launched an investigation into Guess, who was arrested
and charged in May 1996. She ended her romance with Gill, nine
years her junior, because her bail terms barred contact with him.
	   Prosecutors are appealing the acquittals of four of the
murder-trial defendants, including Gill.
	   Guess's five-week trial attracted nationwide media attention and
drew daily full houses to the Vancouver courtroom.
	   Prosecutors solicited testimony from other jurors in the murder
trial that Guess consistently argued in support of Gill.

	   TIANJIN, China (AP) _ Take a walk down nearly any street in
China's big cities and you'll see where the most sweeping social
transformation since the breakup of the communes two decades ago is
about to take place.
	   Right at home _ in the drab apartment buildings where most urban
people live.
	   China is about to end nearly 50 years of providing very low-rent
apartments to urban workers, revealing details Wednesday of the
government's plan to promote home buying instead.
	   Beijing hopes housing reform will unleash spending to spur
economic growth. Another aim is to help debt-ridden state factories
by eliminating their huge burden of providing housing.
	   To help people with average incomes afford to buy their housing
for the first time, the government will set prices and provide
subsidies, promote construction of affordable housing and encourage
state banks to provide more mortgages.
	   Zhao Lijun, a former journalist who runs an art-framing
business, said she and her husband, an artist who used to work for
the Ministry of Culture, can afford to buy their two-bedroom
apartment in central Beijing. The ministry, which owns their
building, recently posted notices telling residents to apply to
buy.
	   Ms. Zhao said she will pay about 30,000 yuan (dlrs 3,600) for an
apartment that would otherwise cost 200,000 yuan (dlrs 24,000).
	   Some cities have been experimenting with housing reform for
several years. In Tianjin, a port near Beijing, 60 percent of all
government offices have stopped providing housing and have given
workers lump-sum payments to help them buy apartments.
	   Workers also save 5 percent of their salary, which the
government matches, in a housing account and withdraw it when they
are ready to buy.
	   Xu Yanhe, a 45-year-old retired factory worker, moved with her
husband, mother and daughter last July into an apartment complex
that is a national model for spacious, pleasant housing.
	   Pink and yellow buildings of different heights topped with red
tile roofs are clustered around a huge expanse of lawn _ a rare
sight in the world's most populous country.
	   Mrs. Xu and her family bought their 200,000 yuan (dlrs 24,000)
apartment with savings, government help and a family loan. The
three-bedroom apartment with its brown floor tiles, wood paneling,
new air conditioners and lace curtains doubled their living space.
	   ``It's very light. There's nothing outside my windows, and it's
quiet all the time,'' said Mrs. Xu.
	   At the high end of the market are elegant apartments and big
suburban houses. These are bought by a new class of well-to-do
Chinese _ entrepreneurs, professionals and employees of large joint
venture businesses who also can afford cars, cell phones and
private schools.
	   But most wage earners cannot afford to buy apartments without
government help. Since the plan was disclosed in March, everyone
has been talking about housing _ a mix of reluctance to end the
welfare system and enthusiasm about a chance to buy.
	   What Beijingers have always liked about their apartments is that
they've been cheap. A typical 60-square-meter (670-square-foot)
apartment rents for about 60 yuan (dlrs 7) a month, about 6 percent
of an office worker's salary of 1,000 yuan (dlrs 120).
	   But rents will go up as welfare housing is phased out in the
second half of the year.
	   Prices depend on whether the apartment faces the sunny south or
the cold north winds, how far it is from downtown, the buyer's
years of government service and rank, and the age of the building.
	   The poor will continue to receive small, low-rent apartments.
	   Anger over housing disparities has become a big problem, said
Sun Huaqi, deputy director of housing reform in Tianjin.
	   ``But now it's a market economy,'' he said. ``If you're a small
businessman and can afford an enormous apartment, that's not my
affair. It's like buying a TV. Whether you have a big one or a
small one depends entirely on your ability to pay.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ For China's leaders, the biggest coup of
President Bill Clinton's visit will be welcoming the leader of the
free world to Tiananmen Square.
	   Using the square as a backdrop for improved Chinese-U.S.
relations could help China erase the stigma of the violent military
assault on democracy protests nine years ago. China says the White
House agreed to the same formal welcoming ceremony on the square
that China gives most foreign leaders.
	   Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S. president since Washington
froze high-level contacts following the 1989 crackdown, highlights
China's success in fighting its way back into the diplomatic fold.
	   It also will aid China's push for a greater say in international
affairs to match its growing economic might and to counter an
oft-resented U.S. dominance as the sole superpower.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin represents a nation anxious to be
accepted as a responsible power that deserves and needs to be
consulted on world affairs.
	   ``China does not want to dominate the world but wants a place in
the leadership,'' said Yan Xuetong, a U.S. expert at the Chinese
Institute for Contemporary International Relations.
	   China will be looking to Clinton to reaffirm the important role
it played in mitigating the Asian financial crisis by keeping its
currency, the yuan, stable, while other regional moneys tumbled.
	   With funding from Asia drying up, China also needs continued
U.S. investment and access to the U.S. market to fuel its economy.
	   But many of the more concrete results Chinese leaders might have
hoped for from Clinton's visit appear out of reach.
	   With Congress investigating allegations that his administration
approved transfers of sensitive satellite technology to Beijing,
Clinton is unlikely to yield to Chinese demands to ease
restrictions on sales of high-tech equipment to China.
	   China also wants Washington to halt U.S. weapons sales to
Taiwan, the island off the Chinese mainland that Beijing regards as
a rebel province. But U.S. law requires Washington to help Taiwan
defend itself and sympathy runs high in Congress for Taiwan's
switch in the past decade from dictatorship to democracy.
	   U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser said last week he does not
expect ``any new ground will be plowed'' on Taiwan at the summit.
	   Nor was he optimistic about a breakthrough on China's bid to
join the World Trade Organization, although Beijing has since
submitted a new proposal to allow more foreign competition in
highly restricted financial industries, telecommunications, law and
accounting.
	   Washington wants China to further open its markets before it
joins the group, which sets rules for world trade.
	   As an unelected leader, President Jiang does not face the same
pressures as Clinton. For him, being the first Chinese leader since
Tiananmen to host a U.S. president is a victory in itself.
	   ``Jiang benefits simply by virtue of the visit,'' said David
Shambaugh, a Chinese expert at George Washington University. ``It
enhances his position as the leader of China.''
	   Smooth relations with Washington can help Jiang and other
leaders focus on the painful process of transforming China into a
market economy. China needs a stable international environment that
will allow its leadership to focus on building up the economy and
finding jobs for millions of workers being laid off from state
firms.
	   Above all, Beijing argues, China and the United States are two
major nations whose common interests outweigh their differences.
	   ``No matter whether you like (America) or hate it, you can't
deny its power,'' said Zhao Baoxu, a Beijing University professor
and expert on international affairs.
	   ``Therefore, you have to understand how to exist peacefully with
it on an equal footing,'' Zhao was quoted by the official newspaper
China Economic Times as saying.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ They take to the ring to combat masked
professional wrestlers. They bounce around the stage in moon boots
and tight T-shirts singing upbeat country songs. They fend off
swarms of squealing teen-age girls at shopping malls.
	   The Gemelos Brenan _ the Brenan Twins _ are Mexico's newest
obsession: 20-something identical twins who took off from a tabloid
television news programs to become a cultural phenomenon.
	   In a country where the poor often feel forgotten, the Gemelos
Brenan are seen by the children of working-class families as two
grown-up _ but still very cool _ guys with big biceps who care.
	   Their appeal as working-class heroes among poor kids sprang from
their reporting on news of the street, with its neighborhood
brawls, lost pets and sick kids.
	   Mexican television news traditionally has covered the rich and
famous. The idea of upper-class reporters venturing into a hillside
slum was foreign _ and delightful.
	   ``We're trying to pay attention to people who feel isolated,
forsaken,'' Antonio Brenan says.
	   Adds brother Jorge: ``We're paying attention to the humble
people.''
	   The twins say their success was entirely accidental: When the
Televisa network auditioned them for the tabloid news program,
``Wrong Side of the Law,'' the brothers didn't realize they would
be reporters.
	   ``We thought it was a comedy show,'' Antonio said in an
interview. ``They told us what it was about and we were kind of
bummed.''
	   They took the job anyway, and soon became a hit as they
traversed the city in the show's uniform of skin-tight T-shirts and
denim vests.
	   They were so successful they even released a CD, considering
themselves more singers than journalists. But their voices hit
about as hard as their reporting.
	   And they've taken to the ring as professional wrestlers, adding
sports-obsessed pre-adolescent boys to the legions of adolescent
girls they already had as fans.
	   ``Now,'' Antonio Brenan says, ``we are the boom.''
	   But the twins' real success was a product of their tabloid TV
street reporting, covering very local news in poor neighborhoods.
	   Indeed, many of their reports focused on ``humble people.''
Typical was an interview with a poor woman whose son was, well,
very fat. They asked questions like: ``What's it like to have a son
who is so fat?''
	   But most reports focused on violence _ assaults, homicides,
neighborhood brawls. The crews often arrived before ambulances, and
the twins found themselves giving first aid.
	   ``We weren't trained as reporters, so instead of getting the
story we'd help people. And of course the cameras recorded that,''
Antonio says. ``On two occasions we saved people's lives. Our
hearts are made for helping people.''
	   ``Wrong Side of the Law'' ultimately ran into trouble when
President Ernesto Zedillo last year launched a campaign against
television violence, singling out that show and a similar one on a
competing network.
	   Both shows went off the air, but the 7:30 p.m. weeknight time
slot was filled by a suspiciously similar show with the same host,
reporters and format. The new name: ``Hard and Direct.''
	   The new show added softer features like a boy whose pet turtle
was sick (the reporter brought along a clown to cheer him up). It
also has nightly appearances by Walter, an astrologer and card
reader of dubious gender who appears in flowing gowns and heavy
makeup to deliver forecasts with an eerie intensity.
	   But the show's bread and butter remains: fistfights, arrests,
deformed children.
	   With ``Hard and Direct,'' the twins really took off. They soon
switched to the other side of the camera, transforming themselves
from newsmen into news. The show assigned a reporter to cover their
live appearances across Mexico _ and hype their story.
	   ``They are so loved by Mexico, by their audience, that for me
it's an honor to cover them,'' says Juan Jose Ulloa, the reporter
with the Brenan Twins beat.
	   ``Hard and Direct'' now airs almost nightly appearances by the
twins to promote their new record. On one recent show, a girl of
about 12 sobbed at the camera: ``Mommy, they're so handsome!
They're so handsome!''
	   Recently the twins held a contest asking participants to follow
their daily appearances and stories and write in. The four winners
_ all teen-age girls from poor neighborhoods _ dined with the twins
at a fancy restaurant.
	   ``Hard and Direct'' broadcast the dinner live.
	   ``I can't get rid of this smile,'' said Erika Adriana Banda
Salazar, a 17-year-old high school student seated next to Jorge.
``I have so many emotions, because all my dreams are coming true.''

Mexican dilemma: Should taxpayers pay bankers' giant debt? financial wire 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Ramirez de la O is correct in last graf. Also moved on

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo's proposal sounds
like an invitation to political suicide.
	   He wants taxpayers, most of whom aren't rich enough to have a
bank account, to pay off a dlrs 65 billion debt generated partly by
corrupt and incompetent bankers. And he's asked Congress to endorse
the plan.
	   Opposition legislators rant against the proposal, but they may
have to approve it.
	   The government has already taken responsibility for the debt.
Although the opposition charges the government acted illegally,
there is little suggestion of a default. No one wants the kind of
crisis that led to a dlrs 50 billion, U.S.-led international
bailout three years ago.
	   ``If the debt isn't paid, it could cause a terrible crisis of
confidence,'' said Fortunato Alvarez, a deputy from the opposition
National Action Party.
	   The proposal to assume the debts of the bank savings protection
fund, known as Fobaproa, is one of Mexico's hottest political
battles. It's likely to be a top issue in the 2000 elections as the
opposition tries to break the ruling party's 69-year grip on the
presidency.
	   The money at stake is mind-boggling. The dlrs 65 billion is
about 14 percent of gross domestic product, the total value of
economic activity. Mexicans _ about 40 percent of whom live in
poverty _ would need about 30 years to pay it back. The U.S.
savings and loan bailout was eight times greater, but the U.S.
economy is about 100 times larger.
	   The proposal, part of a banking reform package, is stalled in
the opposition-led Congress. Legislators are awaiting audits that
will look for evidence of bad banking practices and theft and
determine how much of the debt can be recovered.
	   The roots of the debt problems date to the bank privatization of
the early 1990s. Businessmen, many closely tied to the governing
party, bought banks even if they weren't qualified to run them. Lax
oversight led to embezzlement and bad loans.
	   When the value of the national currency, the peso, dropped
sharply shortly after Zedillo took office in December 1994,
interest rates surged, debtors couldn't repay loans and the
already-weak banking system was near collapse.
	   Through Fobaproa, the government kept the system afloat.
Fobaproa used government-backed notes to buy off the banks' bad
debts. Deposits were protected.
	   It was part of an emergency economic program that the government
touts as a big success: Through tough austerity measures and the
international bailout, it revived the economy.
	   The government sees the Fobaproa proposal as a step toward
further shoring up the banking system.
	   Some see the proposal as little more than a bookkeeping move:
Because it backed the notes, the government is already liable for
the debt.
	   But to the opposition, the government's backing of the Fobaproa
notes was illegal because Congress was never consulted.
	   ``Incredibly, the executive power now wants Congress to legalize
its illegalities, presenting the issue as a matter of national
survival,'' the leftist Democratic Revolution Party said in a
newspaper ad.
	   It has called for the resignation of central bank governor
Guillermo Ortiz, who, as deputy treasury secretary and later
treasury secretary, helped design the privatization plan and the
bank rescue.
	   With the opposition winning control of Congress last year for
the first time, it could reject the proposal. But if it wins the
2000 elections, it would have to deal with the economic
consequences.
	   ``In the end, there is no question in my mind that the package
will be approved,'' said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. ``The
country has to move forward and this is such a big stone in the
road, that in the absence of approval, almost nothing else can be
discussed, let alone approved.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. sanctions levied in response to
nuclear tests conducted last month in the Asian subcontinent will
affect cash-strapped Pakistan, some officials believe, more than
India, which has a comfortable reserve of foreign exchange.
	   Mahbub-ul Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister who now heads
an independent development research center, said tough sanctions
could force Islamabad to sell nuclear technology for cash.
	   ``There's nothing more dangerous than to push a desperately poor
nation to the economic brink,'' he said Friday.
	   Last month, India exploded five underground nuclear devices,
prompting neighboring Pakistan to retaliate with what it said were
six nuclear tests a few weeks later.
	   Washington said Thursday it was canceling nonhumanitarian aid to
India and Pakistan, suspending delivery of defense material and
dual-use items, prohibiting bank loans to the governments, and
blocking new credit guarantees for private loans.
	   The State Department estimated the two countries would lose a
total of dlrs 4 billion in international bank loans.
	   The Indian government downplayed U.S. sanctions, saying they
were ``coercive'' interference with free trade. But neither it nor
Pakistan showed any signs of reconsidering their nuclear programs.
	   Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called the sanctions ``a
minor roadblock'' toward better U.S.-Indian relations, but said it
was too early to assess the impact. Commerce Minister Ramakrishna
Hegde said trade would be unaffected.
	   The two U.S. companies that would be hit hardest by the denial
of U.S. loan guarantees are Enron Corp., which is building a
massive power project in western India, and Boeing, which is
bidding to upgrade Air India's fleet. Both could raise capital in
international financial markets at marginally higher costs,
industrialists said.
	   Pakistan declared a state of emergency to combat the sanctions.
It may default on payments of its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt if
the International Monetary Fund is blocked from extending future
loans, financial analysts have said.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc., the company that publishes
ratings on companies according to their ability to repay their
debts, lowered India's sovereign credit rating Friday after the
United States unveiled the sanctions.

Best security won't stop determined hooligans, British police say 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECAPS pvs. Also moving on sports lines.
By FRANCK DEMAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The best laid security plans cannot stop
a horde of determined hooligans from disrupting World Cup soccer,
according to British police helping prepare for Monday's match
between England and Romania.
	   ``Nobody, British or French, has said we could guarantee a
trouble-free event,'' Tim Hollis, the top British police officer
advising the French, told a news conference Friday.
	   This southwestern city, site of the match, is the focus of
attention by World Cup officials, local authorities and police on
both sides of the English Channel.
	   A barrage of measures are being put into place to try to avoid
the kind of clashes that occurred before, during and after last
Monday's match in Marseille between England and Tunisia.
	   Marseille authorities were also bracing for possible violence
ahead of Saturday's match between the Netherlands and South Korea,
increasing police strength.
	   But regional Prefect Jean-Paul Proust relented on a strict
alcohol ban announced earlier, under pressure from cafe and
restaurant owners. Proust agreed Thursday to allow alcohol to be
sold an hour later, until midnight, and said cafes and restaurants
could remain open until 4 a.m.
	   In Toulouse, cafes and bars were forced to close at 11 p.m.
starting Thursday and continuing through Monday, instead of the
usual 2 a.m. closing time. The nationwide music festival has been
postponed in Toulouse until July 11 and, with it, a series of other
festivities.
	   Two giant World Cup screens for ticketless fans are being
eliminated. A screen on Marseille's Prado beach was the sight of a
scuffle during Monday's game.
	   Police strength is being increased, with the 1,300 police to be
backed by two or three 80-member units of riot police or motorized
gendarmes, police officials said.
	   ``Our plan is in place, but it is worth nothing if you have 500
guys who don't fear arrest and who want to wreck everything,'' said
British liaison officer Eddie Curtis, attached to his country's
Football Association.
	   Hollis said that 200 hooligans who rampaged in Marseille have
been identified and so-call British ``spotter'' police would be on
the lookout for them in Toulouse.
	   Authorities in the southern city of Montpellier on Thursday
arrested an English fan linked to the three days of clashes in
Marseille in which 80 people were detained. The suspect was
identified by English police.
	   Meanwhile, the prefect of Toulouse's Haute-Garonne region, Alain
Bidou, said Friday night that a decision has been made not to
install fences inside the stadium to control hooligans.
	   British officials had argued against using fences on the grounds
they could prove dangerous should a commotion arise. The fences
themselves tend to breed enmity, the argument went. FIFA head Sepp
Blatter agreed.
	   French authorities had been considering using fences to control
any rowdiness by hooligans.
	   Stricter measures were also put in place in the French capital,
including banning alcohol consumption on the streets around Parc
des Princes stadium on match days.
	   Area bars will be ``asked to close'' on those days, the police
statement said.
	   Alcohol is also banned around the large World Cup viewing
screens built outside City Hall, near the Eiffel Tower and three
other locations, the statement said.

Security Council reaches tentative agreement on Iraqi spare parts deal

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi threats to stop oil sales,
the Security Council unanimously has agreed to allow Baghdad to
spend dlrs 300 million of oil-for-food revenues to buy spare parts
for its oil industry to meet increased export targets.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad ``is not
going to accept this resolution,'' saying it could trigger the
``collapse of the whole (oil-for-food) program.''
	   But Hamdoon did not repeat his threat, made last Monday, to
cancel the program immediately and cease oil exports if the
resolution were approved.
	   Iraq has argued the resolution effectively transforms
oil-for-food into an ongoing program as long as economic sanctions
against Baghdad remain in effect.
	   Although Friday's resolution allows Iraq to buy much-needed
spare parts, it also reduces the political leverage Baghdad has
used in its campaign to force the council to lift sanctions.
	   Under the system in effect since the program began in December
1996, Iraq would submit a plan for distributing food and medicine
purchased with oil revenues every six months each time the program
was renewed.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the council imposed sanctions after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. In
1996, the council allowed Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to
buy food, medicine and humanitarian goods.
	   Iraq was allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six
months, but the ceiling was raised this year to dlrs 5.2 billion.

	   HWANGE NATIONAL PARK, Zimbabwe (AP) _ You'll never forget the
sounds of an African night.
	   The snorting of rutting impalas, the barking of zebras, the
bellow of elephants and a hundred other roars, whistles, chirps and
hollers.
	   But my first night in the field, this wild chorus was a chilling
cacophony.
	   A broken drive shaft had hobbled our Land Rover, and we were
stuck in deep sand on a seldom-traveled dirt road along the edge of
Hwange National Park.
	   I knew Hwange was closed after dark, in part because of the
danger from lions. Yet here my husband, the driver and myself were
stuck in the middle of who-knew-where, hours after dusk, with no
radio, no gun and no hope of getting the open-air Land Rover onto
hard ground where the tires might grip.
	   It was only later that I learned that the sounds were a song of
safety. The animals go quiet when there's a predator around.
	   By the next day, our nighttime adventure had already become the
talk of The Hide safari lodge, and the 14 other guests had heard
how after fruitless attempts to push the car out, we had finally
cut the bungee cords holding the canvas roof to the vehicle and
used the tarp for traction under the tires.
	   That night in Hwange was the only time we even came close to
roughing it during our trip. There are basically two ways to tour
Zimbabwe _ as a backpacker or in luxury. As we considered this the
trip of a lifetime, we chose the latter.
	   Our dollars were well spent. Our days at The Hide began with
coffee and biscuits left on the deck outside the tent (which had an
attached bathroom and hardwood floors); then a 6 a.m. rendezvous
for a morning drive or walk.
	   Given our recent experience with vehicles, we opted at first for
the walk. Moving single-file behind a guide armed with the largest
rifle I had ever seen (a Weatherby .458 magnum), we walked through
tall grass beaded with dew as our guide pointed out the various
plants, insects and birds. Under the watchful gaze of a lone
wildebeest, we crept to within about 150 feet of a herd of zebra
and an hours-old foal and watched his awkward first steps. Later,
when we strolled back into camp, a family of hundreds of baboons
chattered at us from the neighboring trees.
	   Although one doesn't get as close to the animals on foot as one
does in a vehicle, Zimbabwe's guides are among the most highly
trained of any country's and the walks provide an opportunity for
them to share their knowledge of tracking and animal
identification. The guides were only too pleased to explain how to
tell the droppings of a browser from a grazer, and they taught me
how to tell the speed, age and sex of an elephant from its
footprint.
	   The dawn activity would be followed by a full breakfast that was
a clear reminder of Zimbabwe's British heritage. Then the day's
activities would involve at least two game drives in the
now-repaired Land Rover.
	   Our trip was in May, the start of the dry Zimbabwe winter which
lasts through October. During our stay, the vegetation was still
full and lush, and the temperatures relatively moderate, from the
low 80s at midday to 45 at night. As the pools of water dry up
through the winter, game viewing becomes easier because the animals
congregate at the remaining watering holes and never stray very
far. The tradeoff, however, is that the landscape bakes brown and
the temperatures rise, peaking in October.
	   Despite the timing of our trip, we did not lack for animals.
Hwange is known for its healthy elephant population. Too healthy,
some would say, as the herds threaten to overwhelm the fragile
ecosystem in which they live. This has led to passionate arguments
as to the best and most humane way to control the size of the
herds. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is hard to
feel anything but awe watching these massive animals move about
with seeming delicacy and a quietness that allows them to virtually
melt into the trees.
	   Hwange, Zimbabwe's best-known park, also has large herds of
zebra, scores of doe-like impala, smaller groups of sable and kudu
antelope, and families of warthog whose tufted tails wave
antenna-like as they trot along. Giraffe, wildebeest, jackals, and
the fearsome Cape buffalo are also commonly seen.
	   And then there are the birds. I have never considered myself a
birder, but it's impossible not to be captivated by the eagles,
hawks, cranes, ostrich and the common but extraordinarily beautiful
lilac-breasted roller.
	   Unfortunately, there are no rhino in Hwange. The only place to
be reasonably sure of seeing white rhino in Zimbabwe is in Matopos
National Park, where the rhinos, including the few remaining black
rhinos, were consolidated in an attempt to save them from poachers.
Matopos, in the southern part of the country, offers a variety of
other animals (no lions or buffalo), Stone-Age cave drawings, and
the grave of Cecil Rhodes, after whom the country was named
Rhodesia until its independence in 1980.

<TEXT>
	   Matopos can be visited in a day-trip from Bulawayo or by staying
at a private camp in the hills near the park. One resort, Amalinda,
has carved its Flinstone-like rooms out of the boulders and is
notable for the trips it arranges to a nearby tribal village,
medical clinic and school.
	   Still, apart from the rhino, Hwange is where the wildlife is.
And we'd toast our good-fortune every afternoon with a
``sundowner'' cocktail served in the Land Rover while watching the
sun set over a waterhole where elephants played.
	   We'd spent several nights at The Hide and I'd still not seen the
lions that my imagination had so fearfully conjured that first
night. Still, the guides had seen their tracks and knew they were
in the vicinity.
	   Our last night, they got a little closer than we expected. After
dinner, my husband and I were walking behind a tent while a lion,
unbeknownst to us, was walking in front of it _ to the amazement of
those who watched it saunter through the camp. We all quickly
climbed into the Land Rovers for a night drive in hopes of tracking
the giant cat.
	   We found him, and it was not the chilly night air that caused me
to shiver. Imagine a sound that you feel as much as hear. A
visceral ``oomph'' that resonates through your body and sets your
nerves to jangling. That was the roar of this lion.
	   The black-maned male lay on his side in the grass. Every few
minutes his belly would rise as he filled his lungs with air. And
as he expelled the air, there was that noise. Soon after, there was
an answering roar that grew closer.
	   Our guide explained that the two lions were brothers. Sure
enough, within a few minutes the second lion appeared. Together
they walked, slowly, regally, clearly lords of their domain, down
the road and into the closed park where we could not follow. We saw
many other things that night. Sleeping crown cranes adorning the
skeletal branches of a tall tree, bat-eared fox and a family of
civets.
	   But all that anyone could speak of was the magnificence of the
lions, and of that sound.

A canoe trip down the Zambezi puts you close to the hippos With TRAV-Zimbabwe Safari

<TEXT>
	   MANA POOLS NATIONAL PARK, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The day can start cool
and mysterious on the Zambezi River before the sun has a chance to
burn off the morning fog.
	   From the mist ahead of us came the ``thwack'' ``thwack''
``thwack'' of our guide's paddle against the side of his canoe.
This alerted the hippos ahead to our presence and let them move
towards deeper water, where they watched with baleful eyes and
twitching ears as we paddled past.
	   You don't want to surprise a hippo, or get between it and deep
water. These were the two rules we were told before setting out on
our 40-mile (65-kilometer) trip down the Zambezi River as it flows
past Zimbabwe's Mana Pools National Park on the right, and Zambia
on the left.
	   All the guide books warn that despite their rather comic
appearance, hippos are responsible for more human deaths than any
other animal in southern Africa. Fortunately, with rare exception,
hippos are as delighted to avoid us as we are to avoid them. This
is good, since our fiberglass, two-person canoe would afford little
protection against the long tusk-like incisors of the two-ton
beast.
	   So with this in mind, the three canoes set off down the broad
slowly flowing river with our guide tap-tap-tapping our way,
directing the route we were to take and pointing out the wildlife
as we quietly moved past.
	   You can get much closer to many of the animals in a canoe than
on foot or in a vehicle. The hippos for sure, but also elephants,
Cape buffalo, water buck, and other game that come to the river's
edge to drink and to play. Not to mention the crocodiles that bask
in the sun along the banks, or skulk in the deep water just beyond
the drop-offs waiting for an unsuspecting meal to venture too close
to the edge.
	   And there were the birds. Egyptian geese flying in low
formations, colorful bee-eaters darting into their nests carved
into holes in the banks, stately fish-eagles perched atop trees,
and numerous herons and storks of all types.
	   Evenings brought us to our camp sites, where a staff of four had
already arrived to setup our tents and heat the water for showers.
Dinner was served on china under the stars, with the sounds of the
African night _ punctuated by the honking call of the hippo _
providing the music by which we dined.
	   This wasn't hard-core camping obviously, but even luxury camping
in Africa does have it's moments. Such as finding a large, bull
elephant standing squarely between you and the outhouse. This was a
game of chicken I wasn't going to play.
	   Mana Pools is remote, and is accessible by car only part of the
year. Mana means four, a reference to the four pools around park
headquarters. Away from the water, it lacks the density of wildlife
seen in the better known parks in Zimbabwe. But this part of the
Zambezi Valley is still wonderfully wild, and should remain so
since Mana Pools was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
	   We finished the trip in three days, and the next morning had us
climbing aboard a Land Rover for the bumpy 3.5-hour trip back to
the Ruckomechi Camp where we had started.
	   That night was pure heaven. After watching the stars rise and
joining the others at the resort for dinner, my husband and I were
asked what time we wanted our bath. At the appointed time, an armed
guard (the area has many lions) escorted us to a brightly painted
concrete room, which had only three walls and a giant bathtub. The
roof, like the fourth wall that would have closed off the Zambezi,
was nonexistent. The water for our tub had been heated with a wood
fire, candles had been lit and an open bottle of chilled wine left
nearby.
	   It was the perfect end to the perfect trip. A moonlit soak in
our water while we watched the hippos soak in theirs.

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ From my perch on the Victoria
Falls bridge, I watched the rapids of the Zambezi River rushing
along 366 feet (112 meters) beneath me. The world's fastest men can
run that distance in 11 seconds. It takes only 4.7 seconds to fall
that far, but it feels like an eternity.
	   This is the highest commercial bungee jump in the world. And it
is my first.
	   Victoria Falls, twice as high as Niagara Falls, is sort of the
Disney World of Zimbabwe. Yes, there is still game to be seen, but
here the elephants, warthogs and baboons play second fiddle to the
casinos, helicopter rides, rafting, and, of course, the falls.
	   I could hear the thunderous roar of the cascading waters behind
me as I stood on a small platform on the bridge that connects
Zimbabwe and Zambia.
	   I had spent the first few days in Vic Falls questioning the
sanity of those who chose to jump. I spent my days doing the
tourist things. I walked through Victoria Falls National Park and
let the spray from the falls drench me.
	   I visited the Victoria Falls Hotel, a throwback to colonial
times where the white-gloved staff waits on the upper-crust. I
bargained with merchants in the market for carvings and souvenirs.
	   Yet, somehow, on the final day of my trip, I find myself with a
large, frayed-looking rubber band tied to my ankles as several
dozen people chant 5-4-3-2-1 ... BUNGEE!!
	   To get to this point, I had been weighed on two scales and my
weight written in marker on my hand in an efficient assembly line
that moved me towards the edge. My ankles had been wrapped in
towels to cushion against the pull of the cord, and all the while
the reassuring words of the crew had prevented me from actually
thinking about what I was doing.
	   A good thing.
	   So why did I do it? What compelled me to fling myself off a
bridge in a free-fall that brought several moments of sheer terror
before a slow tug on my ankles brought euphoric relief in the form
of deceleration followed by upward bounce?
	   There are times in a person's life when they do things that they
can't explain. When you do something simply because some part of
you says that you can't.
	   But the other part says you can. And that's why I jumped.
	   Because I could.

Tips for traveling to Zimbabwe With TRAV-Zimbabwe Safari 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
 &UR; GEOGRAPHY:
	   Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, neighbored
by South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique. Most of the
country consists of the highveld and midveld plateau, between 3,000
and 5,600 feet (900 to 1,700 meters) above sea level, which
accounts for the un-Africa-like temperatures in much of Zimbabwe.
The hot, dry lowveld of southern Zimbabwe is comprised mainly of
flat savanna. The only significant mountainous region is the
Eastern Highlands.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; GETTING THERE:
	   Most people traveling from the United States to Zimbabwe fly to
the capital city of Harare via London or Johannesburg, South
Africa. It is also possible to fly directly to Victoria Falls from
London.
	   Once in Zimbabwe, the infrastructure is one of the best in
Africa, and local planes, express buses and trains make traveling
around the country easy and convenient.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; LANGUAGE:
	   English is an official language and is used in government and
business. However, it is the first language to only about 2 percent
of the population. Shona is the native language for about 70
percent of the country, and Ndebele, a derivation of Zulu, is the
language of 15 percent.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; MONEY:
	   The currency is the Zimbabwe dollar, or Zim buck, as it's more
commonly called. The exchange rate as of late May was about Z dlrs
18 to US dlrs 1 but is constantly changing. Banks can be found in
the cities, and the airport and some resorts have foreign exchange
bureaus. There is a black market in foreign currency, but it's best
to stay away from the hustlers on city streets. Black market
trading is a serious offense, and many of the dealers are running
scams.
	   Credit cards are accepted at most places that deal with
tourists.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; DOCUMENTS:
	   A valid passport is required. Visas aren't required of U.S.
citizens nor by citizens of Commonwealth countries, members of the
European Union, Japan, Norway or Switzerland. Yellow fever
vaccination certificates are required if entering from a country
where the disease is endemic.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; HEALTH RISKS:
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions
travelers about the risk of malaria in Zimbabwe. Although
potentially fatal, mosquito repellent and anti-malaria drugs
significantly reduce the risk. The CDC also recommends that
travelers not swim or bath in fresh water where schistosomiasis,
also known as bilharzia, is present. The infection, carried by tiny
worms, can cause severe organ damage if untreated. HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, is also a major problem in southern Africa.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SHOPPING:
	   Shona sculpture, although a recent addition to Zimbabwe's
culture, has been recognized as world-class art. Although it's
possible to find pieces costing thousands of dollars, smaller works
can be purchased in most markets for only a few dollars.
Traditional crafts include wood carvings, baskets and crochet work.
Ironwork figurines are also popular.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Just off the hotel lobby, where the
gurgling marble fountain has been stained a rusty orange over time,
a lounge singer croons Sinatra standards in a heavy Ivorian accent.
	   A few dozen yards (meters) away, while bowling pins crash in the
background, grumbling waiters serve Cokes and cheeseburgers to
American tourists at The Snackarama.
	   It's a Friday evening at the Hotel Ivoire, the most famous hotel
in West Africa and a long-faded monument to modernity and elegance.
Where celebrities once played, the Ivoire is now known more as a
pickup spot for Abidjan teen-agers, and has become just another
rest stop for tourists and businessmen.
	   ``It has been the house of kings and presidents and royal
families,'' said one employee, ``in the past.''
	   But the government-owned Ivoire, with its 750 rooms, five
restaurants, bowling alleys, movie theater and casino, is coming
back. Even the skating rink _ the only ice rink for thousands of
miles (kilometers) _ will be renovated to better keep away the
withering West African humidity.
	   Section by section, starting later this year, the complex is to
be redone in a dlrs 60 million project underwritten by the
Inter-Continental hotel chain, which manages the Ivoire and has
recently signed a contract extending its lease. Decorations will be
scrapped, public areas renovated and remodeled rooms outfitted with
Internet connections and high-tech TVs.
	   The idea is to renovate it to five-star status.
	   And it comes not a moment too soon.
	   The decorations are decades out of date, the linoleum is worn,
and the Snackarama, well, it looks like something called a
``Snackarama.'' With its bowling-pin decorations and
green-tuxedo-clad waiters, it looks like an imitation American
snack bar that didn't quite get it right.
	   Many guests, who pay from about dlrs 166 to about dlrs 238 a
night for a room, leave the hotel feeling it's more than ready for
an overhaul.
	   ``The bedrooms smell. The sheets are old. The service is far
from excellent,'' said Marlene Kama, an executive assistant who has
stayed at the hotel a few times. ``It's a well-known hotel ... but
it leaves a lot to be desired.''
	   Once, though, things were different. After the hotel opened in
1963 it was the height of luxury on this part of the continent. It
was a showpiece of what Africa could do, proof an industrializing
country like the Ivory Coast could produce five-star elegance like
any Western nation.
	   The Ivoire meant expensive French restaurants and raucous
nightclubs, an old-fashioned ice cream parlor and color televisions
in every room, a pool _ they call it The Lake _ that twists and
curves for hundreds of yards.
	   So they came. European and African royalty have stayed at the
hotel, Mohammed Ali was a guest, as was Michael Jackson.
	   These days, a hotel executive has to think awhile before coming
up with a more recent celebrity guest: Marion Barry, whose stints
as mayor of Washington, D.C., were interrupted by jail time for
drug possession.
	   Hotel employees make no secret that it's time for renovation.
	   ``We get comments that this is a hotel out of the 60s or 70s,''
said one worker, who spoke on condition his name not be used _ a
common practice in a country where business and politics are
tightly intertwined.
	   Criticizing the Ivoire _ which is owned by a corporation owned
by the Ivorian government _ is seen by many as criticizing the
government. That can be a bad career move in a country where
success often has more to do with political connections than
business acumen.
	   Plus, some Ivorians are still proud of their faded, famous
hotel. A Friday night finds dozens of local families dressed up for
a stroll in the air-conditioned chill. Photographers still do
reasonable business taking snapshots of posing visitors.
	   And, most famous of all, the skating rink draws them in.
	   There are sun-battered Peace Corps volunteers in from the bush
skating leisurely, European diplomats practicing their hockey
moves, flirting teen-agers and noisy children, and Ivorians trying
on skates for the first time.
	   ``In Africa there is too much sun'' said Angnerho Lathi
Jerubais, a 13-year-old Abidjan schoolboy, lurching around the rink
like the novice he is. ``So it's nice to have a little cold.''

Developers envision Niagara Falls becoming tourist utopia

<TEXT>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, New York (AP) _ Like the honeymooners drawn here
to gaze at rainbows through the mist, and the forlorn who surrender
to the rapids, Niagara Falls has a history of new beginnings and
unhappy endings.
	   Now, after seeing much of its tourism appeal and much of its
industry disappear, this city of wedding chapels and smokestacks,
upscale hotels and boarded-up buildings, is looking to make a fresh
start.
	   A new revitalization plan goes far beyond a fresh coat of paint
and some new souvenir shops. Developers envision a tourist utopia
with a casino, resort-type hotels, new housing, restaurants, retail
shops, recreation trails and green space.
	   ``We can only go up,'' says Mayor James Galie.
	   The would-be saviors come from across the Canadian border:
former Toronto Mayor David Crombie and deal-maker Edwin Cogan.
	   Cogan and the Niagara Falls Redevelopment Corp. he formed have
committed dlrs 140 million over eight years, and are trying to
persuade other private investors to up the ante.
	   ``What we're really talking about is rebuilding the entire
downtown of a major tourism-oriented city,'' says Richard Reinhard,
chief operating officer of the Redevelopment Corp.
	   Visitors now stay an average of four hours at the falls and
spend about dlrs 22 each. Planners want to lengthen visits to four
days.
	   ``When we learned that 14 million people visit here (yearly), we
realized that all we have to do is design some kind of catcher's
mitt to get people back into the city to stay longer,'' says David
Moreno of the Jerde Partnership, Inc., which was tapped to redesign
the city. The Venice, California, group has put together the Mall
of the Americas in Minnesota and the Fremont Street Experience in
Las Vegas.
	   When a preliminary version of the plan was unveiled publicly, it
was cheered by a crowd of more than 1,000. The final version of the
plan now awaits approval by the City Planning Board, the Urban
Renewal Agency and the City Council.
	   ``It's just given a shot in the arm to the people,'' says Bishop
Edward Grosz, pastor of two city churches, Holy Trinity and St.
Stanislaus. ``This whole area has suffered from a sense of low
self-esteem.''
	   Of course, folks here know better than to embrace any plan
without hanging onto a healthy dose of skepticism.
	   The Jerde concept is wonderful, says Charles Naughton, a city
firefighter and attorney, but ``we've had wonderful concepts before
and they always seem to fall by the wayside ... Show us the money.
Put something on the ground.''
	   The problems that confront Niagara Falls today are not unlike
those it faced 100 years ago.
	   Then, like now, observers worried that the natural beauty of the
falls was disappearing behind concrete and smokestacks. American
landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of New York's
Central Park, stepped in and oversaw the removal of unsightly
buildings and the development of parkland.
	   But the lure of cheap hydroelectric power proved too great and
once again industry, this time chemical companies, moved in. The
transition would come back to haunt the city later, when toxic
chemicals made their way into homes in the Love Canal neighborhood
and forced the evacuation of hundreds of families in the 1970s.
	   An attempt at urban renewal about the same time did little to
improve things. Homes, shops and old theaters were bulldozed to
make way for a convention center and pedestrian area that were
supposed to attract major development, but didn't.
	   Today's population of 55,000 is half of what it was in the
1960s.
	   Across the river, meanwhile, the city's Canadian counterpart,
Niagara Falls , Ontario, continues to take greater advantage of the
tourism potential _ it does have the more spectacular view of the
Falls _ and has thrived under years of savvy planning.
	   A newly opened casino in the province attracted 10 million
visitors in its first year and grossed more than dlrs 500 million
in gambling revenues. Now developers are at work on a new,
100,000-square-foot (9,300-square-meter) casino, a 350-room hotel,
retail mall and giant entertainment complex.
	   The developers on the American side say that is all the more
reason to legalize casino gambling in New York, where they envision
a 230,000-square-foot (21,360-square-meter) casino as the
centerpiece of a mega-entertainment center.
	   Indians of the Seneca Nation recently gave tribal leaders
permission to open talks with New York State toward opening a
Seneca-run casino, possibly at the falls.
	   It will be a year to 18 months before any of the revitalization
plan's other components become reality, Reinhard says.
	   A long road lies ahead, but at least it leads in the right
direction, residents say.
	   ``Basically, what's happening is there is a whole new vision of
hope that is being presented to the community,'' Grosz says.
	   ``There's a real nice spirit.''

Puerto Rico governor firm on privatization as strike enters second day headquarters, managers prevented from leaving.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello vowed to press
ahead with plans to sell a controlling interest in the state-owned
telephone company as a protest strike entered its second day.
	   ``The transaction is already done,'' Rossello said Friday,
discounting any chance that the telephone workers' strike could
derail the dlrs 1.9 billion sale to private investors led by GTE
Corporation.
	   Puerto Rico Telephone Company management filed a complaint with
the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Board, alleging the strike was a
violation of the company's bargaining agreements with its two
unions. The PRTC asked the board to order the strikers back to
work.
	   Only one skirmish was reported Friday _ a scuffle between police
and strikers outside telephone company headquarters. Union leaders
met with Police Chief Pedro Toledo to discuss ways to prevent a
repeat of violence on Thursday that injured two police officers and
led to one arrest.
	   Strikers prevented company managers inside the building from
leaving. Some managers escaped the structure unnoticed, but others
stayed inside, fearing for their safety.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale of 50 percent plus one
share of the company on Thursday, the same day 6,400 company
workers went on strike in protest. Union leaders fear layoffs under
GTE control.
	   The House of Representatives is expected to approve the sale
next week.
	   Rossello, whose administration has sold hotels and a shipping
company and has courted private investment in the power industry,
says a state-owned telephone company cannot compete in the newly
open Puerto Rico market.
	   PRTC had a monopoly in this U.S. commonwealth of 3.8 million
people until 1996. Now it faces competition from private firms and
has been forced to cut rates.
	   PRTC employees were threatened with disciplinary actions by both
sides in the labor conflict.
	   The company's management has said workers could be disciplined
for participating in what it called an ``illegal strike.'' Union
leaders, meanwhile, threatened to impose fines of up to dlrs 5,000
for members who don't honor picket lines.
	   Strikers also protested outside some branches of Banco Popular,
Puerto Rico's largest bank. Its parent, Popular Inc., is part of
the GTE-led consortium.

Staten Island meets Ming Dynasty at Chinese garden 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Chinese Scholar's Garden, billed as the first
authentic one in the United States, is under construction on Staten
Island and will be open for tourists next May.
	   A traditional Ming Dynasty pavilion is being built around a
lotus pond at the Staten Island Botanical Garden by artisans who
were brought from China and whose work was donated for the project.
	   New York City put up dlrs 1.2 million for the garden and the
Landscape Architecture Co. of China is contributing materials and
labor to match that. An additional dlrs 4 million is being sought
from corporations and private donors to complete and maintain the
brainchild of Frances X. Paulo Huber, who heads the botanical
garden.
	   ``It's the first authentic Chinese garden in the United
States,'' Huber said.
	   Its components include five one-story structures around the
lotus pond, three bridges, a tea house and three gardens _ the
Billowing Pine Court, the Wandering-in-Bamboo Court, and the Court
of Uncommon Reeds.
	   In addition to spaces for scholars to meditate and contemplate,
it will have facilities for shows involving Chinese acrobats and
other performers, Huber said.
	   Xie Young Ping, an administrator for the Landscape Architecture
Co., who will serve as interpreter for the 34 artisans, said none
of the workers had ever before been to the United States.

 &UR; Music to dive by under a Florida Keys coral reef
	   BIG PINE KEY, Florida (AP) _ Snorkelers wanting music to dive by
on July 11 can head for the Lower Florida Keys where an underwater,
coral-reef concert is planned at the Looe Key National Marine
Sanctuary.
	   Keys radio station WWUS/U.S. 1 plans a six-hour, commercial-free
broadcast that will be delivered by speakers suspended under boats
positioned above the reef.
	   Interspersed with the music will be public service announcements
to inform divers and snorkelers of proper reef etiquette.
	   ``We want to draw attention to the enjoyment we receive from the
reef while reinforcing the importance of preserving it,'' said Bill
Becker, coordinator of the Lower Keys Annual Underwater Music
Festival.
	   About 600 divers and snorkelers usually show up for the event at
the sanctuary, located six miles below Big Pine Key.
	   Space aboard locally operated dive boats will be available
during the event, or visitors with their own craft may launch from
public ramps throughout the area.
	   For more information, contact the Lower Keys Chamber of Commerce

 &UR; French to dance in the streets of New York on Bastille Day
	   NEW YORK (NY) _The French will be dancing in the streets of New
York to celebrate their national holiday, Bastille Day. And
everyone is invited.
	   The festival, which has grown the last three years block by
block, this year will close off 60th Street between 5th and
Lexington avenues from noon to 9 p.m. on Sunday, July 12.
	   True, the storming of the Bastille in 1789 that sparked the
French Revolution, was on July 14, but New York's French-community
sponsors decided to fudge a bit in deference to Manhattan traffic.
	   In addition to dancing in the street to live French music, there
will be street theater, a folk costume show, a full block of
chilren's activities and an entire block devoted to French food.
	   Most of the city's French restaurants will be represented on the
block dubbed ``Restaurant Row,'' serving their house specialities.
	   The restaurants will offer in-house from July 4 through July 14
prix fixe meals for the Revolutionary price of dlrs 17.89.

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A 43-year-old Canadian woman
was convicted Friday of obstructing justice for having a love
affair with an accused killer while serving on the jury that
acquitted him of murder.
	   Gillian Guess showed no reaction as the verdict was read in a
packed courtroom by the foreman of a jury of six men and six women.
She will be sentenced later, and faces a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison.
	   The verdict concluded one of British Columbia's strangest
trials, marked by the unprecedented testimony of former jurors who
spoke about deliberations usually kept secret, as well as frequent
outbursts in court from the flamboyant Guess.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Guess fell in love with Peter Gill
during his 1995 murder trial and disrupted the case by acquiring
inside information and using it during jury deliberations.
	   Defense lawyer Peter Ritchie described Guess as a victim of
Gill's shrewd manipulations, suggesting the younger man played her
``like a fiddle'' in a bid to win his freedom.
	   Guess believed Gill and his fellow defendants were innocent
before the affair began, he said, and she didn't know she was doing
anything wrong.
	   After a six-month trial, Gill and five other men were acquitted
in 1995 of charges of murdering two men in what police called a
feud between rival drug gangs.
	   Police launched an investigation into Guess, who was arrested
and charged in May 1996. She ended her romance with Gill, nine
years her junior, because her bail terms barred contact with him.
	   Prosecutors are appealing the acquittals of four of the
murder-trial defendants, including Gill.
	   Guess's five-week trial attracted nationwide media attention and
drew daily full houses to the Vancouver courtroom.
	   Prosecutors solicited testimony from other jurors in the murder
trial that Guess consistently argued in support of Gill.

World finance officials meet to discuss Asian financial crisis scheduled for 0800 GMT

Eds: Meeting scheduled to start at 0400 GMT, press conference
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Finance officials from around the world gathered
Saturday to discuss Asia's economic crisis and coordinate
strategies to halt the currency turbulence that has sent the
region's economies into a tailspin.
	   Gathering in Tokyo were deputy finance ministers from the G-7
industrialized countries, Asian finance officials and
representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
dispatched Thursday on an emergency mission to hold talks on
Japan's economic woes and the yen's weakness, will also attend the
meeting.
	   The officials were expected to agree to coordinate efforts to
stabilize Asian currencies and to re-emphasize the importance of
shoring up the yen's value against the dollar.
	   The yen's recent slide has raised fears that Asian countries may
be forced to engage in another round of competitive devaluations
that could trigger a repeat of last year's disastrous free fall in
regional currencies.
	   On Friday, Summers concluded a series of high-level meetings
with Japanese government officials and extracted promises that
Japan will take swift action to boost its ailing economy.
	   Summers and Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga vowed to
intervene again in currency markets to stabilize the yen if
necessary.
	   But experts worry that no amount of government intervention will
restore long-term confidence in the yen unless Japan takes swift
and aggressive action to clean up its ailing banking system.
	   Earlier this week, the United States made a dramatic foray into
world currency markets after the Japanese currency fell Wednesday
to its lowest level against the dollar in eight years.
	   The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 7 yen in a mere
three days.
	   Summers also told LDP officials that it is more important for
Japan to stimulate the economy than to put the country's finances
in order by tightening spending.
	   Summers received assurances from senior members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party that Japan will set up a special financial
institution to take over debts at failed banks.
	   Japan's banks are saddled with 76 trillion yen (dlrs 563
billion) in bad debt and many are expected to collapse in the near
future as the government implements financial deregulation
measures.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Payne Stewart worked the gum ferociously in
his mouth and watched with folded arms as his 8-foot birdie putt on
the 18th hole at the U.S. Open neared the cup, nearly stopped then
proceeded on its merry way.
	   ``I really thought I would have about 3 or 4 feet coming back up
the hill,'' Stewart said after he shot a 71 Friday to be at
3-under-par 137, one-stroke ahead of Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway
after two rounds at The Olympic Club.
	   ``Then all of a sudden it's 20 feet,'' the 1991 U.S. Open winner
said with the exasperated look of a man who knows how the USGA sets
up a golf course with deep rough, fast greens and difficult pin
placements.
	   ``That was borderline ridiculous where they had the pin,'' he
said. ``I wasn't really pleased about that.''
	   Stewart missed the putt coming back.
	   Adding to his annoyance was the fact that it was his third bogey
in five holes as a three-stroke lead became one just like at the
1996 U.S. Open when he made bogeys on two of the final three holes
of the second round to let a lead slip to one stroke and ended up
finishing 27th.
	   But on a day in which Casey Martin and his cart made the cut for
the weekend rounds and player after player succumbed to the unique
demands of a U.S. Open golf course, Stewart managed to make just
enough putts to keep the lead.
	   Lee Janzen grabbed a share of that lead briefly with birdies on
Nos. 15 and 16, but he went from the rough to the bunker on the
468-yard 17th hole and made a double bogey and still shot a 66.
	   ``I was actually thinking abut shooting a 62 and shooting the
lowest round in major championship history,'' Janzen said. ``You
don't get greedy in a U.S. Open.''
	   Janzen was at 139 along with 19-year-old amateur Matt Kuchar and
32-year-old journeyman Lee Porter, while Nick Faldo and Davis Love
III missed the cut.
	   While others around him were unraveling _ including Tiger Woods,
Colin Montgomerie and Fred Couples _ Stewart, who finished the
first round with three consecutive birdies, started Friday with
three more.
	   He then settled into doing what needs to be done to win a U.S.
Open _ make a lot of putts to save par, including key ones on Nos.
11, 13 and 16.
	   But bogeys on Nos. 14, 17 and 18 let a lot of players back into
the tournament. One of those was David Duval, who shot a 68 and was
lurking at 143, suddenly only six strokes back going into the
weekend.
	   Nine players started the second round under par, but that number
dwindled as the day went on and the thick El Nino-fed rough
swallowed up shots and the wind-dried greens grew faster by the
minute.
	   Of those nine, only Maggert was able to improve on his score,
shooting a 69.
	   ``The style of golf that we play at the U.S. Open suits my game
very well,'' said Maggert, who was in a final-round duel with
Montgomerie, Ernie Els and Tom Lehman last year at Congressional
before finishing fourth.
	   ``I took a lot away from that tournament,'' he said. ``I am
looking forward to getting myself in a position like that again and
hopefully I can better my performance than what I did last year.''
	   Maggert rebounded from bogeys three times on Friday and _ in
perhaps the key to winning a U.S. Open _ managed to make bogey his
worst score on any hole.
	   Woods was not as lucky. He had a second four-putt green in two
days _ this one on No. 6 _ and made his fifth double bogey in his
last six U.S. Open rounds. He shot a 72 and was at 146, nine
strokes back.
	   Defending champion Ernie Els shot a 70 and was at 145.
	   Perhaps the most surprising player to hang tough _ and in fact
gain on the field _ was Kuchar, who shot a 69 to get to 139.
	   ``I'm definitely playing the weekend right?'' Kuchar said. ``I
made my major goal. I wanted to be out here for Father's Day and my
birthday,'' both of which are Sunday.
	   Sunday will be a special day for Kuchar, whose smile charmed the
galleries at Augusta National in April when he finished 21st at the
Masters, because his father, Peter, is also his caddie.
	   Joining Kuchar in making the cut for the weekend rounds was
Martin, the 26-year-old Nike Tour player who successfully sued the
PGA Tour to be allowed to ride a cart because of a circulatory
problem in his right leg.
	   Martin shot a solid 71 in the second round and was at 5-over-par
145.
	   ``From where I was eight or nine months ago'' when his legal
status was in doubt, ``I am very lucky to be here,'' Martin said.
	   Stewart threatened to sprint away from the field when he started
Friday with birdies on the first three holes to get to seven under
par.
	   But Olympic is a course where you have to put strokes in the
bank when you have the chance because withdrawals from that account
can come at an alarming rate.
	   One of the best examples of how quickly things could go wrong
was Justin Leonard.
	   Leonard had a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 15th hole to go
to even par but had a four putt, missing twice from 3 feet, and
then made consecutive bogeys to finish with a 75 for a 146.
	   Whoever wins this Open will certainly have to endure more of the
same on the weekend _ including ``ridiculous'' pin placements.

<TEXT>
	   TIANJIN, China (AP) _ Take a walk down nearly any street in
China's big cities and you'll see where the most sweeping social
transformation since the breakup of the communes two decades ago is
about to take place.
	   Right at home _ in the drab apartment buildings where most urban
people live.
	   China is about to end nearly 50 years of allocating very
low-rent apartments. A national conference on Wednesday formally
announced the government's plan to promote home buying instead.
	   Beijing hopes housing reform will unleash spending to spur
economic growth. Another aim is to help debt-ridden state factories
by eliminating their huge burden of providing housing.
	   To help people with average incomes afford to buy their housing
for the first time, the government will set prices and provide
subsidies, promote construction of affordable housing and encourage
state banks to provide more mortgages.
	   Zhao Lijun, a former journalist who runs an art-framing
business, said she and her husband, an artist who used to work for
the Ministry of Culture, can afford to buy their two-bedroom
apartment in central Beijing. The ministry, which owns their
building, recently posted notices telling residents to apply to
buy.
	   Ms. Zhao said she will pay about dlrs 3,600 for an apartment
that would otherwise cost dlrs 24,000.
	   Some cities have been experimenting with housing reform for
several years. In Tianjin, a port near Beijing, 60 percent of all
government offices have stopped providing housing and have given
workers lump-sum payments to help them buy apartments.
	   Workers also save 5 percent of their salary, which the
government matches, in a housing account and withdraw it when they
are ready to buy.
	   Xu Yanhe, a 45-year-old retired factory worker, moved with her
husband, mother and daughter last July into an apartment complex
that is a national model for spacious, pleasant housing.
	   Pink and yellow buildings of different heights topped with red
tile roofs are clustered around a huge expanse of lawn _ a rare
sight in the world's most populous country.
	   Mrs. Xu and her family bought their dlrs 24,000 apartment with
savings, government help and a family loan. The three-bedroom
apartment with its brown floor tiles, wood paneling, new air
conditioners and lace curtains doubled their living space.
	   ``It's very light. There's nothing outside my windows, and it's
quiet all the time,'' said Mrs. Xu.
	   At the high end of the market are elegant apartments and big
suburban houses. These are bought by a new class of well-to-do
Chinese _ entrepreneurs, professionals and employees of large joint
venture businesses who also can afford cars, cell phones and
private schools.
	   But most wage earners cannot afford to buy apartments without
government help. Since the plan was disclosed in March, everyone
has been talking about housing _ a mix of reluctance to end the
welfare system and enthusiasm about a chance to buy.
	   Beijing's apartment blocks look both unfinished and decayed.
Most are gray or tan concrete, or red brick with concrete trim.
Main entries open to elevators or concrete stairways where the
paint is peeling and the lights don't work.
 &UR; What Beijingers have, pick up 16th graf pvs.

World finance officials meet to discuss Asian financial crisis 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with meeting beginning; ADDS byline

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Finance officials from around the world gathered
Saturday to discuss Asia's economic crisis and try to coordinate
strategies to battle turbulence in the currency markets that has
sent the region's economies into a tailspin.
	   The meeting in Tokyo is one of the broadest since Asia's
financial crisis began almost one year ago, and comes just days
after a major joint intervention by the United States and Japan to
stop the yen's recent freefall against the dollar.
	   Meeting Saturday were deputy finance ministers from the G-7
industrialized countries, Asian finance officials and
representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
dispatched Thursday on an emergency mission to hold talks on
Japan's economic woes and the yen's weakness, was also attending
the meeting.
	   The officials were expected to agree to coordinate efforts to
stabilize Asian currencies and to re-emphasize the importance of
shoring up the yen's value against the dollar.
	   Before the meeting began, however, concerns were already being
expressed that interventions like the one earlier this week can
only do so much _ and that the situation may well worsen again
quickly without more serious, long-term action by Japan.
	   Earlier this week, the United States made a dramatic foray into
world currency markets after the Japanese currency fell Wednesday
to its lowest level against the dollar in eight years.
	   The yen-buying action pushed the dollar down 7 yen in a mere
three days.
	   The yen's slide had raised fears that Asian countries may be
forced to engage in another round of competitive devaluations that
could trigger a repeat of last year's disastrous free fall in
regional currencies.
	   On Friday, Summers concluded a series of high-level meetings
with Japanese government officials and extracted promises that
Japan will take swift action to boost its ailing economy.
	   Summers and Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga vowed to
intervene again in currency markets to stabilize the yen if
necessary.
	   But experts worry that no amount of government intervention in
the currency market will restore long-term confidence in the yen
unless Japan takes swift and aggressive action to clean up its
ailing banking system.
	   Saturday's meeting was being watched closely for signs of just
how serious Japan will be in its efforts at the longer-term
structural reforms most experts agree it badly needs.
	   Japan has said it will implement a program to clean up the bad
loans at the nation's banks and accelerate reform of the country's
tax system to boost the economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has reportedly decided
to slash corporate taxes and announce a permanent income tax cut
before elections for the upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   During his talks Friday, Summers told Japanese officials that it
is more important for Japan to stimulate the economy than to put
the country's finances in order by tightening spending.
	   He also received assurances from senior members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party that Japan will set up a special financial
institution to take over debts at failed banks.
	   Japan's banks are saddled with 76 trillion yen (dlrs 563
billion) in bad debt and many are expected to collapse in the near
future as the government implements financial deregulation
measures.

Royals beat Tigers 8-4; Red Sox defeat Devil Rays 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Jeff King's two-run homer capped a four-run first
inning that carried the Kansas City Royals to an 8-4 victory over
the Detroit Tigers on Friday night.
	   The Royals, who also got a home run from Mike Sweeney, won their
third straight and sixth in their last eight. Brian Hunter hit two
doubles for the Tigers, who lost for the 14th time in 19 games.
	   Glendon Rusch (5-8), who shut out Detroit in his last start,
beat them again despite struggling through five innings. The
left-hander gave up four runs and nine hits, walked three and had
no strikeouts.
	   Ricky Bones, recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Omaha, pitched four
shutout innings for his first career save.
 &UR; Red Sox 4, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Nomar Garciaparra hit two solo
homers and Jason Varitek added another as Boston won its fourth
straight.
	   Steve Avery (4-1) allowed four hits over 5 1-3 innings to get
the win, Boston's ninth in 11 games, and Tom Gordon pitched the
ninth for his 22nd save.
	   Garciaparra, who has an 11-game hitting streak, homered off Tony
Saunders (1-7) in the sixth and hit another one off Rick White in
the ninth.
	   Saunders struck out a season-high 10 and gave up only three
hits, but Boston made every one of them count. John Valentin had a
RBI double in the first inning and Varitek hit an opposite-field
homer to right for a 3-1 lead in the eighth.
 &UR; Indians 7, Yankees 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jim Thome homered twice as the Indians handed
David Cone his first loss in 12 starts.
	   Thome hit a solo homer in the second and a two-run shot in the
seventh, his 19th, off left-hander Graeme Lloyd. Kenny Lofton hit
his second homer in three days as Cleveland evened the four-game
series between the division leaders at one apiece.
	   Scott Brosius homered and drove in three runs for the AL
East-leading Yankees (49-17), who still have the best record in
baseball.
	   Cone (9-2), who hadn't lost since April 4, allowed five earned
runs and eight hits in 5 1-3 innings. He walked three, had three
wild pitches, gave up two homers and hit a batter.
 &UR; Twins 10, White Sox 6 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Marty Cordova homered in his second consecutive game
and Matt Lawton had a three-run shot and four RBIs as the Minnesota
Twins beat the White Sox.
	   Cordova, who hit a solo homer Thursday, hit a two-run homer in a
four-run fourth inning as the Twins won for the fourth time in six
games. Lawton had an RBI single in the first and hit his seventh
homer of the season in the ninth.
	   Mike Trombley (3-2) picked up the win with 3 1-3 innings of
one-hit relief. Greg Swindell gave up two runs in the ninth,
including a solo homer to Robin Ventura, but pitched 2 1-3 innings
for his second save.
	   Jaime Navarro (5-9) took the loss, his sixth in his last seven
starts. He gave up seven runs and seven hits, walked four and threw
two wild pitches over four innings.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Mike Lieberthal hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in
the 12th inning Friday as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the
homer-happy Chicago Cubs 9-8.
	   With one out in the 12th, Scott Rolen reached on third baseman
Jose Hernandez's third error of the game and Rico Brogna singled
him to third. Rod Beck then replaced Terry Mulholland (2-2) and
Lieberthal hit a fly to center to score Rolen.
	   Chicago's Brant Brown, who hit three homers Thursday, tied the
game with a two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth off Mark
Leiter. Sammy Sosa, who had three homers Monday against Milwaukee,
hit two more, giving him 27 for the season and 14 in June, matching
Ryne Sandberg's club record.
	   The Cubs have 14 homers in their last five games.
 &UR; Expos 14, Braves 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Chris Widger homered twice and drove in four runs
as the Expos beat nine-game winner Kevin Millwood.
	   Widger and Shane Andrews hit consecutive homers off Millwood
(9-3) to start a six-run outburst in the second inning. Andrews
added a two-run double in the eighth for the Expos, who tied a
season-high with 15 hits.
	   Widger also hit a three-run homer in the fourth, and Rondell
White homered for the third consecutive game as Montreal reached
double figures in runs for the first time this season.
	   Millwood, who was trying to join teammate Greg Maddux as the
NL's only 10-game winners, was rocked for seven runs in 1 1-3
innings, his shortest outing of the season.
 &UR; Marlins 3, Mets 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Rick Reed took a perfect game into the seventh
inning for the second straight start at home before the Florida
Marlins got four straight hits and rallied to beat the Mets.
	   Reed (8-4) retired the first 19 batters before Edgar Renteria
hit a clean single with one out in the seventh to end Reed's second
recent bid for the Mets' first no-hitter.
	   Reed allowed six hits, struck out eight and walked none in 8 2-3
innings, and John Franco got one out to break the Mets record for
career appearances with 402. In his last home start, on June 8,
Reed didn't allow a baserunner for 6 2-3 innings before Tampa Bay's
Wade Boggs doubled.
	   Cliff Floyd hit a three-run homer in the seventh as the Marlins
rallied to hand New York its third straight loss.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Pirates 1 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Steve Woodard pitched 7 2-3 strong innings to get
his first home victory in 10 starts this season.
	   Woodard (4-5) gave up one run and five hits to win for the first
time this season at County Stadium, where he was 0-4. He also had
lost his last four decisions overall.
	   Woodard, who had pitched past the sixth just once all season,
took a no-hitter into the sixth before Doug Strange lined a shot
over shortstop Mark Loretta with one out. One out later, Strange
scored from second on Al Martin's single, pulling Pittsburgh to
2-1.
 &UR; Astros 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Carl Everett homered and drove in two runs, and Sean
Bergman survived a shaky start as the Astros handed Cincinnati its
sixth straight loss.
	   Everett hit his seventh homer in the second inning, and doubled
home a run in the fourth when the Astros got three doubles to take
a 4-2 lead.
	   Dmitri Young went 3-for-4 for the Reds, who have lost seven
straight road games.
	   Bergman (6-3) allowed five hits and two runs in the first
inning, but the right-hander limited the Reds to four hits over the
next eight. Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his 17th save.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Diamondbacks 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Brian Jordan went 3-for-4 with a home run and
three RBIs, and Mark Petkovsek pitched seven shutout innings for
the Carindals.
	   Petkovsek (5-3) allowed just four hits in extending his shutout
streak over the Diamondbacks to 12 innings. He pitched five
scoreless innings before leaving with a leg cramp in the Cardinals'
2-0 victory in Arizona on Sunday.
	   St. Louis fans missed one of their favorite attractions before
the game when Mark McGwire _ and the rest of the Cardinals _
skipped batting practice after arriving in town at 5 a.m. from
Houston.
	   Many fans in St. Louis and around the country have been coming
to the ballpark early to watch McGwire hit tape-measure homers in
batting practice. McGwire, who leads the majors with 33 homers,
went 1-for-4 in the game with a single.

Brazilian striker set to return to Vasco: Report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO,Brazil (AP) _ Tempermental Fiorentina striker
Edmundo could be back with Vasco da Gama just six months after he
left to join the Italian team, Brazilian media reported.
	   Edmundo _ known here as ``the Animal'' for his hot temper _
could return to Brazil as early July 16 to help Vasco face down
Argentina's River Plate in the semi-finals of the Libertadores Cup,
the Jornal dos Sports reported Friday.
	   ``In Italy it's difficult. I miss my friends. I like the beach
and the way of life. I'd be more happy if I was back playing
football in Brazil,'' Edmundo was quoted in the O Globo newspaper.
	   Edmundo's career at Fiorentina had been troubled from the
beginning. First, he chafed being kept on the reserves and
abandoned the team to travel to Rio for Carnival. More recently,
after he got on to the starting line-up his performance was largely
disappointing.
	   Edmundo's manager Pedrinho Vicencote was due to meet Fiorentina
president Cechi Gori on Friday to negotiate the forward's return,
the sports newspaper reported.
	   No one at Vasco was available for comment.

U.S. looking for more from China in proposal for WTO membership 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's new proposal to further open its service
sector does not go far enough to address U.S. concerns about its
bid to join the World Trade Organization, a spokesman for the U.S.
trade representative said Saturday.
	   ``While China put forward new proposals, those proposals are not
responsive to U.S. interests at this point,'' said Jay Ziegler,
spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
	   Barshefsky hoped to meet Saturday with Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng to offer new ideas about how China can further open
its markets. The talks would be ``more an exchange of ideas than
nuts and bolts negotiations,'' Ziegler said.
	   Washington has long been pressuring China to further open its
markets before it joins the WTO.
	   A breakthrough appeared unlikely before President Clinton
arrives in Beijing for a summit next week.
	   ``These are long, complex negotiations,'' Ziegler said. ``It's
unlikely to expect any particular new developments prior to the
Jiang-Clinton summit next week.''
	   Barshefsky met with Shi on Friday to discuss China's
long-stalled bid to join the WTO, the global body that sets trade
rules.
	   A new Chinese proposal would offer foreign companies greater
access to China's service sector, allowing more foreign competition
in its tightly controlled financial industry, telecommunications
and legal and accounting professions.
	   China is in the midst of economic struggles and is not eager to
expose domestic companies to competition. Its economic growth
targets are threatened by a drop in trade and investment due to the
Asian financial crisis, and it is trying to restructure debt-ridden
state industries while laying off millions of workers.

Barnes earns share of lead with Jenkins 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Brian Barnes, a burly Briton accustomed
to playing in bad weather, shot a 5-under-par 67 on a Friday that
featured rain, hail and lightning, earning a share of the lead in
the dlrs 1.1 million Canada Senior Open.
	   Barnes was at 136, 8-under for two rounds of the 6,942-yard
(6,346-meter) Glencoe Golf and Country Club course. Four back at
the start of the day, he forged into a tie for the midway lead with
Tom Jenkins, who shot a 71 Friday.
	   ``I would love to do this on a regular basis,'' said Barnes, 53,
a two-time British Senior Open winner. ``It was one of those rounds
that was easy and I put the ball in the position that I wanted to,
other than the second hole, to give myself any palpatations.''
	   Barnes's round was delayed by rain and lightning as he was
finishing the 17th hole. He had to wait almost 90 minutes before
resuming.
	   ``The putting is the department that has improved drastically
over the last few weeks,'' Barnes said. ``I just hope it
continues.''
	   Jenkins, a Senior PGA Tour rookie, was just glad to get through
the day.
	   ``It was a struggle out there. We started off wearing sweaters,
rain jackets and I have a hard enough time turning anyway without
anything on, much less with all that stuff,'' Jenkins said.
	   ``I hit a couple of bad shots on the first hole, made a great
par and then took off all of the sweaters.''
	   Bruce Summerhays held a piece of the 18-hole lead but a 73
Friday left him at 138, one shot back of Walter Hall, who shot a
second-round 68.
	   ``You're constantly fighting the elements, as well as the golf
course,'' Hall said. ``We were in and out of our rain gear,
umbrella up and down.''
	   Larry Laoretti had a 66, best of the day, and was at 139.
	   Jenkins, who said he thinks the weather this week is the worst
so far on the tour, qualified for the senior tour last November
after a PGA Tour career in which he won one tournament _ and that
in 1975.
	   Jenkins saved the day with birdies on the 15th and 16th holes to
get back under par for the round.
	   ``I thought the course was going to shut me out for birdies,''
he said.
	   ``It was a patient day of trying not to make too many
mistakes,'' he added. ``I'm glad the day is over.''

Duel of the rookies in Friendly's 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AGAWAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ First-round leader Heather
Daly-Donofrio and second-day upstart Marilyn Lovander were tied for
the lead near the midway point of the storm-marred LPGA Friendly's
Classic on Friday.
	   Both had 7-under-par 137 totals, although Daly-Donofrio wasn't
able to play her final hole because of the heavy rain and
electrical storms.
	   Lovander, with the help of a 30-foot (9-meter) eagle putt on No.
7, had a 68 Friday. Daly-Donofrio carded a 5-under 67 in the first
round and was two under Friday going to the 18th tee.
	   One stroke behind tour rookie Christy Erb who had a second 69.
	   Lovander, a 43-year-old who said she didn't pick up a golf club
until she was 19 and turned pro at 30, made her surge when she
followed the eagle with a birdie on No. 8. She was playing the
front nine last.
	   ``My driving actually was pretty poor but I made enough good
shots to make up for it,'' she said.
	   Daly-Donofrio had two birdies in the first four holes Friday.
She was to finish her second round Saturday before playing the
third round.
	   ``I'm just tired from hanging around,'' Daly-Donofrio said after
a delay that lasted over an hour before play was finally called for
good.
	   ``I'm happy with the way things went. I was able to stay calm
and keep my emotions inside,'' said Erb, who admitted to having
attitude problems in the past.
	   From 14-17 she went birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey.
	   ``If I did lose focus it was on 17 where I hit trees and water.
But the key for me was being able to recover,'' Erb said.
	   Erb, who finally qualified for the LPGA tour this year on her
fifth attempt, finished with five birdies and two bogeys.
	   Two strokes behind the leaders at 139 were Charlotta Sorenstam,
who had a 70, and Val Skinner, who had a 71.
	   A three-putt on No. 9 was Sorenstam's only mistake in a round
which included three birdies.
	   ``I'm pleased with both my chipping and putting,'' she said. ``I
had more ups and downs than I normally do.''
	   Things didn't fare too well for Elizabeth Janangelo, a
14-year-old amateur who was playing her first LPGA tour event.
Janangelo, from the United States, failed to make the cut after an
82 left her at 168.
	   Lisa Walters, who tied the LPGA record with her 23-under 265
total in winning the Oldsmobile Classic last week, had a 72 and was
at 143.

Nigeria continues to prove Africa's rise in prominence

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ What Cameroon promised, Nigeria seems intent on
delivering.
	   The Super Eagles recorded their second straight victory and
confidently moved into the second round of the World Cup on Friday,
giving more credence Africa's rise in world soccer.
	   ``For people who like the spectacular, we make it spectacular,''
Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said following the Africans' 1-0
victory over Bulgaria in Parc des Princes.
	   With Spain and Paraguay playing to a comparatively dull goalless
draw, Nigeria clinched the Group D title and will advance to the
second round as one of the top eight teams at France '98.
	   Eight years ago in Italy, Cameroon's ``Indomitable Lions''
advanced all the way to the quarterfinals, shocking the world
before being beaten by England in extra time. It was a wake-up call
that alerted the globe to the emergence of African soccer.
	   FIFA increased Africa's slot to three for 1994 and added two
more for France.
	   With seasoning of its players in European pro leagues, Nigeria
won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta two years ago and now seems
to have aimed its target higher.
	   Combined with a 3-2 victory over Spain, Nigeria joined Brazil
and France as the third nation to guarantee its spot in the round
of 16 and shared with the defending champion the honor of winning
its group with a game left to play.
	   Mexico had a chance to clinch its place in the second round
Saturday, facing Belgium at Bordeaux in Group E. Netherlands was to
play South Korea in Marseilles in that group's other game.
	   Japan was to play Croatia in Group H in Nantes in Saturday's
other game.
	   ``We attack because that is the style that fits Nigeria best.
Bora has come to understand this,'' said Victor Ikpeba, whose
27th-minute goal provided the victory over Bulgaria. ``And to try
to change us at this time would not be wise.''
	   Ikpeba completed a three-man combination, finishing after
Jay-Jay Okocha's initial pass was flicked on by the outside of
Daniel Amokachi's foot into the middle of the penalty area.
	   The AS Monaco forward one-touched the ball past sweeper Trifon
Ivanov and rolled it under keeper Zdravko Zdravkov's right arm for
his second goal in the green-and-white and first in the World Cup.

Casey Martin rides into weekend play despite some poor driving AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Casey Martin was tired, but happy. Driving
his cart up the 18th fairway, he needed only to avoid disaster to
make the cut in his first U.S. Open.
	   Martin's tee shot was buried in the deep rough and he hacked
out, then chipped on. Two putts later, he had his bogey and a
1-over-par 71 Friday that ensured he would play two more rounds at
The Olympic Club.
	   A day after driving into Open history, Martin was riding into
weekend play.
	   ``I didn't play well and still I made the cut in the U.S.
Open,'' Martin said. ``It gives me confidence that I know I should
be here, that I can compete here.''
	   Urged on by crowds who shouted ``Go get 'em Casey,'' Martin was
still a curiosity to many as he maneuvered his green golf court
through towering Cypress trees and limped toward greens.
	   But he showed that he could play a little golf too, staying
under par until the 17th hole despite hitting only five fairways
all day. He bogeyed the last two holes, but still finished the two
rounds at a solid 5-over 145.
	   ``I'd love to be known more as a golfer than a person with a
disability,'' Martin said. ``I'm probably never going to lose that
label, though.''
	   Martin, after shooting a 74 the first round, started Friday's
round with a flourish by chipping out from underneath a tree to
within three feet for a birdie on No. 1. It was the first of many
saves with a short game that was badly needed on a day Martin did
not drive the ball well.
	   Martin made two more birdies against two bogeys to stay one
under for the day before a bad 5-iron on the difficult 17th cost
him a bogey, followed by a drive in the rough on 18 for a second
bogey.
	   ``It's disappointing I finished that way. I thought I could have
snatched something I probably didn't deserve out of the round,''
Martin said.
	   There were no incidents involving Martin's golf cart as he drove
it slowly up fairways because the large crowds at Olympic jammed
the cart paths. Martin drove near most greens, then let a golf
official take the cart to the next tee.
	   The hills at Olympic would have taken their toll on Martin's
diseased right leg, but he was not entirely comfortable riding in
the cart either.
	   ``It's hard to get a tempo going,'' Martin said. ``And it's
always awkward on the first tee when you're driving off alone. I'd
much prefer walking.''
	   Martin's cart did come in handy for his playing partners, too.
On the 2nd tee, Ed Fryatt had hit his drive when he looked to a
USGA official and motioned to him, asking if he could sit in the
cart.
	   ``As long as it doesn't move,'' official Ed Gowan said.
	   Fryatt sat on the back of the cart, and then amateur playing
partner David Eger joined him, sitting in the driver's seat. Then
Martin hit, and the two got out to walk up the hilly fairway while
Martin got behind the wheel for a drive.

World Cup violent play worries Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ As Brazil's soccer artists take
center stage at the World Cup, the team worries that lax refereeing
won't let them perform.
	   Brazilians are alarmed at the leniency of referees for vicious
fouls and the waffling stance of FIFA, the sport's governing body,
on what is and isn't allowed.
	   ``FIFA has to make a quick decision so the Cup maintains its
sparkle,'' team coordinator Zico said Friday. ``When that business
starts about winning at any cost ... all of soccer loses.''
	   Brazil's concern for its athletes' safety grew in last Tuesday's
game with Morocco. After Ronaldo scored in the ninth minute, the
Atlas Lions went gunning for the two-time FIFA Player of the Year.
	   In the 18th minute, Morocco's Said Chiba slid in with cleats
high, ripping Ronaldo's shorts and leaving a gash on his left
thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov didn't even show a
yellow card.
	   ``Against Morocco, some players should have been expelled and
weren't,'' said Zico. ``Sure, people make mistakes, but you can't
permit dirty fouls that can hurt athletes.''
	   It's not the first sign of slack authority. Despite promises
that sliding tackles from behind would be punished with expulsion,
FIFA backtracked days before the Cup and said referees should judge
intent and not simply the act.
	   ``We were perplexed,'' Zico said. ``All of those who love soccer
want extreme rigor against this type of play. It's criminal, but in
this Cup we can have it.''
	   Zico is among the most outspoken critics of dirty play _ and
with good reason. In 1985, his knee was shattered by a cleats-up
tackle. Although he was called to the 1986 World Cup, Zico was
never the same afterwards.
	   Although the Brazilian Soccer Confederation has protested about
the rough play in Cup, the final word belongs to referees, said
Zico.
	   ``The referees have to take a stance,'' he said. ``They are the
maximum authority to prevent dirty tackles. The Cup is entering a
stage where good refereeing is essential.''
	   Recently, FIFA urged referees to be tougher _ but then made
veiled criticism of Colombia's John Jairo Toro and Mexico's Arturo
Brizio for cracking down too hard. After they handed out five red
cards between them, FIFA's chief spokesman said the two
overreacted.
	   ``The first days, there was too much leniency,'' spokesman Keith
Cooper said. ``Yesterday (Thursday), the movement was in the
opposite direction.''
	   All the Brazilians want is simply to play. It's what they do
best.
	   ``The advice we give our players is to play soccer,'' said Zico.
``I've never seen anyone punished for just playing.''

Tracy suspended from Saturday's qualifying in unprecedented CART penalty AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Paul Tracy was suspended from Saturday's
second day of qualifying for the Budweiser-G.I. Joe's 200, the
first time a driver has been banned from any competition in the
20-year history of U.S. Championship Auto Racing Teams.
	   CART said Tracy had taken an ``unjustifiable risk'' that led to
a crash in Friday's first round of qualifying, his fifth crash this
season. He also was fined dlrs 20,000.
	   CART chief steward Wally Dallenbach took the action after Tracy,
placed on probation June 11 after he crashed with Christian
Fittipaldi's car in the Detroit Grand Prix two weeks ago, struck
and sailed over Michel Jourdain Jr.'s car on Friday in the first
lap, known as the out lap, after the two cars had emerged from a
pit stop.
	   ``The accident was preventable and should not have happened on
an out lap for both race cars,'' Dallenbach said in a statement
issued by CART.
	   Tracy will be allowed to take part in Sunday's race using the
time he had in his brief qualifying appearance on Friday. He was
12th fastest on Friday but undoubtedly will slide farther down the
starting grid after Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``I'm disappointed, but that's life,'' Tracy said in a statement
released by his team.
	   Dario Franchitti, Tracy's teammate, held the provisional pole on
Friday, leading six drivers who broke the track record at Portland
International Raceway.
	   Several drivers have been placed on probation by CART, including
Tracy, Alex Zanardi and Michael Andretti over the past two years.
But this was the first time a driver any further action had been
taken against a driver on probation.
	   Tracy, 29, has 13 career victories. He is in his first year with
Team Kool Green after he was replaced on the highly successful
Marlboro Team Penske after last season. Tracy was fined dlrs 25,000
last year for what CART termed ``unjustifiable risk or reckless
endangerment'' in his driving.
	   Before the suspension was announced, Tracy said he had planned
to pass Jordain as he approached him on the back straightaway of
the 1.967-mile (3.17-kilometer) road course.
	   ``I guess he didn't see me because he got on the brakes really
hard and there was nothing I could do,'' Tracy said.
	   But Jordain said he was not going exceptionally slow, especially
since it was the first lap out of the pits.
	   ``I was not going very fast, but I wasn't too slow either,''
Jordain said. ``The undertray of his car hit the rollbar of mine,
and his car bent the top half of my steering wheel. It was very
dangerous.''
	   The director of Jourdain's Herdez-Viva Mexico team, Antonio
Marron, complained to Dallenbach.
	   ``It's a typical Tracy move,'' Marron said. ``I am very angry.''
	   The complaint helped lead to Tracy's suspension.
	   Franchitti harbored no illusions that his Friday speed would
hold up in Saturday's second round of qualifying.
	   The 25-year-old Scotsman's Honda-powered Reynard took the
provisional pole with a top lap speed of 120.386 mph, or 58.821
seconds.
	   Bryan Herta, whose Ford Cosworth sustained some rear-end damage
when he hit the wall in the morning practice session, came back to
finish second in the qualifying at 119.657 mph (192.56 kph). Scott
Pruett, the pole sitter last year in Portland, was third in a Ford
Cosworth at 119.655 mph (192.56 kph).
	   The top six qualifiers broke the track record of 59.383 seconds,
or 119.246 mph (191.90 kph), set by Pruett last year. It was no
coincidence that those six drivers all had tested their cars in
Portland two months ago.
	   Franchitti, Herta and Pruett all bettered 58 seconds in their
April testing in Portland. But they couldn't match that kind of
speed Friday on a track that was much more slippery than it was two
months ago.
	   ``We tested in the 57's and I showed up this morning expecting
to be reasonably in that ballpark, but we weren't,'' Franchitti
said. ``I was getting kind of frustrated, to be honest, but Don
(team engineer Don Halliday) calmed me down.''

World Cup violent play worries Brazil

	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ As Brazil's soccer artists take
center stage at the World Cup, the team worries that lax refereeing
won't let them perform.
	   Brazilians are alarmed at the leniency of referees for vicious
fouls and the waffling stance of FIFA, the sport's governing body,
on what is and isn't allowed.
	   ``FIFA has to make a quick decision so the Cup maintains its
sparkle,'' team coordinator Zico said Friday. ``When that business
starts about winning at any cost ... all of soccer loses.''
	   Brazil's concern for its athletes' safety grew in last Tuesday's
game with Morocco. After Ronaldo scored in the ninth minute, the
Atlas Lions went gunning for the two-time FIFA Player of the Year.
	   In the 18th minute, Morocco's Said Chiba slid in with cleats
high, ripping Ronaldo's shorts and leaving a gash on his left
thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov didn't even show a
yellow card.
	   ``Against Morocco, some players should have been expelled and
weren't,'' said Zico. ``Sure, people make mistakes, but you can't
permit dirty fouls that can hurt athletes.''
	   It's not the first sign of slack authority. Despite promises
that sliding tackles from behind would be punished with expulsion,
FIFA backtracked days before the Cup and said referees should judge
intent and not simply the act.
	   ``We were perplexed,'' Zico said. ``All of those who love soccer
want extreme rigor against this type of play. It's criminal, but in
this Cup we can have it.''
	   Zico is among the most outspoken critics of dirty play _ and
with good reason. In 1985, his knee was shattered by a cleats-up
tackle. Although he was called to the 1986 World Cup, Zico was
never the same afterwards.
	   Although the Brazilian Soccer Confederation has protested about
the rough play in Cup, the final word belongs to referees, said
Zico.
	   ``The referees have to take a stance,'' he said. ``They are the
maximum authority to prevent dirty tackles. The Cup is entering a
stage where good refereeing is essential.''
	   Recently, FIFA urged referees to be tougher _ but then made
veiled criticism of Colombia's John Jairo Toro and Mexico's Arturo
Brizio for cracking down too hard. After they handed out five red
cards between them, FIFA's chief spokesman said the two
overreacted.
	   ``The first days, there was too much leniency,'' spokesman Keith
Cooper said. ``Yesterday (Thursday), the movement was in the
opposite direction.''
	   All the Brazilians want is simply to play. It's what they do
best.
	   ``The advice we give our players is to play soccer,'' said Zico.
``I've never seen anyone punished for just playing.''

Nigeria continues to prove Africa's rise in prominence

	   PARIS (AP) _ What Cameroon promised, Nigeria seems intent on
delivering.
	   The Super Eagles recorded their second straight victory and
confidently moved into the second round of the World Cup on Friday,
giving more credence Africa's rise in world soccer.
	   ``For people who like the spectacular, we make it spectacular,''
Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said following the Africans' 1-0
victory over Bulgaria in Parc des Princes.
	   With Spain and Paraguay playing to a comparatively dull goalless
draw, Nigeria clinched the Group D title and will advance to the
second round as one of the top eight teams at France '98.
	   Eight years ago in Italy, Cameroon's ``Indomitable Lions''
advanced all the way to the quarterfinals, shocking the world
before being beaten by England in extra time. It was a wake-up call
that alerted the globe to the emergence of African soccer.
	   FIFA increased Africa's slot to three for 1994 and added two
more for France.
	   With seasoning of its players in European pro leagues, Nigeria
won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta two years ago and now seems
to have aimed its target higher.
	   Combined with a 3-2 victory over Spain, Nigeria joined Brazil
and France as the third nation to guarantee its spot in the round
of 16 and shared with the defending champion the honor of winning
its group with a game left to play.
	   Mexico had a chance to clinch its place in the second round
Saturday, facing Belgium at Bordeaux in Group E. Netherlands was to
play South Korea in Marseilles in that group's other game.
	   Japan was to play Croatia in Group H in Nantes in Saturday's
other game.
	   ``We attack because that is the style that fits Nigeria best.
Bora has come to understand this,'' said Victor Ikpeba, whose
27th-minute goal provided the victory over Bulgaria. ``And to try
to change us at this time would not be wise.''
	   Ikpeba completed a three-man combination, finishing after
Jay-Jay Okocha's initial pass was flicked on by the outside of
Daniel Amokachi's foot into the middle of the penalty area.
	   The AS Monaco forward one-touched the ball past sweeper Trifon
Ivanov and rolled it under keeper Zdravko Zdravkov's right arm for
his second goal in the green-and-white and first in the World Cup.
