<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. Urged to Settle Difference with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean industrialists,
business people and political scientists Sunday called on their
government to settle differences with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their shocks at reports that the ruling Zimbabwe
African Nation Union (Patriotic Front) politburo had decided to
cut ties with the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Dialog should have been opened with the Bretton Woods
institutions to force them to provide money to support the
country's economic reforms, they said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
Kumbirail Katsande said Sunday that the business community was
disturbed by the ruling party's decision.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Katsande as saying that he
believed there was still room for the government to have dialog
with the international institutions to reach concrete agreements
since they were the major backers of the country's economic reform
programs started in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan
Shamuyarira, who is also the secretary for information and
publicity of the ruling party, was quoted by the weekly Sunday
Mail as saying that the party had made the decision so as to seek
alternative sources of funding for its economic programs.
</P>
<P>
The two international institutions made numerous demands to the
 Zimbabwean government as a prerequisite for releasing balance of
payment support of 53 million U.S. dollars, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was against Zimbabwe's land acquisition program and its
 involvement in the wad in the Democratic Rrepublic of Congo while
the World Bank wanted Harare to decide on one project between the
Gokwe North Power Station and the extension of Hwange Thermal
Power Station.
</P>
<P>
Katsande said the international institutions should provide
money to the country whose economy was going through a rough path
with no sign of improvement in sight.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce,
Nhlanhla Masuku said that it was important the government clarify
its position with regards to its latest relations with the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue should be discussed at government level and
not just by the party.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Criticizes U.S. Double Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday
criticized the United States for adopting double standards
concerning the defense issue of Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General Mohamed Zakaria Ismail said in a
statement that the U.S. opposes Russia's help in maintaining and
developing Syria's defense weapons while it arms Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the U.S. attitude of opposing Russia's defense
assistance to Syria while it pledges to give all kinds of military
aid, without limits, to Israel, which is occupying Arab
territories," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League "categorically rejects" the U.S. double
standards, the league official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies and research centers were reportedly helping
upgrade Syria's defense system, which was installed by the former
Soviet Union in the 1960s-70s. The U.S. has expressed opposition
to the Russian move.
</P>
<P>
The American approach will not be an encouraging element on the
way to make a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
particularly as the United States always declares that it is
determined to help realize peace in the region, Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the league's support for Syria and its right to get
the arms needed to upgrade national defense, especially its Golan
Heights is still under the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zimbabwe Federal
Party Sunday urged the government to urgently convene a
constitutional conference on drafting a new constitution of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The interim president of the opposition party, Richard Ncube
warned that time was running out for drafting a new constitution
and if the country does not hasten with the process, it may be
overtaken by events beyond its control and liking.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted Ncube as saying that those to be invited to
the conference would include opposition parties, trade unions,
commercial and industrial leaders, lawyers, chiefs, civic and
church organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will not only tackle political and constitutional
matters, but other issues like moral standards, AIDS and erosion
of good traditional and cultural values," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conference should usher in a new constitution
which would pave the way for a federal system of government and
autonomy for provinces in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"The only conflict prevention mechanism is to prepare a
political system that recognizes these differences and build an
amicable bridge and harmony before these differences become a
source of hostility as has happened in other countries," he noted.

<HEADLINE> King of Jordan Arrives in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Al
Hussein arrived in Abu Dhabi on Sunday for a three-day visit to
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in an effort to boost ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old monarch, who arrived from Oman, was greeted at
the airport by UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan,
Deputy President and Prime Minister Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al
Maktoum and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's entourage includes Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Raouf Al Rawabdeh, Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Al Khateeb and
other ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit is expected to give a new push toward the
common interests of the two countries and to strengthen the
bilateral relations which date back to the early 1970s, when
Jordan rushed to the help of the then newly independent UAE.
</P>
<P>
The two countries entered into a number of agreements in
mid-70s in the information, cultural, educational, communication,
agricultural, electricity and energy sectors as well as on the
recruitment of labor and exchange of technical experts.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were renewed during an important meeting
between the two sides in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the political arena, the two countries are bent on shunning
differences and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed gave his full support to King Abdullah when he
was crowned in February, expressing his confidence that the new
king will follow the steps of his father, the late King Hussein,
who enjoyed world respect for his efforts in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Acting on orders by Sheikh Zayed, the UAE Central Bank
deposited 150 million U.S. dollars in the Jordanian Central Bank
on February 5, 1999 to support Jordan's foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed also issued four decrees in March on
strengthening bilateral cooperation on air, sea and land transport
and ports.
</P>
<P>
During the current visit, King Abdullah and Sheikh Zayed are
expected to discuss ways to further improve bilateral relations as
well as exchange views on international and regional issues.

<HEADLINE> Arab Holds Two-Third of World Oil Reserve: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil reserves in the Arab
world were 643.4 billion barrels last January, or 61.2 percent of
the around 1,052 billion barrels of the total global reserve, an
Arab oil expert said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Oil reserves in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Iraq account for about 54 percent of the world reserve
and 88 percent of the total Arab reserve, said Mohammad
Al-Lababidi, head of the Technical Department of the Organization
of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), at a seminar on oil
and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Until last January, Kuwait's oil reserve stood at 96.5 billion
barrels, Saudi Arabia at 261.5 billion, the UAE at 98.1 billion
and Iraq at 112.5 billion, Lababidi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that around 585 billion barrels of oil were located in
the eastern side of the Arab world and some 58 billion barrels in
North African countries.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that natural gas reserve in the Arab world was
estimated in January 1998 at around 32.6 trillion cubic meters, or
21.4 percent of global reserve of about 152.5 trillion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Of the total Arab gas reserve, he said, Qatar holds 26
percent, the UAE 18.4 percent, Saudi Arabia 17.7 percent and
Algeria 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lababidi said there are strong possibilities of discovering
new oil and gas wells in the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the volume of undiscovered oil was at 163-208
billion barrels, while around 23 trillion cubic meters of gas
might not have been found yet.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos Criticizes NATO Airstrikes Against </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Sunday criticized the bombing raids by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Yugoslavia, saying that
failure was inherent in NATO's policy of confrontation and
bombings, which had its limits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour of military units in Attica prefecture,
Tsohatzopoulos said that conditions were quickly evolving towards
the chance for political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Extending military operations from airstrikes to ground warfare
was a step that the parties involved would manage to avoid, he
said, adding that Greece would not participate in a possible NATO
ground operation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that a withdrawal of Serb forces and the
unimpeded return of all refugees to Kosovo, guaranteed by an
international force, were a realistic base to work towards peace.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos Sunday also denounced
NATO's military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was inadmissible for bombings to occur in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned About Israel's Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official Sunday
expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli
settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the
peace making between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk urged Israel to stop these activities
which "can affect and prejudge the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Indyk arrived in Israel earlier Sunday for talks to enhance
the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic
Cooperation, which was signed in October last year and designed
to improve Israel's defense and deterrence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and its principal ally in the Middle East
should remain coordinated in face of threats of ballistic
missiles and non-conventional weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he said the strategic cooperation also has another aspect,
that is, to look for ways to move forward the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"The window of peacemaking is closed," he said, citing the
frozen agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and the
stalemate on the Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
He said "some questions have occurred" concerning the
U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, referring to the Jewish
settlement activities in the West Bank, "particularly in central
West Bank."
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, Washington has expressed its concern
on several occasions over Israel's land grabbing and settlement
expansion in the West Bank, saying it is a reversal of Israeli
assurance that such activity would not be carried out.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, both sides
should not take unilateral actions which will change the status
quo in Gaza and the West Bank before the talks on final status end.
</P>
<P>
Washington said unilateral actions include Jewish settlement
activity on the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the settlement
issue during talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in
Washington last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross bluntly
dismissed the settlement activity as "destructive" to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Indyk's remarks, Netanyahu repeated the
government's line that Israel has pledged not to build new
settlements but never promised to stop the expansion of existing
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Washington has, however, said that the accelerated Jewish
settlement activity in the recent months included construction of
new settlements as well as an expansion of settlements well beyond
their existing perimeters, in many cases involving expansions to
distant hilltops.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Bomb Attack in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Three soldiers and one civilian
were killed on Sunday in a bomb explosion in southern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the blast exploded at Dereli village in
Osmaniye town of Adana province.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that terrorists had controlled the time bomb
from the remote area, added the agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency also reported that a group of terrorists
at the same day had launched an armed attack against the security
forces in Erbaa town of northern province of Tokat, wounding seven
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched by Kurdish
rebels in protest against the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, who had
been leading the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) for
fighting for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey
since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been jailed on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
Turkey's western province of Bursa on charges of treason. He may
face the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Gulf-U.S. Military Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday blamed the Gulf states for holding war games
with the United States in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Some Persian Gulf states expressed concern over Iran's
military maneuvers, which have been carried out in Iranian waters,
but they invited foreign forces to hold war games in the region,"
Kharrazi said at a joint press conference with his South African
counterpart Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister referred to recent joint military
exercises held by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with the United
States and France in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that the presence of foreign forces in the
region would not bring security to the region, but it would create
more tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The security in the Persian Gulf region will be guaranteed
only through cooperation among the regional countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the UAE lodged a strong protest to Iran's military
exercises in the Gulf, particularly in the waters near the three
islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs, over which
both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claim sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council also expressed
concern over Iranian war games in the Gulf and called on Iran to
settle its disputes with the UAE over the three islands near the
strategic shipping lane at the mouth of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran beat back the charges against it by saying that
any criticism should go to those maneuvers held jointly with the
U.S. and Britain which have no rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands in 1971 after the British
forces pulled out from the region. However, both Tehran and Abu
Dhabi claim sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran insisted on bilateral talks to
solve the issue, but the UAE called for an international
arbitration.

<P>
Police have confirmed the explosion and said that they are

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Pledges to Pay Back Depositors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has assured all depositors of the recently closed Greenland Bank
Limited (GBL) that they will all be paid their money.
</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge Sunday at the four-day ongoing
National Executive Committee meeting of the ruling National
Resistance Movement in Jinja town, 80 kms east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The GBL issue came up as the meeting was discussing a paper
presented by the Director of Economic Affairs at the Movement
secretariat Ezra Suruma.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will be responsible for the
depositors' interest and asked Bank of Uganda, the central bank,
to better supervise the operations of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The GBL was closed because it became insolvent and it was only
the bank' s insolvency and not politics that led to its closure on
April 1, the president explained.
</P>
<P>
To shield the country from another such debacle, the central
bank is now going to ensure that the minimum requirements will
have to be high for any bank to open up business.
</P>
<P>
The closed GBL has about 120,000 depositors. It was declared
bankruptcy by the central bank just before the long Easter
holiday, prompting many depositors to cry for their money.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Unmoved By Air Raid On Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing air strike
against Yugoslavia launched by the U.S.-led North Atlantic
Treaty Organization two weeks ago has not boosted military
stocks on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has been unmoved by the "barking dogs of war"
which was unleashed on March 24, the New York times said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Persian Gulf war, a far bigger
military operation than the attack NATO has waged thus far
against Yugoslavia, generated interest in military stocks in
1990 and 1991 and the group outperformed the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 stock index. Wars don't always light a fire under
military stocks, but they usually don't hurt, it said .
</P>
<P>
Byron Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch said in a report
that a three-to-six-week air attack would result in no more than
200 million to 300 million U.S. dollars in supplemental spending
by the Defense Department to replace munitions and electronics
consumed in the operation and that sort of money is not going to
make much of a difference to the six giant companies in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The S. &AMP; P. Aerospace-Defense Index is now 31.8 percent below
its 52-233k high, which was last April.
</P>
<P>
Pierre A. Chao, senior aerospace-defense analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter said events like Iraq and Kosovo are
important to the extent that they draw attention to the sad
fact that peace on earth is not here. But they won't drive
earnings or the stocks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The important numbers are the Defense Department outlays
requested by the Clinton Administration for the coming fiscal
year through 2005, stock analysts said. The Clinton
Administration has proposed a steady increases in outlays for
weapons procurement from 53 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2000
to 75.1 billion dollars in fiscal 2005.

<HEADLINE> Punjab Assembly Speaker Hosts Civic Reception for Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, Pakistan, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Parvez Ellahi, speaker
of Punjab's Provincial Assembly, hosted a grand civic reception
in the historical Lahore Fort Sunday in honor of Li Peng,
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Ellahi said the relationship between
Pakistan and China had been a model for the international
community. "China has always been a reliable friend of Pakistan,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan-China relations were based on mutual beneficiality,
mutual respect and mutual understanding, said Ellahi, adding that
"Pakistan and China share weal and woe, and we feel proud of
this."
</P>
<P>
Ellahi expressed his profound appreciation for China's support
and assistance to Pakistan in times of need, saying China has
played "an important role" in Pakistan's economic construction and
social development.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "a strong and prosperous China will continue to
play an active role in defending the rights and interests of the
developing countries and in safeguarding peace and security of the
world."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, like China, is willing to establish good-neighborly
and cooperative relations with all the countries in the region,
and attaches equal importance to economic development and national
defense.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that a close and friendly relationship
between Pakistan and China will continuously be fortified and
developed in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the China-Pakistan friendship dates back far into
the history, as it started to come along with the ancient "Silk
Road." Since China and Pakistan established diplomatic ties 48
years ago, the good-neighborly and friendly relations between the
two countries have been developing smoothly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader reiterated that no matter how the world
situation may change, China was, is, and will continue to be a
trust-worthy and reliable friend of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Acting Speaker of the National Assembly Jaffer Iqbal, Federal
Information Minister, also the minister in waiting Mushahid
Hussain, Mayor of Lahore Ahmad Hassan, all members of the Punjab
Provincial Assembly and senior members of the provincial
government attended the civic reception.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Says Spy Network Smashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Sunday that its
security service has smashed a spy network run by an Australian
national.
</P>
<P>
According to Serbian Radio and Television, Major Steve Pratt,
operating under the cover of the Care International relief agency,
collected intelligence information in Yugoslavia about military
and police movements prior to NATO's air strikes, and about the
effects of the air raids.
</P>
<P>
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia have entered the 19th day
since the commencement on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before Serbian television cameras, Pratt said he was
born in Australia in 1949, that he is an Australian national and
that, before coming to Yugoslavia, he had worked in northern Iraq,
Yemen, Zaire, Rwanda and Kenya for the Care Australia relief
agency.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that, since coming to Yugoslavia, he had been doing
certain intelligence work, using Care Australia as his cover,
Tanjug reported.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Halt Palestinians' ID Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Interior Ministry
announced Sunday it will halt withdrawal of identity cards (ID)
of the Palestinians born in Jerusalem but living outside the city.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's decision was made in response to Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert who told the ministry that withdrawing indentity
cards has not achieved positive results, but forced more
Palestinians to return to the city.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has informed the High Court of Justice of its
decision and the High Court is scheduled to decide over this issue
on April 22, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian statistics, more than 25,000
Palestinians have returned during the past several years to East
Jerusalem and more will do so.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister in Charge of
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini Sunday voiced suspicion over the
decision, saying Israel announced several times in the past to
halt this policy, but in fact it did not.
</P>
<P>
The PNA demands the return of all the Palestinians who used to
live in Jerusalem before 1967 and the return of the Palestinians'
indentity cards that had been confiscated by Israel in the past,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Israel allowed Palestinians to retain their
permanent resident status in Jerusalem as long as they did not
live abroad for more than seven years and returned periodically
to the city.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, Israel abruptly changed course, and had many
Palestinians' indentity cards revoked and were forced to leave the
city.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Interior Ministry has denied permanent status
to the Palestinians who have been forced to move to the city's
suburbs because of lack of housing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, as well as Israel's National Insurance Institute,
denied these Palestinians' rights on grounds that their "center of
life" had changed to another town, even if members of their family
still live in Jerusalem and their children study there.
</P>
<P>
The residency status of some 788 Palestinians were revoked in
1998, 606 in 1997, 189 in 1996 and 96 in 1995, according to
Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli and 14 Palestinian human rights organizations
last year petitioned the High Court of Justice over the issue of
revoked residency permits for Palestinians. The Court is
scheduled to discuss the issue also on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Clan Clashe Kill 6 People in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and more than nine others were wounded in two separate armed clan
confrontations in Mogadishu Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first case, at least two people were killed and four
other were wounded when two battle wagons belonging to the same
Suleman sub clan of Habar Gidir exchange fire in front of two
telecommunications companies, Al- Barakat and Acrolite Somalia,
along Hawlwadag Road, one of the busiest streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not known. However, sources
close to the Suleman gunmen said that the rival sides fired at
each other over the ownership of guns earlier distributed by
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid to the Suleman militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The second and more serious incident took place in the heart of
 Mogadishu's largest market of Bakara.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses in the market, about six heavily
armed men from the Sheikhal sub clan have launched an attack
against Sadiq Ahmed, a well-known businessman in the market.
</P>
<P>
They said that the gunmen fired at the market security guards
and the relatives of Sadiq, who fired back. As a result, four
people were killed, three of whom were the attackers, while five
more civilians were wounded in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is reported to be related to an
earlier killing within the rival sub clansmen of Sheikhal.
Sheikhal elders have characterized the attack as purely
retaliatory action.
</P>
<P>
The absence of the long-expected demobilized and uniformed
former police and militia personnel from the streets has been
attributed to the growing lawlessness and insecurity in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The uniformed men have not been paid since late last year and
it is believed that some of them are now contributing to the
instability of the capital city in a bid to earn their khat (a
stimulant chewed as tea) and food through the introduction of the
use of their guns.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Ready for Selling Ivory Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- All is set for Zimbabwe to sell 20
tons of its 40-ton ivory stock at a public auction in Harare
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Ministry of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications said in a statement Sunday that Japanese buyers
would view the ivory to be auctioned at the National Ivory Store.
</P>
<P>
The auction comes as a result of the transfer of African
elephants in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe from Appendix one to
two at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) conference held in Harare in June, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the convention, it is illegal to kill animals
listed on Appendix one as they might become extinct.
</P>
<P>
The three countries were allowed by the convention to conduct
an experimental trade with Japan after fulfilling certain
stringent conditions.
</P>
<P>
Namibia had already sold about 13 tons of ivory with Botswana
expected to sell over 25 tons by next week.

<HEADLINE> NATO Destroys Two More Radio Sites in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Spokesman Jamie Shea said here Sunday that the
allied forces during last 24 hours concentrated on targets in
Kosovo, including two radio relay stations.
</P>
<P>
He said at a daily news briefing that NATO attacks focused
particularly on an assembly area, petroleum oil and lubricant
facilities at Pristina. "There was some cruise missile attack
against two radio relay stations, I stressed the way that these
were strictly military targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But as you can see that last night NATO had a relative
restraint. We were mindful of the Orthodox Easter celebration. At
the same time, the Yugoslav armed forces continue to demonstrate
signs of wear and tear as a result of our operations," he told
reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"One thing that we are tracking at the moment are the
mobilization problems, and manpower call-up problems that Yugoslav
army is facing," Shea said. "Belgrade is turning wherever they can
to identify officers of man that can be called up," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the plight in Yugoslavia, the spokesman said that
the civilian population is now subject to fuel rationing "as the
fuel supplies are being used exclusively for the military and
their operations in Kosovo".

<HEADLINE> Japanese Writer Wins Tokyo Governor Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Shintaro Ishihara, an outspoken
Japanese writer and former lawmaker, won the hotly contested
gubernatorial election in Tokyo, the Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Early returns showed that the 66-year-old former transport
minister had an unbeatable lead over 18 others in the Tokyo
gubernatorial race and is poised to succeed outgoing Tokyo
Governor Yukio Aoshima as chief executive of Japan's capital, the
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo election is part of the first round of quadrennial
local elections across Japan that also include 11 other
governorship races as well as seats of 44 of the country's 47
prefectural assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, a one-time lawmaker of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), stirred controversy with the publication
of his 1989 book "The Japan That Can Say No." In the book, co-
authored with then Sony Chairman Akio Morita, he suggested that
Japan take a nationalistic stance in relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, he called for the return or joint use of
land occupied by the U.S. military's Yokota Air Base in western
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Estimated voter turnout for the Tokyo race stood at 57.8
percent, up 7.13 percentage points from the previous election in
1995.
</P>
<P>
As for the 11 other gubernatorial races, 10 incumbent governors,
including Osaka Governor Knock Yokoyama, easily secured victories.
</P>
<P>
The governors-reelect, who were running as independents, were
assured of victories about one hour after the vote counting
started at 8:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Scientists Ready for Response to India Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading Pakistani scientist
said Sunday that India's test-firing of its Agni-II missile has
created a situation like the one on May 11 last year and that his
fellow scientists have been ready for any response to it.
</P>
<P>
"We will not disappoint the great Pakistani nation. We are
ready to do anything if the government wants so," said Samar
Mubrakmand, a senior member of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
(PAEC), who led the team which detonated nuclear devices on May 28
last year in response to India's tests on May 11.
</P>
<P>
But he added that political decisions will be taken by the
government and the scientists should not be involved in political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it successfully test-fired a
longer-range version of its Agni ballistic missile, ending a
five-year period of restraint on the controversial weapon.
</P>
<P>
The upgraded version of Agni, which had a planned range of
around 2,200 kilometers, was launched from a testing center off
the eastern Indian sea shore.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan promptly expressed its "deep concern" over the
test-firing to which Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said
Islamabad might give a "befitting response."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan demonstrated its Ghauri and Shaheen missiles on March
23, the Pakistan Day.
</P>
<P>
The Shaheen, named after a bird which was used by great
Pakistani poet Allama Iqbal as a symbol of bravery, can carry a
payload of 1,000 kilograms and hit a target at a distance of 750
kilometers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri, named after great Muslim warrior Shahbuddin Ghauri,
was test-fired last April. It has a range of 1,500 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of People March in London, Demanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of demonstrators on
Sunday demanded NATO stop its bombing campaign on Yugoslavia
during a two-hour-long rally in central London.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3,000 protesters marched from Victoria Embankment
to Trafalgar Square, most of them Britons with placards reading
"Stop the Bombs, NATO out of Balkans" and "Hands off Yugoslavia".
</P>
<P>
A British citizen told Xinhua that he is "ashamed to be Britain
for the first time in his life time" because Britain was now
taking part in NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia which is killing
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Several backbench Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) gave their
support to the protest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to thousands of pretesters in Trafalgar Square,
Parliament Member Tam Dalyell said the bombing of Serb targets had
only served to make President Slobodan Milosevic more popular with
his people and would worsen the situation in that region.
</P>
<P>
"Bombing serves no purpose. It is counterproductive," he said
as crowds shouted slogans around him.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, the main organizer of
the demonstration, hopes to draw in significant public support and
force the government to pay attention to its opinions.
</P>
<P>
It believes the alliance's case for military action is
"unpersuasive" and wants a solution found through mediation and
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Veteran left-wing politician Tony Benn denounced the NATO
action as "dangerous", "foolish" and "absolutely illegal".
</P>
<P>
He said any decision on action should have been made through
the United Nations, not NATO.
</P>
<P>
"What America and Britain are trying to do is take over Europe
in the name of NATO," he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S., British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were killed
and several others injured when U.S. and British warplanes bombed
civilian and military targets on Sunday, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 12:40 p.m. local time (0840 GMT),
nine formations of enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti
bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Qadisiya and Samawa
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The planes bombed al-Sinniya village in Qadisiya province,
killing two civilians and injuring several others including two
women, added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraqi air defenses fired surface-to-air
missiles at the planes.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that civilians were reportedly killed
since the United States and Britain resumed their regular air
attacks on Iraqi targets 10 days ago after the holy period of
pilgrimage, or hajj, during which they suspended their bombing.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British air strikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones and the Iraqi air defenses have almost become a daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
what the U.S. said "Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> India PM Says Missile Test-firing "Purely Defensive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said on Sunday that the test-firing of an Agni-II
missile was "purely defensive."
</P>
<P>
But left parties said the flight test on Sunday was linked with
the survival of Vajpayee's government and not based on India's
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation, Vajpayee said India had to
develop its own indigenous capabilities on the ground that India
could not depend on others to defend it.
</P>
<P>
He said the test-firing was a "purely defensive step" and not
meant for aggression against any country.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told the nation that his government had in advance
informed Pakistan along with major powers last Friday of the
decision to test-launch the missile.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and his government are facing a political crisis with
All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), a major ally of
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), threatening to withdraw
support to the coalition government. Two AIADMK ministers resigned
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the test-firing Sunday, Information and Broadcasting
Minister Pramod Mahajan denied that the missile test was aimed at
diverting attention from the political crisis engulfing the
BJP-led government.
</P>
<P>
However, a political member of the Communist Party of India
(M), Sitaram Yechury, said here that the flight test was linked
with the survival of the Vajpayee government and not based on
security concerns of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Now when the government is about to leave, it clearly appears
that the flight tests have little to do with security concerns and
more with the political concerns of the Vajpayee government," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Stops Russian Aid Convoy to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian customs authorities have
refused to allow the whole convoy of 73 lorries carrying
humanitarian aid from Russia and Belarus to Yugoslavia to cross
its border, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax reported that the convoy had eight oil-carrying
trucks. As fuels were banned by NATO from entering Yugoslavia, the
Hungary customs officers asked the convoy team either to leave the
trucks in Hungary and pay 50,000 U.S. dollars in storage fees or
drive back to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Hungary joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on March
12 together with Poland and the Czech Republic. Russia froze ties
with NATO over continuing air raids against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Hungary customs authorities also refused the 31 military-
style armored trucks to pass through Hungary. Interfax news agency
said they would allow the convoy into Hungary only if the cargo on
the armored trucks was shifted onto normal, non-military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hungarian news agency MTI reported a convoy of
five-ton trucks carrying a field hospital, medical equipment,
medicines, food, disinfectants, blankets and fuel, had crossed
into Hungary and was expected in Serbia on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Delegate Outlines Chinese Achievements in Human Rights Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has scored
tremendous achievements in promoting and protecting the civil and
political rights of its citizens, a Chinese delegate said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"For more than 20 years since our reform and opening up, the
Chinese government has committed itself to realizing the economic,
social and cultural rights of the people by improving their
livelihood," said Li Baodong, deputy representative of the Chinese
delegation to the 55th session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"The government has attached great importance to promoting and
protecting the civil and political rights of the citizens, and has
achieved remarkable success," he told a plenary meeting on civil
and political rights here.
</P>
<P>
Li outlined four of the most outstanding achievements of the
Chinese government in the promotion and protection of the civil
and political rights.
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up the process of the rule of law with emphasis
being placed on judicial independence and fairness.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded second session of the Ninth National
People's Congress adopted the amendments to the Chinese
Constitution as proposed by its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, provisions on governing the country
according to law and building a socialist country of the rule of
law have been written into the constitution. This represents a
major step forward by China in promoting and protecting human
rights and in accelerating the process of governing the country
according to law.
</P>
<P>
-- Protecting the freedom of speech of the citizens in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Among all the newspapers and magazines published in China today,
only one fifth belongs to governmental organs. The rest belongs to
various democratic parties, social organizations and academic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
-- Taking effective measures to protect the religious freedom
of the citizens.
</P>
<P>
Religious freedom, which is protected by the Constitution and
other laws, is a fundamental right of the Chinese citizens. In
China, all religions are treated equally. All citizens including
believers and non-believers enjoy equal rights. All religions in
China have their own publications of scriptures, books and
journals.
</P>
<P>
There have also been exchanges of visits between the religious
personnel in China and other countries, as an effort to strengthen
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Taking various measures to prohibit and oppose the use of
torture.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always stressed the importance of
human rights protection in the judicial system. In both
legislation and judicial practice, a special emphasis has been
laid on the opposition and prohibition of the use of torture.
</P>
<P>
Severe punishment against the use of torture is explicitly
provided for by such Chinese laws as the Criminal Law, the
Criminal Procedure Law, the Law on Prison, the Law on the People's
Police, the Law on Judges, the Law on Procurators and the National
Law on Compensations.
</P>
<P>
"However, the full realization of civil and political rights is
a long and step-by-step process," Li stated.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is willing to work with all governments
and relevant international organizations to search for the ways
and means of promoting and protecting civil and political rights
by strengthening dialogue and cooperation and sharing experience,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Accuses India of Violating Spirit of Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday accused India
of going against the spirit of understanding reached between the
two countries at the Lahore summit by test-firing the Agni-II
missile.
</P>
<P>
It called for an end to the arms race in the region while
urging effort to expedite the bilateral dialogue process in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told the state-run
Pakistan Television during an interview Monday morning that the
test-firing of the longer-range Agni-II missile barely a couple of
weeks before the scheduled expert-level talks between the two
countries was "against the spirit of the memorandum of
understanding (MoU) signed at Lahore."
</P>
<P>
In the MoU signed by the two countries' foreign secretaries on
February 21 in the presence of the their prime ministers, "we had
spoken about establishing a strategic restraint regime and the
related issue," he noted, adding that the test of Agni-II was
"totally against this understanding."
</P>
<P>
Aziz further said that considering the latest missile test by
India, "now it has become more important that the talks should be
held immediately and the understanding reached at Lahore should be
made functional."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India are set to follow up the MoU with a round of
expert-level talks by the end of this month or early May to chalk
out details of all the points contained in the MoU.
</P>
<P>
The expert-level talks will be followed by foreign
secretary-level talks in New Delhi to finalize the crucial issues.
</P>
<P>
The eight-point MoU mainly dealt with security concepts and
nuclear doctrines with a view to developing measures for
confidence building in the nuclear and conventional fields aimed
at avoidance of conflict.
</P>
<P>
India claimed on Sunday immediately after the Agni-II test that
it had officially informed Pakistan according to the understanding
reached at Lahore, but Pakistan refuted this claim, saying it was
told only after its high commissioner in New Delhi inquired about
the impending test from Indian authorities following intelligence
reports.
</P>
<P>
The two countries through the MoU had undertaken to provide
each other with advance notification in respect of ballistic
missile flight tests.
</P>
<P>
While urging the expediting of the bilateral dialogue process,
Aziz said that the resolution of all outstanding issues including
Kashmir should be found through dialogue and that "we don't need
an arms race" in this region.
</P>
<P>
He termed the testing of the Agni-II missile by India as
"unfortunate," stressing that this is a "new weapon" which would
further deepen the already existing conventional imbalance in the
region.

WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A 250 million million U.S.
dollars missile-warning satellite has been stranded in a useless
orbit since its launching last Friday, and the U.S. Air Force is
scrambling to rescue it, said the Washington Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Support Program satellite was launched aboard an
Air Force Titan rocket Friday. Officials from the Air Force said
that the rocket performed correctly but an upper-stage motor
apparently malfunctioned and left the satellite in a highly
lopsided rather than circular orbit.
</P>
<P>
The missile-warning satellite was intended for a
22,300-mile-high orbit, where it was to have joined other Defense
Support program spacecraft in detecting missile and rocket
launches as well as nuclear detonations.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5-ton satellite is equipped with 6,000 infrared
sensors, and is the 19th Defense Support Program satellite. In
the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the U.S. military used this satellites
to track Iraqi Scud missiles.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Wins SPD Support for NATO Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, April 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Monday at a special party congress won the support from his Social
Democratic Party (SPD) for Bonn's participation in the ongoing
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a show of hands, a majority of the 515 SPD delegates voted
for a resolution backing NATO strikes until Belgrade withdraws its
troops from Kosovo and allows the refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for maintaining the German cabinet's
rejection of deploying combat ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the congress, Schroeder said, "By halting NATO air
strikes now we would not come one millimeter closer to reaching
the goal."
</P>
<P>
Germany has 14 Tornado jet fighters taking part in NATO air
raids on Yugoslavia and about 3,000 ground troops stationed in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who has been acting as head of the party since the
resignation of Oscar Lafonaine in March both as party chairman and
Finance Minister, was due to be elected as chairman of the SPD by
the congress.
</P>
<P>
The SPD is Germany's biggest political party with about 775,000
members.
</P>
<P>
The party traditionalists, led by delegates from the Bremen
state and the SPD youth wing, have presented an alternative
resolution calling on Bonn to urge an immediate halt to the NATO
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The pacifists want non-combat forces of the United Nations,
including the Russian troops, to secure " humanitarian corridors"
in Kosovo for aiding ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Many Social Democrats want a ceasefire, the SPD youth wing
leader Andrea Nahles said, adding, "It must be possible to replace
the military logic with a logic of negotiation."

<HEADLINE> Labor Puts Education top of Scotland Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor Party on Monday
put education at the heart of its manifesto for the elections to
the Scottish Parliament to take place on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Launching the document in Glasgow, Scotland, Scottish Secretary
Donald Dewar said if Labor was elected, his first job as first
minister would be an "education for a nation" Act.
</P>
<P>
He said the manifesto would have five key elements: new
community schools to tackle poverty and social exclusion; state of
the art information technology for schools; a guarantee of a
nursery place for all three and four-year-olds; "proper rewards"
for teachers to restore their status; and the raising of standards
in schools.
</P>
<P>
"The manifesto title is Building Scotland's Future and that is
exactly what I am determined to do," Dewar said.
</P>
<P>
Dewar also promised that if Labor was elected, in four years
time children would go to better schools, more patients would
receive quicker treatment in better hospitals and more people
would live in better homes.
</P>
<P>
A poll in The Scotsman newspaper suggests that Labor's rating
in the first-past-the-post ballot stands at 46 percent compared to
30 percent for the Scottish National Party.
</P>
<P>
On health, the Labor party says it will create eight new
hospital developments through a mixture of public and private
finance, in addition to guaranteeing 15 million pounds (25 million
U.S. dollars) for council support services for carers.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also outlines a drugs enforcement agency for
Scotland, with more police officers to fight the trafficking and
abuse of drugs.

<HEADLINE> OAU Team Leaves for Eritrea on Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced Monday that an OAU team will leave here
Tuesday on a follow-up peace mission for Asmara, Eritrea, in one
more effort to end the 11-month old border conflict with
neighboring Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here, Justin Thundu, acting head of
the OAU press and information department, said OAU is "very keen"
for a peaceful solution of the conflict, as both parties have
indicated their readiness in favor of a peaceful settlement
through the OAU framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Thundu told reporters that a similar visit to Eritrea by an OAU
team took place last month to convey the OAU's concern over the
on-going fighting, despite the acceptance by both sides of the OAU
framework agreement for resolving it, and to press for the
implementation of the agreement by working out the necessary
modalities.
</P>
<P>
The OAU team has conveyed similar concern to Ethiopian
authorities before going to Asmara, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accepted the OAU framework agreement in November last
year while Eritrea accepted it in February this year. The border
conflict escalated into fierce fighting in June 1998 and renewed
in February and March this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thundu said OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim
is due to leave Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, later Monday for
Port Louis, Mauritius, to attend a two-day ministerial conference
on human rights in Africa which opens Thursday. Salim will
proceed from Port Louis to Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he will
attend the inter-islands peace conference on Comoros from April
19-23 in the capital of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
"This conference on the crisis in the Comoros is sponsored by
the OAU. We hoped the gathering of all concerned parties will
come out with acceptable solutions to all the problems of the
islands within the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,"
Thundu said.

<P>
MADRID, April 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO is planning to arrest
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Spanish Defense Minister
Eduardo Serra said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a consensus within the Atlantic Alliance that
Milosevic deserves to be treated as a war criminal," Serra said in
an interview with the private television channel Antena 3.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international court in the Hague is looking
for evidence to indict Milosevic and "NATO would be prepared to
try to capture him."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish minister indicated that the plan of arresting
Milosevic would be carried out by NATO's troops in Bosnia. The
fact that the plan has not been carried out yet does not mean that
NATO did not have the plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Serra declined to disclose any details about the plan.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Legislator Urges NATO to Stop Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator on
Monday urged NATO to immediately stop air strikes against
Yugoslavia, saying the on-going bombings of Yugoslav targets run
counter to the U.N. Charter and the norms governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice president of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, told the Inter-Parliamentary Union (
IPU)'s 101st conference in Brussels that the world is far from
tranquil as there are repeated occurrences of interference in
other countries' internal affairs under certain pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few days, NATO has escalated its bombings of
Yugoslavia, causing civilian casualties and huge property loss and
further complicating the situation in the region. This has met
with increasingly strong opposition and condemnation," Buhe told
some 1,000 participants of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly urge NATO to stop immediately its military
interference in Yugoslavia so that the Kosovo question can return
to the track of political solution," the Chinese NPC leader said.
</P>
<P>
The week-long IPU conference is being attended by some 1,000
delegates from 136 countries.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians will focus their discussions on
parliamentary actions to encourage all countries to sign and
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty prohibiting all nuclear
testing, to encourage universal and non-discriminatory nuclear non-
proliferation measures and to work towards the eventual
elimination of all nuclear weapons.

BONN, April 12 (Xinhua)-- Amid challenges of the pacifists in
his Social Democratic Party (SPD), German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Monday called on the SPD members to back Bonn's
decision to take part in the ongoing air campaign against
Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is set to test-fire a
longer range version of Ghauri-I ballistic missile in response to
India's Agni-II test, an official source here disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source said Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has given
go-ahead to Kahuta Research Laboratory, which will carry out the
test-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II is likely to be test-fired on April 14 morning
from Tilla, Jehlum in northern Punjab province, the same site of
Ghauri-I missile test-fire one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile, weighing around 13 tons and carrying
warheads of 500 to 600 kilograms, will cover the range from Tilla
to Nokundi, Balochistan province in the Makran coast.
</P>
<P>
It has a range of more than 2,000 kilometers, covering the

<HEADLINE> Japanese Soldier's Description Of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Azuma Shiro, one of the Japanese
soldiers who massacred 300,000 people in Nanjing in 1937, has lost
a series of lawsuits in Japanese courts over attempts to reveal
the mass killings in his wartime diary.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the 87-year old man has found strong support
in Nanjing itself, which was the nation's capital before 1949 and
now the capital of Jiangsu Province, where an exhibit of Azuma
Shiro's court trial has been on display since early February.
</P>
<P>
It includes over 80 photos and other items showing how he was
sued by people who participated in the massacre after he published
the diary. About 40,000 people have visited the exhibit and over
23,000 people have sent letters and expressed their support for
the old man.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the exhibit today, Azuma Shiro said that the
Japanese justices should visit the show and listen to the voices
of the people of Nanjing and of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The old man explained that he has lost all the lawsuits in
Japan for the past six years but has got support from the rest of
the world. He made an appeal to Japan's Supreme Court at the end
of last year and said he hopes the Chinese people will continue
their efforts to force Japanese authorities to act in accordance
with history.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his son, his daughter, and his lawyer, he also
attended a ceremony for the Chinese version of his diary, which
has been published by the Jiangsu Provincial Publishing House.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Attention to Issues in Human Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Certain issues should be attended
to while the international community strives for one of its goals,
the full realization of civil and political rights, a Chinese
delegate said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenum of the ongoing 55th session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights, Deputy Representative of the
Chinese delegation Li Baodong stressed that the realization of
civil and political rights requires attention to the following
points:
</P>
<P>
First, states should be mindful of the balance between rights
and obligations in realizing the civil and political rights of
their citizens.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the normal functioning of the society as a whole, he
said, an individual must abide by laws and undertake obligations
while exercising his rights.
</P>
<P>
Second, civil and political rights, as part of the super
structure of a state, should be realized on the basis of the
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In promoting and safeguarding the civil and political rights of
its citizens, the state needs to ensure that the efforts made in
this regard correspond to its economic foundation, rather than
stretching beyond the specific stage of historical development the
state is in.
</P>
<P>
Third, the promotion and protection of civil and political
rights involves a long and gradual process, and has no uniform or
fixed model to follow.
</P>
<P>
All governments in the world should proceed from their own
specific conditions in adopting practical and feasible measures to
safeguard the civil and political rights of their citizens through
strengthened international cooperation and by drawing upon the
positive experience of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Rebuking a United States delegate's accusations against China
at the same meeting, Li said that the totally unfounded
allegations again exposed the U.S.'s nature of hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. has signed the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, Li said, it has several reservations,
which also reveals that the U.S. is a hypocrite in claiming its
protection of human rights. Li called on the U.S. to remove the
reservations so that its citizens can enjoy full freedom and
democracy, and to mind its own business.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the human rights commission meets from
March 22 to April 30 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests International Protection for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- France opposes a breaking away of
Kosovo from Yugoslavia, but supports a form of international
protection there, said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the NATO foreign
ministers' meeting in Brussels, Vedrine said, "The question of the
partition (of Kosovo) did not come up to the table."
</P>
<P>
"The question is to know, in the Kosovo of tomorrow, how the
Kosovars, the Serbs and other minorities will live together, to
know who will exercise the political power," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that NATO is not seeking an
independent Kosovo with the breaking away of either the entire
province or a part of it from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Eryk Derycke said on Monday that the
NATO foreign ministers for the first time discussed the
establishment of "an international protectorate" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Derycke said that it could be a solution to the Yugoslav crisis
with the involvement of the United Nations and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Egypt Agree to Boost Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Egypt on Monday agreed to
enhance cooperation in boosting the stalled Middle East peace
process while advising Palestinians to delay their planned
unilateral declaration of independence in May.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to establish a "Japan-Egypt
partnership forum" of cabinet ministers to beef up their exchanges
on a full range of bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak announced the agreements in a joint statement issued
after their meeting and working luncheon at the Japanese prime
minister's official residence.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi vowed to urge Palestinians to "refrain from unilateral
action," though he reaffirmed Japan's support for Palestinians to
implement early their right to self-determination, including
establishing a state, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Obuchi and Mubarak expressed "deep concern"
over the stalled process and reaffirmed their desire for the
resumption of negotiations as early as possible" to set a final
and comprehensive peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, the two leaders announced their "commitments
for strengthening political dialogue" and issued a bilateral
partnership program intended to realize "peace and prosperity"
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for establishing a cabinet-level partnership
forum to facilitate cooperation on bilateral, regional and
international issues, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and Mubarak agreed to focus on five fields -- peace
cooperation, economy, trade and investment, environment, culture,
and education, youth and academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit following
his tours of China and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Quotas Hurt Cambodia's Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. export quotas on
Cambodian textiles have caused many layoffs and forced some
garment factories to close, the Cambodia Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The quotas were imposed by the U.S. government in January in
response to a sharp increase of textile products from Cambodia. A
garment quota pact signed by Cambodia and the United States put
ceilings on 12 kinds of garment products.
</P>
<P>
Many garment companies blamed the layoffs on the quotas because
many factories got only a small share of quotas so they could not
survive and those heavily relying on the U.S. market were also
suffering, government and company officials said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the U.S. quotas, the Cambodian government set up a
formula to allocate the quotas to more than 150 factories
operating in Cambodia. Each factory can receive at least 80
percent of its 1998 volume. Another share is being allocated
through auction and to factories with good labor condition.
</P>
<P>
Some managers said that in the presence of the quotas, the only
way to continue their business is to reduce their export to the
United States and lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
Workers in two factories affected have filed complaints with
the Labor Ministry's inspection department, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has benefited from special trade privileges from the
United States since 1996 and low tariffs provided under the
European Union's Generalized System of Preferences.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports from Cambodia in 1998 stood at 360 million U.S.
dollars and three-fourths of them went to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed, 40 injured in German Monorail Train Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A suspension train detached from its
monorail and plunged into a river Monday morning in the German
town of Wuppertal with 4 people killed and more than 40 injured.
</P>
<P>
Two cars of the train, packed with early morning commuters,
dropped 8 meters into the shallow river. The left side of the
train was hanging from the rail.
</P>
<P>
Three men were found dead in the river by rescue firefighters,
and a fourth later succumbed to injuries.
</P>
<P>
Rescue services were set up nearby to provide the seriously
injured with first aid before they were transported to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated a clamp left on the monorail after
weekend refurbishing work has caused the early morning accident.
</P>
<P>
The disaster happened just before a building site near a stop
of the historic monorail, which had never experienced an accident
since its opening in 1901.
</P>
<P>
Boasted as the world's safest form of transport, the Wuppertal
monorail system, a landmark of the town, is popular among
commuters by carrying passengers to their destinations above the
street traffic.

</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the value of Hong Kong's imports in February
decreased to 80.2 billion HK dollars (10.28 billion U.S. dollars),
the department said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Ruling Party to Win: Election Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling party,
African National Congress (ANC), could secure a two-thirds
majority if voter intentions remain consistent until the June
elections, a poll has shown.
</P>
<P>
The Markdata poll was conducted by analyst Professor Lawrence
Schlemmer, who monitored the intentions of 2,280 voters in January
during the second round of voter registration, The Star newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schlemmer's provisional estimate of the outcome of the June
poll showed that the party was close to 67 percent mark. His
estimate was based on the hypothesis that undecided voters and
voters who did not disclose their choice be distributed in
proportion to the popularity of the parties.
</P>
<P>
He said the level of voter registration and motivation would
make a meaningful difference only to the level of the ANC's
support.
</P>
<P>
However, the extent of voter apathy or demotivation was
particularly serious among Asians and English-speaking whites and
moderately serious among Afrikaans-speaking whites.
</P>
<P>
"This may be an early warning sign of the kind of political
withdrawal that has occurred among economically successful
non-African minorities elsewhere in Africa," Schlemmer said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have been doing their best to avert a
two-thirds majority for the ANC, which means the party could amend
the constitution without obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Begins Buick Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai General Motors Corp.
, a Sino-U.S. joint venture, began producing Buick cars today.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Hu Maoyuan says that this first production is
intended to counter the increase in imports. The company has
increased this year's output target from 15,000, as originally
planned, to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The quality and performance of Shanghai Buicks is better than
was expected, he said, and they have passed GM's quality
inspection. The retail price, including value-added tax, consumer
tax, and shipping costs, of 9 Buick models that come in 5 colors,
range from 318,000 yuan (38,300 U.S. dollars) to 369,000 yuan,
</P>
<P>
He says that 40 percent of the cars' parts are manufactured in
China. Shanghai General Motors has 9 outlets and 28 service
centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and elsewhere
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts say that the new cars are competitive in
price, technology, and quality.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai operation, which cost over 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars, is located in the Pudong New Area. The plant has a
designed annual production capacity of 100,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Other international auto giants with joint ventures in China

<HEADLINE> Farm, Services Growth to Offset Jobless Rate: Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that the 9-percent unemployment rate recorded in January
this year could be offset by the recovery of agriculture and the
robust growth of services.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the
reported rise in unemployment could be attributed to the huge
expansion of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
"The recovery of agriculture and the continuing robust growth
of services are expected to sustain the generation of jobs for the
rest of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a labor force survey, Barican said the economy provided
679,000 additional jobs in January, an improvement of 354,000 jobs
recorded for the same period last year, or up by 2.5 percent in
total employment.
</P>
<P>
But the rising number of jobs was still not enough to absorb
the 3.1-percent expansion in the labor force, he said.
</P>
<P>
To address the unemployment problem, he said, the government
will strengthen employment facilitation through improvement in the
labor market information system.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue its reforms in labor and
employment programs such as the Workers Retraining Program,
National Apprenticeship Program and Occupational Health and Safety
Programs, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates's new book, "Business at the Speed of Thought -
- Using A Digital Nervous System" went on sale in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
It is being published by Beijing University Publishing House,
which was also involved in translating and publishing Gates's
first book, "The Road Ahead", which was a bit easier reading. The
new book is mainly targeted at business executives.
</P>
<P>
In the book, Gates talks about a computer network called "a
digital nervous system" and its impact on business management.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that it is meant to promote Windows 2000
and Office 2000 that Microsoft expects to release in the near
future. "The Road Ahead", which appeared in 1995, was meant to
boost Windows 95, a product designed for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that the new book, especially its Chinese
version, is less readable. According to China Book Business Report,
because of the limited production time and limited language skills
of the translators, the book is "flat" and "unstimulating".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version appeared half a year after the copyright
was purchased by the publisher for 55,000 U.S. dollars, according
to Gao Siuqin of Beijing University Publishing House.

LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Major motorway across Britain are
jammed with trucks as lorry drivers lodged a nationwide protest
against price hikes in diesel and road tax.
</P>
<P>
The M1, M2, M4 and M25 motorways are all filled with vehicles
as protesters head for central London, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Lorry drivers, joined by taxi drivers and farmers, are also
moving towards Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Middlesbrough,
Manchester, Truro and Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
Lorries lined the carriageways of Park Lane in central London
as the morning rush hour reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
The protests were sparked by tax hikes in Finance Secretary
Gordon Brown's Budget. Diesel price went up by 6.14 pence (10
cents), or a gallon above the 3 pounds (5 U.S. dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
Phil Flanders, from the Road Haulage Association, said the
protest went on well. "Just about everybody we have passed has
given their support with a thumb up or a toot of the horn."
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of action, backed by the Road Haulage
Association, is expected to be more widespread and involve greater
numbers than previous protests.
</P>
<P>
One demonstration last month closed several major roads in
cities across Britain and another during the busy Easter weekend
break also caused disruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russia-Belarus aid convoy
bound for Yugoslavia but blocked at the Hungarian border for two
days was now free to proceed, announced Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orban on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Orban said a compromise had been reached under which five
trucks considered to be military vehicles would not enter Hungary
while Hungary would allow four trucks of diesel fuel to go to
Yugoslavia out of eight in the 73-truck convoy. He also said two
Hungarian observers would join the convoy.
</P>
<P>
Orban made the announcement after intensive talks on Monday
morning between Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter and
Russian Minister for Emergencies Sergei Shoigu in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
Russia had warned Hungary earlier on Monday that its decision
to block the convoy would deal a serious blow to bilateral
relations. Hungary said the convoy carried supplies of diesel that
could be of use to the Yugoslav troops.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Easter Eggs Found Differently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SREMSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nada, 12,
and Stefan, 3, did not know whether or not to collect the Easter
eggs this year because they were in an unusual place.
</P>
<P>
April 11 was the Easter holiday for the Serbs. On the day,
people usually visit relatives and friends while kids were busy
collecting Easter eggs of various colors from their own and other
people's courtyards to see who can collect most.
</P>
<P>
But on this year's Easter holiday, most residents in Sremska
Mitrovica, a town with a population of 30,000, gathered in the
downtown market square, sang and danced to protest against
barbaric NATO bombing of civilian facilities in the town.
</P>
<P>
Kids also went to the square with their parents. So went good-
hearted holiday-makers who colored cooked eggs and placed them in
supermarket-like shopping baskets decorated with tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
While the adults were chatting about the current situation, the
kids meandered their way through the human labyrinth to stop at
one basket after another, collecting eggs of different colors.
</P>
<P>
Munic Gordana, 24, was one of the holiday-makers at the square.
This nursery school teacher not only prepared eggs of red, blue,
green, purple, brown and yellow colors, but also prepared
miniature caricatures of NATO cruise missiles for bigger children
to take home with.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged Nada and Stefan to collect as many eggs as they
liked and talked with their mothers at the same time about how to
take good care of the kids during NATO bombing sessions, which had
taken place three times in this industrial town.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether she was scared, the teacher said yes but
added that she preferred to stay in the town just like the parents
of those kids who were sent to the day-care center where she works.
</P>
<P>
"This is the tiny bit that I can do to help the town and the
country through the nightmare, though the worst of it may still
yet to come," Gordana said.
</P>
<P>
With eggs in their hands, Nada and Stefan smiled back toward
Gordana and before soon disappeared in the labyrinth of people at
the square, which was filled with cheering Slav folk songs and
smoke from burning flags and coffins symbolizing NATO and some of
its member states.

<HEADLINE> Asia Economies to Get 5 Bln Dollars for Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have promised to
work together to initially mobilize 5 billion U.S. dollars in
bilateral and multilateral support of bank and corporate
restructuring in crisis-hit Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Under-Secretary Timothy Geithner announced this at a press
briefing at the end of a one-day meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-chaired by Geithner himself and Kiyoto Ido,
deputy director-general of the International Bureau under the
Japanese Finance Ministry, was attended by officials from APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) economies and the ADB, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, observers from the
European Union and private sector representatives.
</P>
<P>
Geithner said a key element of the strategy to accelerate the
pace of bank and corporate restructuring in the region is the
Asian Growth and Recovery Program (AGRP), which would be financed
in part by the World Bank, the ADB and bilateral support of
various forms.
</P>
<P>
The AGRP would utilize innovative, cost-effective financing
methods to mobilize substantial additional private capital to
assist governments in the region to finance bank recapitalization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Support from the AGRP would be provided to countries that need
assistance and are implementing integrated and comprehensive
framework for corporate and bank restructuring, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the meeting also discussed ways to increase
trade and working capital finance and to mobilize the return of
private sector capital.
</P>
<P>
The meeting presented some key assumptions and terms of the
AGRP as well as the financing methods under the AGRP.
</P>
<P>
Geithner said participants underlined that as the financial
situation of countries in Asia has stabilized somewhat in recent
months, the focus of the international community and the
governments in the region has shifted toward speeding the
restoration of growth.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to discuss ways to carry out the Asian
Growth and Recovery Initiative (AGRI) which was announced at the
APEC leaders' meeting held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in November
1998.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Troops to Take Part in SADC Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has dispatched a contingent
of 160 officers and soldiers to South Africa for a peacekeeping
military exercise organized by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a sending-off ceremony at Lusaka International
Airport Sunday, Colonel Barney Links, the military adviser of
South African High Commission to Zambia, said it was important for
the region to embark on peacekeeping exercises due to escalating
armed conflicts in some parts of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zambian local newspaper, the Post, Monday quoted Links as
saying "Such exercises are a golden opportunity for the southern
Africa countries as they enhance cooperation among the armies in
view of armed conflicts in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said the exercise was being funded by SADC with the help of
American, Belgian and Italian governments.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has helped us with aircraft which
would be used during the exercise," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Col. Charles Myezi, Zambia Army Assistant Adjutant
General (AAG), said the Zambian contingent had joined other SADC
countries' armies which had been mobilized for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
He said 11 SADC countries had since confirmed their
participation in the exercise during which the officers and
soldiers would be trained how to enforce ceasefire and separating
two armed warring groups.
</P>
<P>
"As Zambian Army, we have contributed one four-seater
helicopter and an eight-seater VIP aircraft toward the exercise,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Myezi said the exercise would be open to the press between
April 17 and 26 during which the journalists would be allowed to
interview army officers.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela was expected to award an
 excelling contingent on April 26 to mark the end of the exercise.

MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
open formal peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) in May in an effort to pursue lasting peace in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview on Monday, Orlando Mercado, secretary of
defense, said the technical panels of both sides have completed
preliminary discussions and will soon pick up where they left off
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"This May, the formal peace talks will resume," he said.
</P>
<P>
The technical panels of the government and the MILF have been
discussing the agenda of the formal peace talks since last month.
</P>
<P>
Also last month, MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat relayed to
President Joseph Estrada his organization's request for various
development projects in Mindanao.
</P>

Estrada immediately approved the request, saying this would
show his administration's sincerity in promoting peace and

<HEADLINE> Barak Promises Referendum on Peace Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli prime minister
candidate Ehud Barak said Monday that he has asked a team of
legal experts to work on a legislation which will present any
final-status agreements with the Palestinians for a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of the Labor Party, said that if elected in the
May elections, he will introduce such a legislation within two
months after forming the new government, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
He first floated the idea of a national referendum Sunday night
during an interview with Israel's Channel Two Television.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would also carry out a similar referendum on
any agreement with Syria which could include a withdrawal from
parts of the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
The local daily The Jerusalem Post quoted a source in Barak's
office as saying that the initiative of calling for a referendum
on the eventual final-status agreement has been in work for some
time.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Barak wants to use this idea to lower
Palestinian expectations in the negotiations and refute the
argument by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Barak would be
more willing to make concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Barak's idea, Netanyahu said the real referendum
is the election itself due to take place on May 17, adding that
the people will decide who could better prevent a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Central Party said that if its leader
Yitzhak Mordechai wins the election, he will create a broad
national government, "one that will be able to...make the needed
decisions (without resorting to a referendum)."
</P>
<P>
But Benny Begin, the right-wing candidate for the premiership,
dismissed the ideas of all these candidates as "illusions."
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the names, Begin said Monday that Barak,
Netanyahu and Mordechai "are all pretending they are holding the
key to the problems while they don't have one."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign reporters in Jerusalem, Begin said no
solution could be found concerning the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict since the key is in the hands of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, which he accused of being colluding with
terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Barak are running neck to neck in opinion polls
with Mordechai and Begin trailing after them.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate wins a majority on May 17, then a run-off
between the two leading players in the first round will be held on
June 1.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the candidacy of aspirer, former
legislator Yosef Ba-Gad, was disqualified Sunday night by the
Central Elections Committee since at least one third of the 61,000
signatures of supporters he collected for registration were
suspected of being forged.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Gad said he would petition against the decision to the High
Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> China Emphasizes Strong Economic Ties With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government encourages
its enterprises to enhance cooperation with African businesses,
Sun Guangxiang, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remark here during the opening ceremony of the
second China-Africa Seminar for Economic and Management Officials.
</P>
<P>
Sun suggested that Chinese businesses set up processing
projects in Africa, according to the resources and market demand
there.
</P>
<P>
Processing needs less investment and has a quick return, he
said, and it will benefit revenues and employment in African
nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that China-Africa trade volume reached 5.5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, and the number of newly signed labor contracts
has surpassed 1,000, involving 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's foreign-aid reform, Sun said China has
begun to offer low-interest loans and help in building small- and
medium-sized projects productive of greater economic return. So
far, these kinds of projects have been implemented in over twenty
African nations.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven economic officials from 14 African countries will
take part in the seminar, hosted by MOFTEC and the Foreign
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Sees Stronger Recovery Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that signs of economic recovery are growing
stronger, with the performance of the stock market and a drop in
the inflation rate as bright indicators.
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to point to that we are on our way to
recovery because the stock market is going up and the inflation
rate is going down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bureau of Internal Revenue also reported an
increase in its tax collection recently.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said that the
Philippines could expect to see significant gross national product
(GDP) growth of 3.5 to 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the growth to the "pump-priming" activities the
government has been undertaking in the previous months to create
"a very vital factor to the Philippine economy."
</P>
<P>
Due to the Asian financial crisis and bad weather, the
country's GNP grew by only 0.1 percent in 1998, while its gross
domestic product shrank by 0.5 percent.

MACAO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here on
Monday that application for the candidacy for the first chief

and just and the personal inclination of the applicants is well-

</P>
<P>
An applicant goes to the office, submits a signed letter to
express the wish to run for the chief executive and receives an
application form and a description of the method for selecting the
first chief executive, which was passed by the Preparatory
Committee in January this year.
</P>

"Both the letter and the completed application form will remain
unopened and be transferred to a conference of the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee," Li Shuilin said. "An
applicant gets no hint about how to write the letter and fill in
the form."

chairmen of the Preparatory Committee will screen the name list of
applicants to check their qualifications for the race.

20 or more members of the Selection Committee become final
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
more than two-thirds of a U.S. cent Monday, spurred by a recovery
in a leading commodity index and improved gold prices.
</P>
<P>
"Commodity prices did well on Friday night," Deutsche Bank
currency strategist Tim Moloney said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 63.53 U.S. cents, up from
Friday's close of 62.82 U.S. cents after spending the day between
63.6 and 63.13 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Moloney said last week's activity in the Australian dollar
confirmed support for the domestic unit around the 62 U.S. cent
area.
</P>
<P>
"The global growth picture seems to be improving, and that will
only be assisted by the round of European rate cuts last week," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Late last week the European Central Bank cut its main
refinancing rate to 2.5 percent from 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Friday in New York the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index
closed 2.26 points higher at 189.78.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 17 U.S. futures markets and although not
weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an indicator
for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney Monday, the Australian dollar was buying
0.5869 euro from 0.5849 euro at Friday's close and 76.55 Japanese
yen from 75.94 yen, while the euro was trading at 1.0834 U.S.
dollars from 1.0740 U.S. dollars.

imperative that they maintain close cooperation, especially in the
economic field, since Nigeria can learn much from China, he said.
China is the world's most populous country, and Nigeria is
Africa's most populous country, so they should have close
cooperation in world affairs and consult on many important issues
to retain consistency.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic development is the key issue
facing African countries, and China's economic cooperation with
African countries constitutes an important part of its overall
ties with Africa. He reaffirmed that the Nigerian government will
continue to adhere to the "One China" policy and support China's
unification.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed appreciation for this, and briefed the guests on
China's implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems"
in Hong Kong and Macao's upcoming return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Habibie: Indonesian Athletes' Performance Still Not Satisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The performance of Indonesian
athletes, both in national and international sports events, is not
yet satisfactory, President B.J. Habibie said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement during the induction of
officials of the National Sports Committee (KONI) for the 1999-
2003 period. He installed Wismoyo Arismunandar as KONI chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We have to admit that generally, Indonesian athletes'
performance is still not that good. (We could) not expect (to win
in) international sports events if we could not do much in Asian
events," he said.
</P>
<P>
This should be seen as a challenge to KONI, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state however noted that in such events as
badminton and weightlifting, Indonesia has some world-class
athletes.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that among the country's 200 million people
are many potential athletes.
</P>
<P>
They are not only in big cities but also in remote areas, he
said, adding "We should pay more attention to them".
</P>
<P>
Habibie stressed that talent and training are key factors in
molding a good athlete.
</P>
<P>
Without talent, he said, it is difficult to train an athlete
while without good training, it is difficult for a talented
athlete to perform well.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked sports organizations to cooperate with schools --
from elementary schools to colleges -- to find talented athletes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Parents should also pay more attention to their children's
talents in sports so they could improve them, the president added.

Spring Festival holiday period in February began to recede;
</P>
<P>
-- Fuel prices declined as the weather began to turn warmer;
</P>
<P>
-- Electricity prices in some rural areas fell, along with post
and telecommunications fees.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of foreign affairs of
the 19 NATO member countries held their first meeting on Kosovo
crisis here Monday since the alliance unleashed air strikes
against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are trying to reaffirm their determination to
continue the air strikes before the advent of the military bloc's
50th anniversary celebration in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters earlier that the
ministers will define their position for NATO's next step to
continue attacks against Yugoslavia and to deal with the refugee
problem as well as the political future in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
So far, NATO has still not achieved its goal after trying
military conquest in nearly three weeks. The allies had to adjust
their policy despite repeated commitments to keeping the U.S.-led
air strikes until yielding by the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told western
journalists earlier before arriving Brussels that NATO "have to be
realistic and flexible" as looking at the future. She hinted that
Yugoslavia may be able to retain some security forces in Kosovo
instead of withdrawing troops completely as NATO demanded before.
</P>
<P>
All 19 foreign ministers met NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana and NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark today for their
emergency talks about Kosovo crisis, which has threatened security
and stability of the Balkan region and even in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Unfolds Details of Anti-corruption Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo has said that pursuit of good governance, poverty
alleviation and genuine crusade against corruption would form the
priority issues he would address on assumption of power on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect stated that his intention was to tackle
those three areas of concerns first so that genuine economic
reforms can take place in the west African country, This Day
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who was represented by Donald Duke, governor-elect of
Cross River State, was speaking last Friday in Paris at a meeting
of donor countries sponsored by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He has indicated that he would set up an agency which would
have the powers to search, investigate and recover stolen money.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the president-elect disclosed that he had
concluded plans to invite international audit firms as well as the
World Bank to scrutinize the books of the Finance Ministry,
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Central Bank of
Nigeria where corruption had managed to ravage.
</P>
<P>
By the time the investigation is completed, he said, anybody
found to have soiled his fingers would be handed over to the
anti-corruption agency.
</P>
<P>
At the Paris meeting attended by 11 donor countries and 10
international agencies with top officials of the Nigerian
government, the World Bank has listed seven challenges before the
nation "makes a new beginning" with the assumption of power by
president-elect Obasanjo on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The challenges facing the most populous African country are
poverty, debt, corruption, governance, poor infrastructure, Niger
Delta and diversification of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the corruption problem, the bank said "Nigeria has
gained the reputation as a country whose ample resources are
wasted due to corruption and where corruption poses a formidable
barriers to utilizing government resources efficiently.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 billion U.S. dollars have been earned from oil
proceeds since the early 1970s, the bank said, but due to over
inflation of contract and diversion of funds, very little
development impact has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the World Bank Sunday in capital Abuja
described the two-day Paris meeting as "optimism couched in
realism, optimism about the future, tempered by the realization of
the difficult challenges ahead."

<HEADLINE> ILO: Over 1 Million Die at Work Annually Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 1 million work-related deaths
occur each year around the world as the result of workplace
accidents and exposure to hazardous substances, said the
International Labor Organization (ILO) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to be presented at a global conference on work
health and safety in Sao Paulo, Brazil, this week, the ILO says
more people die this way than in road accidents  (999,000), in
war (502,000) or from AIDS (312,000).
</P>
<P>
Some 600,000 lives would be saved every year if safety measures
were taken and appropriate information were available, according
to the United Nations agency.
</P>
<P>
An average of 250 million work accidents occur annually, or 685,
000 every day, and 475 every minute, according to ILO statistics.
Three thousand people are killed at work every day, or two in
every one minute, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 million occupational accidents among working
children each year and an estimated 12,000 of them are fatal, said
the ILO.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report shows that the fatality rate in industrialized
countries is lower than in developing countries owing to
structural changes in the nature of work and real improvements in
making the workplace healthier and safer, including improved first
aid and emergency care, which save lives in the event of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Construction sites in developing countries are 10 times more
dangerous than those in industrialized countries, the ILO document
says.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO is reinforcing its allied armada for air
intervention against Yugoslavia, it is opening two more frontlines
by organizing a humanitarian operation, "Allied Shelter," for
Kosovo Albanians, and holding a meeting of foreign ministers of
its 19 member countries on Monday in Brussels. "Allied Shelter,"
the first humanitarian operation ever organized by NATO since its
creation, is relying on 8,000 soldiers of the alliance deployed in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
-- Millions of Algerians in France and their compatriots at
home will vote on April 15 in the presidential election. The most
hopeful candidate of presidency to succeed President Liamine
Zeroual, former Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Boutefilika under
President Houari Boumediene, has repeatedly reminded his
countrymen that Algeria is in a "grave state."
</P>
<P>
Le Parisien:
</P>
<P>
-- Upset by the tragedy of Kosovo refugees, the French people
have responded massively to the call by humanitarian organizations
for help. Over the past week, the movement of solidarity by the
French people in contributing to humanitarian aid to the refugees
is almost unprecedented since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- Stimulated by the attitude of the member countries of OPEC
which respected their promise in March to reduce their production,
the prices of crude oil have risen again. On Friday last week, the
price of crude oil surpassed 15 U.S. dollars a barrel, a 50 U.S.
cent increase over the previous day.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Not Accept Conditional Sanctions Lift: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi government newspaper
Monday stressed that Iraq will not accept any conditions for
lifting the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra daily, organ of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said in an artical the lifting of the nine-year sanctions
on Iraq is not donation granted by the U.N. Security Council, but
Iraq's legitimate right.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the U.N. Resolution 687 obliges the council to
lift the sanctions as long as Iraq has implemented all its
commitments under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Nine years of embargo and eight years of inspections and
verification and military aggression that destroyed all Iraqi
facilities and plants are enough to be sure that Iraq was empty of
any prohibited weapons," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It also said that some countries tried to add new conditions
for lifting sanctions "under the pretext of making sure that Iraq
is void of weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq have been suspended since
December when the U.S. and Britain launched their four-night
airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has been sharply divided on its
policy toward Iraq after the U.S.-British raids.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. and Britain oppose any easing of sanctions,
Russian, China and France want them to be reduced or lifted
entirely as an alternative to resumption of long-term monitoring
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. panel, set up by the council after the U.S.-British
airstrikes, recommended recently that monitoring, inspection and
investigation of Iraq's weapons program should continue.
</P>
<P>
The panel stressed in a report to the Security Council that
international inspectors must be given unimpeded access to all
Iraqi sites, including those of military facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi newspaper affirmed Iraq's right to reject
any coercive and arbitrary conditions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize the U.N. panel set
up to assess Iraq's implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions,
arguing that the U.N. did not consult with Iraq on its
establishment.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Wants Peaceful Settlement of E. Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Rodolfo C. Severino
Jr. Monday said that ASEAN wants the problem of East Timor to be
settled in peaceful ways.
</P>
<P>
"It is for the Indonesians and the international community to
resolve (the problems). The ASEAN Secretariat has nothing to do
with it... but, what we want is a peaceful solution to the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the seventh ASEAN
editors' conference here, Severino said the problem of East Timor
should peacefully be resolved by Indonesia and Portugal under the
United Nations' umbrella.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is (how) to get personal security back to
the people (of East Timor) so that they can work out their own
lives, and it is up to the government of Indonesia and other
concerned parties and the people of East Timor to work it out," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian government's decision to send an
investigating team to the former Portuguese colony, in connection
with last week's Liquica incident which claimed at least five
lives, Severino said it is the problem of Australia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, comprising Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and
Vietnam, would never send any team to East Timor, he added.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
and became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas would present
the government's final autonomy proposal during his two-day
meeting with Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama in New York on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie has repeatedly stated that Indonesia will
allow East Timor to become an independent state if the people vote
to reject the autonomy proposal.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM Urges Intervention in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Prime Minister I.
K. Gujral has written to world leaders urging them to intervene to
halt hostilities in Kosovo and stop NATO military action against
Yugoslavia, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his separate letters to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
South African President Nelson Mandela and French President
Jacques Chirac, Gujral called for immediate cessation of
hostilities and steps to bring the warring sides to the
negotiating table and restore the sanctity of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO action was being carried out without U.N.
authorization, Gujral said in his letter to Annan. He expressed
anguish at the disdain with which some powerful countries are
treating the world body.
</P>
<P>
"If a meeting of the Security Council and convening of a
general assembly is not possible, you may kindly think of
assembling some eminent persons in the world to sit with you and
think ways and means of preserving world peace that is very much
threatened presently," he told Annan.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Chirac, Gujral said, "I turn to you both as a
statesman and a world leader to ask you for your intervention
which is urgently needed to save the peace of the world."
</P>
<P>
While referring to the "unipolarity" of the world order and the
"risks that it spells for the third world," Gujral said, "I even
get worried when I see that even the voices of Russia and China
are overlooked, thus fracturing the Security Council and future of
the U.N."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
Al-Faisal arrived here Monday morning to submit messages from
Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Al-Faisal said that his visit was aimed at
discussing bilateral relations, regional and international
developments, particularly the Kosovo crisis, with Iranian
officials.
</P>
<P>
"I will not leave Tehran unless the exact date of President
Khatami's visit to Saudi Arabia is determined," he said, according
to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal termed the relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia
as very good and called for further efforts by both sides to boost
the ties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kosovo crisis, the Saudi official said it as
an international dilemma and stressed that "it is the duty of
Islamic states to defend the world Muslims."
</P>
<P>
The recent meeting in Geneva of the contact group of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) was held for this
purpose, he said, "the Islamic states are determined to defend the
rights of the Muslims throughout the world by forming a deterrent
force."
</P>
<P>
Greeting Al-Faisal at airport, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said that the Kosovo crisis, ways to raise the oil
price, and other regional and international issues would be
discussed the Saudi official's stay in Tehran.

after last week's heavy rally, did not prove a weak market.
</P>
<P>

ABU DHABI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A referendum will be conducted
by the peoples of Jordan and Palestine to choose what form the
unity between them will take after the establishment of a full
sovereign state of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf
al-Rawabdah, who was accompanying King Abdullah Bin Hussein on a
three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Rawabdah said Jordan would play an important
role in the final-status talks between the Palestinians and
Israel, particularly talks involving such issues as refugees,
water distribution, borders and security.
</P>
<P>
Like other countries, Jordan has been trying to persuade
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to postpone the declaration of
an independent state until after May 17 Israeli elections,
fearing that an early announcement of statehood could lead to a
victory of Israel's hard-line politicians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will decide on April 24 whether to declare statehood
on May 4, when the five-year interim period under the Oslo peace
accords with Israel expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat once indicated that an independent Palestinian state
could form a union with Jordan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Pakistani business
delegation has expressed its disappointment with India test-firing
its ballistic missile Agni 11 Sunday, saying this might be a
spoilsport in Indo-Pak trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are upset that India test-fired Agni 11 just when trade
relations between the two nations have shown signs of improvement
after the Lahore Declaration signed between Pakistan and India in
February," President of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce Fazal-Ur-Rehaman Dittu, head of the delegation, said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Agni-11 test would have an impact on the trade relations,
which had been improving over the last few months, said
Rehmatullah Javed, secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
"India and Pakistan should be concerned with the economic
prosperity and should find ways to get over the clutch of
poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan reacted angrily to the test-firing of Angi-11 missile
by India on Sunday. Its Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz vowed to give
a "befitting reply." He said that his government would decide in a
couple of days on conducting its own missile test.

<HEADLINE> Over 1 Million Thais Lose Jobs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 1 million Thais have
lost their jobs as a result of the economic crisis, said a report
of the National Economic and Social Development Board received
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed rose to 1.31 million or about 4.0
percent of the country's 32.7 million workforce at the end of
1998, from around 495,000 or 1.5 percent at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of Thais who live in poverty was reported to
increase to 7.9 million or about 13 percent of the Thai population
at the end of 1998, compared with 6.8 million or 11.4 percent at
the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income had fallen by 19.2 percent on year-on-year
base when it was surveyed in February 1998 and the contraction
accelerated to 24.8 percent on year-on-year base when it was
gauged again in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
To ease growing unemployment, the Thai government has been
assisting 268,259 Thais in the past two years to find jobs
previously held by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Thai gross domestic product fell by 9.6 percent on year-on-year
base in the first nine months of 1998 after it lost about 1.3
percent in all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Due to the deepening recession, Thailand's economic policies in
the first two years of its current five-year economic development
plan (1997-2001) were mostly dictated by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) which prescribed reform measures.
</P>
<P>
The IMF came to Thailand's rescue with a
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout package when the crisis broke out
in July 1997. So far, Thailand, by accepting the IMF-set
conditions, has obtained 13.3 billion dollars from the package.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Keep Air Strikes "As Long As It Takes": Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO will keep up its air raids on
Yugoslavia to make Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bow to
NATO's demands, said a NATO official in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in an interview with BBC
television at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, shown here on
Monday, that the meeting itself of NATO foreign ministers to take
place in Brussels on Monday shows that the unity of the alliance
has strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"It will show that NATO is united. It will show that NATO has
the staying power to keep its air operations up for as long as it
takes to make (Yugoslav) President Milosevic comply with the
demands of the international community," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO foreign ministers would consider the "timing and
conditions" of the deployment of a NATO ground force in Kosovo to
help refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report said on Monday that at the talks no decision is
expected on mounting a ground offensive to "liberate" Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia entered its 20th day on Monday,
with Yugoslavia showing no sign of yielding to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly said that
Britain would not send ground troops to "fight their way into
Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Italy Seek Cooperation in Small Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ministry of Trade is
exploring ways of enhancing cooperation with Italy in developing
small industries as part of efforts to boost Egypt's national
industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili Sunday discussed
with a delegation of the Italian Federation for Small and Medium
Industries various means of promoting cooperation in this regard,
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili was quoted by the English-language newspaper as saying
that both sides stressed the importance of the small industries to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Small enterprises, with fewer than 50 employees each, account
for 99.7 percent and 80 percent of Egypt's non-agricultural
private sector in terms of number and value respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Italian federation, which has opened an office in Egypt,
agreed with the Egyptian Cooperative Production Union to cooperate
in many areas including financing, marketing, human resources
development and updating information systems, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economic reforms launched in 1991 to loosen control
over and privatize the state-owned enterprises have helped the
private sector leapfrog public sector.
</P>
<P>
By next year, up to 80 percent of the country's economy is
expected to have been in private hands.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Australian Develop Technique for Measurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A world-first technique that
will slash tens of millions of U.S. dollars off Australia's mining
costs has been developed by a team of experts led by a Chinese
Australian scientist, Australia's leading research body announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), the largest research body in the country, said the
technique for automated 3 dimensional measurement of blasting will
also improve mining safety and environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
"Using two high speed cameras and super-power computers, a team
led by Dr. Youzhi Wei of CSIRO Exploration &AMP; Mining has produced a
dramatic 3 D (dimensional) ultra slow motion video, turning a pile
of rock and shockwaves moving at 5000 meters a second into a work
of art," CSIRO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Wei lives and works in west Australia's coastal city of Perth,
3925 km from Canberra.
</P>
<P>
The world-first technology will enable miners and engineers to
sculpt the very shape of the explosion by planning the entire
blast in methodical details, then ensure the rubble drops in a
neat pile composed of the right-sized fragments, with the least
dust, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The technique could also be used to improve missiles and
anti-tank weapons, Wei told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Blasting is widely used worldwide for mining, which costs an
estimated 882 million U.S. dollars for Australian mining and
quarrying industries, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate it ought to be possible to reduce this by as much
as 140 million Australian dollars (88.2 million U.S. dollars)
across the whole industry using this technique," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"The costs of a poor blast can be very high. You get uneconomic
sizes of rock fragments dumped in heaps that are expensive to dig.
You may get too little ore yield for you blast outlay. You may
also get a lot of flying rocks and dust spread round the
environment."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that part of the secret lies in the detailed
study of the type of rock to be blasted, its hardness, its
conformation, how to get the most of the least explosive, how to
get the rock to fall in the right place, shape and fragment size.
</P>
<P>
"We begin by mapping the area to be blasted in 3 D (dimension),
taking account of the type of rock, its faults, fractures and weak
points and the overall shape of the terrain. This information is
critical to achieving optimal blast results."
</P>
<P>
"We then use two high speed cameras to produce a 3 D video to
measure the movement of the rock face and flying rock fragments
during the blasting."
</P>
<P>
"The third step is to use these measurements to calibrate our
mathematical models predicting the results of specific blast
designs, the shape of the rock pile, the size distribution and the
distance and direction of fly rock and dust."
</P>
<P>
"From this research, we will develop tools to enable mining
companies and blasting engineers to better measure their blast
performance, diagnose their blasting problems and reduce their
costs," Wei said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Loses $600M on Emeralds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is losing more than 600
million U.S. dollars every year in uncollected revenue from
Zambian emeralds being smuggled out of the country, Piala Mine
director Special Sakala has said.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said Sunday that about 70 percent of the emeralds
produced in Zambia are exported by unscrupulous businessmen
without passing through proper Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
procedures, the Post newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said the owners of Pilala Mining Cooperative in the
central Copperbelt Province recently lost half of the ownership of
the mine to a man who initially sponsored production at the mine
because they owe him some money.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative has since been closed making it even more
difficult for production to be properly accounted for.
</P>
<P>
He said tons and tons of emeralds are being exported every year
without the knowledge of appropriate authorities including the
Ministry of Mines.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Raise Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister of Energy Chris
Okemo has announced that fuel prices will be raised by the end of
this month in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said here Sunday that the move to hike fuel prices
follows a decision by the Middle East countries to increase prices
of crude oil after reducing their production quotas, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Okemo also warned local oil companies against exploiting the
people in the wake of the move to increase fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan oil companies buy their crude oil from the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (Adnoc), on which local oil companies base
their selling prices.
</P>
<P>
Based on escalating world prices for crude oil and the slight
depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the dollar, local oil
companies have indicated their intentions to increase their fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
Kenol and Kobil, leading oil companies in Kenya, said earlier
last week that they were going to raise their petrol prices by one
shilling (about 1. 6 U.S. cents) and 1.5 shillings a liter.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has
introduced new measures to reduce oil production for its members
in order to revamp oil-exploiting economies, hit by a recession
due to low oil prices in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President-Elect Calls for Increased Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua)-- President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo
of Nigeria, in a meeting with Chinese business representatives
today, said that Chinese entrepreneurs and investors are welcome
in his country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, elected president last February, added that Nigeria
can provide a sound environment for Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should work together to define
the orientation for bilateral economic and trade cooperation in
the years to come, and inject new impetus in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Sino-Nigerian relationship is based on equality,
mutual respect, and common interest, Obasanjo said the two sides
will make concerted efforts to expand bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is now China's third-largest trading partner in Africa.
Trade volume between China and Nigeria last year topped 385
million U.S. dollars, an increase of nearly 18 percent over the
previous year, according to statistics from Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
China mainly exports light industrial products, mechanical and
electronic products, and medicine to Nigeria. The two countries
signed an accord to encourage and protect mutual investment in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese business concerns believe that there are broad
prospects for bilateral cooperation in oil, natural gas, railways,
and power.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Obasanjo also discussed related issues with
Chinese entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu presided over
the meeting in which representatives from the metallurgical, power,
oil, natural gas, civil engineering, and machinery sectors
participated.

<HEADLINE> Most Polluters Around L. Dianchi to Meet Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the serious polluters
around L. Dianchi in southwest China's Yunnan Province will be
able to meet the tight restrictions imposed on them in order to
transform the lake in time for the opening of the World
Horticulture Exposition, which begins on May 1.
</P>
<P>
So far, among the 253 enterprises listed as major polluters in
the area, 184 have passed inspections conducted by environmental
protection agencies, 26 are awaiting inspection, and 40 others are
introducing pollution control systems, according to officials from
the State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
However, three enterprises are unable to meet standards and
have been forced to shut down or move out of the area, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring center in Kunming, the provincial capital,
receives and deals with reports from the public about the
pollution situation.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental officials say the center will strengthen
supervision and examination of the enterprises to avoid relapses.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and
covering an area of 307 square kilometers, plays a key role in
balancing the ecological environment in Kunming, but has been
seriously polluted by industrial and urban waste water.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed L. Dianchi as one of
the key targets for Pollution Control Project for the Three Rivers
and Three Lakes. The three rivers in the project are Liaohe,
Huaihe and Haihe rivers and the other two lakes are Taihu and
Chaohu lakes.

<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE), China's top engineering research institution,
established a commission of administrative science and engineering
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Daily quoted CAE President Song Jian as
saying that the commission aims to promote administrative science
and technology in the building of the major state projects and the
management of large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will undertake feasibility studies for
the country's major engineering science projects and major
construction projects, entrusted by the central government and
ministries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Song, former head of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said one of the biggest challenges now facing China's
economic growth and social development is backward administration
and unqualified administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many scientific research institutions waste
resources on subjects that are of no use for economic development,
and many enterprises lack effective administration and produce low-
quality major project.
</P>
<P>
He said the new commission, comprising 25 CAE academicians,
will also arrange academic exchanges between Chinese and foreign
researchers and promote Sino-foreign cooperation in the field of
administrative science.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins First Title In Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Andre Agassi of the
United States added his first Asian title to his 40 career titles
by slamming Germany's veteran Boris Becker in straight sets in the
final of the 350,000 U.S.dollars Salem Hong Kong Open tennis
tournament Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the only non-German player in the last four, outplayed
Becker 6-4 in the rain-delayed third set on Monday when the match
resumed.
</P>
<P>
The two had fought to 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, with Agassi breaking
Becker's first service game and leading 2-0 in the decider Sunday
night when the match was rained out.
</P>
<P>
"We both played pretty well... and Becker showed his experience
in playing big points," said world number 12th Agassi.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the Hong Kong Open final is played
on Monday, following a Michael Chang-Patrick Rafter clash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
After resuming the third set with a 2-0 lead on Monday's noon,
Agassi got a flying start, leading at 5-1 by breaking again in the
fifth game.
</P>
<P>
But Becker, resilient and experienced, kept pressure by his
superb serve and volley game.
</P>
<P>
After saving two match points, the semi-retired veteran broke
the American serve in the eighth game and won three games in a row
at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
But the 31-year-old German failed to keep his momentum and
yielded the match 6-4 following a wide return.
</P>
<P>
Becker served 21 aces in the final while Agassi got seven.
</P>
<P>
"He beat me today, I didn't lose the match. I created chances
for myself, but Agassi deserved to win," said the former world
number one Becker, who now ranked 75th in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I improved each month and is preparing for Wimbledon for the
last time," added Becker who collected three titles in the Grand
Slam competition.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will returned to the Hong Kong Open next year,
he joked: "Maybe as a journalist I will be here."
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who also entered the doubles final by teaming with
compatriot David Wheaton, withdrew in the doubles final because of
pain in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The doubles title went to James Greenhalgh and Grant Silcock.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cites 46,000 Traffic Violators A Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 46,000 non-motor-driven
vehicle drivers and pedestrians were cited in this capital city
during a city-wide campaign cracking down on traffic violations
from April 1 to April 7.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Municipal Bureau of Public Security and
Traffic Administration said today that in week-long campaign,
traffic policemen dealt with more than 40,000 cases of traffic
violations by non-motor-driven vehicle drivers and pedestrians,
and temporarily impounded 1,740 non-motor-driven vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The bureau chose 60 traffic crossings in Beijing's eight urban
districts to showcase proper traffic order for non-motor-driven
vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, traffic officers have focused their efforts on
cracking down on violations such as non-motor-driven vehicles
without licenses or running red lights, and pedestrians failing to
walk in the crosswalks, overpasses or underpasses.
</P>
<P>
The violators were given traffic education, fined or had their
vehicles taken away temporarily. Those who did not obey after
being corrected were handed over to local public security offices.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has about 10 million non-motor-driven vehicles,
mostly bicycles. Last year, public security and traffic
administrative organizations in the national capital dealt with 10.
9 million cases of traffic violations, revoked 39,000 drivers
licenses, and detained 319 traffic violators.

organized by the TDC and the Hong Kong Exporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our trade fairs are expanding while others in the
region are folding," Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"There are many reasons," Lam said. "But paramount, in my view,
are Hong Kong's sound fundamentals -- the free port, excellent
transportation links, minimal customs formalities, strong
supporting services, free flows of money and information and our
predictable business regime, all underpinned by the rule of law,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
High design standards, cost-efficient manufacturing and fast
delivery all help to make Hong Kong products competitive -- and a
major attraction for the 20,000-plus overseas buyers, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
For the convenience of buyers, the event is sectioned according
to product categories, which covers gifts, consumer electronics
and electrical appliances, houseware, kitchenware and tableware,
as well as carnival and Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
Lam announced that from the year 2001, the Hong Kong Gifts and
Houseware Fair and Hong Kong Premium Show will become two
consecutive and specialized events.
</P>
<P>
Part I will feature houseware and Part II will cover gifts and
premiums. The amount of space available at each fair will double
and the expected exhibitors will surpassed 5,500.

<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese technicians have
successfully developed a computer software program which can
monitor and control erotic information on the Internet, the
People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
As soon as it detects pornographic material, the program, run
on PCs, turns off the input, the newspaper said, attributing the
development, the first in China, to a specialist team working at
the prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Experts fear that a great deal of pornographic material is
spreading throughout the Internet and can cause moral harm to
minors.
</P>
<P>
Following inspections by ministries of Public Security and
State Security and the State Press and Publication Administration,
the software has been declared effective and easy to use.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: First Chief Executive of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Application of running for the
first chief executive of the future Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) began on Monday at the Macao Office of the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Historically, Portugal has been sending governors to Macao, a
territory under Portuguese colonial rule in the past centuries.
More than 95 percent of local residents are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao on December 20 this year, and the Macao SAR will be
established right after the handover. Macao residents will for the
first time have the right to choose the head of the region in a
democratic way.
</P>
<P>
According to the Macao Basic Law passed on March 31 of 1993 by
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, the
chief executive is the head of the Macao SAR and represents the
region, and shall be accountable to the central people's
government of China.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive shall be chosen by a 200-member
Selection Committee consisting only of permanent residents in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
A decision passed by the NPC on that same date stipulates that
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR takes charge of
preparations for establishing the SAR. The Preparatory Committee
was formed in May last year comprising 60 members from Macao and
40 from the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Preparatory Committee has convened seven plenary
sessions and worked out a number of key decisions on establishing
the SAR. At the latest session held on April 9 and 10, the 200
members of the Selection Committee were chosen by Preparatory
Committee members by means of secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
Between January 26 to February 14 this year, a total 2,291
Macao residents had applied to enter the Selection Committee,
among whom 2,288 were qualified applicants. It is a large number
in view of the fact that Macao only has a population of 430,000.
</P>
<P>
Coming from all walks of life in Macao, the 200 members of the
Selection Committee are widely representative. They shall
recommend the candidate for the first chief executive through
local consultations or through nomination and election after
consultations, and report the recommended candidate to the central
government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Basic Law stipulates that the chief executive shall
be a Chinese citizen of not less than 40 years of age who is a
permanent resident of the region and has ordinarily resided in
Macao for a continuous period of not less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive is also required to uphold the Macao Basic
Law and swear allegiance to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive is expected to be elected in the
middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (25) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 25 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
In what two categories are the residents of the MSAR classified?
What is the difference between them?
</P>
<P>
At present, Macao residents are issued the same resident
identification cards according to law with no specific difference
among them. However, according to Article 24 of the Basic Law, the
residents of the MSAR shall include permanent residents and non-
permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
There are four major differences between permanent residents
and non-permanent residents:
</P>
<P>
First, difference in terms of qualification for acquiring
resident status. The qualification for permanent residents is
strict and is well defined in the Basic Law. The qualification for
non-permanent residents is less strict which is not defined in the
Basic Law. It remains to be defined by other laws.
</P>
<P>
Second, difference between identity card and travel document.
The identity cards issued to a permanent resident is called
permanent resident identity card of the MSAR, and a Chinese
citizen among the permanent Macao residents may obtain the
passport of the MSAR of the People's Republic of China. The
identity card issued to a non-permanent resident is called Macao
resident identity card, and a Chinese citizen among non-permanent
residents can only obtain the other travel document.
</P>
<P>
Third, difference in right of abode. A permanent resident shall
have the right of abode, while a non-permanent resident shall not.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, difference in political status. For instance, a
permanent resident has the legal right to vote and to stand for
election and to serve as civil servant of the Government of the
MSAR and a member of the Legislative Council. A non-permanent
resident, however, cannot serve as a civil servant and member of
the Legislative Council except where special permission is given
under legal provision to serve as a civil servant.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not Cut Ties With IMF, WB: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has no
intention of cutting ties with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank (WB), and is, in fact, working closely
with the two institutions on various development programs, the
daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Refuting a report in Sunday Mail which quoted Nathan
Shamuyarira, secretary for Information and Publicity of the ruling
Zimbabwe Africa National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), as
saying the politburo had decided to cut links with the two
institutions, Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa and Shamuyarira
himself said under no circumstances had the government or the
politburo indicated that they would cut relations with the two.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to advise that the remarks in the article
attributed to Shamuyarira are not true. The Zimbabwean government
has not cut ties with the international institutions," Murerwa
said.
</P>
<P>
"The story painted a wrong impression of what I said. The
reporter asked me whether any money was coming from the IMF, to
which I said no, and then he asked me what the government was
going to do with IMF-sponsored projects, to which I said we would
have to mobilize our own resources and look for funding
alternatives," Shamuyarira said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
purchase more than 43,000 tons of grain this month to distribute
to several communal areas, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has, in the last two months, distributed more
than 130, 000 tons of maize to hunger-stricken families
countrywide under the grain loan scheme and drought relief
program.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people have applied for grain under the drought
relief program for this month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in capital Harare Sunday, Florence Chitauro,
Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, said the
number of applicants was expected to drop by the end of the month
since many people have started harvesting.
</P>
<P>
The maize would be distributed to families who have exhausted
their food reserves, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper also reported that the country may have to
import about 300,000 tons of maize this year to offset a deficit
in national consumption requirements.

Downer said it was outrageous that Yugoslavia continued to

their only crime was to help refugees of all ethnic backgrounds.

But Downer also attacked a newspaper report just hours before

<HEADLINE> Australia Regrets India's Ballistic Missile Test: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia deeply regretted
India's test of a long-range ballistic missile, Australian Foreign
Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new Agni II nuclear-capable missile was detonated Sunday,
raising fears of a new arms race with neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"India's development of a ballistic missile capability is
disturbing to the region and the world," the foreign minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Following its conduct of nuclear tests last year there are
fears India could arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead
capable of delivering a nuclear payload to countries in its region
and beyond."
</P>
<P>
"This development will have negative reverberations for the
strategic environment in South Asia and is likely to further
strain bilateral relations between India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Downer urged Pakistan to resist domestic pressure to conduct
its own missile test.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has an opportunity to earn international goodwill and
respect if it can show restraint and avoid a counter missile
test," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said India's action undermined its willingness to act
as a responsible member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Downer urged both India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 26 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What qualifications do Chinese and Portuguese people
respectively need to meet in order to become permanent residents
of the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Regarding the qualifications for local residents, every country
takes a less strict approach to its own citizens. This is
international practice which is based on the principle of state
sovereignty. In spelling out the qualifications for permanent
residents of the MSAR, the Basic Law differentiates between the
Portuguese and other foreigners in light of the actual conditions
of Macao. Still, there are differences in qualifications for
permanent residents that apply to the Chinese and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 24 of the Basic Law, there are two
differences in qualifications for permanent residents between the
Chinese and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
First, Chinese citizens who were born in or have ordinarily
resided in Macao for a continuous period of not less than seven
years before or after the establishment of the MSAR shall be the
permanent residents of the Region. The Portuguese who were born in
Macao or have ordinarily resided in Macao for a continuous period
of not less than seven years must take Macao as their place of
permanent residence before they are qualified to be permanent
residents of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Second, the children of Chinese nationality born by the above
mentioned Chinese citizens outside Macao may become permanent
residents of the MSAR if their father or mother had been a
permanent resident of Macao when they were born. But the children
of Portuguese nationality born by the above Portuguese outside
Macao cannot become permanent residents of the MSAR simply on the
grounds of their parent-children relationship.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Oil Prices Welcomed by Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is
welcoming more oil companies to come and bring down the high oil
prices in the land-locked east African country.
</P>
<P>
The government is reviewing its policy on fuel to facilitate
the operating of oil companies, the latest edition of East African
weekly quoted Kabagambe Kaliisa, the permanent secretary in the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since oil prices are almost twice those in neighboring Kenya
and Tanzania, Uganda has lost a lot of revenue through smuggling,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government lost over 99 million U.S. dollars in the
1997/1998 financial year because of rampant smuggling activities.
Smuggling fuel from Kenya is reported to account for the bulk of
the smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
The high prices of fuel is expected to fall once more oil
companies come in to share the Ugandan market.
</P>
<P>
At present, the oil market is predominantly controled by Shell,
Total, Agip and Caltex.
</P>
<P>
The high oil prices in Uganda is mostly attributed to the high
transportation cost. Having no ports of its own, Uganda imports
the majority of its goods through the Kenyan port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's annual consumption of oil products is estimated at
between 390 million to 400 million liters. A quarter of the
country's total revenue comes from taxes on petroleum.

<HEADLINE> About 120,000 Congolese Refugees to Enter Zambia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is threatened with a fresh
influx of about 120,000 Congolese refugees in addition to the
current 17,000 in the Northern Province, a senior government
official has warned.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Katele Kalumba said the current working
figure of about 17,000 was a gross under assessment and Zambia
should prepare itself for a larger influx from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), with the anticipated fresh fighting in
the town of Mpweto which is about 100 kilometers from the Zambian
border town of Kaputa.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted Kalumba as saying
the town of Mpweto is currently held by the allied forces helping
the embattled government of DRC President Laurent Kabila, and has
constantly been under threat from the rebel forces but for the
heavy rain and the resultant rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
The home minister explained here Sunday that the two opposing
forces have been kept away from each other because of the
difficult terrain as a result of the heavy rains in the area, and
once there was a dry spell a fight for the strategic town would
resume and the civilian population of about 120,000 would be
forced to flee into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) had estimated that 17,000 refugees had entered Zambia and
was providing aid based on those figures.
</P>
<P>
The reality of the situation is that the 17,000 refugees were
the officially registered refugees, but there was another
estimated 20,000 that had unofficially entered the country and
were still unaccounted for, he added.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Moves Industrial Polluters Out of Urban Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The decades-old Guangzhou
Copper Plant in the downtown area of this south China city has
recently transferred its land rights to a real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
The move was made under a comprehensive urban plan designed to
remove more than 100 industrial polluters out of the city's urban
area.
</P>
<P>
A commercial and residential zone will soon take the place of
this plant, and is expected to become another bustling area in the
city, taking advantage of its favorable location.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is an industrialized city with a tough urban
pollution problem. Since 1985 it has been concentrating on
updating pollution treatment technology for plants in the urban
area, but it took a more resolute decision in 1996 to shut down
155 big polluters and begin relocating others.
</P>
<P>
However, the city has been expanding so fast that the sites of
many relocated plants have again been included in the urban area,
where real estate developers have found it lucrative to invest in
residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Now, plants have to be moved further out of the city. After the
Guangzhou Watch Plant and the Candy Plant were moved out of the
crowded city, a foreign real estate company purchased the land
rights and designed it as for large apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
While real estate businessmen rejoice over their profits and
urban dwellers enjoy cleaner air, industrial producers have also
found a more room for development in the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The old copper plant has obtained a piece of land large enough
to separate its work area for electrolysized-copper production
from that of its standard copper sheets operations, which used to
be blended together, a move designed to increase production.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Return Belarus Helicopters This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will return the two MI-24
helicopters this week to the manufacturer in Belarus because they
are not in conditions as good as specified in the contract.
</P>
<P>
The gunships supplied by the British Virgin Island-registered
company, Consolidated Sales Corporation, were rejected for the
poor mechanical conditions of the planes, the New Vision daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters were not overhauled according to the contract
signed in February of 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Steven Kavuma, state minister for defense, was quoted as saying
that he was still investigating the controversy surrounding their
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
So far the mode of transport to be used in returning the
choppers cannot be ascertained.
</P>
<P>
The two helicopters, accompanied by Russian engineers, were
flown to Uganda in a cargo plane and assembled here in 1998. The
Ugandan army decided to return the choppers last month, saying
that it will send its team for checks.
</P>
<P>
Some top army officers are said to be involved in the purchase
of the helicopters. Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's
brother and former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, had confessed to the president that he had accepted
commission when buying the helicopters for the army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the price for the helicopters were
inflated well above their real value, enabling the top officers to
get huge sums of kick- back.

<HEADLINE> GCC Needs Sizable Investments in Manufacture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
member countries will need around 200 billion U.S. dollars by the
year 2010 to diversify their manufacturing base, a pan-Gulf
industrial consultancy agency has said.
</P>
<P>
"Future requirement of investment in the region are likely to
be sizable and could exceed 200 billion dollars by the year 2010,"
said Gulf Organization of Industrial Consulting in its latest
monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The Doha-based organization, funded by GCC members Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), said expenditure on oil and gas alone could well be 100
billion dollars by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Expenditure estimates on major projects in the next three to
five years are about 34 billion dollars for oil and gas, 18
billion dollars for petrochemicals and 25 billion dollars for
power, aluminium, steel and other projects," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the industrial planning of Gulf states would see an
extensive growth over the next few years as governments press
ahead with their diversification drive.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, the six GCC states had invested 77.85 billion dollars
in their manufacturing sector. This is expected to leap several
folds by 2010.
</P>
<P>
GCC states control 45 percent of the world oil reserves and
have started a massive industrialization program to diversify
their economies so as to decrease their dependence on crude oil.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest bookstore
estimates that its book sales via the Internet will be thriving in
the near future, the People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Book Mansion, a new, large-scale book store, initiated
its own electronic sales network in March. Within the first ten
days, its website, www.jbbb.com.cn, was visited by 40,238
customers and received 704 orders worth 54,584 yuan (6,576 U.S.
dollars), an encouraging sign compared with other businesses in
this field, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, store staff say their turnovers at the store on
recent weekends have doubled to 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
After the first on-line bookstore opened in 1997 in Hangzhou in
east China's Zhejiang Province, many other bookstores followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most of them were not as successful as Amazon, a
U.S. on-line bookstore giant. A great number bookstores only use
their websites as a window to introduce latest publications, but
do not have the necessary mechanism to handle on-line sales.

<HEADLINE> China Imports Surge in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's imports surged 11.6
percent in the first three months of 1999, the highest growth rate
since the second quarter of 1996, according to figures released
today by the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Total import value reached 32.99 billion U.S. dollars between
January and March, and the overall trade volume for the period was
70.26 billion U.S. dollars, up 0.3 percent, while export value
dropped 7.9 percent to 37.27 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although imports of primary goods declined 5.5 percent, imports
of finished industrial goods including electrical appliances and
electronic products, machinery and equipment, vehicles,
instruments, rolled steel, and paper products increased by 15.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the increase to the expansion of domestic
demand and the anti-smuggling efforts of the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports has been slowing down monthly. Export
value dropped 10.8 percent year-on-year in January, 10.2 percent
in February and only 3.6 percent in March, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
While China's exports to the United States grew by 8.4 percent
during this period, exports to some other major trading partners
such as the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand, rose for
three consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Japan and Singapore also grew in the period, but,

CHICAGO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said Sunday Sino-U.S. friendship conforms not only to the
interests of the peoples of China and the United States but also
to those of other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and the United States and the
Sino-U.S. ties have moved forward on the whole despite ups and
downs," Zhu said when speaking at a dinner held in his honor by
Governor of Illinois State George Ryan and Mayor of Chicago
Richard Daley.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, both the U.S. Democratic and Republic
Parties have been dedicating to the improvement and enhancement of
Sino-U.S. relations, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Especially, he said, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton have made successful exchange of visits and
the two leaders announced that China and the United States had
decided to establish a constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
"All these reflect that to develop the Sino-U.S. ties is the
bipartisan policy in the United States," the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the purpose of his current U.S. visit is to promote
the understanding of the peoples of China and the United States
and to push forward the development of the friendly relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, both Ryan and Daley said that they welcomed
the Chinese premier and thanked him for his visit to Illinois
State and Chicago City. They expressed their hope that relations
between the state and China will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here on Sunday morning from Denver to continue his
eight-day official visit to the United States, the first by a
Chinese premier in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, capital of Illinois State, is the third largest city
in the United States with a population of three million.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zhu met with Chairman of the American Farm Bureau
Federation Dean Kleckner and toured Marellbar Farm on the
outskirts of Chicago. The farm, an 865-acre spread with row crops,
cattle and horses, is one of the well-known in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Seeks Myanmar Help to End Border Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
Sunday called on the Myanmar government to help put to rest a
spree of violent incidents along Thailand's drug-infested northern
border with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The overlapping area between northern Thailand's Chiang Mai
province and Myanmar's Shan State is vulnerable to a number of
illegal activities and both countries have to jointly tackle the
problem, Chuan was quoted Monday by The Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement came only a day after one Thai police officer and
two ethnic Lahu men were shot dead during a 30-minute gunfight
between drug smugglers and authorities in Vieng Pa Pao district of
Chiang Rai province.
</P>
<P>
According to police officers, the two Lahu men had come to
demand payment from people who had purchased drugs from them.
</P>
<P>
Only hours before the incident in Vieng Pa Pao, Thai soldiers
had a brief gunfight with three armed men who crossed from Myanmar
into Thailand near Fang district of Chiang Mai province. One of
the armed intruders was shot dead in the gun battle.
</P>
<P>
Fang district was the scene of the gruesome murders of nine
Thai villagers only 10 day ago. The victims were reportedly beaten
to death, allegedly by troops of The United Wa State Army which
operates out of Myanmar's Shan State along Thai-Myanmar borders.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that the Thai army and police were jointly
investigating the slaying of nine Thai villagers.
</P>
<P>
Other narcotics trafficking groups operating in Shan State
include Lahu, Hmong, and former soldiers of Khun Sa's Mong Thai
Army.

<HEADLINE> UN Forecasts 5.7 Percent Growth for Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN) forecast
in a latest report that Sri Lanka will get a growth rate of 5.7
percent for 1999 despite a global slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In its report titled "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and
the Pacific," the UN estimated that Sri Lanka's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by 5.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was quite creditable especially in the light of the global
economic downturn, the official Daily News said Monday, quoting
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the South Asian region is the only
bright exception which managed to withstand the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's performance has been exceptional given the fact
that the country had to contend with the adverse consequences of
the financial turmoil in East Asia and Russia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the growth rate in the agricultural sector
in 1998 increased by 3.5 percent in Sri Lanka. In the industrial
sector garments had not been unduly affected by the large
depreciation of Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
On the macro-economic front the country has been successful in
containing the inflation rate to about 10 percent for the second
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
This has been attributed to the decline in the world market
prices of major imports such as wheat, sugar and petroleum which
had eased the pressure on domestic prices, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Autonomy Plan Akin to Hong Kong System, Says Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, President B.J. Habibie's advisor on foreign
affairs, said that the latest draft provided East Timor with its
own political parties and legislative council, while its
administration would be led by a governor in the capacity of a
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"Its system will be similar to Hong Kong's style," Dewi said in
an interview with the English newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dewi said East Timor's administration would be called the
Administrative Council of the Special Autonomous Region. The
central government would be in charge of foreign affairs, defense
and security, the judiciary and currency systems.
</P>
<P>
The province will have its own police force and the freedom to
manage its own natural resources, Dewi said.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will subsidize its budget until it is
able to
finance its own budget," she said.
</P>
<P>
People will be permitted to establish their own political
parties. A separate general election will be held in the area to
elect members of the legislative council.
</P>
<P>
"The special autonomy for East Timor is in line with
international understanding on autonomy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dewi said Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas would present
the government's final autonomy proposal during his two-day
meeting with Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama in New York. The
meeting, under the auspices of United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, is scheduled for April 21.
</P>
<P>
If Portugal agrees to the Indonesian proposal, the U.N. will
lead a two-month familiarization of its content with the East
Timorese. It will be followed by a direct ballot on the proposal
in July.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also hopes the U.N. will lead the direct ballot. The
government has insisted it would agree to the presence of
international observers, but not military observers, to supervise
the balloting process.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of 15,
000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 and
became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie has repeatedly stated that Indonesia will
allow East Timor to become an independent state if the people vote
to reject the autonomy proposal.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't to Revise Raw Material Taxes to Help Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai finance and commerce
ministries plan to revise taxation on raw materials in a bid to
reduce the production costs of export-oriented industries,
according to Suriya Jungrungreankit, deputy industry minister.
</P>
<P>
The review will also deal with the issue of double taxation of
finished goods which are imported for reexporting purposes, as
well as tariffs designed to protect domestic industries, Suriya
was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The review comes as Thailand is not expected to achieve its 4
percent export growth target this year, because of higher costs
and fierce international competition.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is obliged by WTO rules to reduce its tax on 854
industrial products by an average 28 percent this year and trim
tariffs on 157 information technology products next year.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Wins Brazilian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- World Champion Mika
Hakkinen retained his Brazilian Grand Prix title at Sao Paulo
Sunday to give the McLaren team its first points of the season.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen took one hour, 36 minutes and 3.785 seconds to
complete the 72-lap race on the 4.325-kilometer Jose Carlos Pace
track with German Michael Schumacher finishing 4.925 seconds back
for Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Another German Heinz-Harald Frentzen came in third in a Jordan
with compatriot Ralf Schumacher placing fourth, while Briton Eddie
Irvine in the Ferrari kept his world championship lead with fifth
position.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen had led from pole position after his British teammate
David Coulthard stalled on the front row of the grid but an sudden
mechanical disorder dropped him to third place behind Brazilian
local favourite Rubens Barrichello for the Stewart team and
Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
The Finn, who failed to finish the season-opening race in
Australia last month for mechanical problems, soon recovered from
the incident to challenge Schumacher as the pair move to the front
of the field when Barrichello pitted at the end of lap 26.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher came in for his stop on lap 38 and a series of fast
laps from Hakkinen, allied to swift work from his McLaren team,
ensured that he returned to the track in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen slowly extended his advantage at the front to cross
the finish line for the 10th win of his career.

<HEADLINE> Japan Dispose of England at World Youth Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan became the only Asian team to
qualify for the second round of the World Youth Soccer
Championships as they sent England home with a 2-0 victory on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan tied with the United States on the win-and-loss record
but went ahead as N0. one of the Group E on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon was placed third after they were routed by the United
States 1-3 on Sunday but they still managed to go through thanks
to the generous rule which eliminated only eight of the 24 teams
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
As the rule goes, the top two in each group plus the four sides
with the best records in third qualified.
</P>
<P>
England was sent home without a point and the only team without
a goal to their credit, joining Germany whose chance in Group A to
go through was killed when they lost to Costa Rica 1-2 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the group, Paraguay and Nigeria went ahead as the top two
teams and Costa Rica earned a berth of round two on goal
difference over Zambia although both teams placed third.
</P>
<P>
Zambia became the only African team to go out as they were
overwhelmed 5-1 by Brazil on Sunday who fought back from a goal
down to qualify in the second place in Group F
</P>
<P>
Spain won the group after scoring three times in the first half
through Pablo Gonzalez, Fernando Varela and Ruben Suarez to beat
Honduras 3-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mali finished top in Group D although they were hammered 2-4 on
Sunday by South Korea who were finally placed at the bottom,
joining another Asian team Saudi Arabia in their exit of the
event.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia went out of the contention as it placed last in
Group C which saw Mexico and Ireland going into the next round.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday in Group D, Portugal and Uruguay spent most of their
second half watching each other pass the ball around as they drew
0-0, a result which put both sides into the next round.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's results threw up some intriguing second round clashes
including Mexico vs Argentina, Paraguay vs Uruguay and an all-
African affair between Cameroon and Mali. Zambia were the only
African team to go out while all but one of the seven Latin
American sides qualified.

<HEADLINE> China Advocates Cooperation for Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China will further expand its
collaboration with foreign countries in the next decade to boost
the development of domestic dairy production, a Ministry of
Agriculture official said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to import more world advanced techniques and
equipment and also welcomes foreign investors to set up ventures
in China, Xu Dingyi, director of the ministry's National Animal
Husbandry and Veterinary Service, was quoted by China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, China has established a good relationship with
the World Food Program and the European Union since the early 1980
s. The two organizations have provided budgetary support of 200
million US dollars to help renovate dairy production techniques
and management in China from fodder research to dairy processing.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral Technical exchanges and cooperation have also been
carried out with a dozen foreign countries such as the United
States, Denmark and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
China has big potential market for dairy products, said Xu, who
has been involved in developing the domestic dairy industry for
two decades.
</P>
<P>
With an annual production of around 8 million tons of milk, the
per capita consumption of dairy products in China is only 6.6
kilograms. The world average level stands at 99 kilograms per
person a year, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
Following improvement of people's living conditions and large-
scale publicity on the importance of milk for human health, more
people are expected to take dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the Ministry of Agriculture will take into account
international standards to further upgrade the quality of
domestically manufactured dairy products.
</P>
<P>
About 20 diary production bases will be constructed by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
In order to introduce the best techniques, the ministry has
scheduled the International Conference and Exhibition on Dairy
Products in Beijing in June next year.
</P>
<P>
To arouse the public's awareness, the ministry will carry out
publicity activities on World Milk Day on May 18 to disseminate
knowledge about milk and other dairy products, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hofung Invests in China's Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Hofung, one of the leading Dutch
trading companies in China, is joining hands with the Energy
Research Institute under the State Development Planning Commission
on four gas-fired co-generation projects, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The four projects aim at making full use of steam and heated
water, by-products of gas-based electricity generation which are
wasted in traditional power plants.
</P>
<P>
The four projects, two in Tianjin Municipality, one in
Chongqing Municipality and one in Qiqihar in Heilongjiang Province,
are valued at 400-500 million US dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
They are part of the framework agreement reached by China and
the Netherlands last February.
</P>
<P>
"Hofung is expanding quickly in China because it has set
'China's sustainable growth' on its own business agenda," Xander
Tiedemann, one of Hofung's three directors, was quoted by the
paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Its turnover last year increased more than 30 percent to 70
million US dollars despite the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hofung has been helping China to raise energy efficiency,
develop clean and renewable energy, and treat industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
It is the exclusive marketing and sales partner of Vestas, a
leading wind turbine manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Hofung, together with Stork Engineers and Contractors from the
Netherlands, has five projects in China which aim at removing
sulfur from the waste gases of refineries.
</P>
<P>
China is importing an increasing amount of crude oil from the
Middle East which has a high sulfur content.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of environmental protection technologies and
related equipment requires a substantial investment, which China
can not manage alone.
</P>
<P>
"Many American and European companies have the technical know-
how, but lack the knowledge about how to sell in China," said
Tiedemann.
</P>
<P>
Hofung is serving as bridge between China and the outside world
by introducing and providing financial support for environmentally
friendly projects and technologies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Using Acupuncture To Deal With Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Obese people from China and
abroad have come to the Chinese city of Tianjin for acupuncture
therapy to help them lose weight.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese man who is studying Chinese at Nankai University has
been able to lose 7.5 kilograms since he started the treatment a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 10 hospitals that offer the treatment,
of which the Aimin Weight-Loss Center is perhaps the best known.
Eleven-year-old Deng Xuejian, who is grossly overweight, has been
able to go down 59 kilograms from 174 kilograms over the past 6
months with help from the acupuncture therapy combined with
dietary and sleep controls and physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 people are expected to come to the center every day
but the figure was only about 100 last year. People come from
Japan, the Netherlands, the United States, the Republic of Korea
as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture has a long history in China and can be used to
adjust the nervous and other systems. Many patients have been able
to lose weight in a short period of time while avoiding such side
effects as diarrhea and weakness.
</P>
<P>
More foreign medical organizations and individuals are showing
an interest in the therapy.

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Renovation of Dikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up
reconstruction of key water control projects damaged by last
summer's catastrophic floods, especially levees and secondary
dikes along major rivers, according to the Ministry of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Restoring flood-damaged facilities has been listed high on the
agenda of local governments, while the central government is
adopting a series of quality-control regulations to prevent shoddy
construction, sources from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of levees along the Yangtze River in Jiujiang,
capital of south China's Jiangxi Province, is scheduled to be
completed by the end of this month, the ministry was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the city's levees on August 7 last year, the
worst of its kind during the flood season, has resulted in
flooding in parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 60 percent of earth work and a portion of the
concrete structures for the project have been completed as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In Paizhouwan, a small town along the Yangtze in central
China's Hubei Province which suffered from the worst damages and
losses during the breach of the Paizhouwan Embankment, projects
are also under way to fill a 148,800-square-meter flood-washed
cavity and rebuild the breached dike.
</P>
<P>
Technicians in charge of the projects were quoted by China
Daily as saying that the 30-meter-deep crater will be filled with
800,000 cubic meters of sand and stone.
</P>
<P>
The 44-million-yuan (5.3 million U.S. dollars) projects are
expected to be completed by the end of this month, before the new
flood season begins.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Philippines Plunge in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Investments in projects approved
by the Board of Investments (BOI) of the Philippines fell 71
percent to 717.25 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of
1999 from 2.46 billion U.S. dollars a year ago, the Manila Times
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
BOI data showed that the equity portion of these investments
plummeted 54 percent to 283.50 million U.S. dollars from 615.25
million U.S. dollars a year earlier as foreign investments
continue to drop, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The BOI said the new investments created only 9,337 new jobs,
21.7 percent lower than the year-ago level of 11,934.
</P>
<P>
Foreign equity investments went down 59.7 percent to 165
million U.S. dollars from 414 million U.S. dollars a year ago,
indicating traders from other countries remain pessimistic about
the economy's prospects, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The BOI released the new investment tally a week after it
announced a 25 percent cut in its investment target this year.
</P>
<P>
Instead of 10 billion U.S. dollars, the BOI said it expects to
approve only 7.5 billion U.S. dollars in fresh investments this
year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United
States Sunday defeated unseeded Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in the
final to win first title of the year at the Bausch &AMP; Lomb Tennis
Championships in Amelia Island, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Seles claimed her 44th career singles title
and first since last September with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Dragomir.
</P>
<P>
Seles collected 80,000 U.S. dollars for her first title on clay
since capturing the 1992 French Open, one of her nine Grand Slam
titles.
</P>
<P>
Unlike her previous four opponents of the tournament, none of
whom won more than four games from Seles, Dragomir had several
chances to make it a close match.
</P>
<P>
The victory will move Seles ahead of Jana Novotna to third in
the world rankings and give her a confidence boost for the rest of
the clay season and the French Open next month.

<HEADLINE> Toshack Turned down Offer to Coach Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Spanish soccer club Real Madrid
coach John Toshack has revealed he had turned down the chance to
coach at Liverpool at the start of the season, local reports said
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Toshack, who had a highly successful eight-year playing career
at Liverpool in the 1970s, told Spanish sports daily AS he
rejected an offer to return to Anfield to work alongside then-
manager Roy Evans.
</P>
<P>
"Last summer I received an offer to work at Liverpool alongside
Evans," said the Welshman. "I had a meeting in London with the
club directors but I wasn't convinced by the idea of sharing the
job with someone else."
</P>
<P>
That joint role was later accepted by French coach Gerard
Houllier, who now holds the job on his own following the departure
of Evans in November.

<HEADLINE> Fowler may Drop Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool's Robbie Fowler may not
appeal against the six match ban and 32,000 pounds fine imposed on
him by the FA, according to local reports here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fowler was banned for two games for his bust-up with England
teammate Graeme Le Saux and for four after pretending to snort
cocaine as he celebrated a goal against Everton.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the punishment on Friday in Birmingham, his
legal representative Kevin Dooley issued a statement declaring it
"an unjustified and disproportionate sentence."
</P>
<P>
But it now appears that Fowler will serve out the ban in the
knowledge that his absence from a Liverpool team with virtually no
chance of qualifying for Europe may be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
"Robbie came back from a career-threatening cruciate ligament
knee injury so early that the rest might, in the long run, do him
good," said Dooley.
</P>
<P>
There remains a feeling with Fowler and the club that while
they are willing to accept the punishment, they are not satisfied
that he has been hit with a bigger ban than Le Saux, who only
received a one-match ban for elbowing the England international.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying that Robbie should not have been punished, but
I do expect punishment to be fair and consistent," said Dooley.
</P>
<P>
"They have not treated Fowler with the same sort of
understanding that they treated Le Saux," he added.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Advance into FA Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United defeated
Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the F.A. Cup semi-final at Old Trafford
on Sunday while holders Arsenal and Manchester United must meet
again on Wednesday after a 0-0 draw at Villa Park earlier on the
day.
</P>
<P>
The semi-final match at Old Trafford also went to extra time.
With 18 minutes minutes played, Tottenham's England defender Sol
Campbell handled a lofted pass from Newcastle substitute Duncan
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer beat Ian Walker from the penalty spot and
Newcastle were on their way to Wembley. A minute from the end of
extra time, Shearer drove home from the edge of the area for a
resounding 2-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham had a penalty claim rejected by referee Paul Durkin
when a 57th-minute cross hit Greek defender Nikolas Dabizas on the
hand.
</P>
<P>
So Newcastle United's quest for the trophy they last won in
1955 continued.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, their beaten opponents in the 1952 final and
conquerors last season, must renew battle with Manchester United
in the replay at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
In a tight contest, Manchester United created more chances and
thought they had scored when Irish midfielder Roy Keane had the
ball in the net after 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Referee David Elleray ruled the effort offside, much to the
amazement of United manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's defence, the best in the premier league, again proved
resolute. They held out despite having Argentine midfielder Nelson
Vivas sent off five minutes into extra time.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United still had a record treble of league, F.A.Cup
and European Cup in their sights. Arsenal are attempting to become
the first English team to achieve a league and F.A. Cup in
successive seasons.

<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea stayed at third with a 2-1
victory at Wimbledon cruised to a comfortable 2-1 win at Wimbledon
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Chelsea moved to within two points of league
leaders Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Everton eased their relegation worries with a 2-0 home victory
over Coventry City that took the Merseysiders into 16th place,
their first success after four consecutive league defeats.
</P>
<P>
While Chelsea's premier league rivals Manchester United and
Arsenal ended their F.A. Cup semifinal in a 0-0 deadlock at Villa
Park, the Londoners took full advantage at Selhurst Park.
</P>
<P>
Held 1-1 by Spain's Real Mallorca in the European Cup Winners'
Cup semifinal first leg on Thursday, Chelsea took early control
against Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo dispossessed defender Chris
Perry, exchanged passes with Dane Bjarne Goldbaek and gave the
Londoners a 1-0 lead in the 23rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea went 2-0 up in the 53rd minute when Italian forward
Gianfranco Zola capitalised on Wimbledon's defensive errors to set
up Uruguayan Gustavo Poyet.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Gayle pulled a goal back for Wimbledon in the 88th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Victory gave Chelsea 62 points from 31 games, two points behind
Manchester United. Arsenal are second on 63 but have played one
match more.
</P>
<P>
Two goals by Kevin Campbell gave Everton a glimpse of premier
league salvation at home to Coventry City. The forward,on loan
from Turkish club Trabzonspor, scored in the 28th and 86th minutes
for their 2-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Everton climbed out of the bottom three to 16th place on 34
points despite having Italian Marco Materazzi sent off in the 86th
minute.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Praises Kenya's Education Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan education allocation
accounts for about seven percent of its gross domestic product
which is sufficient and higher compared to the other sub-Sahara
African countries, a World Bank official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Harold Wackman, the boss of the World Bank Kenyan Branch, told
participants at a union leaders' seminar that most of other
African countries spend only an average of five percent of their
GDP.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kenya set aside a larger proportion of the
government expenditure on public education with 23.7 percent,
while the other African nations with some 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan government covers 69 percent of the cost of the primary
schools, while households pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
The government covers 40 percent and 92 percent of tuitions
for secondary and college students respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Kenya's pupil to teacher ratio is
" unusually low," citing the figures as 31 pupils to one teacher
for primary schools and 16 students to one teacher in the
secondary level.
</P>
<P>
But in many other African countries, the ratio is 44 pupils to
one teacher for primary schools and 27 students to one teacher for
secondary schools, Wackman added.

<HEADLINE> Cash Shortage Threatens AIDS Project in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million-shilling AIDS
project sponsored by the World Bank may stall because of cash-flow
problems with local governments, Kenyan officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sexually transmitted infections (STI) project, funded by
the World Bank and being implemented by Kenyan Ministry of
Health, may not progress as local governments have failed to fund
implementation activities before seeking reimbursement, they said.
</P>
<P>
Project operations were curtailed by inability to get cash from
district treasuries, said officials in charge of the project,
which was mainly aimed at building the capacities of public health
institutions to deal with the STIs, said to predispose people to
HIV. It is hoped that if STIs are reduced, fewer people will be
at risk of contracting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In Nyanza where 30 percent of the people between 15 and 49 are
reportedly HIV carriers, local authorities are entitled to spend
41 million shillings (about 650,000 U.S. dollars) for AIDS
prevention and treatment activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the money is not available and may be recalled in two
months when the current financial year ends.
</P>
<P>
Nyamira District Commissioner Earnest Munyi said they were not
to blame for the lack of cash, adding that the shortage of cash in
the treasuries was a national problem and could not be addressed
at the local level.
</P>
<P>
Dr. D.N. Hagembe, manager of the National AIDS/STI Control
Program, said that a consignment of drugs to treat STIs has
arrived but each district is expected to arrange the delivery.
