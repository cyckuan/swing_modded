<HEADLINE> Gore Touts 'Comprehensive' Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore courted senior citizens
and Hispanics Monday, touting his plan for a ''real,
comprehensive'' prescription drug benefit as a stark contrast to
the proposals of rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll put the power of medical science back in the medicine
cabinets of our mothers and fathers,'' Gore said of his Medicare
benefits plan. ''It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking in the suburb of Clayton at a town hall-style
meeting with senior citizens, also took on the big drug companies,
accusing them of ''price gouging.'' And he criticized the
Republicans' drug bill now pending in Congress, saying it was put
together by the drug companies and ''its only purpose is to serve
as an illusion or camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the vice president was House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt of St. Louis, who said the cost of drugs could be a
decisive matter in both the presidential election and the fight for
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge, huge issue to senior citizens,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have received more than $3 million from drug
manufacturers, while the Democrats have gotten just over $700,000,
Gore aides said campaign finance records showed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Gore has offered would provide a prescription drug
benefit under the Medicare program, with the government paying half
of the annual costs up to $5,000. Aides said it would extend
coverage to 40 million people at a cost of $255 billion over 10
years. Gore had explained details of the proposal earlier, but was
hammering hard at his plan in the battleground state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He said many senior citizens have to choose between buying drugs
or going without other necessities. ''We just should not be putting
our seniors in that position,'' he said. ''It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore flew to San Diego to pitch the proposal to the
National Council of La Raza, an important Hispanic group. He said
Hispanics would benefit under the prescription plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said 2 million Hispanics would gain because the number
eligible for Medicare was expected to triple over the next 25
years. Further, Hispanics are more than twice as likely to lack
supplemental coverage for prescription drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm committed to a real prescription drug benefit for all
Hispanics who rely on Medicare,'' Gore said. ''Not one that tells
them to go beg the HMOs and the insurance companies for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the vice president would focus on the prescription
drug proposal and health care throughout the week, including in
separate appearances before two big teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was addressing the National Council of La Raza on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to Hispanic activists, Gore telephoned Mexican
President-elect Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good, long conversation,'' Gore said. ''He asked for
the chance to have a meeting in Washington soon. I will look
forward to having that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said Mexico's ruling party deserves credit for losing
''gracefully and well, without challenging or overturning the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, made a
Gore-arranged conference call to reporters to criticize Bush for
offering minimal details about what he would provide in financing
for prescription drug aid to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the American people deserve to have a clear statement
by Governor Bush as to what he would propose to do,'' said Graham,
sometimes mentioned as a vice presidential possibility for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said Bush has been
consistent in proposing to allocate $5 trillion over five years to
both save and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, also
providing prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said Gore, as vice president, should have
spoken up much earlier if he thought the issue was so important.
</P>
<P>
   ''After eight years of failing to propose a solution, the vice
president is calling for reform,'' said Missouri Rep. James Talent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his plan would cover far more people than a more
modest bill backed in Congress by Republicans. He also said his
plan is best because it includes coverage under Medicare, while
Republicans rely on insurance companies to provide the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Missouri campaign stop, 72-year-old Jacqueline Steele
Johnson said she spends $423 of her monthly $870 income on
prescription drugs. She said she eats macaroni and cheese every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his appearance for spirited criticism of big drug
makers, the second straight week he has taken on a large and
unpopular industry. Gore spent much of last week bashing big oil
companies over the soaring price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are price gouging and you are paying the bill,'' Gore
said of the drug makers. ''There's no other industry in America
that has profits nearly as high.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something of a vice presidential buzz surrounding
Gore's swing with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't talked about that,'' Gephardt said when questioned.
''As Harry Truman once said, I don't answer iffy questions.''

<HEADLINE> Tips on E. coli Safety  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Ground beef is the most common source of the E. coli
bacteria,
but not the only one. Fruits, vegetables and drinking water also
can harbor the deadly pathogen. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention offer these tips for preventing E. coli infections:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Cook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly. Ground beef can
turn brown before the bacteria are killed, so it should be heated
until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty,
including the thickest section, reads at least 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   --If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef
product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking.
</P>
<P>
   --To avoid spreading the bacteria at home, keep raw meat separate
from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with
hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked
hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw
patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that
require further cooking.
</P>
<P>
   --Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, or cider.
</P>
<P>
   --Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially those that
will not be cooked. Children under 5 and people with depressed
immune systems should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   --Drink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or
other effective disinfectants and avoid swallowing lake or pool
water while swimming.

<HEADLINE> Projectiles Fired Toward US Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two pieces of metal were fired from small steel
pipes toward a U.S. military base on the outskirts of Tokyo in what
Japanese police suspect was attempted sabotage by leftist radicals.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or damage inside or outside
Yokota Air Base, although one projectile landed near the runway.
Police were still searching to find out where the other projectile
had landed when they were fired around 11:30 p.m. Monday, said
Kazumasa Kuwana, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A runway on the base is about a half-mile from where the pieces
of metal were fired from the grounds of a construction company,
Kuwana said.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a pair of steel pipes, each measuring 2 inches
around 21 inches long, and partially stuck into the earth on the
grounds of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwana said fragmented cables and a timing device apparently
used in the launching were also discovered nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect anti-U.S. military base radicals or leftist
radicals opposed to this month's meeting of the Group of Eight in
Okinawa might have been behind the firing of the steel pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from the United States, Japan, Russia, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Canada will hold a three-day summit on the
southern island starting July 21.
</P>
<P>
   About 47,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan as part of a
security agreement between the two countries, and some Okinawans
have complained about the many bases located there.
</P>
<P>
   For years, small leftist groups in Japan have complained about
the power that the G-8 enjoys. In 1986, during the last summit by
the group in Japan, several small mortar shells were fired at the
accommodation where the leaders were staying, and police accused
the radicals of firing them.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Turn Against Each Other  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVO SELO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Life or death? Another man's fate
lies in the young villager's hands. The young man averts his gaze
as he struggles with the dilemma -- if he defends the family honor
by killing, he himself becomes the target of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say,'' mumbles Iset Maxhuni. ''It's so
difficult to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxhuni's ordeal began three years ago, with the killing of his
brother. As so often among Albanians, it was a matter of honor --
the brother had left his wife for her younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   For the sisters' brother, the divorce was a slight that needed
avenging. He was slain -- and so began yet another blood feud in the
region's violent history of an eye for an eye. Now, it is up to
Maxhuni to avenge his own brother's death by taking a life.
</P>
<P>
   With the blood barely dried little more than a year after the
end of the Serb crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians has come the
revival of Gjakmarrja (djak-MAHR-yeh), or blood feud killings.
</P>
<P>
   With it have come those whose mission is to try to prevent a
prevent new cycles of bloodshed. One of them is historian Zekeria
Cana, who crisscrosses Kosovo trying to reconcile feuding families.
</P>
<P>
   Under decades of communist rule with little tolerance for
Gjakmarrja, deadly family feuds were rare, both in Kosovo and
neighboring Albania. But communism itself is now history, and
nearly everyone has a gun. Old blood debts are being collected, and
new blood is being shed.
</P>
<P>
   The code was first laid down nearly 600 years ago by a northern
Albanian prince: If a man kills another, a male member of the
victim's family must respond in kind. It became a popular form of
justice in a highly armed, tribal society where a man's honor was
everything. Whole families were wiped out by feuds that sometimes
went on for generations
</P>
<P>
   Not every killing has the potential to erupt into a blood feud,
and most Albanians continue to reject the whole idea. But the code
has experienced a revival -- first in Albania, fed there by the
chaos and armed insurrection of the late 1990s, and now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Here, with the Serbs vanquished, unity again can give way to the
everyday reality of family against family; Albanian against
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever the Albanian people are in danger of extermination,
they unite to fight the common enemy,'' says Cana, 75. ''But now,
the wound has started to reopen.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he says, the brutality of the killings has increased
because society has been traumatized by the war against the Serbs.
Knives and axes are increasingly used instead of firearms. The
''honorable'' tradition of shooting someone face-to-face is
increasingly ignored in favor of a bullet in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Cana says he is working on more than 100 cases.
</P>
<P>
   First he tries to secure the promise of a ''Besa'' -- an oath by
the family seeking revenge to suspend the threat of killing. This
allows those under the gun to live and work without fear for the
duration of the Besa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I try for true reconciliation -- forgiving,'' says Cana.
''But sometimes families are only ready for that after you allow
several killings to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cana's quest has brought him recognition across Kosovo. As he
drinks a beer in cafe in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, waiter
Gazmen Kaciru asks him to intervene in the case of an uncle under
threat of death because he killed two men who tried to kidnap a
female relative. Cana agrees, murmuring: ''A particularly ugly
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, his search for reconciliation takes him to
Novo Selo, 10 miles northwest of Pristina. There, Cana sits in
Maxhuni's spartan living room along with the village elder. His
5-year-old son on his lap, Maxhuni squirms under the gaze of the
other two men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want him to grow up without a father?'' Cana asks,
pointing to the boy. ''I have seen many children grow up without
fathers, killed for a matter of honor. Look at this kid -- he should
live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The turbaned village elder joins in. ''Life goes on,'' says the
elder, Haxhi Ferid Zekoli, 79. ''It is time to forget and
forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Besa ends for the killer in two days. And Maxhuni, 32, a
gentle-looking man with friendly brown eyes, knows what's at stake.
If he kills the man who killed his brother, the man's kin are free
to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if that happens who will take care of them?'' he asks,
pointing to the preschool children scampering in and out of the
living room -- some of them kids of his dead brother.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 minutes of gentle persuasion, Maxhuni promises to
deliver an answer to the village elder following consultation with
his family, which must take the decision collectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the answer will be good,'' he says softly. ''I want it
to be good.''

<HEADLINE> Kids Advised Against Playing 1 Sport  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Tiger Woods was playing nine holes of golf by age
3, and Chris Evert took up tennis at 5, the same age Shannon Miller
got hooked on gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a new policy statement from the American
Academy of Pediatrics, youngsters should be discouraged from
specializing in a single sport before adolescence to avoid physical
and psychological damage.
</P>
<P>
   The risks range from ''overuse'' injuries such as stress
fractures to delayed menstruation, eating disorders, emotional
stress and burnout, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the policy could harm talented youngsters and change
the face of elite-level sports.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has seven Olympic medals and hopes to make a
comeback at the Sydney Olympics in September, said she would have
missed her glory days had she not focused on gymnastics at an early
age.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt that I would be an Olympian or going to my third
Olympics,'' said Miller, 23. ''When I was 12 and 13 I was already
competing and representing my country, and I don't see how that can
be a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, published in the July issue of the academy's
medical journal, Pediatrics, serves as a recommendation for the
group's 55,000 pediatricians and pediatric specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to specialize until the age of 12 or 13, when children
are more emotionally and physically mature, helps ensure that they
are pursuing an activity that really interests them rather than
fulfilling a parent or coach's dream, said Dr. Steven Anderson, a
University of Washington sports medicine specialist and chairman of
the academy's committee on sports medicine and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the academy recognizes that recommending a
complete ban would be unrealistic. So the policy also encourages
pediatricians who treat child athletes to be on the lookout for
problems and help make sure youngsters aren't ''getting overwhelmed
and burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The pediatrician may be the most objective person these people
encounter,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new policy was prompted in part by the upcoming
Olympics and the book ''Little Girls in Pretty Boxes: The Making
and Breaking of Elite Gymnasts and Figure Skaters.'' Joan Ryan's
1995 book details the intense pressures involved in turning
youngsters into champions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Rowland, a committee member and pediatric
cardiologist in Springfield, Mass., said there was concern ''about
the extremely intensive sports play that begins at age 5, where the
child's whole life becomes oriented toward sports success and
victory. There's an intuitive feeling that this is not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been success stories like Evert or Woods, there
have also been sad tales. Teen-age tennis sensation Jennifer
Capriati was arrested on drug charges in 1994 and went into drug
rehab, and Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu, now 18, has suffered
sidelining injuries and gone through ugly family battles.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said it is especially troublesome ''when you look at
the statistics of how many of these kids who are being pushed are
really going to make it. It's well under 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna deVarona, an Olympic gold-medalist in the 1960s, said the
recommendations are generally sound, though exceptions should be
made for children who are obvious prodigies.
</P>
<P>
   DeVarona, who zeroed in on swimming at age 10 and joined the
Olympic team three years later, said she did not mind missing
parties and sleepovers because she ''loved the focus of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have an 8-year-old who's an extraordinarily flexible
gymnast, you would tend to support more specialization, but with a
balanced life,'' deVarona said. ''You see so many kids burned
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Jaeger, who played competitive tennis at 10 and was No. 2
in the world at 16, said early sports specialization raises
troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many kids who are trying to be that and don't make it, at
the end of the day feel like a failure? How do you know a child at
age 2 wants to play tennis?'' said Jaeger, 35, who left the tennis
circuit at 21 after a shoulder injury. ''It might be bringing out
an enormous talent, but how do you know there isn't another one in
there?''

<HEADLINE> Black Bears Targeted in Crowded NJ  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WANTAGE, N.J. (AP) -- William Kellner didn't see the animal
coming.
</P>
<P>
   He had just closed the barbecue grill on the back porch of his
vacation trailer when his son yelled ''Bear!'' The black bear was
right behind Kellner, towering over him, sniffing at the grill.
After he backed inside, the bear put its paws on the trailer's
sliding glass door and stared at Kellner's family until it fled at
the sound of pots and pans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It scared me,'' said Kellner, who said he and his 12-year-old
son are eager to take part in a bear hunt this fall, the state's
first in 29 years and one that is stirring controversy.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Fish and Game Council scheduled the hunt for 175
bears to curb a burgeoning ursine population that is killing
livestock and breaking into homes and cars. In the state with the
highest population density in the country, with more than 1,000 per
square mile, bears walk through suburban yards and saunter along
roads. Experts say they were born and raised with people around.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're used to cutting across the back lawn, coming across
the driveway, checking out the garage for trash,'' said Bob
Eriksen, a biologist with the state Division of Fish and Wildlife.
''They don't avoid people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when bear hunts were abandoned, black bears
numbered ''well below'' 100 in New Jersey, Eriksen said. Now more
than 1,000 roam 11 counties, especially in northern parts like
Wantage, about 75 miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   If you go far enough north, in Sussex County at the northwestern
tip of New Jersey, just about everyone has seen a bear in the past
few years and has a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   A cub broke into Susan Snover's car in Stillwater last week to
get at the Sugar Corn Pops in a shopping bag. Flossie Masker, 91,
looks out her front door to see bears cut through her yard,
sniffing at her car before heading to the open road. John Keenan
has a mother and two cubs who regularly bash his bird feeders for
food.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come in my back yard almost every day,'' said 17-year-old
Matt Walloga of Lake Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Division of Fish and Wildlife handled 250 bear
complaints, Eriksen said. Last year there were 1,659, including 29
complaints of bears entering homes, 29 complaints of killing goat,
sheep and other livestock, 12 attacks of pet dogs and 46 bears who
were killed by cars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet residents and legislators aren't sure whether killing bears
is the right way to control them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just leave them alone,'' said Masker, who watches the bears
from her front door. ''As long as they don't do no damage, they're
nice to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate last week passed a bill that would postpone a
bear hunt for five years and instructs the state to come up with
another population control plan that could include sterilizing
females. The bill is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said hunters have an obligation to reduce the number of
bears competing for food.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll starve to death if you don't kill them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, Eriksen said. Northern New Jersey offers enough
vegetation and wildlife to satisfy many more bears, but the problem
is that the animals are living too close to the sprawling suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen went to Stillwater last week to help remove a cub who
had become trapped inside Snover's Ford Escort, tearing off the
rearview mirror and pounding the horn in a frantic attempt to get
loose. After the cub was freed, it ran up a tree with another cub
and their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''They go up a tree as fast as a squirrel,'' Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials tranquilized the mother bear and took her a
short distance away from her children, then pelted her with rubber
bullets and pepper spray and yelled at her to discourage her from
returning. The bear came back, as Eriksen knew she would, to
retrieve the cubs. He said the separation was hopefully punishment
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bears are killed by wildlife officials if they're caught two or
three times wreaking havoc near homes. But many residents say
they've grown comfortable with the creatures. Walloga followed one
once from his Lake Shawnee yard into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just went and sat in the woods and just laid there and
looked at me,'' Walloga said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't as welcoming, and blame some residents for feeding
the bears, encouraging them to come closer and closer.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wantage resident Judy Phillips, ''I think it's going to
take a child getting mauled for someone to do something about it.''

<HEADLINE> Resort company doubles reward for missing American writer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) - Sandals Resorts has doubled the reward
for information about a New York travel writer who disappeared
while staying at one of its camps in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The company on Monday raised the payment to $50,000 for clues
about Claudia Kirschhoch, an editor at New York-based Frommer's
Travel Guides, who was reported missing on June 2. Kirschhoch was
staying at a Sandals resort in western Negril.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first reward announcements triggered almost 400 calls,''
Sandals chairman Gordon Stewart said in a statement from London.
''We hope the larger reward will generate more calls and perhaps
loosen a tongue or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch arrived in Jamaica on May 24 as part of a
Sandals-sponsored tour for travel writers that was to continue to
Cuba. When the Cuba leg was canceled because of visa problems and
all flights back to New York were booked, she opted to stay in
Negril. She was last seen May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing police investigation into Kirschhoch's disappearance
has yielded few clues. Last week, an FBI team arrived in Jamaica to
aid local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch's parents, who have visited twice, said last week
that the reward, then $25,000, would be raised no further.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart, the Sandals chairman, ''called and asked if he
could raise it, and even though we said we wouldn't raise it again,
I didn't see how this could hurt,'' Fred Kirschhoch said during a

<HEADLINE> Changes Urged for Nuke Lab Security  </HEADLINE>
By CHAKA FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Scientists at Los Alamos National
Laboratory will have to undergo a cultural change if security is to
improve at the nuclear weapons facility, lab officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lab has instituted security upgrades following the two-month
disappearance of two classified hard drives from a vault at the
top-secret X Division, said John Tucker, the lab's deputy director
of security.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lab scientists will have to change the way they do
business if future security breaches are to be avoided, Tucker said
during a briefing with Rep. Tom Udall, D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Manhattan Project created the first (nuclear)
weapons, the collaborative effort said everyone working had a
common need to know,'' Tucker said. ''Today, there is a school of
thought that says 'I don't need to know everything about a
project.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lab has been criticized recently for several security
breaches over the past year, prompting some congressional leaders
to call for the resignation of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
whose department oversees the lab.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury has been convened to look into the disappearance of
the two computer hard drives. Last month, two 10-year-old floppy
disks containing classified information were discovered missing,
then found the next day. In December, former Los Alamos scientist
Wen Ho Lee was charged with illegally copying top-secret nuclear
weapons files. He is in jail awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Monday the lab has changed all vault combinations,
revised procedures for entering and leaving classified areas and
installed devices that read palm prints before access is granted to
secure areas.
</P>
<P>
   Udall, in town to tour rehabilitation work being done to lab
property burned by the wildfire in May, said he would continue to
monitor security upgrades at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning of the process to have the laboratory
evaluate this and make recommendations,'' Udall said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge for lab security is to get scientists to
heed security concerns without hindering the scientific process,
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said one scientist may be working on the human
genome project while another is working on a nuclear weapon design.
Both may have the same security clearance, but that doesn't mean
they should share classified information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because you have a clearance doesn't grant you a right to
see all the information in the laboratory,'' he said. ''We're
trying to further refine it to make sure that the right people
doing the right things have access to the right information.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said security breaches can also occur when scientists
pass along information to one another, especially through
electronic media such as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to get them to realize not to send information
through open communication,'' he said. ''They need someone to
review it and say, 'This needs to be encrypted.'''

<HEADLINE> Report: Giuliani's Dad Served Time  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The late father of law-and-order Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani served 18 months in prison for holding up a milkman at
gunpoint in the 1930s, The Village Voice reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani pleaded guilty to armed robbery in 1934, a
decade before his son was born, the weekly newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and an accomplice stopped milkman Harold Hall as he
entered an Upper East Side apartment building to collect customer
payments, pointed a gun at him and took $128.82 from his pocket,
the Voice reported in an excerpt from reporter Wayne Barrett's
upcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor, declined to comment
on the story. ''We haven't read it,'' she said. ''Don't read The
Village Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the state Department of Correctional Services seeking
confirmation of the report was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes in a difficult year for Rudolph Giuliani, who
dropped out of the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton after
revealing he had prostate cancer and was separating from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, has built his career on a
reputation as a crime fighter, gaining national prominence as New
York's crime rates dropped sharply. Until recently, he rarely spoke
about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor recalled his father's influence on him while speaking
about his cancer diagnosis in April. His father died of prostate
cancer in 1981 at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings up very painful memories,'' the mayor said when he
was diagnosed. ''And, you know, I miss my father every day of my
life. And he's a very, very important reason for why I'm standing
here as the mayor of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Voice, after a police officer interrupted the
robbery, an indictment identified Harold Giuliani, then 26, as the
man who pressed a gun into Hall's abdomen. But the milkman later
changed his statement, saying Giuliani's accomplice wielded the
pistol, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   One prosecutor, Louis Capozzoli, said in court that Hall had
been told to change his story when ''he was visited at about four
o'clock that morning by several people who threatened him,''
according to the Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani, who told a judge his name was Joseph Starrett,
was initially charged with four felonies, and pleaded innocent, the
Voice reported. After Hall changed his statement, Giuliani was
allowed to plead guilty to just one felony, according to the paper.
He was sentenced to two to five years and released on parole after
a year and a half, the Voice said.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice said Harold Giuliani's criminal record is filed under
the name Joseph Starrett.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice story portrayed Giuliani's father as a hot-tempered
man who was quick to throw a punch and rarely held a legitimate
job. In the late 1940s, he began working as a bartender at a tavern
owned by his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, the Voice reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice said D'Avanzo ran a loan-sharking and gambling
operation out of the bar. Harold Giuliani wielded a baseball bat to
collect debts owed to his brother-in-law, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani moved his family from Brooklyn to Long Island in 1951,
and left his bartending job in the late 1950s to become a school
custodian. He was eventually fired for failing to show up to work,
the Voice said.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Won by State Senator Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PAYNE, Ala. (AP) -- A judge Monday cut by two-thirds a state
senator's $15.2 million award in a lawsuit against an insurance
company that allegedly tried to dig up dirt on him.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Randall Cole ordered the judgment for state Sen.
Lowell Barron reduced to $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said the lesser amount still will ''send a clear
message'' that invading an elected official's privacy ''is not
acceptable behavior in our political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron sued Alfa insurance in 1997, contending the company
invaded his privacy by hiring private investigators to look into
his background. He claimed the company sought the information to
get him to support an Alfa vice president for a seat on the Auburn
University board.
</P>
<P>
   In February, jurors awarded Barron more than $15 million in
punitive damages. Barron's attorney, Dee Miles, said the senator
would accept the reduced amount rather than seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Alfa was closed for the holiday Monday and company officials
could not be reached for comment. They can appeal to the Alabama
Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> 3-Year-Old Girl Rescued After Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARKS, Ind. (AP) -- A tuft of reddish-brown hair alerted a
bystander to a girl trapped in a wrecked car, leading to her rescue
just before the vehicle went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please, get me out,'' 3-year-old Raven Padgett said, reaching
out from her car seat in a vehicle that had overturned after
colliding with a train.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Aders then stepped into the vehicle, unbuckled the car
seat and grabbed the girl, carrying her from danger about two
minutes before the vehicle went up in flames, said Dubois County
Sheriff's Deputy Forrest Kieser.
</P>
<P>
   ''If her hair hadn't fallen down, nobody would have known she
was in there,'' said Aders, 33, a mother of a 5-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Raven, who suffered a cut lip and bumps in the accident Sunday,
was treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Ms. Aders that she did something that hopefully
everybody would do, but human nature tells you not everyone would
do it,'' Kieser said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred just Sunday afternoon at a crossing in
this town about 40 miles northeast of Evansville.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer of a freight train hit his emergency brake but
could not stop before striking the front passenger side of the car,
spinning and flipping the vehicle on its top.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car, 33-year-old Roy M. Medbery II -- who was
engaged to Raven's mother -- was not wearing a seat belt and was
thrown from the car. He died Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aders was painting a birdbath at her mother's house when she
heard the train whistle blare.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal left Aders thinking about her own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fully hit me yet,'' she said. ''It was
difficult driving home after that.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Begins Stunning Transition  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With a hug and a handshake, the last leader
of Mexico's ruling dynasty and the maverick rancher who will
succeed him embarked on Mexico's first peaceful transfer of power
in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Mexicans voted out of the presidency the party that
has governed them since the beginning of the Depression, Vicente
Fox strode into the presidential residence known as Los Pinos on
Monday evening to discuss the transition with President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast couldn't have been starker: Zedillo, a 5-foot-7
bookish, Yale-educated economist, and Fox, a 6-foot-5 tough-talking
businessman who rode into one of his final campaign rallies on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
   But the two said they would work together to ensure a peaceful
transition from 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party to the next six in which the National Action Party will hold
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The two even agreed to work together on the 2001 budget
proposal, which Zedillo must submit to Congress just as Fox takes
office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some clear ideas about next year's budget ... but, on
the other hand, there is a need to take advantage of the
government's experience,'' Fox said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fox applauded Zedillo, first for recognizing Fox's victory only
three hours after the polls closed, and then for his eagerness for
a peaceful transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had expected more difficult scenarios,'' Fox told
reporters. ''We have to acknowledge President Zedillo. His
performance will remain registered in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also began to plan the transition on his own, saying he
would send out head hunters to find the most qualified people for
each top post, regardless of their party affiliation. He said he
would personally interview the top three candidates for each
Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not showing up to govern with friends or relatives or
buddies,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''I'm
showing up to govern with the most professional team there is in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's relations with other parties could be an important test
for his presidency. The officials with the greatest experience in
governing Mexico are almost all members of the ruling party. It is
not known how many would accept Fox's invitation to join his
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of cooperation with Zedillo were likely to reassure
investors that the presidential handover wouldn't plunge Mexico
into economic crisis, as the last four handovers within the ruling
party have.
</P>
<P>
   ''That won't happen this time,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's overtures to investors Monday appeared to be working.
Mexico's stock market closed up 6.1 percent and the Mexican peso
rose sharply against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The election was so stunning that many Mexicans don't know what
to expect. No one alive has seen a peaceful transfer of power
between parties in Mexico: The PRI has governed since 1929, and
before that, Mexicans endured a long series of rigged or violent
changes of power by earlier regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is often confused with Mexico itself, especially in
rural areas. It has a political monopoly on the colors of the flag,
and for a long time there was no difference between the government
and party.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's National Action Party, founded in 1939, was considered a
fringe party of the Roman Catholic middle classes for its first
half-century, and didn't elect its first governor until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But with 93 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's election,
Fox had 42.7 percent, the ruling party's Francisco Labastida had
35.8 percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution
Party had 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called to congratulate Fox and issued a
statement calling the elections a ''vivid testimony to the depth of
the democratic commitment of the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, an election
observer, called it ''a truly historic sea change in the politics
of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't mean anything but good in terms of U.S. interests,''
Baker said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidency, National Action also appeared to
have captured the largest delegations in both the House and the
Senate, although it was well short of a majority in both. The party
also wrested the governorship of Morelos state away from PRI and
kept its hold on Fox's Guanajuato state. Democratic Revolution won
the mayor's race in Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> Fox's Election Sends Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The stock market is up, the peso is stronger
and there is little talk of the postelection economic curse that
plagued Mexico after the past four presidential votes.
</P>
<P>
   Electing the first opposition candidate to Mexico's presidency
in a century seems to agree with the country financially -- at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's victory Sunday ended 71 years of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Deutsche Bank responded by
naming Mexico the top pick in its Latin American portfolio, saying
''as democracy is strengthened in Mexico, the economy will become a
major focus of attention for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the vote, however, many Mexicans
worried that the economy would collapse after the election as it
has after the past four presidential votes -- all of which were
followed by crises that sent inflation, interest rates and
unemployment soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with The Associated Press, Fox repeated
promises for a smooth, crisis-free transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under no circumstances do we want to fall into a deep hole,
into a vacuum as we did in December 1994,'' the last crisis, Fox
said. ''That is not going to happen this time because we are going
to have a lot of communication with everyone -- with investors, with
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Mexico, the United States and Canada should move beyond
their free-trade bloc, known as NAFTA, and into a common market
agreement where Mexicans, Americans and Canadians can work beyond
their countries' borders -- an idea unlikely to be accepted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will eliminate migration,'' said Fox, a former Coca-Cola
executive who has touted free trade and a cleaner, more efficient
government. ''It will eliminate the gap between salaries in one
country and another, and this will make us very, very fruitful,
winning partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's stock market responded favorably to Fox's win, closing
6.1 percent higher -- its highest close since April 3. The peso
strengthened to 9.57 against the dollar, its strongest level since
June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that optimism can be sustained, said
Sidney Weintraub, an expert on political economy for the Center for
Strategic &AMP; International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's short term,'' he said. ''And I think people are going
to watch how the transition goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts agree the economy is strong and there is
little chance of another postelection crisis, many in Mexico are
still wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most Mexicans, this has happened every six years or so,
and it's built into their psyche that something will happen,'' he
said. ''They aren't going to change their mind until Fox is in
office and things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still shocked by Fox's win, many Mexicans seemed to embrace the
idea of change within their country. In Texas, some immigrants said
they might even return home if Fox can improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things got better, I would maybe go back to Mexico,'' said
Maria De Jesus Osoria, who moved to the United States a year ago.
''I think (Fox) will make the changes. He has to be the catalyst
for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't convinced that a new party in power would mean a
stronger economy.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo de la Torre, 27, who was having his shoes shined while
reading about Fox's win, said he voted for Fox and hoped that the
newly elected president can create jobs and develop Mexico's
resources. But he also said Fox's success would depend on how his
government is accepted in Mexico, where the ruling party has ruled
for decades with limited opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if it's going to work or not,'' de la Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a newly shined pair of shoes to a waiting
luxury car and returning to de la Torre, Felix Sanchez Moreno, 28,
agreed, saying Mexicans were accustomed to economic crises, and
wouldn't be surprised by another. Still, he was hopeful things
would improve under Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change is very good,'' he said. ''This is what the country
needs.''

<HEADLINE> At long last, Revolutionary War veteran gets honorary headstone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, N.Y. (AP) - One hundred sixty-two years after his
death, a Revolutionary War corporal is getting a veteran's
headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Through a quirk of fate and the efforts of the Daughters of the
American Revolution and the state Department of Veterans Affairs,
Theophilus Howard will soon have a new gravestone indicating that
he served honorably in his country's war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1773, Howard participated in the Boston Tea Party, in which
colonists protested the British tax on tea imported to the
Colonies. And beginning in 1775, Howard spent six months as a
private in Cambridge, Mass., during the British occupation of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1776, he joined again for a year and was stationed first
in Williamsburg, Mass., as a corporal, and was listed as a gunner
and a bombardier. He was transferred to Naddles Island, off the
Massachusetts coast. When he was scheduled to go to Rhode Island,
he hired a substitute to finish out his term.
</P>
<P>
   He died May 23, 1838, had 12 children, several of whom are
buried next to him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of his remembrance began with a meeting in Seattle
between Don Howard, a direct descendant of Theophilus Howard, and
Peggy Power Gifford, a member of the General Peter Gansevoort
Chapter of DAR who was visiting her sister.
</P>
<P>
   The two women decided to spend the afternoon at a genealogy
library, which is a common activity for members of the DAR. Members
must trace their ancestry to qualify for membership in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''I struck up a conversation with a complete stranger about the
DAR,'' Gifford said. ''He began telling me about his ancestor who
was in the Revolutionary War and took part in the Boston Tea Party.
I couldn't believe it when he said the man was buried in
Stamford.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation progressed, Howard revealed that the grave
didn't indicate that Theophilus was a veteran. Gifford, who works
with Desert Shield/Storm veteran Chuck Greenfield to get VA markers
for other soldiers, offered to do the legwork and submit the
application to properly mark Theophilus' grave.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days, Greenfield will come to Stamford to place a new
veteran's marker at the foot of Theophilus' grave. He always gives
the veterans a fitting tribute by playing ''Taps.'' To date, he has
placed more than 100 markers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take pride in doing something for our veterans, giving them
the honor they deserve,'' Gifford said. ''Patriotism is important
to me,'' she told The Daily Star of Oneonta. ''When I see a parade
and see the flag go by, I get tears in my eyes.''

Fiji Govt. Sworn in During Crisis
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- An all-Fijian temporary government was sworn in Tuesday in
defiance of hostage takers who are holding 27 members of the ousted, Indian-led
government at gunpoint in parliament. Banking executive Laisenia Qarase became
prime minister in an appointment that provoked the anger of the hostage takers
who had demanded a role in naming any new government. Armed clashes late broke
out between Fiji's military and the hostage takers after a news conference by
rebel leader George Speight, who said he did not expect the new government to

speaking in the suburb of Clayton at a town hall-style meeting with senior
citizens, also took on the big drug companies, accusing them of ''price
gouging.'' And he criticized the Republicans' drug bill now pending in Congress,
saying it was put together by the drug companies and ''its only purpose is to

that independence must come only as part of a peace accord. The PLO Central
Council, the Palestinians' chief policymaking body, declared its
''determination'' to declare independence by that time, and called on the world
community to recognize statehood when it is declared, ''noting the natural and
historical right of our nation to establish a state.''

Judge Paul G. Hatfield Dies

   GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- Senior U.S. District Judge Paul G. Hatfield, a
former senator who in 1979 cast a deciding vote for the treaties that gave the
Panama Canal back to the Central American country, died Monday. He was 72.
Hatfield apparently suffered a heart attack at his home, the coroner said.
Appointed to the Senate in 1978 after the death of Sen. Lee Metcalf, a fellow
Montana Democrat, Hatfield served for only a year. Hatfield was among the last
of the undecideds on the Panama Canal issue, and he did not make up his mind to
vote for ratification until the last moment. The treaties, which were
passionately opposed by many Montanans, were ratified by a single vote.

shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Palestinians and
Israelis were reported as remaining far apart on crucial issues, including
whether Israel would withdraw from all territory it took in the 1967 Six-Day
War. Clinton is trying to assess whether the parties are close enough to bring
the leaders together, or whether further lower-level negotiations are needed,
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA officials denied reports Monday that a computer
hacker attack in 1997 endangered astronauts by disrupting communications with
the space shuttle Atlantis. The British Broadcasting Corp. had reported that
during a rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir, a hacker interfered with
communications and forced the shuttle crew to use the Russian station to
maintain contact with NASA. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman Bob Jacobs said ground controllers never lost contact with the
astronauts nor did they use the Russian space station as a communications relay.

<HEADLINE> Poll: U.S. Voters Want Honesty  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American voters are about evenly divided on
whether they think George W. Bush or Al Gore is the more honest
candidate, but their desire for a president who tells the truth is
growing, an Associated Press poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 voters picked honesty ahead of such traits as caring
about people like them, showing strong leadership, standing up for
beliefs and having a vision. In a November AP poll, one-third
picked honesty, which ranked first then as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky affair and the long Clinton impeachment
process sent the message to voters that ''you can't believe what
politicians are saying,'' said political scientist Merle Black of
Emory University in Atlanta. ''Now they want someone to tell it
like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa.,
about a third picked Bush as most honest and a third picked Gore.
Another third said neither candidate or they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier poll, taken before the presidential primaries, did
not ask people to compare the candidates on honesty. In the latest
poll, black voters put the most emphasis on a candidate who cares
about people like them, but honesty ranked second.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, voters placed
honesty near the top of the list of most important characteristics
along with leadership abilities and the candidate's stand on
issues. But in the new poll, honesty, at 39 percent, was far in
front. Second was caring about people like you, at 17 percent, and
then leadership at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When registered voters in the new poll talked about the
candidates, their comments quickly turned to who they did or did
not trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Bush's character, his demeanor, his father,'' said
Harry Auel, 49 and a salesman from Batavia, Ohio, who said he
''leans Republican.'' ''Gore's been a little bit tainted by Clinton
as far as I can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Lausch, a 28-year-old daycare provider and mother of
three, said Gore is more honest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't trust Bush, with his dad being the president before,''
said Lausch, a Democrat from Colorado Springs, Colo. ''I didn't
like his dad, didn't trust him either, his background was CIA.
There are a lot of secrets there.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed the overall race close, 40 percent for Bush and
39 percent for Gore, among registered voters. The telephone poll of
798 registered voters was taken June 21-25. It has an error margin
of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent polls of registered voters have shown the race
close, too, but polls that measured only likely voters have given
Bush an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, was favored on strong
leadership skills, 49 percent to 32 percent, and as a candidate who
stands up for what he believes, 44 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic vice president, was seen by more voters as
caring about people like them, 44 percent to 34 percent, and as a
candidate with a vision for the future, 46 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel Bush has good leadership qualities,'' said Kimberly
Jamison, a middle-school teacher who is registered Democratic for
local politics but leans Republican in national races. ''Bush seems
to be able to handle the press well, he doesn't seem to be goaded
into answering something too quickly. I like somebody who thinks
through their decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Klein, a 51-year-old commercial-building painter from
Minneapolis, said he doesn't want another Bush in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had enough of the Bushes with his dad,'' said Klein, who
leans Democratic. ''I about starved to death under the trickle-down
theories. For the first time in how many years, the little guy has
some money in his pocket.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Ruling Party Wounds Go Deep  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Losing the presidency for the first time in
its 71-year history was a painful blow to Mexico's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   But the wounds inflicted on the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, in Sunday's national and local elections ran much
deeper. Voters also stripped the party of its majority in the
Senate and ensured that it would no longer be the largest political
force in the House.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the vote counted late Monday, the opposition
National Action Party of President-Elect Vicente Fox had 38.3
percent of the Senate vote to the PRI's 36.3, and it had 38.4
percent of the House to the PRI's 36.6.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing control over the Senate is basically the end of the
PRI,'' said Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, director of the Mexico
Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to confirming important Cabinet positions nominated
by the president, the Senate is responsible for approving reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they've lost it really is going to enable the
opposition to push through reforms that will open up the political
process forever,'' Peschard-Sverdrup said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections also saw the PRI lose control of Ecatepec,
Mexico's third-largest city with 1.6 million residents, stripping
the party of control in any of the country's 12 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, the world's longest-governing party, has dominated
nearly all aspects of Mexican society, becoming a force that many
equated with Mexico's national identity. The PRI's colors are
identical to those of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that dominance has been slowly eroded. Over the past decade,
opposition parties have won governorships and the Mexico City
mayor's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the unexpected and unthinkable loss of ruling-party
presidential candidate Francisco Labastida, the PRI had been having
discussions about dissolving and reinventing itself,
Peschard-Sverdrup said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's inability to convince voters that the ''New PRI''
could be a force for change -- combined with the party's
overwhelming losses at the state and local levels around the
country -- have probably sped up that process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to make the discussion resonate much louder
within the walls of the PRI,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll on 2000 Presidential Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Associated Press poll on the 2000 presidential
campaign is
based on telephone interviews with 798 randomly selected registered
voters from all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews
were conducted June 21-25 by ICR of Media, Pa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The results were weighted to represent the population by
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education.
</P>
<P>
   No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the
sample cause the results to vary by more than 4 percentage points
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were
polled.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of sampling error is larger for responses of
subgroups, such as income categories or those in political parties.
There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the
wording and order of questions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Revolutionary War Veteran Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- One hundred sixty-two years after his
death -- although not quite in time for Independence Day -- a
Revolutionary War corporal is getting a veteran's headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Through a quirk of fate and the efforts of the Daughters of the
American Revolution and the state Department of Veterans Affairs,
Theophilus Howard will soon have a new gravestone indicating he
served honorably in the war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1773, Howard participated in the Boston Tea Party, a protest
of the British tax on tea imported to the Colonies. And beginning
in 1775, Howard spent six months as a private in Cambridge, Mass.,
during the British occupation of Boston. He died May 23, 1838.
</P>
<P>
   The new headstone was arranged when Don Howard, one of
Theophilus' direct descendants, met New York DAR member Peggy Power
Gifford by chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''He began telling me about his ancestor who was in the
Revolutionary War and took part in the Boston Tea Party,'' Gifford
said. ''I couldn't believe it when he said the man was buried in
Stamford.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard told Gifford the grave didn't indicate that Theophilus
was a veteran. Gifford offered to submit the application to
properly mark Theophilus' grave.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days, a veteran's marker will be placed at Theophilus'
grave in Stamford, about 45 miles southwest of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Gore Targets Prescription Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Courting Hispanics in a critical election-year
state, Vice President Al Gore said his plan to boost prescription
drug coverage under Medicare is needed most by Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Latinos are the most uninsured and underinsured population in
America,'' the likely Democratic presidential nominee said Monday,
adding that they have the most to gain from his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the number of Hispanics eligible for Medicare will
triple over the next 25 years and that nearly a third of those in
the program have poverty-level incomes. Hispanics also are more
than twice as likely to lack supplemental insurance coverage for
prescription medicines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will not come without a fight,'' Gore told thousands of
activists Monday at the annual convention of the National Council
of La Raza. ''I am committed to a real prescription drug benefit
for all Hispanics that rely on Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he sought to tie Republican presidential rival
George W. Bush to unpopular pharmaceutical companies that many
blame for high drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to take on the big drug companies,'' Gore said. ''I
know they are supporting the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal would provide a prescription drug benefit under
the Medicare program, with the government paying half of the annual
costs up to $5,000. Aides said it would extend coverage to 40
million people at a cost of $255 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said Bush has been
consistent in proposing to allocate $5 trillion over five years to
both save and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and also
provide prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore first headed Monday to St. Louis to meet with seniors and
tout his prescription drug plan, as well as to bash a proposal by
congressional Republicans that has Bush's support.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, which relies on insurance companies to provide
coverage instead of the government, is useless, said Gore. He
accused Republicans of allowing insurance interests to write the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they crafted the actual words,'' he said. ''It was
designed to make it appear they have a plan. They do not have a
plan. Its only purpose is to serve as an illusion or camouflage.
It's a fraud. Let's call it what it is, it is a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore blamed soaring drug costs on ''price gouging'' by drug
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have fought this battle for more than two decades now,'' he
said. ''Governor Bush is supported by the companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign retorted that Gore has had eight years to devise
a prescription drug program but is doing so only as the
presidential campaign unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore met with seniors as he opened his latest swing
focused on the economy, he quickly headed to California to speak to
Hispanic activists. Later in the week, he was meeting with two big
teacher unions, though aides said he would continue to focus on the
prescription drug issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the number one issue for Hispanics, along with
education,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane. He added
that teachers who deal with children daily also are receptive to
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left no stone unturned in courting members of the Hispanic
advocacy group on his 80th trip to California since becoming vice
president in 1993. California is the biggest prize in the
presidential contest, holding 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed
to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also prowled the cavernous hall for an hour taking
questions on a range of issues, touted differences with Bush on
affirmative action and hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   He also echoed a promise from Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Cabinet will look like America,'' Gore said. ''It will
embody the diversity of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's marathon campaign day, which began in Washington early
Monday, was ending there at dawn Tuesday after an all-night flight.
He was spending the Fourth of July away from the trail, marking the
first birthday of his grandson, Wyatt.

<HEADLINE> Some Students Return to Romania  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Having earned a doctorate in political
science from New York University, Catalin Cretu is looking for a
job -- not in the United States but back home in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case in a country still struggling
to overcome the economic crisis left by the collapse of communism
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, almost 400,000 Romanians have left this
country for greater opportunities in the United States or
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of the best-educated are deciding to return home,
lured by job prospects or the chance to participate in transforming
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Romania, James Rosapepe, has started a
plan to encourage Romanians enrolled at American universities to
return home after completing their studies. The U.S. Agency for
International Development has awarded a grant to the International
Research and Exchanges Board to aid the project.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some 300 students attended a symposium dedicated to
young Romanians who have studied abroad. Of the 3,000 Romanians who
study abroad, 2,200 are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered in a room at the 17th-century Cotroceni presidential
palace, some of the young Romanians said they hoped they could help
change the old, communist-era mentality in their homeland, drawing
on experience gained from studying at Western universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to work in national security and in making defense
policy,'' said Cretu, 33. ''And this is the only place I can do it.
There are great opportunities here that I would not have outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his patriotism and enthusiasm, Cretu admits he's
worried about finding housing and earning a decent wage -- problems
that have driven away many talented Romanians. The average monthly
salary in Romania is $94.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hopes to get a research grant.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day symposium, to be followed by a job fair, was hosted
by President Emil Constantinescu, who was rector of Bucharest
University before he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brain drain is a reality,'' Constantinescu said. ''But we
must not exaggerate it. Rather we must talk about the free
circulation of (Romania's) elite, which brings us closer to the
West.'' Constantinescu's son, Dragos, studied in Belgium in the
1990s before returning to set up a children's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Pralong lived in Switzerland and the United States before
returning to Romania twice -- once in 1990 to run the local office
of a private foundation and again in 1999 to join Constantinescu's
staff as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel I am helping to build the state,'' said Pralong, who
studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University in Boston. ''I bring with me a different way to approach
and solve problems, a different vision on how the world works.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Govt. Sworn in During Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed clashes broke out between the military
and hostage takers Tuesday hours after an all-Fijian temporary
government was sworn in in defiance of the gunmen holding 27
members of the ousted, Indian-led government at gunpoint in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire broke out after a news conference by rebel leader
George Speight, who said he did not expect the new government to
rule for long. Rebels and witnesses said five people were injured,
including four taken to a Suva hospital with gunshot wounds to the
leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a little war,'' rebel spokesman Jo Nata said. ''One
of our people was shot at, a dogfight ensued.''
</P>
<P>
   Nata also confirmed reports that Speight supporters in Labasa on
the island of Vanua Levu confiscated weapons from a military
barracks. ''Our people ... have control there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini blamed the
rebels for opening fire first, saying they shot at an army patrol
as it passed close to parliament. Tarakinikini said the situation
had calmed down by late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some Speight supporters also attacked a photographer for the
Fiji Times newspaper, accusing him of feeding information from the
compound to police. The attackers were pulled off by other Speight
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, banking executive Laisenia Qarase became prime minister
in an appointment that provoked the anger of the hostage takers who
had demanded a role in naming any new government.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech after being sworn in, Qarase said he accepted the
job as prime minister as a ''call for national unity.'' He urged
the gunmen to release the hostages immediately so Fiji can begin
rebuilding its shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase said his government will give priority to protecting
indigenous Fijian rights, but that ''no communities will be
excluded ... in our multiracial and multicultural society.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All communities have a cherished and valued place in our
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in traditional Sulu skirts, 19 indigenous Fijian men
swore to ''be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of
the Fijian Islands'' during a ceremony Tuesday at military
headquarters in the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony could not be held at parliament because that is
where rebels led by Speight, a former insurance executive, have
been holding the ousted government hostage for more than six weeks
in what they call a battle for indigenous Fijian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the hostage takers, the country's military leader on
Monday named the temporary civilian government but said he will
retain power until the captives are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama -- who assumed power 10 days after
rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government hostage
-- appointed the interim leaders without input from the gunmen, who
had demanded a role.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Monday the army may pay a high price for
''completely ignoring'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very big possibility of making a lot of people
really upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no members of the Indian minority are in the new
government. ''We approached two very well-qualified members of the
Indian community, but they declined,'' Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
   After Speight's raid on parliament, the army gave in to most of
his demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indians, including
firing Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- a hostage and the first
Fijian of Indian ancestry to lead the country. The army also threw
out the 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers for rich sugar cane
fields. Today, they make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population,
while indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians were angered by Chaudhry's refusal to raise rents
charged to Indian sugar cane farmers on land communally owned by
indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said he will remain head of state until all the
hostages are safely released, the gunmen turn over their weapons,
and public order is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the interim government will rule for 18 months
and set guidelines for a new constitution. The old one ''will not
be reinstated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new government should work for Fiji's poor indigenous
majority, and for ''the protection of the rights of Indians and
other communities that are an integral part of our nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has cordoned off the parliamentary compound where
the hostages are being held, and army spokesman Lt. Alipate
Mataitini said the military will tighten its cordon.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the hostage crisis has cost Fiji 5,000 jobs,
$96 million in lost exports, $96 million in lost revenues and
untold losses in talent by people who have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase, the new prime minister, is known more as a manager than
a politician. He has been head of the Merchant Bank Fiji and is a
former director of the Fiji Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has spoken positively of him, but Qarase was not his
first choice for prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Players Help Rescue Man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Florida outfielder Mark Smith pulled a man from a
smoke-filled car on Sunday, hours after hitting two homers in the
Marlins' 2-1 victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Marlins pitcher Brad Penny were driving from Fort
Lauderdale Airport following their flight from Montreal on Sunday
night when they saw a car swerve off the highway, over a median and
onto a grassy knoll.
</P>
<P>
   The players got off at the next exit and returned to the scene
of the accident where other passersby had already stopped to help
one of the passengers get out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The car was smoking under the hood and in the window, when I
saw a guy trying to kick out the back window,'' said Smith, who
homered twice for the first time in his career earlier in the day.
''I did hesitate at first. I was scared to death. Then I was, 'Yes,
go, go go!'''
</P>
<P>
   The man was draped through the glass so Smith, who is 6-foot-3
and 235 pounds, reached in and yanked the man out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the car exploded and fire crews arrived to
put out the flames. Smith and Penny were reassured that no other
people were in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball is a game. This is life and you can't compare the
two,'' Smith said Monday night. ''That's someone's son, brother or
husband and I'd hope that someone would do the same for me if I was
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 30, is batting .286 with four homers and 14 RBIs as a
reserve for the Marlins. Penny, 22, is 4-7 with a 4.81 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Puts Holzemer on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies placed left-handed
reliever Mark Holzemer on the 15-day disabled list prior to their
5-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Holzemer strained his left hamstring on Saturday just three
pitches into an appearance against Pittsburgh. He was recalled from
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on June 2 and is 0-0 with a 2.38 ERA
in 15 appearances with the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia recalled left-hander Ed Vosberg from
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to replace Holzemer. Vosberg, who was
acquired from Colorado on Thursday for a player to be named, joined
the team in Milwaukee but didn't pitch on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Vosberg on the Phillies' 40-man roster, Mike
Jackson was moved from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL.
Jackson, who signed a $3 million, one-year contract with
Philadelphia in the offseason but hasn't thrown a pitch for the
team yet, is out for the season after shoulder surgery on May 26.

<HEADLINE> Report: Hill To Sign With Orlando  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Forward Grant Hill, who spent the first six
years of his career in Detroit, is preparing to tell the Pistons
later this week that he will join the Orlando Magic, The Orlando
Sentinel reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a free agent, bypassed his flight home to Detroit on
Monday so he and his wife could continue house-hunting in Central
Florida, giving indications that he will sign a long-term contract
next month with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Although NBA rules prohibit free agents from signing contracts
until Aug. 1, two league sources told the Sentinel that Hill is
preparing to let the Pistons know he will join the Magic next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando general manager John Gabriel said he knows nothing of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday night outside his resort-area hotel, Hill only
said that he and his wife, Tamia, had an enjoyable time in Orlando.
They are expected to leave Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hot. I can tell you that -- very hot,'' Hill said before
getting into a limousine to go to dinner. ''But I don't have much
else I can say. I'd like to keep it to myself for now. Hope you
understand. We'll talk about it later.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is expected to meet with Pistons officials later this week
before announcing his decision to join the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic are offering Hill and free agent forward Tim Duncan
six-year deals worth $67.5 million, the most allowed under the
collective bargaining agreement. They can get seven-year, $86.5
million contracts if the Magic and their current teams agree to
sign-and-trade proposals.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, the Magic cleared an estimated $20 million
of salary-cap space, enabling them to offer the maximum first-year
salary of $9 million to two star players.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic entertained both players throughout the weekend.
Duncan left Monday morning without commenting to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic are hoping Hill can sway Duncan into signing with
Orlando, which could radically alter the balance of power in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is expected to sign, regardless of what Duncan decides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they both enjoyed themselves here,'' Gabriel said.
''They are two individuals who will make their decision on their
own. It's hard for us to speculate on what helps a person make a
decision.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 14, Royals 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Paul Konerko and Chris Singleton each
had two hits in an eight-run fifth inning Monday night as the
Chicago White Sox overcame a six-run deficit to beat the the Kansas
City Royals 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago became the first major league team to win 12 straight
road games since Detroit opened the 1984 season 17-0 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Jorge Fabregas was 2-for-3 with a grand slam and a
career-high six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham of the White Sox was 4-for-6 with two RBIs, two
steals and three runs. Frank Thomas was 3-for-4 with a home run, a
double, two walks and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had a season-high 22 hits, including at least one by
each starter. Every starter scored at least one run.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Pena (2-1), the third of six White Sox pitchers, won with
1 1-3 hitless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 9-3 against Jay Witasick, Chicago loaded the bases in
the fifth on a leadoff walk by Magglio Ordonez and singles by
Konerko and Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee had an RBI single and Herbert Perry reached when his
grounder got passed third baseman Joe Randa for an error that
allowed two runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (6-3) relieved Witasick, who gave up eight runs --
seven earned -- and 10 hits in four-plus innings -- and RBI singles
by Brook Fordyce and Durham pulled Chicago within a run.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin reached on bunt single that loaded the bases,
Frank Thomas forced in the go-ahead run with a walk and, after
Ordonez lined out to center, Konerko singled for an 11-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Laxton relieved and allowed a single to Singleton that
reloaded the bases, but Lee grounded into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a two-run homer in the first, but the Royals took a
4-2 lead in the second on Fabregas' two-run, two-out double and RBI
singles by Rey Sanchez and Johnny Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's RBI single in the third pulled Chicago within a run, but
the Royals made it 8-3 in the fourth when Kevin Bierne relieved Cal
Eldred with the bases loaded and Fabregas hit his first career
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred gave up eight runs and six hits in 2 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's homer in the bottom of the fifth pulled the Royals to
11-10, but the White Sox added three in the sixth on Durham's RBI
double and Ordonez's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kansas City CF Carlos Beltran left in the fifth with
soreness in his right knee. ... Thomas' leadoff double in the third
inning was his 336th, moving him past Nellie Fox into second on the
Chicago career list behind Luke Appling, who had 440. His three
RBIs moved him to within six of Appling, who holds the club record
with 1,116. ... Fabregas' slam was the second of the season for
Kansas City. Jermaine Dye connected against Tampa Bay's Ryan Rupe
on April 26.

<HEADLINE> United States 1, Brazil 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- If World Cup hero Briana Scurry wants her
starting job back, she's going to have to take it from Siri
Mullinix.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix, supposedly a fill-in while Scurry sat out with shin
splints, got her 10th shutout of the year Monday night as the U.S.
women's team beat Brazil 1-0 in the championship game of the Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, coach April Heinrichs confirmed Mullinix as her No. 1
goalkeeper in the buildup to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a difficult decision,'' Heinrichs said.
''You watch what's happening in front of you and you see Siri
Mullinix is playing on the cutting edge of international women's
soccer. ... The difficult decision is if Bri comes back and she's
still playing at the level she was playing at a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, stellar in last year's victorious World Cup, has played
just 45 minutes this year because of her injury. She is working to
get back in shape and will rejoin the team later this month for a
tournament in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not talking about two months. You're talking about 12
months away from the international scene,'' Heinrichs said.
''That's a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates chanted Mullinix's name as she was named the top
goalkeeper of the Gold Cup. She made five saves against Brazil,
including a rolling kick save against Cidinha on a short breakaway
in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix, a product of the University of North Carolina soccer
machine, has allowed just three goals -- two on penalty kicks -- in
14 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I've had to play three big games in a
row,'' Mullinix said. ''The first wonder is, 'Can I play at this
level?' I felt I accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett scored in the 44th minute, and the United
States again played with three forwards as Heinrichs continues to
experiment with different styles and lineups.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nearly everything has worked. The U.S. team has won five
tournaments this year: the Australia Cup in January, the Algarve
Cup in Portugal in March, the U.S. Women's Cup in May and the
Pacific Cup in Australia last month and now the Gold Cup. The team
is 17-3-3 this year and is unbeaten in 42 games (41-0-1) in
tournament play on home soil since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning is the icing on the cake,'' Heinrichs said. ''The
process, the journey, the growth that we've been able to have
during the course of the games is what's going to take us one step
closer to being the single best team that we can be when it really
matters, at the Olympics. ... We have a confidence against any team
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the United States played to a 0-0 draw at this same
stadium in group play last week. The result tied the two teams at
the top of the standings, and the U.S. team won a coin toss
immediately after the game to decide the seeding for the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rematch, before 20,123 at Foxboro Stadium, was one of
those classic onesided, 1-0 soccer games. Brazil had trouble
getting the ball out of its own end early in the game, and the U.S.
team's deft passing attack kept the pressure on. The Brazilians'
close man-to-man marking and aggressive tackling prevented the
Americans from building a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett's speed and flair made her a dangerous force
throughout. She finally gave the Americans the lead with a classic
one-touch 12-yard shot with her left foot on an assist from Mia
Hamm. It was Milbrett's 76th international goal in 147 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we catch ourselves watching her,'' Hamm said.
''She's so explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly nearly made it 2-0 in first-half injury time when
her close-range header missed wide right. Brazilian goalkeeper
Maravilha, who entered the game at halftime after starter Andreia
injured her leg, made a nice leaping save on Hamm's drive in the
82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   China beat Canada 2-1 in the third-place game.

<HEADLINE> Mason Incited Riot, Police Say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets forward Anthony Mason was
arrested after he was accused of starting a riot and assaulting
police in the city's French Quarter on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 33, of Charlotte, N.C., was arrested at about 10:15 p.m.
EDT after he was sprayed with pepper by officers, police spokesman
Joseph Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of officers noticed two groups of men arguing over women
on Bourbon Street, Narcisse said. When the officers tried to
separate the groups, Mason, who is 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds, hit one
of the officers and began rallying the crowd, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who had been hit tried to subdue Mason with pepper
spray, but with little effect, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers arrived and some in the crowd threw bottles and
shouted racial slurs at police, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason fled and the crowd followed him, while police went to the
8th District station, where they regrouped. They then arrested
Mason and took him to the city's charity hospital to have his face
treated, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   No officers were seriously hurt in the melee, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason will be booked with inciting a riot, battery on police
officers and resisting arrest, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Mason's first brush with the law. He was arrested on
two counts of misdemeanor assault last February after a scuffle
outside a barroom in New York. The charges were later dropped when
prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who has played with New Jersey, Denver and the New York
Knicks, led the Hornets in 1997-98 in field goal shooting
percentage and rebounds for the second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mason has said in NBA promotions that he ''sees a
career in criminal justice after his playing career ends.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners 8, Angels 6  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- John Olerud drove in four runs and Joe
Oliver had a solo homer as the Seattle Mariners built a big early
lead and held off the Anaheim Angels 8-6 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Garret Anderson hit a pair of solo homers, only the
second multihomer game of his career, and an RBI double in the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez singled home a run in the Mariners first to
extend his RBI streak to eight consecutive games and his season
total to 85 RBIs. That's the most in club history before the
All-Star break, one more than Ken Griffey Jr. had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 6-1 in the third, the Angels closed to 7-6
with one run in the fourth, on Anderson's second homer of the game
and 23rd of the season, and a four-run sixth, keyed by Benjie
Molina's two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer (7-3) gave up six runs in 5 2-3 innings, holding
Anaheim to a pair of runs on Anderson's solo shots until the sixth,
when Anderson and Troy Glaus had consecutive run-scoring doubles
and Molina hit his ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had a sacrifice fly as Seattle went up 2-0 in the first,
then doubled with the bases loaded to drive in three more runs for
a 5-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are only 3-3 in their last six games, the Mariners
have won 18 of their last 23 and, at 48-32, have the best record
through 80 games in their club history.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill (4-5) had trouble getting the ball over the plate and
was rocked for five runs on four hits and five walks in just 1 2-3
innings.
Notes: The Mariners' best mark through 80 games prior to this year
was 47-33 in 1997. ... The Angels' Darin Erstad, a late scratch
from the starting lineup because of tightness in his lower back,
had a pinch-hit single in the eighth. Erstad, who has missed only
one game this season, has a major league-leading 131 hits. ...
Anderson is 16-for-34 lifetime against Moyer, including three
homers. Anderson's other two-homer game was May 25 of last year
against Baltimore. He's the seventh different Angel to homer twice
in a game this year. ... Glaus' double in the sixth snapped a
0-for-20 slump in which he struck out 13 times. ... Molina's nine
homers match the highest number by an Angels catcher in an entire
season since Lance Parrish had 19 in 1991. Jim Leyritz and Todd
Greene each homered nine times in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fox Election Marks Change in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By ELOY O. AGUILAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- There will be cowboy boots and hats and much
less solemnity in the Los Pinos presidential office when Vicente
Fox becomes Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a rancher and businessman from the state of Guanajuato,
differs much from the traditional ceremonious presidents of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he hates ties and always wears cowboy boots. For
another, he has a sense of humor and an ability to laugh at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Before Fox, Mexican presidents hardly ever laughed in public,
often assumed the imperial attitude their collaborators expected,
were very careful of their language and generally came from
academia or the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is Lyndon B. Johnson without the late president's
congressional experience. Like the school teacher LBJ, Fox comes
from a profession that has not produced presidents. He is a
business administrator and rose to manager of Coca Cola in Mexico
and then joined the family's boot-making business before entering
politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is called stubborn by his opponents and opinion makers -- and
he proudly admits it is a trait that even his mother could not
change.
</P>
<P>
   His language is often the language of the ranch -- rough and
salty. He has even called some of his opponents black snakes and
toads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may stop being vulgar,'' he told his main opponent Francisco
Labastida in a nationally televised debate, ''but you will never
stop being corrupt and lousy administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   After the election he was asked by a reporter whether he would
continue to use his gruff language. ''I am sure something will slip
out once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about wearing boots as president, he answered: ''Until the
day I die.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before he was elected, Fox ''eased tensions'' with a
four-hour horse ride with his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   On election night, as he spoke before thousands of celebrating
followers, he was offered a bottle of champagne to drink. He tasted
it, put it down and said: ''Frankly, I prefer tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   He already did away with the tradition that the first lady is
always the head of the Integral Family Development office that
deals with programs for poor families. Fox is divorced and, for
protocol matters, his daughter Ana Cristina will act as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she would not take the job, Ana Cristina, a law
student, said it should be handled by professional experts.
</P>
<P>
   At work, Fox is described by his collaborators as a man who can
break up tension during long meetings with a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''He creates an easy atmosphere for others to work,'' said
Carlos Salazar, who deals with Fox's international relations. ''He
does not stand on ceremony. He is very relaxed, but also very
focused.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE TOPLITZ, Austria (AP) -- In the cold waters of a pristine
Alpine lake, an American salvage crew is trying to solve some of
the last mysteries of World War II -- what secrets or treasures did
the Nazis hide here in the chaotic, final days of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-June, the crew has been using state-of-the-art sonar
and video equipment to scan the floor of Lake Toplitz to determine
once and for all whether cases of secret documents, gold and
precious stones are still lying more than 300 feet beneath its
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope once we come off (the project) we will be able to say:
This is what's there and this is what's not,'' said Scott Pelley, a
correspondent for CBS News, which financed the project with the
Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The one-mile-long lake lies in the Salzkammergut region in the
heart of Austria, sheltered on three sides by steep limestone faces
and reachable only by a narrow, wooded path. It was used by the
Nazis as a secret marine warfare testing station starting in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with defeat starring them in the face, the
Nazis apparently used the lake to hide evidence of their crimes.
Workmen under SS guard were seen dumping heavy metal cases into the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly what was deposited here. For more than a
half century, however, rumors have spread that the cases included
gold, precious stamp collections, diamonds and other valuables
looted by the Nazis from Jews in occupied Europe during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know the Nazis were hiding treasures in the area, '' said
Albrecht Syen, whose family runs a green-shuttered restaurant, the
only building on the lake. ''So they must be in Lake Toplitz.''
</P>
<P>
   The lake itself has fed the legend of lost treasure. Over the
years, divers have salvaged more than 18 cases stuffed with
documents and counterfeit currency, as well as enormous rusted
mines and parts of rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the lake yielded millions of dollars worth of fake
British pound notes, as well as secret documents detailing the
Nazis official counterfeiting operation aimed at devaluing the
British currency by flooding markets with fake notes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 years later, the Austrian government salvaged more
trunks stuffed with fake British pounds and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   The current operation took shape last year when Pelley and CBS
television producer Bill Owens heard of the legend of Lake Toplitz
from an Israeli colleague. They became intrigued by this unsolved
piece of the World War II puzzle that remains little known in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our purpose here, what led us here, was never the story of
gold dumped into the lake,'' Owens said. ''It was more the history
of World War II dumped into the lake by the SS.''
</P>
<P>
   To do this, they recruited a professional salvage company,
Oceaneering Technologies, to map the floor of the lake using
remotely operated video-sonar machines.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ridge Albaugh, Oceaneering's senior project manager
for the Toplitz search, the operation was hampered by the number of
trees covering the lake floor, making it difficult for the machines
to squeeze beneath the branches to scan the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the team pulls up crates of gold or other valuables, the
only thing they would be allowed to keep are documents. Anything
else must be turned over to the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, neither the Austrians nor the Americans
worry that coming up empty handed will kill the intrigue
surrounding the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to talk about this lake and dream about this
lake no matter what we find,'' said Pelley. ''Its too much fun to
talk about -- it's like the Loch Ness monster.''

	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An attempt to lure supersonic Concorde
jet service to upstate has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 20 well-heeled travelers accepted a St. Louis company
offer of a two-week luxury trip from Rochester to Europe, costing
between $7,000 to $19,000 each.

	   HIGHLAND, N.Y. (AP) - One man was killed and another was
seriously injured after being struck by a freight train in Ulster
County, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Nakia Barreto, 20, was killed in the accident, according to Town
of Lloyd police. Dennis Hartung, 19, remained in critical condition
at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Naval Academy Rape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Two Naval Academy football players accused
of raping a female midshipman admitted having sex with her after
she passed out from drinking, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cordrea Brittingham and Arion Keith Williams each was charged
with second-degree rape, a felony punishable by up to 30 years in
prison. They were held on $250,000 bond each.
</P>
<P>
   Brittingham and Williams, both 21, also were charged with
second-degree sex offense, a nonconsensual sex act punishable by up
to 20 years in prison. Williams also was charged with third-degree
sex offense, punishable by up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested Monday and held on $250,000 bond each,
police spokesman Tom O'Connor said. They declined to comment as
they awaited processing.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged assault occurred late Thursday or early Friday at an
off-campus party in Arnold, across the Severn River from the
academy, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair admitted having sex with the 20-year-old woman after
she was ''passed out'' and ''unconscious'' from drinking heavily
with a dozen others, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The female midshipman told police that she went to a bedroom in
the home to lie down after becoming intoxicated and was awakened by
two men who were sexually assaulting her. The two fled the room
after she pushed them away, according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Academy spokesman Cmdr. Mike Brady would not comment beyond
reading a statement saying two midshipmen had been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Navy football coach Charlie Weatherbie, who has described the
two as key players for his team this year, said he hoped to speak
to them later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll let the criminal justice system work, and we'll take
appropriate action after that point,'' Weatherbie said.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Academy has been rocked in recent years by a series of
scandals involving drug use, car thefts and sexual assaults on
female midshipmen. Several midshipmen have been expelled for sexual
misconduct or fraternization.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Blood Simple'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who never caught the Coen brothers' feature-film debut
in theaters, here's your big-screen chance to see the tense,
stylish thriller ''Blood Simple.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who caught it on video, the reissue of a new cut of
this sardonic ode to film noir offers the chance to see it as it
should be seen, in a dark movie house surrounded by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of ''Blood Simple'' runs counter to the typical
''director's cut.'' Rather than adding footage, Joel and Ethan Coen
hacked out what they call ''some of the boring parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coens also note that the film was transferred poorly for
video release, and they were unable to license some of the music
used in the theatrical version for home video.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the first time a wider audience can see the authentic
rookie effort by the brothers who brought you ''Fargo'' and
''Raising Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   The reissue opens with a humorous introduction that pokes fun at
the film restoration process and ''legacy'' of ''Blood Simple''
opening to universal acclaim and shattering box-office records.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ''Blood Simple'' does have something of a real legacy.
Though it performed modestly at the box office, the movie was a
memorable entry at film festivals and a favorite among critics. It
also heartened independent filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shot on a shoestring budget, ''Blood Simple'' became a launching
pad for the Coen brothers to reach wider audiences on subsequent
movies without compromising their singularly creepy and cryptic
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins as a bizarre love triangle between a bartender
named Ray (John Getz), his lover, Abby (Frances McDormand, wife of
Joel Coen), and her jealous husband, Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns
the roughneck Texas saloon where Ray works.
</P>
<P>
   Marty hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to
kill Abby and Ray. This simple plan becomes a tangle of
misdirection and misunderstanding as Visser, the slimiest and
sweatiest of villains, concocts his own diabolical
murder-for-profit scheme.
</P>
<P>
   One of the delights of the film is the shifting loyalties it
engenders in audiences. None of the characters are quite the sort
you'd like to sit down with over a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Abby is the most sympathetic, a woman who pays dearly for her
adultery but finds the pluck to deal with Visser in a dark,
knuckle-biting showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ray begins as a nice guy, but in an act of misplaced devotion to
Abby, he falls into complicity to the violence engineered by
Visser.
</P>
<P>
   Even Marty, who approaches Visser's sleaziness factor early on,
elicits some empathy as a cuckold undone by his own vengeful plot.
</P>
<P>
   Only Visser, a dirtbag you love to hate, is consistently vile
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The Coens take their usual slots, Joel directing, Ethan
producing, the brothers sharing the screenplay credit. They
compensate for their low budget with simple but startling images:
dusty beams of light shooting into a dark room through bullet holes
in a wall; a body in a shallow grave raising a gun at the shoveler
about to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blood Simple'' owes a lot to Alfred Hitchcock, wringing
suspense out of understatement and unusual encounters among
characters at cross purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The reissue of their debut also makes for a nice bookend to the
Coens' next film, ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' -- starring George
Clooney, John Turturro and Holly Hunter and due in theaters this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The new cut of ''Blood Simple,'' distributed by USA Films, runs
97 minutes and is rated R for violence and language.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Disney's The Kid'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Willis may grow tired of being upstaged by children.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment ran off with the show in last year's ''The
Sixth Sense,'' and this time, 8-year-old chubby cherub Spencer
Breslin steals what little thunder there is to rumble about in
Willis' latest, ''Disney's The Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   This one's so thickly and sickly sweet, Willis probably should
have borrowed from his ''Sixth Sense'' persona and played dead
rather than sign on.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is promising: On the cusp of his 40th birthday, an
overbearing loner of an image consultant named Russ Duritz (Willis)
magically meets his embarrassing 8-year-old self, Rusty (Breslin).
</P>
<P>
   Rusty is a starry-eyed, nose-picking geek whom the hard-edged
Russ has worked a lifetime to exorcise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've forgotten my childhood,'' Russ pronounces. ''My childhood
is in the past, where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Russ' childhood doesn't remain in the past. While
his adult self sets out to toughen up the dweebish Rusty, it's the
boy who becomes mentor to the man. Rusty offers observations about
what's lacking in his older self's world, the things Russ craved as
a child: no dog, no wife, no family, no pilot's license and
airplane. Mainly, no life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grow up to be a loser!'' Rusty exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of crowd-pleasing humor in ''The Kid,'' mainly
from Breslin and Lily Tomlin, who plays Russ' sarcastic but loyal
office assistant. The movie could have used more screen time with
the acerbic Tomlin, and Breslin runs circles around Willis with his
winsome, whiny delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Willis' smirking, comic smarminess is ineffective here, lacking
the breeziness of his ''Moonlighting'' days on television. Director
Jon Turteltaub strives so hard early on to paint Russ as a cad in
need of a makeover that Willis becomes downright unlikable at
times.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Smart makes a fine showing as an engaging TV anchorwoman
who has a couple of brief but insightful meetings with Russ. As the
nominal love interest, though, Emily Mortimer is relegated to an
impossible struggle, making an audience accept that a pert, pretty,
sensible woman could be inexplicably enamored of nasty Russ.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing idea of ''The Kid'' is squandered with a
simpleminded story line that never meaningfully scratches the
surface of questions most people ask themselves: Is this all I am?
What happened to my childhood dreams? What if I had a second
chance?
</P>
<P>
   The movie goes for gut laughs while feeding sugar water to the
heart and Sweet 'N Low to the head.
</P>
<P>
   In an encounter with Rusty's idealized vision of his adult self,
there's an unsatisfying explanation of the magic that threw big kid
and little kid together.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the movie's most notable flaws is Marc Shaiman's
relentless, obtrusive score, which violates a cardinal rule of
movie composing: If they're conscious of the music, it's
distracting them from the film.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its many laughs, ''The Kid'' proves as forgettable as
the little-boy dreams that Willis forgot to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney's The Kid'' is rated PG for mild language and runs 104
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Navy's new destroyer is both throwback and radical step forward  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - In appearance, it hearkens back to the USS
Monitor - the ironclad ''cheesebox on a raft'' of the Civil War -
but in every major respect the Navy's newest class of destroyer
represents a revolution in modern warship design.
</P>
<P>
   So radically different is the ship that the choice of its
namesake, Admiral Elmo M. Zumwalt, is almost poetic. Zumwalt, chief
of naval operations in the Vietnam war, was known for bucking naval
tradition and taking an unconventional approach to command.
</P>
<P>
   The new warship, called the ''land attack destroyer,'' was
announced by President Clinton on Tuesday during Operation Sail
2000, the Fourth of July ''tall ships'' festival and International
Naval Review in New York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for it to be built at a cost less than today's ships,
be operated by a crew one-third the size and fire shells with
extreme accuracy three times as far as current U.S. naval guns.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, General Dynamics and Litton Industries, are in a
Navy-sponsored competition to design and build 32 of the ships,
with the first three to be delivered in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy calls the Zumwalt-class destroyer, also known as DD-21,
the ''first surface combatant founded entirely upon post-Cold war
thinking,'' with two basic roles - to support forces on shore and
to hit targets far inland.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig
said it would be the first ship designed ''with the ability to
influence events on land.'' It extends the idea behind using
sea-fired Tomahawk cruise missiles against land targets in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that as U.S. interests abroad have strengthened
in a global world, where we have citizens everywhere, where we have
economic interests everywhere, where we care about the evolution of
democracy and human rights around the world, then frequently we
want to use military power to protect those interests, and the most
obvious choice is naval power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' renderings of the Zumwalt show a low, flat, sharply
pointed hull with a pyramid-shaped superstructure near the stern.
The deck is empty but for two guns and a missile launcher. The low
silhouette and absence of clutter appear part of a radar-thwarting
''stealth'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's main features are unprecedented - an all-electric
propulsion system, two 155-millimeter guns that can hit a tennis
court 60 miles away with a 250-pound shell, and operating systems
that cut crew size by more than two thirds, from 320 on a
conventional destroyer to about 95.
</P>
<P>
   The range of the satellite-guided shells is nearly three times
that of past U.S. naval weapons, 16-inch battleship guns that fired
a Volkswagen-sized shell 23 miles. Danzig said the two
155-millimeter guns would be able to support a land force with
power equal to a Marine Corps artillery battery of six guns for 15
days.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller crew will allow each sailor to have stateroom-type
living quarters instead shared, cramped quarters. ''More
importantly, it will reduce the number of people put at risk,''
Danzig said. ''That's a big achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   That directly reflects the Zumwalt philosophy of ''taking care
of his sailors,'' Danzig said, noting the admiral had rankled Navy
traditionalists with his avowed concern for sailors' living
conditions when he was chief of operations in 1970-74.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for the announcement ceremony aboard the
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, Zumwalt's son James, a
retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, said the honor would be
welcomed by his late father.
</P>
<P>
   ''He committed himself to improving life for those who served
under him (and)... to improving opportunities for minorities who
had long suffered under the inequalities inherent in the Navy
system,'' James Zumwalt said. ''It was no coincidence he shared a
common name with the patron saint of sailors, St. Elmo.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said standard gas turbine engines would power the ship's
''electric drive'' system, greatly reducing the amount of machinery
needed and saving valuable interior space. ''It's potentially as
significant as moving from sail to steam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy estimates each Zumwalt-class ship will cost $750
million in 1996 dollars, fairly cheap compared to the
billion-dollar Aegis-type craft that are the backbone of today's
surface combat fleet. Danzig said the new destroyer also would
operate at one-third the cost, ultimately saving $1 billion in
''total ownership costs'' per ship.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Stigma Lingrers in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) -- Vusi Thiwane never told his family
he was infected with the AIDS virus. They just guessed.
</P>
<P>
   His twin brother, Allen, moved out of their bedroom to sleep on
a couch in the dining room. His family warned neighbors to stay
away from him. His childhood friends seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   He is petrified of what will happen if he confirms their guess.
''Maybe they will kick me out of the house,'' said Thiwane, 37.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has become what leprosy was to
medieval Europe. In an effort to dispel the myths and prejudices
surrounding the disease, experts from around the world will gather
Sunday in Durban at the 13th Annual International AIDS Conference,
whose theme is ''Break the Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those infected are shunned by their families and fired
from their jobs. Their neighbors taunt them. Some are denied
medical treatment -- after all, they are going to die anyway, some
say -- and those who are hospitalized are often neglected by nurses,
who gossip about their illness with other patients.
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane has trained himself to ignore the insults.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I think about it, it makes me suffer more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, where HIV or AIDS infects an estimated 4.2
million people, 10 percent of the population, the country is
staring at a major economic crisis and health-care disaster as the
mostly working age victims begin dying in massive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been working to stop the spread of the
disease with an aggressive public information campaign aimed at
persuading people to wear condoms or abstain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the message is one that many on this conservative continent
would rather not discuss, said Charlotte Mohapi, project assistant
at the AIDS Care and Counseling Trust, at Chris Hani-Baragwanath
Hospital in Soweto.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you talk about HIV/AIDS, you are automatically talking
about sex. You are automatically talking about premarital sex. It
is a chain of so many issues ... which we have never been exposed
to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With huge waves of people around the country dying of AIDS,
though, the stigma is no longer about just sex, but also the fear
of death itself, said Zackie Achmat, chairman of the AIDS Treatment
Action Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention campaigns that try to scare people out of their
high-risk behavior feed into the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emphasis that HIV is a death sentence, and prevention is
the only cure has amplified the stigma,'' especially among
uneducated people in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane, however, lives in Soweto, a township just south of
Johannesburg. He was effectively outed after he spent seven months
in the hospital with tuberculosis last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get sick, they just assume you have AIDS,'' he said.
''If you are admitted to the hospital, you have AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane remembers the compassion and care his community
dutifully gave to sick relatives when he was growing up. Since the
arrival of AIDS, people stopped caring.
</P>
<P>
   During his months in the hospital, they visited only a handful
of times. Since he's gotten out, they have shunned him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is because of the disease, because no one likes it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists talk of infected people being beaten. They talk
of children whose parents have the disease being ostracized at
school -- in some cases by teachers and administrators. They talk of
cabdrivers refusing to stop for people wearing AIDS-awareness
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   This environment is a tremendous improvement, though, Mohapi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not nearly as negative as what happened to Gugu
Dlamini,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dlamini publicly revealed she had HIV in November 1998. Three
weeks later, she was beaten to death in a town near the
KwaZulu-Natal city of Durban, the site of Sunday's conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nomavo Goci, 33, says she does not fear being killed if she
reveals her infection. But she does worry about being humiliated
and ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One family, which has the only telephone in her community,
guessed she was infected after her boyfriend was hospitalized.
She's not allowed to use the phone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Goci and Thiwane said they were unafraid to reveal their
status to a reporter, it was only among their neighbors and
families that they hide their disease.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the problem, many AIDS activists say. The
stigma perpetuates itself because so few people are willing to
declare they have HIV/AIDS and become examples for their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to come from the person saying, 'I want to do this, I
want to tell my community,' and then the community will become more
receptive,'' said Mohapi, who declined to reveal her own HIV status
to a reporter for fear it would obscure the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country with few resources dedicated to helping those
with AIDS, why should people declare their status?
</P>
<P>
   ''What are the benefits of being open, if you are not going to
get treatment or any support?'' Achmat asked.

<HEADLINE> Defense Choices Left to New President  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The closer President Clinton gets to deciding
whether to start building a nationwide shield against missiles, the
clearer it seems that the most important choices will be left to
his successor.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this year, the Pentagon has been gearing up for a
missile intercept test -- scheduled for late Friday -- that many
believed would determine whether Clinton gave the green light to
deploy an anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it seems that Clinton's choice is more modest:
whether to authorize the Pentagon to take the first step toward
constructing a new radar for missile tracking, not whether to
irreversibly commit the nation to missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton gives the go-ahead to build the radar, the work
will not begin until after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever Clinton does, it will not rule in or rule out a
national missile defense system,'' said Joseph Cirincione of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who is a leading critic
of missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said last week he had not made a final decision but
expected to reach a position in the next several weeks. He will
take into account the nature of the missile threat, the feasibility
of missile defense technology, its cost and the implications for
relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee, favors
Clinton's approach of pursuing a limited defensive system that
would protect only the 50 U.S. states. His expected GOP rival,
George W. Bush, supports a broader, more ambitious system designed
protect the United States as well as its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's test may not be the decisive event it once appeared to
be. Still, the outcome is important because Congress has made it
the law that a national missile defense be built as soon as
technically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be called feasible if the test fails? Even if it
succeeds, does that make it feasible?
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has conducted two previous intercept tests; one
succeeded, one failed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most hotly debated aspects of the Pentagon's missile
defense project is the feasibility issue. Critics say the flight
tests are simply too unrealistic to render a judgment on whether
the anti-missile system would be a reliable means of defense
against an actual attack by North Korea or another nation.
</P>
<P>
   These critics argue that the Pentagon's approach does not take
account of potential ''countermeasures'' -- decoys and other means
an attacking nation could use to confuse a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any nation that can build an intercontinental ballistic
missile can construct countermeasures that could easily defeat
it,'' Richard Garwin, a defense expert with the Council on Foreign
Relations, wrote in a recent critique of the Clinton
administration's approach, which he called a threat to arms control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That issue may be given added political punch when the CIA
completes a secret evaluation, probably this month, that is
expected to point out the likelihood of Russian and Chinese decoy
technologies finding their way into the hands of North Korea, Iran
or other countries that are developing long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's technology chief, said recently
there is no doubt any missile defense that is deployed will have to
be improved over time as more sophisticated decoys are acquired by
hostile nations.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said the decision facing Clinton is not to commit the
country irreversibly to deploying a national missile defense, but
whether to take the first steps this year to keep the Pentagon on
track to being ready to deploy a defense by the end of 2005. That
date is considered an important, though ambitious, goal because the
CIA estimates that North Korea may have a missile capable of
reaching U.S. soil by then.
</P>
<P>
   So the question for Clinton is whether to stick to the 2005
target date. The Pentagon has said that if Clinton does not
authorize it this summer or fall to prepare for the start of
construction next year of a powerful new radar on Shemya Island in
the Aleutians, then it cannot put the other pieces of missile
defense together by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said that after Clinton makes his decision this year on
whether to keep to the current schedule, there are several other
key decisions, starting with a determination in 2001 whether to
upgrade the capability of existing early warning radars and to
begin the construction of the Shemya radar.
</P>
<P>
   In 2003 a decision would be required for approving the
full-scale manufacturing of missile interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is when you say, 'I am going to build my weapons.'''
Gansler said. ''This is the decision that actually gets made in
2003. That's the real decision, in terms of commitment to building
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But well before that 2003 decision, a U.S. president will have
to decide yet another sticky question: whether to withdraw from the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which explicitly bans national
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to get Russia to agree to
amend the treaty to allow missile defenses. So far, the Russians
have refused.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear exactly when the United States would be in
violation of the ABM treaty's ban on national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be the moment a shovel is dug into the ground on
Shemya? Or could the initial site preparation work there and at a
missile interceptor site near Fairbanks, Alaska, be completed
without violating the treaty?
</P>
<P>
   This a political and legal issue that the White House is now
struggling with.

<HEADLINE> Next Up for Census: 'Best Guess'  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Elnora Cooper is 76 years old, but she never
counted in the census until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I've ever filled it out,'' Cooper said
after Census Bureau workers urged her to do just that during an
event in the Philadelphia senior home she lives. ''I've been in
North Philadelphia for 50 years, but when I first saw that form, I
said 'what the devil is this?'''
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one mystified. The agency estimates that in
the last census 10 years ago, it missed about 8 million people,
while double-counting 4 million for a net undercount of 1.6 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt is determined not to let that
happen again. But his statistical solution has generated more
problems -- and most of them don't have to do with mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The census? It's to help people right? Yeah, why not fill it
out,'' said Ralph McCray, 28, as he waited for a friend in downtown
Baltimore. But did he fill his own form out? ''No, I forgot,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To account for people like Cooper and McCray, Prewitt wants to
use a statistical method known as ''sampling,'' based on a randomly
sampled follow-up survey of 314,000 households going on now. It is
separate from the head count the Census Bureau just completed of
120 million households across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we stopped the census today, we would have a good estimate
of the population of the United States based on the 120 million
households in our address file,'' Prewitt said after announcing the
agency finished its head count a week ahead of its July 7 targeted
completion date.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we do these operations to get these estimates closer to
the truth,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, sampling involves a complicated series of
mathematical formulas used to adjust the initial head count.
Sampling would help delete twice-counted persons, such as people
with two homes that mistakenly sent in forms from each address.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat akin to balancing a checkbook. Often, errors are
found in the balance of a checkbook when compared to a bank
statement. You add and subtract dollars from the checkbook balance
to match up with the total on the bank statement.
</P>
<P>
   About half of those undercounted in 1990 were children.
Supporters say sampling would help account for them, as well as the
poor, minorities, and inner-city residents that tend to vote
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   And that has some Republicans worried. Since states now have the
option of using sampled data to reshape congressional and state
legislative district boundaries, some GOP leaders fear it could
create new districts with higher concentrations of Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau plans to release both sets of numbers: the
actual head count by Dec. 31; and the sampled count, if approved,
by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel, has questioned whether the Census Bureau
sacrificed quality to speed up its head count, a charge Prewitt has
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Statistician David Murray, an appointee by the
Republican-controlled Congress to the Census Monitoring Board
oversight panel, says the bureau's sampling plan also has
statistical flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you engage in a sampling process, you are putting people
back in districts who may not be there, and you are also including
people who tend not to be engaged in the process,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   But while debate over sampling is likely to heat up in Congress
over the coming months, the issue may ultimately be decided in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia passed an anti-sampling law in April, but still needs
Justice Department approval since it falls under the Federal Voting
Rights Act of 1965 -- a law that Congress passed to ensure that no
discrimination occurs in connection with election law changes. Some
20 states, mostly in the South, are covered by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has asked a federal court to allow it to bypass
Justice, and other states are expected to follow Virginia's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a question that could ultimately be left up to the
courts. I think we all agree on that,'' Miller said at a recent
subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Everitt Bryant, a Republican and Census director during
the Bush administration, supports sampling
</P>
<P>
   ''Redistricting is done at the state level, not by the Census
Bureau, and whichever party controls the state legislature and
governor's office usually has more influence on the way lines are
drawn, than any additional people a district has,'' said Bryant,
now a professor at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt says the Census Bureau's focus is on what is best
statistically, not politically. Though appointed by President
Clinton, Prewitt dismisses notions he has partisan intentions in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope (Americans) will understand that this additional work
is necessary to ensure that Census 2000 can provide the best
possible data to guide important decisions that will impact their
lives through the decade,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate goes on, the agency will continue with its
sampling survey, as well as conduct follow-up visits to 12 million
addresses to ensure the accuracy of answers they collected in the
head count.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people feel it's best not to answer the census, because
you don't know if it's going to hurt us or what,'' said Laverne
Johnson, who lives in the Robert Johnson Homes housing project in
Philadelphia. ''I just hope all this ain't for nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon, VA Could Merge Drug Plans  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Placing rivalry ahead of savings, the
departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are costing taxpayers
as much as $300 million a year because they haven't merged their
massive prescription drug purchasing programs, congressional
auditors report.
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies spent a combined $2.4 billion in 1999 to fill
140 million prescriptions, figures that would give them enormous
combined buying power to negotiate deep discounts with drug
companies, the General Accounting Office found.
</P>
<P>
   On the few occasions the agencies have combined their buying
powers, savings were enormous, the auditors noted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they were able to buy the blood pressure medicine
Capoten at $1.17 for 100 tablets, compared to the average wholesale
price of $90.84. And 500 tablets of the ulcer-fighting Ranitidine
cost just $13.57, compared to $740 at wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   The departments, however, only bought 2 percent of their
pharmaceuticals together. The audit concluded the agencies'
''differing missions and cultures have created rivalries that make
it difficult for them to act together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The driving expectation is that, as the two agencies buy more
of a particular drug, their leverage ... will permit them to exact
discounts from drug manufacturers,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   VA and Defense officials said the audit doesn't take into
account some negative consequences, including the likelihood that a
joint contract with a single drug maker might force many patients
to change medications.
</P>
<P>
   John Ogden, director of pharmacy services for the VA, said it
would be ''penny wise and pound foolish'' to change patients' drugs
''just because we wanted a joint contract. What if an adverse event
occurred?''
</P>
<P>
   Ogden also disputed the estimates of savings, saying the VA
already gets significant discounts. ''I disagree with the
assessment that there's hundreds of millions of dollars on the
table'' to be saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And military officials said it would be difficult to merge the
VA system, which limits patients' choices of drugs, with a Pentagon
system that gives beneficiaries far more alternatives. In addition,
VA pharmacies won't fill prescriptions written by providers outside
their system, but DOD programs do.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patient expectations among DOD beneficiaries are different
from the expectations of VA beneficiaries,'' said Navy Capt.
Charles Hostettler, former director of the Pentagon's pharmacy
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patient choice is one of the basic tenets'' of the military
system and therefore ''constrains DOD's ability'' for joint
contracting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit by Stephen P. Backhus, director of the GAO's veterans
affairs and military health care, was done at the behest of the
House Veterans Affairs investigations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman Terry Everett, R-Ala., said that if the
two agencies ''can combine their pharmaceutical purchases to save
the taxpayer $1.5 billion over five years, then I want to know why
it is not being done right now. This is substantial money that
could be reinvested to improve health care for our active duty
service members and their families, military retirees and
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   It found the deepest discounts would come from a national
contract with a single supplier. The two agencies would agree to
purchase the same drug, commit to encourage its use in their
nationwide health systems, and include the medicine on a preferred
list. However, additional contracts could be written to provide
alternatives based on medical need.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies already can use one of several discount
programs to buy drugs at below-wholesale prices. But Backhus said
the savings from a joint, national contract would be enormous for
two agencies with 12 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We estimate they could save from about $150 million to $300
million, or about 6 to 12 percent of their annual combined drug
spending'' through combined, national contracts -- or even through
additional national contracts by each agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backhus said GAO identified several classes of medicines that
lend themselves to joint contracting, because they are so similar
that ''providers and patients would more likely accept one or two
drug choices per class.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- It started with herds of wildly decorated
fiberglass cattle in Zurich and Cows on Parade in Chicago. They
made people grin, bring their friends, look for more.
</P>
<P>
   Now cows of unexpected hues and patterns graze in Manhattan,
6-foot hares prepare to leap in Saginaw, Mich., 5-foot-high
fantastic fish swim in New Orleans, and moose stalk the streets of
Toronto and Whitefish, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk, Va., has a medley of mermaids. Six-foot ears of corn
decorate Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope everybody else is having as much fun as we are,'' said
Teresa Kelly of Whitefish.
</P>
<P>
   Fun is the common theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Goodpaster of St. Paul, Minn., recalls when he and two
colleagues first saw the cows in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can remember being almost like a little child, going from
one to the other, watching the children and trying not to look like
one, and enjoying the fact that each of these pieces was outdoing
the other as we walked down the street,'' said Goodpaster, a
business ethics professor at the University of St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ''And my colleagues were doing the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul has its own take on the theme: 51 dancing, 5-foot-tall
Snoopys, celebrating ''the joy of being Snoopy'' and honoring the
late Charles Schulz, a native son.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four dozen similar projects are supposed to take place
this summer in North America, said Nathan Mason, curator of special
projects for Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs. And that, he
emphasizes, is ''by no means definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is even planning a new exhibit for next year, but
officials won't give out any details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it's on a growth curve and not likely to slow
down,'' says Jack Becker, editor of Public Arts Review, based in
St. Paul. ''If Chicago can reinvent itself and come up with
something even more inventive, I'd say we're up for a decade of
things on parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Saginaw's 6-foot-tall hares stand tall on their hind feet, about
to take off on a nearly vertical leap -- provoking variations such
as Hare Jordan with a basketball, and Harely Davidson in motorcycle
leathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We chose to make this a collaboration of crass commercialism,
street art and community fund-raising. But we're having fun with
everything that we're doing,'' said Paul Barrera of Saginaw.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful critters give businesses a chance to sponsor public
art at a low price and get a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk's mermaids are $2,000, including a $350 honorarium for
the artist. Chicago's cows started at $3,500, with $1,000 going to
the artist. New Orleans' fish are $3,000, with $1,000 to the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes out to about 27 cents an hour, I figure,'' said Helen
Baffes-Febry, who created three of the nearly 200 fish on New
Orleans' sidewalks, plazas and other public places.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Fontana wasn't really excited when his wife suggested
checking out the New Orleans fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, it sounded like a crazy idea. But when you see them,
they're really nice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Spied on Sis Gets 10 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A former pro-Israeli militiaman, who
spied on his sister while she worked for a guerrilla group, was
sentenced on Tuesday to 10 years in jail with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Ali Beydoun was one of 49 people sentenced by a military
court in Beirut Tuesday for offenses ranging from entering Israel
to collaborating with the Jewish state. Lebanon prohibits any
contact with Israel, with whom it is technically at war.
</P>
<P>
   The court barred Beydoun, 26, from returning to his hometown of
Bint Jbeil, in southern Lebanon, for 10 years after finishing his
sentence. Such sentences are apparently intended to protect
convicts from possible revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Beydoun said he spied on his sister, Sonia, for the pro-Israeli
militia, the South Lebanon Army, while she worked for an
unidentified anti-Israeli group.
</P>
<P>
   The court handed down sentences ranging from two weeks to five
years in prison for 47 other defendants. A 49th defendant, Ali
Khalil Hamid, 45, a former SLA security official, was sentenced in
absentia to 15 years in jail with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 alleged collaborators have been sentenced to up to 15
years in jail since Israel withdrew its forces from southern
Lebanon on May 24. The verdicts cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2,200 ex-members of the 2,500-strong SLA were captured or
surrendered to Lebanese authorities after the Israeli withdrawal.
The rest -- many of them high-ranking militia officials -- fled to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Denies Terrorist Links  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Swiss-Lebanese man at the center
of a bungled Israeli spy operation said Tuesday that the Islamic
center he ran was set up for religious purposes and was not linked
to anti-Israeli activities.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the trial of an Israeli Mossad agent caught
in a February 1998 espionage attempt, lawyers for the Swiss
government and the agent probed for links between Abdallah el-Zein
and terrorist masters in Lebanon and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But a Swiss police expert testified that investigators had been
unable to connect the worldwide network of Ahl El-Beit centers to
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group that fought to oust
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspicion exists,'' said Hans Knaus of Switzerland's
federal police. ''But we have not been able to confirm it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other police officers described Tuesday how they caught the
Israeli agent, identified as Issac Bental, and four colleagues
installing bugging equipment after midnight in the basement of an
apartment building where el-Zein had lived near the capital, Bern.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called in when neighbors reported strange noises.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Leuenberger of Bern state police said he and his partner
found Bental and two other agents in the basement and said there
were enough suspicious elements, including identical stamps in
their Israeli passports, that police decided to take them in for
questioning. Two other agents keeping watch outside were also
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bental was arrested, because he was holding a bag with
tools to install the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   Contained in two hollowed-out boards about four feet long, the
bugging system included a cellular phone, a timer and 24 batteries.
The phone was set up to dial a recording center every time the
telephone in el-Zein's apartment was taken off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have worked for years,'' said Victor Ruefenacht, the
federal police technology expert.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zein told the court that the Ahl El-Beit center he ran
organized soccer teams, promoted friendship and sent money to
orphans in Lebanon and Iraq, but its main purpose was to encourage
Islamic worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course there are other activities but the main purpose is
religious,'' he told the Federal Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Bental said Monday that he had been told el-Zein had sent people
on terrorist missions to Israel. El-Zein denies the allegations and
has settled a separate suit against Bental out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The Mossad agent's lawyer, Ralph M. Zloczower, asked el-Zein
about his contacts with figures prominent in Ahl El-Beit, including
Saddredine Fadlallah, head of the organization's center in Paris.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Gets Its Revenge  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After years of getting sand kicked in its face by
its parliamentary big brother, Russia's lower house is finally
getting its revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the lower house, the State Duma, are showing
noticeable relish in their threats to push through President
Vladimir Putin's first major domestic policy initiative -- a bill
that would overhaul Russia's upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, leaders of the upper house shied away from a
showdown over the bill they oppose, instead agreeing to join a
conciliatory commission to find a compromise. The entire body was
expected to meet Friday to work out details.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's muscle-flexing highlights a stark shift in relations
between the president and the parliament since Putin replaced Boris
Yeltsin. December elections filled the lower house with Kremlin
loyalists, and Putin has focused on reducing the massive powers of
Russia's 89 regional governors, who fill half of the 178 seats in
the upper house, called the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Yeltsin mostly used the Federation Council -- which
was largely loyal to him -- to counterbalance the Communist-led
opposition that dominated the lower house. It worked, and the Duma
was unable to push through any significant initiatives and found
itself reduced to rubber-stamping Yeltsin's' choices for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has also used the enmity between the houses to push his
own agenda, getting the political backing he needs from the Duma to
challenge the governors who amassed so much power under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is using the anger of the lower house at the upper for
his own interests,'' said analyst Andrei Ryabov, with the Moscow
Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would replace the governors and regional legislative
leaders who comprise the upper house with regionally appointed
senators. The Duma overwhelmingly approved the proposal, but it was
quickly vetoed by the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Duma appears to be in the stronger position
with the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto and
make the bill law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says reining in the regions is necessary to boost the
economy and prevent the breakup of the state. Other proposed bills
would permit Putin to remove elected governors found by courts to
have violated the law and suspend governors who face criminal
charges.

<HEADLINE> Navy Destroyer Takes Step Forward  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In appearance, it hearkens back to the USS
Monitor -- the ironclad ''cheesebox on a raft'' of the Civil War --
but in every major respect the Navy's newest class of destroyer
represents a revolution in modern warship design.
</P>
<P>
   So radically different is the ship that the choice of its
namesake, Admiral Elmo M. Zumwalt, is almost poetic. Zumwalt, chief
of naval operations in the Vietnam war, was known for bucking naval
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The new warship was announced Tuesday by President Clinton
during Operation Sail 2000 in New York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy hopes the Zumwalt-class destroyer, also known as DD-21,
will cost less than today's ships, be operated by a crew one-third
the size and fire shells accurately three times as far.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, General Dynamics and Litton Industries, are in a
Navy-sponsored competition to design and build 32 of the ships,
with the first three to be delivered in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has two basic roles for the new ships: To support
forces on shore and to hit targets far inland.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig
said it would be the first ship designed ''with the ability to
influence events on land.'' It extends the idea behind using
sea-fired Tomahawk cruise missiles against land targets in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that as U.S. interests abroad have strengthened
in a global world ... then frequently we want to use military power
to protect those interests, and the most obvious choice is naval
power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' renderings of the Zumwalt show a low, flat, sharply
pointed hull with a pyramid-shaped superstructure near the stern.
The deck is empty but for two guns and a missile launcher. The low
silhouette appears to be part of a radar-thwarting ''stealth''
concept.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's main features are unprecedented: An all-electric
propulsion system, two 155-millimeter guns that can hit a tennis
court 60 miles away with a 250-pound shell, and an operating system
that cuts crew size from 320 on a conventional destroyer to about
95.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller crew will allow each sailor to have stateroom-type
living quarters instead of shared, cramped quarters and reduce the
number of Americans at risk.
</P>
<P>
   That directly reflects the Zumwalt philosophy of ''taking care
of his sailors,'' Danzig said, noting the admiral had rankled Navy
traditionalists with his concern for sailors' living conditions
when he was chief of operations in 1970-74.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt's son James, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel,
said the honor would be welcomed by his late father.
</P>
<P>
   ''He committed himself to improving life for those who served
under him (and)... to improving opportunities for minorities who
had long suffered under the inequalities inherent in the Navy
system,'' Zumwalt said.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said standard gas turbine engines would power the ship's
''electric drive'' system, greatly reducing the amount of machinery
needed and saving interior space. ''It's potentially as significant
as moving from sail to steam,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy estimates each Zumwalt-class ship will cost $750
million in 1996 dollars, compared to the billion-dollar Aegis-type
craft that are the backbone of today's surface combat fleet.

<HEADLINE> Full steam ahead -- maritime celebration swamps New York  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Tall ships sailed through New York harbor on
Tuesday, part of an awe-inspiring floating parade featuring
thousands of vessels as Operation Sail returned to the Hudson
River.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities kicked off when the Coast Guard barque Eagle
passed beneath the Verrazano Bridge. Behind it were two dozen
warships, ''tall ships'' from around the globe and an assortment of
lesser boats from schooners to speedboats.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 4 million was expected to watch an estimated
70,000 craft fill New York Harbor. During the first hours of the
parade, the weather was hazy and it seemed that the turnout of both
boats and spectators was considerably smaller. The U.S. Coast Guard
had no figures on attendance at midday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exciting!'' said Woodrow Keitt of Bayonne, N.J., who
crossed the Hudson River to grab a spot near the USS Intrepid
museum on the West Side. ''They say this is supposed to be the
largest one. I figure I want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Battery Park, where the Statue of Liberty provided a backdrop
for the event, Isabel Cruz of the Bronx stood on a park bench in
hopes of a better view.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's wonderful,'' she said. ''There's some really
awesome ships here.''
</P>
<P>
   The warships were anchored overnight as part of an 11-mile line
marking only the sixth International Naval Review in history.
</P>
<P>
   The ''parade of sail'' was to feature about 30 large
wind-powered ships from 19 countries. Most, like the Coast Guard's
square-rigger Eagle, are government-owned training vessels for
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter,
Chelsea, watched the flotilla from aboard the Kennedy, an aircraft
carrier named after the former president - an avid sailor who
formed the nonprofit Operation Sail in 1961 to promote
international good will and preserve maritime history.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Clinton said that ''it was at the tip of Manhattan
Island where the troops'' of George Washington's Continental Army
''first heard the words'' of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''And where they pledged their lives ... and sacred honor,''
said Clinton. ''They took a vision of liberty and turned it into
the law of this land.''
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that America's next generation of destroyers
would be named for late Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., architect of the
modern U.S. Navy. Clinton called Zumwalt, who died in January at
age 79, ''my mentor, my friend and a magnificent role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the armada was the 129-foot schooner Amistad, a replica of
the ship made famous after its slave cargo of 53 Africans revolted
in 1839. Launched March 25 in Mystic, Conn., it will return to New
Haven, Conn., where it will be a floating history lesson for
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration will be capped by what organizers say will be
the biggest fireworks display ever. Some 5,000 craft of all kinds
were in the water off the southern tip of Manhattan on Monday,
officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the main port of call in the tall ships' nine-week
coastal cruise. The summer tour, the fifth since OpSail began,
started May 19 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The parade left Baltimore early Thursday, led by the 170-foot
Pride of Baltimore II, with cannons firing. After leaving New York,
the ships are to stop in New London, Conn., and Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The first OpSail celebrated New York City's World's Fair in
1964; others coincided with milestones such as the 1976 U.S.
bicentennial and the restoration and centennial of the Statue of
Liberty in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Leader Bolts U.N. Council  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A prominent ethnic Albanian leader
bolted the U.N. committee that administers Kosovo to protest a deal
between the United Nations and the Serbs to enhance security for
the Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have frozen all participation in the interim administration
of Kosovo temporarily,'' Hashim Thaci told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, who stayed away from a second straight council meeting
Tuesday, cited the agreement signed last week with the Serbs as
well as ''other unresolved issues'' including the ethnic divisions
in the northwestern city Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci was the political chief of the officially disbanded Kosovo
Liberation Army, which fought Yugoslav forces until NATO intervened
in the conflict in June, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While another prominent Kosovo Albanian leader remains on the
council as well as moderate Serb representatives, Thaci's protest
underscores the difficulties facing the United Nations and NATO in
reconciling the two foes and building the foundation of a lasting
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials announced the deal with moderate Serbs on
Thursday in an effort to lure them back to the multiethnic U.N.
Transitional Council, which the Serbs had boycotted to protest
continued attacks by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge attacks on Serbs in the province have been plentiful
since the end of the 78-day NATO bombing campaign last year to push
Serb troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, mortars were fired late Monday at a Serb
village but there were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the United Nations promised to ''take special
measures'' to protect Serbs, including a neighborhood watch system,
accelerated efforts to recruit and train Serbs in the local police
force and a special committee to oversee protection of Serb
religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   But many Kosovo Albanians fear the arrangement may be a first
step toward dividing Kosovo into ethnic regions. Such a partition
has long been opposed by every leading Kosovo Albanian politician.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of Thaci's party, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they found the agreement one-sided and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, said he
regretted Thaci's decision and was prepared to make the same
arrangements with ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Kouchner added that ''those who are targeted today are the
Serb community. It is our duty to ensure security for the people of
all communities.''

<HEADLINE> President names new class of destroyers after Adm. Zumwalt  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Traditional tall ships that plied the seas
decades ago paraded past President Clinton on Tuesday as he
celebrated Independence Day by naming America's next generation of
destroyers after the late Adm. Elmo Zumwalt. Jr., architect of the
modern U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   From the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, Clinton called
Zumwalt ''my mentor, my friend and a magnificent role model. He was
a friend and passionate advocate for every sailor in his beloved
Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt, the youngest chief of naval operations in U.S. history,
died Jan 2, about three months after doctors found a cancerous
tumor in his chest. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazingly innovative,'' Navy secretary Richard Danzig said
about Zumwalt in an interview. ''He was the youngest chief of the
Navy at age 50. He emphasized the importance of sailors - giving
them respect and freeing them from unnecessary regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   As commander of Navy forces during the Vietnam War from 1968 to
1970, Zumwalt believed he inadvertently caused the death of his own
son, Elmo Zumwalt III, by ordering the spraying of Vietnam jungles
with the defoliant Agent Orange. Elmo III, who fought under his
father's command, died of cancer in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy plans to build 32 DD21 destroyers, the first class of
ships powered by an all electric propulsion system at a cost of
about $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the ships, to be armed with weapons that can attack
many miles inland, is to enter the fleet in about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the main port of call in Operation Sail 2000, a
nine-week cruise by the tall ships that started in Puerto Rico in
May. About 150 sailing vessels, including 25 tall ships from about
20 nations, paraded through New York Harbor. The oldest of the
ships was the Gazela of Philadelphia, a 178-foot square rigger
built in Portugal in 1883.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched them, sails billowing, from aboard the Kennedy,
an aircraft carrier named after the former president - an avid
sailor who formed the nonprofit Operation Sail in 1961 to promote
international good will and preserve maritime history.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 4 speech, Clinton said that ''it was at the tip of
Manhattan Island where the troops'' of George Washington's
Continental Army ''first heard the words'' of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''And where they pledged their lives ... and sacred honor,''
said Clinton. ''They took a vision of liberty and turned it into
the law of this land.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and daughter
Chelsea started the day aboard the USS Hue City, a guided missile
cruiser. It sailed on the Hudson River past nine U.S. Navy
warships, two US Coast Guard cutters and warships from more than a
dozen foreign navies - all part of the International Naval Review.
</P>
<P>
   The first review was held in 1893 to mark the 400th anniversary
of Christopher Columbus' landing and the most recent was held in
1986 for the rededication of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the review, gray clouds and haze vanished,
giving Clinton a better view of Ellis Island, the Statue of
Liberty, the New York skyline and the more than 18,000 U.S. and
foreign sailors and Marines who participated. Some stood at
attention on the decks of their ships and saluted Clinton as he
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members on a Canadian frigate, The Ville de Quebec, not
only took off their hats and shouted ''hip hip hooray,'' but they
blasted a rendition of the song ''New York, New York'' from their
loudspeakers.

<HEADLINE> Uganda May Get Multiparty System  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Five days after voters opted to stick
with his ''no-party'' system in a referendum marked by low turnout
and an opposition boycott, President Yoweri Museveni made the
surprise announcement that he was willing to consider a return to
multiparty politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no problem with political parties if they are not on
the wrong basis,'' he told a news conference. ''Let's change
society in such a way that if parties are brought in, they are no
longer a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system -- and the one that voters approved --
the political parties are allowed to exist, but they can't field
candidates, canvas for funds or campaign under their colors.
</P>
<P>
   Western donor nations, who paid $4.5 million toward the cost of
the June 29 referendum, afterward expressed concern that the
outcome of the vote favoring Museveni's National Resistance
Movement would result in the establishment of a one-party system in
the East African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, who were asked whether they wanted to retain the
Movement system or return to multiparty politics, opted for the
former with 91 percent of their votes. The turnout was 44.9 percent
of the 9.6 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Uganda People's Congress and the Democratic Party, the
historical opposition parties, boycotted the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni said the Movement, to which every Ugandan theoretically
belongs under the 1995 constitution, would hold a convention to
discuss the future role of political parties in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Movement leaders will organize a convention and ask
ourselves whether we can change our stand toward parties. We shall
consult with people,'' he said. ''The Movement cannot be a
one-party system for the country because it is not a party, it is a
system of various ideologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Museveni has consistently blamed political parties for
exacerbating the ethnic and religious divisions that tore Uganda
apart in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Established before Uganda's independence from Britain in 1962,
the Democratic Party had strong Roman Catholic support and a large
following in Buganda, the home of Uganda's largest tribe, the
Baganda. The UPC was backed by Protestants and had wide following
in the north.
</P>
<P>
   After he took power in 1986 at the end of a five-year guerrilla
campaign, Museveni restricted party activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''By 1986 and following the sectarianism which has characterized
this country, we did not think that the time was ripe to tempt the
population with sectarianism, but that was 14 years ago,'' Museveni
said. ''Now, we have a new generation of people who are not
bothered by sectarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Two opposition candidates ran against Museveni as private
individuals in the May 1996 presidential elections, which he won by
a landslide.

<HEADLINE> Nations Increase Chernobyl Aid  </HEADLINE>
By DETLEF RUDEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The Group of Seven biggest industrial nations and
the European Union have agreed to double their promised aid to $600
million to help rebuild the leaky cement shell that covers the
ruined reactor at Chernobyl, a German official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The additional aid, to be announced Wednesday at a donor
conference convened by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in
Berlin, means Ukraine will have almost the entire $768 million it
says is needed for the project, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident
when a reactor exploded and caught fire in April 1986. Experts say
a new cover over the ruined reactor -- instead of the hastily
constructed and leaky Soviet-built ''sarcophagus'' -- is needed to
prevent new radiation dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine says about half of the money has already been raised,
and it was hoping to secure the rest at the conference of more than
50 donor nations.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, visiting Kiev last
month, expressed optimism that the conference would come up with
the needed money.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay, Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma promised
in early June to shut down the plant's last working reactor on Dec.
15. Experts at Chernobyl sent the government a draft 15-year plan
for the reactor's shutdown, decontamination and final conservation.

<HEADLINE> Governor to sign sprinkler bill, gives colleges more time to fix fire code violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Wednesday is
expected to sign legislation requiring New Jersey's public and
private colleges to install fire sprinklers in all dormitories
within four years.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is in response to a fire at Seton Hall
University Jan. 19 that killed three students and injured 62
others.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleges and universities, including Seton Hall, are
already moving ahead with installing sprinklers in every room in
time for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would appropriate $90 million to help pay for the
sprinklers. Public and private colleges and universities would get
interest-free loans, while boarding schools, military academies and
other schools that have dorms would have to repay the loans at 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows exemptions for certain buildings. That would
most likely apply to ''very small'' buildings, state officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that more than 36,000 college dorm beds
are located in rooms without sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the governor has given colleges and universities
another four months to bring buildings into compliance with fire
code regulations, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Tuesday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the extra time, Whitman commended the progress
colleges have made so far to address code violations.
</P>
<P>
   The state began inspecting colleges and universities after the
Seton Hall fire. During an inspection in April, officials found
2,380 violations.
</P>
<P>
   The state Fire Safety Division said 236 violations remain in
need of correcting, and in almost all of those cases, the colleges
were granted extensions to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has threatened to cut aid to those colleges and
universities that do not comply with her directive.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the four-month extension gives the colleges the
summer to finish major projects while most students are gone. But
she has cautioned that minor or maintenance violations must not be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's comments came a day after a fire in a kitchen at Rowan
University in Glassboro caused about $10,000 in damage and forced
the evacuation of 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the fire in the Student Center was unrelated
to safety inspections. However, Rowan University had ignored
frequent state citations for not installing a sprinkler system in
the basement of a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say a $120,000 project to install
sprinklers likely will be completed this month. When it is
finished, all Rowan University buildings will have fire sprinklers,
university officials say.
</P>
<P>
   At Montclair State University, compliance has encountered some
delays. The school has contracts for repairs that include
installing fire doors, university spokeswoman Phyllis Miller told
The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's holding us up is it requires outside contractors and
requires public bidding,'' she told the newspaper. The work must be
done during the summer when residence halls are vacant.

<HEADLINE> Protest Hits Ivory Coast Capital  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- High-rise offices were empty and
streets abandoned in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Tuesday as
soldiers erected makeshift barricades and raced around in stolen
vehicles with rifles bristling.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by disgruntled army officers demanding perks closely
resembled a brief army mutiny that led to the nation's first coup
d'etat last December. And while officials and soldiers were
negotiating an end to the latest impasse, many civilians feared
another takeover in what has long been one of Africa's most stable
and prosperous nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of these soldiers using guns to disrupt our
lives. We want democracy,'' said Nogbou Mensah, a taxi driver in
the Cocody suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest began with a 30-minute burst of gunfire at 4 a.m.
that lasted for 30 minutes in several parts of Abidjan. Another
round of shooting occurred in the posh residential and commercial
district of Deux Plateau, around 9:30 a.m. and a smattering gunfire
was heard later.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy buildup of soldiers on foot and in armored personnel
carriers was visible around the airport, state broadcasters and
presidential mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. and Canadian embassies both said the
security situation was unclear and advised their citizens not to
venture into the streets. Some border posts were reportedly closed
and at least two airlines, Air France and British Airways, on
Tuesday suspended international flights from Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers also blocked roads in several other Ivory Coast cities
and sporadic shooting was reported near a military base in the
northern town of Korhogo.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer and the
scare prompted cocoa prices on the London futures exchange to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and protesting soldiers were locked in
discussions to resolve the crisis, a senior defense ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In a state television broadcast, Information Minister Henri
Cesar Sama said civilian safety was ''guaranteed'' but appealed to
the protesting soldiers to return to their barracks and negotiate
''in a disciplined and serene manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the announcement, protesting soldiers -- some drinking
beer and threatening civilians who ventured into the streets --
continued to cruise the streets in taxi, jeeps and other seized
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mostly young army officers, have demanded lump
sums of $9,000 each to buy houses. Ivory Coast's cash-strapped
government cannot afford to meet the soldiers' demands, Sama said.
</P>
<P>
   Sama accused unnamed politicians of fomenting the unrest ''in
order to gain power by any means.'' Authorities were searching for
the instigators, he said. No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to avoid bloodshed. It is still not over,'' Sama
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a military checkpoint outside the state television station, a
surly soldier driving a luxury car said: ''Tell the world this: The
government is stealing from the treasury and we have had enough. We
want our money.''
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of military leader Gen. Robert Guei was unclear.
Sama denied reports that Guei had fled his mansion, where there was
a heavy military presence, saying only that the junta leader was
''safe, unhurt and following the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The military protest came amid mounting political and ethnic
tensions in this West African country, which until the December
coup had long been one of the continent's most prosperous and
stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections for Sept. 17, but has not said
whether he will run.

<HEADLINE> Fox's Election Sends Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The stock market is up, the peso is stronger
and there is little talk of the postelection economic curse that
plagued Mexico after the past four presidential votes.
</P>
<P>
   Electing the first opposition candidate to Mexico's presidency
in a century seems to agree with the country financially -- at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's victory Sunday ended 71 years of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Deutsche Bank responded by
naming Mexico the top pick in its Latin American portfolio, saying
''as democracy is strengthened in Mexico, the economy will become a
major focus of attention for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the vote, however, many Mexicans
worried that the economy would collapse after the election as it
has after the past four presidential votes -- all of which were
followed by crises that sent inflation, interest rates and
unemployment soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with The Associated Press, Fox repeated
promises for a smooth, crisis-free transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under no circumstances do we want to fall into a deep hole,
into a vacuum as we did in December 1994,'' the last crisis, Fox
said. ''That is not going to happen this time because we are going
to have a lot of communication with everyone -- with investors, with
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Mexico, the United States and Canada should move beyond
their free-trade bloc, known as NAFTA, and into a common market
agreement where Mexicans, Americans and Canadians can work beyond
their countries' borders -- an idea unlikely to be accepted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will eliminate migration,'' said Fox, a former Coca-Cola
executive who has touted free trade and a cleaner, more efficient
government. ''It will eliminate the gap between salaries in one
country and another, and this will make us very, very fruitful,
winning partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's stock market responded favorably to Fox's win, closing
6.1 percent higher -- its highest close since April 3. The peso
strengthened to 9.57 against the dollar, its strongest level since
June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Investor optimism continued Tuesday. The market was up another
1.6 percent at midday and the peso had strengthened further to 9.51
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that optimism can be sustained, said
Sidney Weintraub, an expert on political economy for the Center for
Strategic &AMP; International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's short term,'' he said. ''And I think people are going
to watch how the transition goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts agree the economy is strong and there is
little chance of another postelection crisis, many in Mexico are
still wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most Mexicans, this has happened every six years or so,
and it's built into their psyche that something will happen,'' he
said. ''They aren't going to change their mind until Fox is in
office and things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still shocked by Fox's win, many Mexicans seemed to embrace the
idea of change within their country. In Texas, some immigrants said
they might even return home if Fox can improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things got better, I would maybe go back to Mexico,'' said
Maria De Jesus Osoria, who moved to the United States a year ago.
''I think (Fox) will make the changes. He has to be the catalyst
for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't convinced that a new party in power would mean a
stronger economy.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo de la Torre, 27, who was having his shoes shined while
reading about Fox's win, said he voted for Fox and hoped that the
newly elected president can create jobs and develop Mexico's
resources. But he also said Fox's success would depend on how his
government is accepted in Mexico, where the ruling party has ruled
for decades with limited opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if it's going to work or not,'' de la Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a newly shined pair of shoes to a waiting
luxury car and returning to de la Torre, Felix Sanchez Moreno, 28,
agreed, saying Mexicans were accustomed to economic crises, and
wouldn't be surprised by another. Still, he was hopeful things
would improve under Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change is very good,'' he said. ''This is what the country
needs.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Stigma Lingers in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) -- Vusi Thiwane never told his family
he was infected with the AIDS virus. They just guessed.
</P>
<P>
   His twin brother, Allen, moved out of their bedroom to sleep on
a couch in the dining room. His family warned neighbors to stay
away from him. His childhood friends seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   He is petrified of what will happen if he confirms their guess.
''Maybe they will kick me out of the house,'' said Thiwane, 37.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has become what leprosy was to
medieval Europe, only more deadly. In an effort to dispel the myths
and prejudices surrounding the disease, experts from around the
world will gather Sunday in Durban at the 13th Annual International
AIDS Conference, whose theme is ''Break the Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those infected are shunned by their families and fired
from their jobs. Their neighbors taunt them. Some are denied
medical treatment -- after all, they are going to die anyway, some
say -- and those who are hospitalized are often neglected by nurses,
who gossip about their illness with other patients.
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane has trained himself to ignore the insults.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I think about it, it makes me suffer more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, where HIV or AIDS infects an estimated 4.2
million people, 10 percent of the population, the country is
staring at a major economic crisis and health-care disaster as the
mostly working age victims begin dying in massive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been working to stop the spread of the
disease with an aggressive public information campaign aimed at
persuading people to wear condoms or abstain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the message is one that many on this conservative continent
would rather not discuss, said Charlotte Mohapi, project assistant
at the AIDS Care and Counseling Trust, at Chris Hani-Baragwanath
Hospital in Soweto.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you talk about HIV/AIDS, you are automatically talking
about sex. You are automatically talking about premarital sex. It
is a chain of so many issues ... which we have never been exposed
to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With huge waves of people around the country dying of AIDS,
though, the stigma is no longer about just sex, but also the fear
of death itself, said Zackie Achmat, chairman of the AIDS Treatment
Action Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention campaigns that try to scare people out of their
high-risk behavior feed into the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emphasis that HIV is a death sentence, and prevention is
the only cure has amplified the stigma,'' especially among
uneducated people in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane, however, lives in Soweto, a township just south of
Johannesburg. He was effectively outed after he spent seven months
in the hospital with tuberculosis last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get sick, they just assume you have AIDS,'' he said.
''If you are admitted to the hospital, you have AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiwane remembers the compassion and care his community
dutifully gave to sick relatives when he was growing up. Since the
arrival of AIDS, people stopped caring.
</P>
<P>
   During his months in the hospital, they visited only a handful
of times. Since he's gotten out, they have shunned him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is because of the disease, because no one likes it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists talk of infected people being beaten. They talk
of children whose parents have the disease being ostracized at
school -- in some cases by teachers and administrators. They talk of
cabdrivers refusing to stop for people wearing AIDS-awareness
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   This environment is a tremendous improvement, though, Mohapi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not nearly as negative as what happened to Gugu
Dlamini,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dlamini publicly revealed she had HIV in November 1998. Three
weeks later, she was beaten to death in a town near the
KwaZulu-Natal city of Durban, the site of Sunday's conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nomavo Goci, 33, says she does not fear being killed if she
reveals her infection. But she does worry about being humiliated
and ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One family, which has the only telephone in her community,
guessed she was infected after her boyfriend was hospitalized.
She's not allowed to use the phone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Goci and Thiwane said they were unafraid to reveal their
status to a reporter, it was only among their neighbors and
families that they hide their disease.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the problem, many AIDS activists say. The
stigma perpetuates itself because so few people are willing to
declare they have HIV/AIDS and become examples for their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to come from the person saying, 'I want to do this, I
want to tell my community,' and then the community will become more
receptive,'' said Mohapi, who declined to reveal her own HIV status
to a reporter for fear it would obscure the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country with few resources dedicated to helping those
with AIDS, why should people declare their status?
</P>
<P>
   ''What are the benefits of being open, if you are not going to
get treatment or any support?'' Achmat asked.

<HEADLINE> Jones Thanks France on Fourth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Quincy Jones celebrated the 4th of July by thanking
France for the happy years he spent there.
</P>
<P>
   Jones conducted the Orchestre Nationale de France in a
star-studded jazz concert Tuesday to thank the French for welcoming
so many African-American artists over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I think of home, I think of a place where there's love
overflowing,'' said Jones, quoting the lyrics of ''Home,'' a top
tune from his Broadway musical hit ''The Wiz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten more recognition from France than I ever did from
my own country. I never got the Legion of Honor or Arts and Letters
medals from the United States,'' the musician said in an interview
Tuesday following a rehearsal at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The two awards are France's top honors for excellence in the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 67, has achieved international stardom as musical
composer, conductor, arranger and producer with such credits to his
name as the ''We Are The World'' and Michael Jackson's best-selling
album ''Thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   He first came to France in the 1950s to study composition with
the famed piano teacher Nadia Boulanger, and later went on to work
with some of the nation's top musical talents -- Charles Aznavour
and Michel Legrand, among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I once came for three months and stayed five years,'' he said,
recalling how his band was stranded here without funds to return
home.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Tiger Position Destroyed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lankan troops attacked and
destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel position in the northern Jaffna
peninsula on Tuesday, killing at least 23 militants, a government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops launched the operation in the Nagarkovil area,
21 miles northeast of Jaffna city, the Tamil rebels' former
stronghold from 1990-95 which the insurgents have been trying to
recapture.
</P>
<P>
   After the battle, soldiers recovered the bodies of 23
guerrillas, while two government soldiers were killed and 37
wounded in the fighting, said government spokesman Ariya
Rubasinghe.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, government troops attacked four Tamil Tiger bases
near Jaffna city, killing 12 guerrillas while three soldiers were
wounded, Rubasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, soldiers in the east repulsed a guerrilla attack on
their army camp. One soldier was killed in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The army offensives follow a lull in recent fighting. The rebels
closed in on Jaffna city in a series of assaults in April and May,
but the military contained the push with newly acquired weapons,
Rubasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the rebels have been fighting to carve out a
homeland in eastern and northern Sri Lanka for the country's
minority Tamils, who comprise 3.2 million of the country's 18.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,000 people have been killed in the 18 years of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Tuesday reinstated censorship on local media
and Colombo-based foreign journalists reporting on the country's
civil war, three days after the Supreme Court threw out the
measures on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reimposed some restrictions again as we felt that in
the interest of the nation there should be some restrictions on
news reporting,'' Rubasinghe told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pakistan assured Sri Lanka of continued support to
combat the guerrillas, the state-run Daily News said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has supplied the army with multibarrel rocket
launchers, which helped stop a Tamil assault on Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to support Sri Lanka,'' the newspaper quoted
Pakistani military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf as saying.

<HEADLINE> Helms: No Decision on 2002 Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms was characteristically
blunt about everything but his own plans in an interview published
Tuesday, saying he has not decided whether he would run for a sixth
term two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody better get cranked up raising money for
the Senate unless they want to run against me,'' Helms, who has
battled health problems, quipped in an interview in the Raleigh
News &AMP; Observer.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added: ''That's not to say I'm going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   At 78, Helms has lost most of the feeling in his feet because of
a condition that disrupts the functioning of nerves. He relies on a
motorized scooter to get around Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, conducted last week, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman, first elected to the Senate in 1972,
also made his opinions clear on several foreign policy issues,
expressing disdain for new Russian President Vladimir Putin and his
military campaign against breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to corner those people, he's going to push them
back, he's going to murder them and then go have a glass of
vodka,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   The famously cantankerous conservative icon also warned that
Senate GOP leaders shouldn't count on his cooperation on a bill
granting China permanent normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dream on,'' Helms said when asked about Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott's strategy to pass the bill without amendments. ''I'm
going to give them the pleasure of voting on a number of
amendments. In the group, there may be at least one they like.''
</P>
<P>
   He also slammed the proposed easing of trade sanctions against
Cuba -- pushed largely by farm state representatives -- as misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't consider the question of where (Fidel) Castro is
going to get the money to pay for all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms vowed to continue blocking U.S. involvement in the
proposed International Criminal Court, a permanent body to try war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to put our servicemen in the posture of being
hauled into court by some people who don't care a thing in the
world about them,'' Helms said. ''I don't want the United States
participating in it, and as long as I'm here, the United States
will not participate in it.''

<HEADLINE> Austria To Hold Referendum on EU  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrians will get to voice their anger
over months of European Union sanctions in a nationwide referendum
that suggests the governing coalition could be seeking popular
support for threats to veto EU decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel said Tuesday that the decision to
hold the referendum was reached after six hours of deliberations by
a special committee of the government, including Joerg Haider and
members of his far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   It was Haider's past praise of the Nazi era that contributed to
the EU 's decision to impose sanctions on Austria in February,
after Haider's party joined the coalition government. The Freedom
Party's harsh line on immigration and other issues affecting
foreigners also played a role in the EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, now a provincial governor, is not a member of the
federal government and has no formal say in government policy.
Still, he remains extremely influential and is thought to exercise
substantial control on Freedom Party members in the government.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly warned that Austria will block EU legislation
normally requiring consensus unless the sanctions are lifted. In
particular, he has suggested that EU expansion eastward, to include
former Soviet bloc members, could be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel and other government ministers have refrained from
such overt threats, but the wording of two of the six referendum
questions indicated a desire to test public opinion on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian news agency said voters would be asked whether the
federal government should ''ensure with all possible means that the
unfairly imposed sanctions on Austria from the other members of the
European Union be lifted immediately?''
</P>
<P>
   Another question asks whether EU member nations should have the
right to choose their own governments without outside interference
-- a clear reference to the sanctions. The four other questions deal
with more general EU issues.
</P>
<P>
   An Austrian government statement Tuesday said the referendum
would not be held if the sanctions are lifted ahead of the date set
for the plebiscite. Possible dates for the referendum are Oct. 29
and Nov. 26, the news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposition Group Quits Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A key Iraqi opposition group said Tuesday it
was leaving a Washington-backed alliance in protest over its
strategy, dealing a blow to U.S. efforts to unite Saddam Hussein's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Iraqi National Accord that it was
quitting the Iraqi National Congress came three days before an INC
meeting in London to work out a new anti-Saddam strategy and bring
more of his foes under its umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the INA gave several reasons for leaving,
including what it said was the London-based congress's close
association with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi National Congress was set up after the 1991 Gulf War
as an umbrella group for Iraqi opposition movements seeking to
remove Saddam from power. But the groups have since failed to agree
on a program of action because of their own political, ethnic and
religious divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore met with nine of the Congress
leaders. U.S. officials later said the meeting was a success, but
that the real test will be whether they can agree on a program for
a future Iraq without Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition groups under the umbrella of the congress are
based in various locations, including England, Jordan, Syria,
France and Saudi Arabia. The INA is based in London.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Debuts Wednesday  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the latest network bid for a share of the
reality-based television trend, 10 people will surrender their
privacy Wednesday night on the new TV series ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is seeking to match the success of ''Survivor,'' which
gathered 16 contestants on a Malaysian island to outlast each other
for $1 million prize under television's watchful gaze.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Big Brother,'' the contestants are isolated in an
1,800-square foot home built on a corner of a CBS Studio Center
parking lot. They were to meet for the first time when they enter
the house late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The network was withholding the identities and hometowns of the
contestants -- who sent in videotaped applications and underwent
what CBS called extensive screening and background checks -- until
the group was secluded in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original Dutch version of ''Big Brother'' was
harshly criticized as exploitative and voyeuristic, the show became
a hit and was copied in Germany and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism has been more muted in America, although some media
observers have questioned how far the reality-TV trend might go.
Fox already saw how far it could go wrong with ''Who Wants to Marry
a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ''People want something different. There's more of a voyeuristic
nature to our watching habits,'' said Leslie Moonves, president of
CBS Television, which paid a reported $20 million to the show's
Dutch creator for the rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' is intended to be ''fun,'' according to series
producer Paul Romer. ''Humans are curious beings. We like to know
how other people live.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's Wednesday debut comes right after the sixth episode
of ''Survivor'' and is intended to capitalize on its popularity.
The castaways show was the first series to make a dent in the
ratings of ABC's hit ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ''Survivor,'' the contestants on ''Big Brother'' will
gradually whittle their ranks down to a final participant. Every
two weeks, the housemates will nominate two colleagues for
expulsion, and TV viewers vote out one of them by phone. The
audience chooses the winner of the $500,000 prize from the three
remaining players.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the island show, which was filmed last spring, ''Big
Brother'' is airing five nights a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday and Saturday is its regular berth).
</P>
<P>
   The daily record made by 28 cameras and 60 microphones installed
throughout the house will be quickly edited for the next broadcast.
The Thursday episode, which will feature the contestant ousted that
week, will be a live in-studio edition.
</P>
<P>
   The house, with adjoining vegetable garden, is stocked with
staples (minus the rats that served as a ''Survivor'' menu item).
There's no TV, radio or newspapers, although each person can bring
a small suitcase with books or games.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Southern Europe  </HEADLINE>
By MIHAELA ARMASELU
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Hundreds of wildfires burned across
southern Europe on Tuesday as the region remained in the grip of a
heat wave that has driven temperatures as high as 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, the sizzling temperatures accompanied the worst
drought to strike the region in 50 years, which has already caused
record crop losses since it began in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances patrolled the streets in southern Romania cities to
pick up people who fainted in 106-degree heat. Radio and television
stations urged old people and children to stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian officials expect no let up in the heat for at least a
few weeks, and they urged local governments and firefighters to
stay on alert and prepare water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 fires still burned Tuesday in Romania, despite
successful efforts by firefighters to put out 98 other fires, said
Ionel Craciun of the Firefighters General Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured in the Romanian fires, he said, but damage
was ''considerable,'' in part because a lack of water impeded
firefighters' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, hot, dry winds blowing across the southern Gargano
region fanned flames that consumed hundreds of acres of forest
despite repeated passes by firefighting planes dumping water.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's state-run RAI television reported Monday that
temperatures on the island of Sardinia approached 120 degrees.
Italian meteorologists said they expect the torrid temperatures to
continue at least through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires have also raged in many areas of Croatia over the last
three weeks, with some fires reaching villages and sweeping through
farmers' fields. No injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Croatia's central Adriatic town of Sibenik,
where 250 acres of forest have already burned, said Tuesday they
could not get to fires because the area has not yet been cleared of
mines from a war fought there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Serbia, where temperatures climbed above 104
degrees in several cities, hospitals reported a sharp increase in
patients complaining of problems related to the heat, and
authorities urged people to stay indoors.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Milk Strike,530  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMER, Wis. (AP) - A number of dairy farmers around the nation
dumped their milk on the Fourth of July to protest low milk prices,
an organizer of the effort said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Siverling of Bloomer said hundreds of farmers from 11
states had pledged to withhold at least 500,000 pounds of milk from
market or put it to other use, but he would not have final figures
for several weeks on how many actually took part.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sprayed 3,500 pounds of milk on his fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an election year. We have a lot of disgusted farmers.
We have the lowest prices we've ever had,'' Siverling said. ''If we
don't change the system, there won't be any farmers out there
producing.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers were getting about $16 per hundred pounds of milk last
September, but it has declined since and is now about $10 for that
amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers are urging the government to establish an emergency
basic price of $13.50 for 100 pounds of milk.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a mandatory supply management system that would
factor in farmers' cost of production and more controls over the
guaranteed income that processors are allowed to use in setting
their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chetek dairyman Don Moos, who helped Siverling organize the
strike, said it costs the average dairy farmer about $17.50 to
produce 100 pounds of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Zen Miller, University of Wisconsin Extension dairy and
livestock agent in Outagamie County, said he doubts the milk strike
will have much effect on prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see a little price rise, but it won't take enough
product off the market to make much of a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doubts enough farmers could afford to participate in
the strike to make it effective.
</P>
<P>
   David Metzig, owner of Union Star Cheese Factory in Winnebago
County, said he sees the strike as more symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're definitely going through very hard times now. It's not
easy watching it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Siverling said he received at least 20 phone calls a day from
farmers as far away as California and New York leading up to the
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Others from Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Louisiana,
New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania also were to take part, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something we want to do,'' Moos said. ''It takes a
lot of time and a lot of money to produce milk. The last thing we
want to do is run it down the drain. But we want to get paid a
reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all protesting farmers dumped their milk.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen farmers in the La Crosse area donated more than
62,000 pounds of milk to a local cooperative creamery, which will
process the milk into cheese and donate it to area food pantries,
Cashton farmer John Hemmersbach said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many farmers feel the same way about the government and
milk prices as he does.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them have let us fail at an alarming rate,''
Hemmersbach said. ''I don't trust my government no more.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Issues New TV Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Moving to bring Jamaica in line with
international intellectual property laws, the government has
ordered cable operators to stop illegal pickups of U.S.
pay-per-view channels and other satellite broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who ignore the order, effective Wednesday, face a fine of
$1,500 or three months imprisonment and could have their licenses
suspended, said Ian Miles, executive director of the government
Broadcasting Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Caribbean island's 37 cable TV operators are
broadcasting a pay-per-view movie channel and other stations picked
up from Direct TV satellite broadcasts in the United States without
permits, Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not waiting for somebody to contact us before we take
the action,'' he explained. ''We know what the law requires in
terms of intellectual property compliance ... this is a global
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Counterdemonstrators outnumber supremacists at rally, 12 arrested  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) - About a dozen counterdemonstrators were
arrested here Tuesday after knocking over or running past police
barricades separating them from a small group of white supremacists
staging a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Nine members or supporters of the Nationalist Movement staged
their rally and one-block march under heavy police guard on a side
street next to the Morris County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Leader Richard Barrett gave a 45-minute speech from the back of
a flag-decorated pickup truck, but he was hard to hear over the
racket made by those who came to Morristown to denounce him.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 counterdemonstrators staged their own protest
nearby on Washington Street, where scores of riot-geared sheriff's
deputies and other police kept guard between rows of barricades set
up to keep the groups apart.
</P>
<P>
   When the supremacists moved to Washington Street for a brief
march, some 30 sheriff's deputies with helmets and shields led the
way, and two dozen police officers followed, including eight
mounted police. When activities broke up hours later, teams of
officers were seen escorting individual supremacists safely to
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County Sheriff Edward Rochford said nearly 300 police
officers from 20 agencies, including a mounted patrol from as far
away as Camden County, came to town to help keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing the American flag and their own Nationalist flag,
bright red with a black cross, the supremacists called for an end
to affirmative action programs and protested the firing of New
Jersey State Police Superintendent Carl Williams last year at the
height of the controversy over racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   One banner read, ''America arise, destroy minority tyranny.''
Counterdemonstraters chanted, ''Death to fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Lamont Jenkins, a member of the New Jersey Freedom
Organization, said, ''We're going to do the best we can to drown
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mini-rally was led by lawyer-activist Richard Barrett, who
argued in state and federal court for the group's rights to protest
on the steps of the historic courthouse. A federal judge moved
their event to the side street.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett has fought for marching rights across the nation and
before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Nationalist Movement, based in
Learned, Miss., claimed it would have 50 marchers here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> EU: Zimbabwe Aid Depends on Action  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Future European aid to Zimbabwe hinges
on the restoration of law and order by the government after months
of largely uncontrolled political violence, European Union
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were killed and thousands beaten and left
homeless in the months leading up to last month's elections. Most
of the victims were opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Zimbabwean civic groups called on the government
Tuesday to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The EU election observer mission said in a statement released
Tuesday that sporadic violence has continued in the aftermath of
the elections, which left President Robert Mugabe's ruling party
with a slender majority in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The EU, which encompasses 15 nations, called on the government
to re-establish swiftly the rule of law across the country and
observe long-ignored judicial orders to remove illegal squatters
from white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of European monitors was to remain in Zimbabwe
until at least July 14, spokesman Francesco Cobus Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Their observations will be added to the elections report
released Tuesday in Harare and Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-page report reiterated the mission's interim statement
issued June 26 that the election process was legally flawed and
affected by violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the term ''free and fair'' was not applicable to
the Zimbabwe polls, the EU said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the National Constitutional Assembly, an
alliance of about 200 civil, religious and opposition groups, said
the government must form a commission of inquiry to bring
perpetrators of the political violence quickly to justice and to
end continuing intimidation and assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, mainly from the ruling party, openly incited,
abetted or condoned attacks on their opponents, assembly spokesman
Brian Kagoro said. Police either participated in the violence or
failed to stop it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country cannot turn a blind eye to the violence that
engulfed us and still engulfs us. Our citizens have to be reassured
justice will run its course,'' Kagoro said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came as the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change presented the strongest electoral challenge to Mugabe's
ruling party since it led the country to independence in 1980. The
MDC captured 57 of the 120 elected seats, with Mugabe's ruling
party winning 62. A small opposition party won one seat.
</P>
<P>
   In the outgoing parliament, Mugabe controlled all but three
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, Mugabe is empowered to appoint 30
lawmakers to the 150-seat legislature, allowing him to effectively
veto the formation of such a panel.

<HEADLINE> Tall ships lead way into NY Harbor  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE DANMARK (AP) - Bells rang, the Queen Elizabeth II
sounded its horn and a shore battery in Brooklyn fired a salute as
the lead contingent of tall ships sailed under the Verrazano Bridge
to formally begin Operation Sail 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some Danish cadets aboard the Danmark, a square-rigged training
ship, snapped pictures; others merely leaned on the rail, their
first glimpse of New York City's skyline obscured by a cloying
haze.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is one of the biggest events we've been looking
forward to,'' said Cadet Anne-Mette Trebbien, 21, as she stood on
the deck. ''To be here in the year 2000, and go back 200 years, it
gives you a very funny feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew of 95 cadets have been world travelers, and
some were looking forward to reunions with friends they had met
elsewhere before this visit to New York.
</P>
<P>
   All agreed this was the most important stop - ''the climax,'' as
one put it - of the tall ship odyssey that began in Puerto Rico two
months ago and will end later this month in Maine. The cruise up
the U.S. Atlantic coast recalls the heyday of sail in the 18th and
19th centuries before Robert Fulton's development of the steamboat
changed maritime history.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 of the Danmark's cadets are women. The crew is
hand-picked, and capturing a position aboard the vessel is
considered an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Danmark was second in line behind the host ship, the U.S.
Coast Guard Eagle, in the procession that began OpSail 2000. The
253-foot steel-hulled Danmark visited the World's Fair in New York
in 1939, and was in U.S. waters when the Nazis invaded Denmark in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish government turned it over to the United States as a
wartime training ship. It was returned after the war. The Eagle,
built in Hamburg, Germany, was seized by the United States after
the collapse of Nazi Germany, a bit of war spoils. It was
commissioned as a Coast Guard training ship in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Danmark, guests were provided with a breakfast of
wienerbrod - a collection of pastries better known in New York as
Danish.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, including the Danish ambassador to the United
States, Ulrik Federspiel, Consul General Michael Metz Morch and
other dignitaries, rose hours before dawn to take chartered buses
to a New Jersey resort town and ferries to the anchored ships,
which emerged like a ghost fleet in the gauzy first light.
</P>
<P>
   Sails were unfurled into still air, forcing Danmark Capt. Kurt
Andersen and his counterparts to use power to form into line and
head for the Narrows. A haze enveloped the sailing route, often
obscuring the shoreline and other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The cadets turned to, scaling the rigging of the 252-foot,
steel-hulled ship and pulling on hawsers like seamen of old. On
orders from officers, they assembled to sing the Danish national
anthem. ''They do it every Sunday,'' said Chief Engineer Preben
Bolther, ''but sometimes they sing sea chanties. They're very
popular. The cadets love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The male and female cadets share living spaces, sleeping in
hammocks. On this year's five-month tour, they have e-mail for the
first time, said Third Mate Mikkel Henriksen. Like several other
officers, he was a cadet who went on to a career in the Danish
merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   ''You learn much more than jsut about the job,'' said First
Officer Lars Christiansen, another ex-cadet. ''You learn
cooperation and teamwork, things that you can use in many other
places.''

<HEADLINE> Linking Welfare, Vaccines Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Threatening to withhold welfare payments to
low-income families unless their children got regular vaccines
significantly increased immunization rates in Georgia, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Several states implemented similar measures in the 1990s, when
the federal government encouraged testing of innovative welfare
programs, including those that improved the health of public aid
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, critics slammed the practice as unfair, and an
editorial accompanying the study in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association questions the ethics of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ethical stumbling block ... rests in the fact that
financial penalties for delayed immunization were threatened only
to individuals already at high risk for economic deprivation,''
wrote Drs. Matthew Davis and John Lantos. Lantos is a medical
ethicist at the University of Chicago. Davis, formerly of UC, is
now at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But the study authors said poor children face a higher-risk of
''vaccine-preventable'' diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is both a public health obligation to encourage low-income
parents to have their children immunized for these diseases and a
benefit to these families and to the public as a whole,'' the
authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Several states implemented similar programs and were required to
assess their impact, though only Georgia and Maryland have
completed their evaluations, said co-author David Connell of Abt
Associates, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia's request, the social science research firm evaluated
the program from its start in 1993 through 1996, when it, like many
others, was revamped under President Clinton's welfare reform
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   An evaluation of Maryland's program done by another firm found
no evidence that the threatened sanctions increased immunization
rates, Connell and colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, few of the families studied actually lost benefits.
Connell attributed the program's success to the threat as well as
reminders from caseworkers and frequent public service
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families weren't unduly burdened by this requirement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, Georgia families applying for Aid to Families
with Dependent Children benefits had to prove their preschool-aged
children had up-to-date immunizations. Families were told they'd
lose their benefits for any children who weren't immunized.
Benefits varied widely but averaged roughly $25 monthly per child.
</P>
<P>
   Connell and colleagues focused on 2,500 families eligible for
AFDC benefits in Muscogee County. Fifteen-hundred families were
told of the possible sanctions, while 1,000 in a control group were
encouraged to have their children immunized but were not told of
any threat and faced no penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccination rates evaluated were for DPT (diphtheria, tetanus
and pertussis); poliovirus; MMR (measles, mumps, rubella); Hib
(Haemophilus influenzae type b); and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 510 intervention group children who turned 2 years old
during the study, 369, or 72.4 percent had up-to-date
immunizations. That compared with 206 out of 240 control-group
children, or 60.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven intervention-group families lost benefits affecting a
total of 18 children. Of the eight families who re-applied, five
lost just one month's worth of aid, while the remainder had aid
restored within six months.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial authors said lawmakers should realize that
programs that fail to fully evaluate negative consequences of
welfare innovations may overestimate program benefits and
''underestimate worsening health status among eligible program
beneficiaries.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Treat Dementia Differently  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors often fail to acknowledge the final
stages of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia as a
terminal illness and subject patients to invasive procedures when
providing comfort care would sometimes be more appropriate,
research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, indicate that patients suffering from the
degenerative neurological condition are often treated for other
problems as though the dementia itself was not terminal. That
oversight affects the quality of their final months of life,
researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The research could have broad implications for the estimated 1.8
million people nationwide with end-stage dementia. Patients in the
final stages of dementia can't talk or recognize family members,
frequently can't walk and must rely on others for daily care.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 4 million
Americans, is the leading cause of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared treatment given to dementia-free elderly
patients and those with end-stage dementia who were hospitalized
for either hip fractures or pneumonia -- two common ailments in the
elderly. Those with end-stage dementia were found to be at least
four times more likely to die within six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the dementia patients were given the same degree of invasive
treatment, such as daily blood tests, X-rays and catheters, as
patients without dementia, the authors reported.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted at an unidentified hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A treatment model developed 14 years ago recognized end-stage
dementia as terminal and recommended hospice care, focusing on
easing discomfort rather than invasive treatment. But the new study
suggests ''this concept has yet to gain acceptance,'' Dr. Don
Riesenberg of the Binghamton Veterans Affairs Clinic in Binghamton,
N.Y., wrote in a JAMA editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Riesenberg said the study underscores the importance of living
wills. Doctors should discuss treatment wishes with family members
or patients before they become incapacitated to decide on care and
''whether the standard of care for hospitalized patients is
appropriate for patients with severe dementia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few minutes spent can save a world of suffering,''
Riesenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors looked at 97 patients age 70 and older with hip
fractures and 119 with pneumonia, treated between September 1996
and March 1998. About half in each group had end-stage dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Among hip-fracture patients, morphine doses were more than twice
as high in the non-dementia patients. And only 9 (24 percent) of
the 38 end-stage dementia patients, ''who often are unable to
communicate the presence of pain,'' had standing orders for other
painkillers such as acetaminophen, the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The authors theorized that doctors withheld painkillers out of
the mistaken assumption that the patients weren't in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. Sean Morrison, an assistant professor at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine and the study's lead author, said it was unclear
whether the hip fractures or the pneumonia hastened the dementia
patients' deaths because dementia alone is terminal.
</P>
<P>
   There were no plans recommending palliative (comfort) care
rather than life-prolonging care for any of the dementia patients.
For 90 percent of them, there also was no evidence that any
discussion about treatment goals or withholding life-sustaining
care had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said they were not recommending that life-sustaining
treatment or even all invasive tests be withheld from all end-stage
dementia patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a minimum, what we're advocating is that the benefits and
burdens of ... burdensome hospital treatments be carefully
evaluated'' for patients who have ''a very limited prognosis,''
Morrison said.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Birth Control Pills  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new report suggests that while women taking
birth control pills -- even the newer, low-dose forms -- are at
higher risk of stroke, that risk is outweighed by the contraceptive
benefits of the pills.
</P>
<P>
   The report, an analysis of 16 previous studies, is in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The low-dose forms, taken by most of the more than 10 million
U.S. women using oral contraceptives, contain less estrogen than
the pill introduced 40 years ago and are thought to be safer.
Still, women taking them were nearly twice as likely as non-users
to suffer a stroke, while women using higher-dose pills faced
nearly a threefold risk.
</P>
<P>
   However, since strokes are so rare in women of reproductive age,
the risk translates to only one additional stroke yearly per 24,000
women for low-dose pill users and one per 12,000 women for higher
dosages, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The risks were associated with current rather than previous use.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes are a known risk factor for higher-dose pills but
previous research had been less clear about lower dosages -- pills
with less than 50 micrograms of estrogen, said Dr. S. Claiborne
Johnston, a co-author of the report and assistant professor of
neurology at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key is about whether this risk matters,'' given how
effective the pill is at preventing pregnancy, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   If oral contraceptives were replaced by condoms, an estimated
687,000 additional unintended pregnancies would result each year,
the study authors said. Some of those women likely would have
abortions, and those who didn't would face health risks associated
with pregnancy plus ''major psychological and economic
consequences'' of unintended children, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke risk linked to the pill thus appears to be outweighed by
its benefits, the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the National Stroke Association and the
National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Breezes to No. 1  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Perfect Storm'' crushed ''The
Patriot,'' despite inspiration from the Independence Day holiday
weekend, according to preliminary studio box office estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The George Clooney movie, based on the true story of a fishing
boat crushed by a tempest, took in $64 million from Friday through
Tuesday, according to studio estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War saga starring Mel Gibson,
brought in $35.2 million for the same five days. ''Chicken Run''
retained its third-place standing for the longer-than-usual holiday
weekend, taking in $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are estimates based on reporting from the individual
studios. Exhibitor Relations, Inc., which usually provides official
numbers, was closed for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The list of the top 10 movies remained the same from Sunday's
tally, with ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' sitting in
disappointing fifth-place with $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July weekend traditionally means blockbuster
business for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the throngs of moviegoers
didn't make ''Mission: Impossible 2'' the first $200 million movie
of the year. The movie took in $7.7 million for the five days,
pushing its cumulative take to $199.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Tuesday at North
American theaters, according to studio estimates. Final figures are
to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Perfect Storm,'' Warner Bros. $64 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Patriot,'' Sony Pictures, $35.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Chicken Run,'' DreamWorks, $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' Fox, $19.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Rally in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Likening their cause to the United
States' battle for independence, hundreds of Puerto Ricans rallied
on the Fourth of July holiday outside a federal prison holding
activists opposed to Navy bombing on the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is paradoxical to celebrate the independence of the United
States and honor the patriots of that nation while they imprison
the patriots of this land!'' local Rep. Victor Garcia told a
cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more protesters marched in the southern city of Ponce,
led by Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 activists Tuesday entered the Navy's training ground
on Vieques and were quickly arrested by military police, Navy
spokesman Gil Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said about 90 of 122 people who had refused
to post $1,000 bail on trespassing charges had been arrested since
Friday by U.S. marshals and imprisoned in the federal prison in
suburban San Juan. The U.S. Marshals Service has not responded to
requests to confirm the number.
</P>
<P>
   The detainees were among 183 people arrested last week as they
tried to enter the Navy bombing range on Vieques to prevent
military exercises. A federal judge freed them temporarily, then
ordered them detained after they refused to post bail.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July is a holiday in Puerto Rico because the
Caribbean island of 4 million is a U.S. territory. The government's
official July Fourth celebration took place a few miles away in San
Juan's colonial district.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speeches began, the protest gathering had the flavor
of a July Fourth picnic, with families relaxing on the grass and
eating snow cones as they listened to music.
</P>
<P>
   But the only U.S. flag at the protest was hung upside down and
defaced with a red X, and T-shirts were emblazoned with anti-Navy
slogans. ''The federal court is colonial oppression!'' proclaimed
one banner. ''To break the law of the empire is to obey the law of
the motherland!'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters waved to prisoners dimly visible in the prison's
mirrored windows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here supporting our compatriots,'' said Gilberto
Torres, 45, of northern Loiza. ''They are defending their lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally, which broke up peacefully in the late afternoon, was
attended by pro-independence luminaries including Rafael Cancel
Miranda and Lolita Lebron, who participated in a 1954 shooting
attack on Congress that wounded five lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has owned two-thirds of Vieques since the 1940s and
uses it for training its Atlantic Fleet. The island's 9,400
residents live between the eastern training ground and a weapons
depot in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Navy's presence in Vieques boiled over in
April 1999, when a U.S. Navy jet dropped a bomb off target and
killed a civilian security guard working in the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, U.S. marshals forcibly cleared protesters who had
camped out on the bombing range for a year to prevent exercises.
Hundreds more have since tried to invade the range, and some 600
people have been detained there.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has agreed to order the Navy out by May 2003
if Vieques residents vote in a referendum to expel them. Until
then, exercises are to continue with non-explosive bombs and
shells.

<HEADLINE> Cha-ching: Good weather, Tuesday holiday add up for shore merchants </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Good beach weather, a holiday and the
luck of the calendar added up to big business this weekend at the
shore, with vacationers and day-trippers taking advantage of a rare
four-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading home Sunday night or Monday morning, they
lingered on the beach and Boardwalk through midday Tuesday. Hazy,
hot weather and the promise of a nighttime fireworks display kept
parking lots full and merchants happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see how they could possibly pack any more people onto
these islands,'' said Brian Conger, owner of B.C. Sweet Jug, an ice
cream shop. ''I'm here 12 years, and this has been one of my best
holiday weekends ever. It was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day traditionally kicks off the summer season at the
shore, but iffy weather forecasts, cold ocean waters and school
commitments keep many visitors away until mid- to late June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July weekend, always one of the season's busiest,
often serves as a barometer for the year. And store owners liked
what they saw this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good start to a slow season,'' said Nick Elmer, owner
of Surf Buggy Centers, which rents bicycles for $5 an hour and
surreys for $12. ''We've been a little slow this year, but it's
picking up now. Hopefully, it'll stay this way.''
</P>
<P>
   At Surf &AMP; Sand Beach Service, which rents chairs for $5 a day
and beach umbrellas for $8, business was brisk all weekend,
especially Sunday. The company's Moorlyn Terrace location rented
all 38 of its chairs and all 30 umbrellas by 1 p.m. Sunday, said
worker Pedro DeLeon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather was great. It was easily the busiest we've been
all season,'' DeLeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Ivory, who owns four Boardwalk stores that sell jewelry,
clothing and gifts, said business was excellent at each.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge weekend for us, and it didn't disappoint. Our
sales were high, our special orders were high, our customers were
happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Tuesday was her busiest day, thanks to more good
weather and the nighttime fireworks display planned at Sixth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   On the Boardwalk, pedestrian traffic was as busy as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're here to stay now,'' said Karen Lightner, 29, of Ocean
City, who watched the sunburned beachgoers walk by from her spot on
a bench. ''They'll be here from now until September.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the passers-by were Larry and Lisa Schultz of
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who brought their five children and two others
for the weekend. The children walked along the Schultzes, carrying
rubber rafts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't need to come here to drop a bundle of money; we
could have done that anywhere,'' she said. ''But it's really nice
here. That's why we come.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Engine of banner-towing plane checks out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - The engine of a banner-towing plane that
crashed, killing the pilot, showed no irregularities when it was
inspected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Lewis, 44, of Omaha, Neb., died when the single-engine
propeller plane dove nose-first onto a Lakewood Airport runway
Monday. He was the only person aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The rope on an advertising banner that read ''Seton Hall, Go
Pirates'' became tangled in the plane's rudder, apparently causing
the crash. It was unclear whether Lewis was picking up the banner
or releasing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought everything was fine. It had plenty of power and
everything,'' said Kute Anthony, of Wall, a pilot who was at the
airport at the time. ''But the plane stalled and rolled over and
just went down on its nose.''
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Robert J. Gretz
said investigators found nothing unusual in their inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through the whole engine today, didn't find any
discrepancies. The only discrepancy we found in the whole
investigation was the rope wrapped around the rudder of the
airplane,'' Gretz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was married with five children, had taken the
banner-towing job to help make ends meet. He started a crop-dusting
business in Nebraska two years ago, his wife, Catherine, told the
Asbury Park Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friday, Saturday, Sunday and (Monday) were the only days he
had flown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had planned to work here through July, but was considering
coming home early, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He missed us and was getting homesick,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 7, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Pat Burrell's grounder scored Bobby Abreu with
the go-ahead run as the Philadelphia Phillies got four runs in the
ninth inning Tuesday to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 4-3 lead into the ninth but closer Bob Wickman
-- expected to be the Brewers' only All-Star -- blew his second save
in three tries and his third overall.
</P>
<P>
   With Ron Gant on second and one out, Abreu's slow grounder up
the middle somehow eluded both Wickman (2-2) and shortstop Luis
Lopez, and Gant scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen then walked, and both runners advanced on a wild
pitch. Burrell grounded to second and Ron Belliard threw home, but
Abreu slid in under catcher Henry Blanco's tag.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Alex Arias singled up the middle to bring home
two more runs. Wickman, who has 11 saves and set the franchise
record with 37 saves last year, left the mound to loud boos and
headed straight up the tunnel to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (5-4) pitched a perfect eighth and Jeff Brantley,
who needed a bases-loaded strikeout of Geoff Jenkins on Monday
night to avoid blowing a save, pitched the ninth for his 13th save
in 13 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia won for the 13th time in 18 games, while Milwaukee
fell to 2-3 on its 10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz's fifth-inning double scored Lopez to put
Milwaukee up 4-3. Lopez had a season-high three hits for the
Brewers, who got 6 2-3 strong innings from Jason Bere.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't quite as successful against the Phillies as he was
five days earlier, when he struck out 13 in an 8-6 victory at
Philadelphia. But except for a three-run third inning, Bere stayed
in control, and Milwaukee's relievers kept the lead intact by
pitching out of jams in the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia scored the game's first three runs with a two-out
rally in the third capped by Rolen's two-run double. Milwaukee got
three of its own in the fourth inning on four hits, with the tying
run scoring on a fielder's choice grounder by Raul Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Dave Coggin, who was facing Bere for the second
time in five days, allowed four runs -- three earned -- and eight hit
before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Despite gorgeous weather and the holiday, just 14,602
attended. ... Ed Vosberg, recalled from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Monday, made his Phillies debut in the
seventh inning and pitched 1-3 inning. Vosberg was acquired from
Colorado on Thursday for a player to be named. ... Rolen, who had
two hits, extended his hitting streak to 12 games.

<HEADLINE> View from a bridge -- not to mention a park and port  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Brooklyn Bridge offers one of New York's
most scenic views of Lower Manhattan. But only a few dozen people
took to its pedestrian walkway Tuesday midmorning to view the
flotilla of tall ships passing in front of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a better view from up here,'' said Bob Friedman
as he stood on the bridge watching the stately vessels glide slowly
toward Manhattan's skyscrapers. ''It's so Gotham, with the haze
rising off the empty buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   At times fog all but obscured the ships' hulls, but their white
sails could be seen shimmering and billowing despite the haze.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   The Eagle has landed!
</P>
<P>
   Nobody actually said that Tuesday, but it was true: The Eagle -
a Coast Guard ship that led the OpSail flotilla - was the first
vessel to dock at historic South Street Seaport. Several hundred
people cheered as two small tugboats nudged the 295-foot-long
vessel flush with the old wooden pier without so much as a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Next to dock at the seaport was the Niagara, a two-masted,
square-rigged sailboat that was built in 1813, and then the
Danmark, a steel-hulled Danish ship that was welcomed by several
dozen Danes on the pier waving their country's flag - a white cross
on a red background.
</P>
<P>
   The Danmark, which was to dock right across from the Eagle in a
slip barely 75 feet wide, aborted one attempt to land, backed up,
sent sailors up the mast to tie up the billowing sails, and then
pulled smoothly in to the dock on its second try.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish Consulate's cultural attache, Irene Krarup, sighed
with relief and cheered as the ship came to a stop. ''They almost
couldn't fit through that little hole,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people gathered at the Riverbank State Park in
Harlem to watch the ships travel up the Hudson. Adante Smith, 7,
whose tongue was pink from eating a cherry ice, knew exactly why
his mother had brought him there from Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm waiting for the pirate ships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of thousands gathered at Battery Park across from the
Statue of Liberty. The spectators applauded as fighter planes
zoomed through the sky in formation, then oohed and aahed as the
first tall ships rounded Staten Island, looking otherworldly as
they approached through the mist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were expecting a faster pace, but it was pretty neat to see
the old-style schooners,'' said Ryan Williams of Cranford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Senkier of Poughkeepsie wielded a camera and a pair of
binoculars for a close-up view, but noticed something funny as he
peered at the crews of the passing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people on the ships are taking as many pictures of us as
we're taking of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   No, that mysterious black UFO wasn't a lost kite or Batman come
to life. It was a Stealth bomber, part of the display of America's
military might that accompanied OpSail. But it swooped over the
city's waterways and skyscrapers so fast that many who saw it
simply shook their heads in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was that?'' asked a jogger on the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A woman walking by just shrugged.

<HEADLINE> Thousands wait long hours for a glimpse of tall ships through the haze </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - As towering tall ships with majestic white sails
paraded through New York Harbor on Independence Day, thousands of
people crowded along the banks of the Hudson River almost as far
north as the George Washington Bridge and waited for a glimpse. And
waited, and waited some more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking as hard as I can but I can't see anything,''
complained George Nyers, a retiree, who sat on the edge of a park
bench craning his neck to see. He and thousands of others were in
place by 10 a.m. along the western edge of Riverbank State Park
around 142nd Street to see the ships.
</P>
<P>
   Children gave up looking as the morning went on, instead going
to massive barbecues in the park accompanied by Latino music.
Several formations of fighter planes flew overhead, but few
onlookers seemed impressed. There were no ships to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   It took a roaring Stealth bomber resembling a huge metal kite to
light up the rows of sweaty faces after 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yo! Yo! Yo!'' shouted a little boy, who jumped up and down and
pointed for his young friends to see.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Cearsy, 36, a fifth-grade teacher, looked up and said,
''Wow. I've only seen those in pictures before. All I know is
they're huge and that they cost a lot. ... But I still don't see
any ships.''
</P>
<P>
   People leaned over the railing, binoculars, cameras or video
cameras poised. But a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, some private white
motor boats and lots of mist were all that could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Cearsy said she felt a raindrop fall as the clouds seemed to
grow darker. But no one seemed ready to give up waiting.
</P>
<P>
   At about 12:40 p.m., the first of the tall ships passed by the
crowded state park. Cannon fire resounded off the western banks of
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yo ahoy matey!'' a half dozen boys in baggy shorts and long
T-shirts screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rodriguez, a church supervisor from the Bronx, grinned
and shouted, ''Muy bonito! (Very pretty!)''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail marked the first return of the tall ships to New
York since 1992's 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's
journey. The 26 Class-A sailing ships, those over 160 feet, came
from 19 countries and had miles of canvas sails. More than 100
smaller wind-powered vessels also were part of the parade of sail.
</P>
<P>
   Waving a small American flag, 70-year-old Juana Pena's face
glowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria,'' she said
in Spanish, as she waved her flag more vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Brenda Lee Childs, 50, who said she was a Cherokee
chief also known as Chief Nightlove Song Secorro, smiled as the
elegant ships sailed by.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been standing here since about 10:30 this morning but it
was worth the wait. ... It shows a part of our legacy - of when the
Spanish came,'' she said, trying to feel what the sight must have
been like for native Americans who saw ships for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can imagine when my ancestors were here and saw the ships
arrive. But I like it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome McArthur, standing nearby, put his feelings in one
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good day to be alive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Master of Sailing, Geometry Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMARONECK, N.Y. (AP) -- C. Stanley Ogilvy, a mathematics
professor at Hamilton College who wrote as expertly about geometry
as sailing, died at his home on June 21. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy taught for 20 years at Hamilton and wrote books and
articles on mathematics, while dozens of articles were written
about his expertise in sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the nautical community as the ''Wise Professor,'' he
raced the class of boat known as the Star, a 23-foot-long, two-man
boat, for more than 30 years, placing third in the world
championships in 1949. Among his numerous victories were the North
American championship and the Austrian national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He then progressed to a larger class of boats, the Etchells,
which use a three-member crew, and had more success, particularly
at competitions of the Larchmont Yacht Club, where he was a member
for 62 years and the official historian.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy attended Williams College, Cambridge University and
Columbia University, eventually earning his doctorate in
mathematics from Syracuse University. In World War II, he commanded
a Navy air sea rescue vehicle in the South Pacific. He taught at
Trinity College before joining Hamilton's faculty in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy's books on sailing included three on one-design racing,
the term for classes of boats, like Stars, in which all boats meet
identical specifications. These were ''Successful Yacht Racing,''
''Thoughts on Small Boat Racing'' and ''Win More Sailboat Races.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy never married. He is survived by a brother, Stephen, of
Westport, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 14, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Edmonds hit a pair of two-run homers and
Andy Benes won his fifth straight decision, leading the St. Louis
Cardinals over the Cincinnati Reds 14-3 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 10th career multihomer game for Edmonds, and second
this season, with both homers going to the opposite field. He hit a
3-1 pitch from Ron Villone (7-6) into the Reds' bullpen in a
six-run first and hit his 24th homer off Scott Williamson in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, who also walked and scored in the second, is 12-for-25
against the Reds this season with four homers and seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Keith McDonald homered in his first major league at-bat, pinch
hitting in the eighth off Andy Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (9-3) struck out eight in six innings, allowing two runs
and six hits to beat the Reds for the second straight start. He's
5-0 with a 3.66 ERA in his last six starts with 48 strikeouts in 39
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire had a much more productive day than Ken Griffey Jr.
in the first meeting between the stars this year. McGwire was
2-for-4 with an RBI double, single and bases-loaded walk while
Griffey was 0-for-3 with a walk and a run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is 1-for-16 with two RBIs in the first five games of a
seven-game trip and is in a 2-for-23 slump.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has won 16 of 21, extending its NL Central lead over
the Reds to nine games. The Reds have lost 18 of 27 since June 4,
when they led the Central by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had its opening-day lineup healthy for the first time
in more than two months. Second baseman Fernando Vina, activated
from the disabled list before the game, did not play, however.
</P>
<P>
   Villone lasted only two-thirds of an inning, allowing six runs
and five hits. Only one run was earned because Shawon Dunston, the
second batter in the first, reached on a fielding error by first
baseman Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone had a sacrifice fly and Eddie Taubensee had an RBI
single in the third for the Reds, and Michael Tucker homered off
Mark Thompson in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The national anthem was a saxaphone solo by St. Louis Rams
all-pro defensive end Kevin Carter. ... Villone threw 47 pitches in
the first. In his last three starts he's allowed 12 earned runs in
10 2-3 innings, and his previous start was a 12-3 loss to the
Cardinals. ... The Cardinals have outscored opponents 94-44 in the
first inning. ... Tuesday's attendance was 46,022, the seventh
sellout in a row at Busch and the 14th of the season.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Might Sell PHALCON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will propose selling an advanced
airborne warning system to China through a third country in hopes
of reducing U.S. pressure to drop the sale, an Israeli TV channel
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Channel Two said Israel's ambassador to Washington, David Ivri,
and Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh would present the proposal
to U.S. administration officials in the coming days. The report,
which cited unnamed Israeli defense officials, did not name a
proposed third country.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh's aide, Hillel Fertouk, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has come under tough criticism in Congress for going
ahead with the $250 million sale of the PHALCON advanced warning
system to China. Some members of Congress say the system presents
an immediate threat to Taiwan, and a potential threat to U.S. air
forces who could conceivably be involved in defending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has all but agreed to give up further PHALCON sales to
China, but fears that scrapping this one -- after the Chinese have
already paid $100 million toward the sale -- would undercut its
carefully cultivated reputation as a reliable arms dealer. Selling
the plane through a third party could allow Israel to lower the
sale's profile in the United States, while saving face with the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional efforts last month to punish Israel for the sale
by cutting its aid collapsed under pressure from the Clinton
administration. But the U.S. ambassador to Israel warned that the
danger of damage to relations still existed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some Israeli officials have noted that U.S.
sales to Saudi Arabia -- technically at war with Israel, and
vulnerable to a takeover by militant anti-Western Islamic militants
-- have included advanced radar systems and combat aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Steinhauer Leads U.S. in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOUFFVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Sherri Steinhauer's par at the final
hole enabled the United States to successfully defend the Nations'
Cup women's golf title Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Coe-Jones, who led by one going to the final hole, could
have earned Canada the victory but missed a par putt. While that
meant Canada and the United States both finished the tournament
with 4&AMP;frac12; points, the Americans won because they were defending
champions.
</P>
<P>
   With the other four singles matches complete and the teams tied
4-4, it came down to Coe-Jones' against Steinhauer over the par-72,
6,400-yard Emerald Hills Golf Club course.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't pretty but that's golf,'' said Steinhauer, a
five-time winner on the LPGA Tour. ''You just have to play with
what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones, who trailed Steinhauer by three holes through nine,
went ahead for the first time at the par-4, 404-yard 14th. The
Canadian, a 17-year LPGA veteran, made a par and took the lead when
Steinhauer, a 15-year pro, settled for a bogey after putting her
drive behind trees in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   After missing a 6-foot birdie putt at No. 15 that would have
given her a two-hole advantage, Coe-Jones surrendered the lead with
a bogey at No. 16 where she put her drive into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones went up by one at No. 17 when Steinhauer bogeyed the
par-5, 440-yard hole after placing her third shot over the green
and into the deep rough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any athlete in any game, be it an overtime goal in hockey or a
winning putt on the last hole, that's what you play for,''
Coe-Jones said. ''I was there and didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't putt well, I didn't hit the ball well and neither did
Sherri. We were just hanging in there. We both made mistakes at
costly times, unfortunately for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada appeared in control heading into the singles competition,
leading 3-1 after splitting the alternate shot matches earlier
Tuesday. All the Canadians had to do was win two of the five
singles matches to avenge last year's 8-1 loss to the United States
in the inaugural tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Americans who dominated singles, winning three of
the four opening matches. Brandi Burton defeated Lorie Kane 3 and
2, Wendy Ward beat Nancy Harvey 4 and 3 and Nancy Scranton downed
Gail Graham 5 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Eathorne claimed the only Canadian victory, defeating
Michelle McGann 4 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauer and Ward earned the Americans their first point,
beating Graham and Coe-Jones 3 and 2 in the alternate-shot event
earlier. Kane and Eathorne won the other match, beating Burton and
McGann 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian captain Sandra Post took no solace in the close finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team believed we were going to win,'' she said. ''And to
say that we did better this year isn't any consolation. We tasted
victory. It was right there.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 10, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- On the anniversary of a grotesque ankle injury
that ended his 1999 season, Jason Kendall revived the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the ninth off Rick
Aguilera and Will Cordero and Pat Meares also homered in the
seven-run inning Tuesday as the Pirates rallied past the Chicago
Cubs 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4 a year ago, Kendall dislocated his right ankle while
landing on first base as he tried to beat out a bunt against
Milwaukee. He needed surgery and his season was over.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pirates trailing 4-3 in the ninth Tuesday, Kendall
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   After Felix Heredia walked pinch-hitter John Vander Wal starting
the ninth, Aguilera (1-2) relieved and retired Adrian Brown on a
flyout. Kendall connected on a 3-2 pitch for his seventh homer and
a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, in an 0-for-15 slump, followed with his 11th homer. The
Pirates added another run on a walk, wild pitch, fly ball and RBI
single by Warren Morris. Aguilera, who blew a save for the sixth
time in 23 chances, finally was taken out to a resounding chorus of
boos after hitting Aramis Ramirez with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay relieved and gave up a three-run homer to Meares
that made it 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Wilkins (2-0) pitched a perfect seventh and eighth for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had scored three in the fourth for a 4-2 lead. Sammy
Sosa walked and Ricky Gutierrez singled, and Willie Greene's liner
went off Brown's glove in right to tie the game at 2. Damon Buford
followed with an RBI single and Cubs starter Kevin Tapani had a
run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh closed to 4-3 in the eighth on Ramirez's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had forged a 2-1 lead in the fourth off Tapani on
singles Kevin Young, Ramirez and Meares.
</P>

   Chicago loaded the bases with no outs in the third but managed
just one run. Grace hit an RBI single but Brown threw out Kevin
Tapani trying to score from second.
Notes: Sosa made the NL All-Star team for a fourth time, the
second time he's been voted in by the fans. He was injured in 1998
and did not play. ... Pirates manager Gene Lamont said Francisco
Cordova could miss a start but that his elbow problem is not
serious. He was forced to leave Monday's game after four innings
when it began to hurt. ... Brown was activated from the DL, where
he'd been since June 13 with a hamstring injury. Abraham Nunez was
sent to Triple-A Nashville to make room for him on the roster. ...
It was the first time the Pirates had hit three homers in an inning
since Sept. 16, 1997 against Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Lazio marches in three parades to mark July Fourth  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TICONDEROGA, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio
marched in three Fourth of July parades in northern New York on
Tuesday while trumpeting his accomplishments for veterans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pointing at his own record, Lazio's campaign
pressed its criticism of Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who was with President Clinton in New York City observing
OpSail 2000, the parade of tall ships on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's out taking an aircraft carrier for a vanity cruise and
we're out here on Main Street,'' said Lazio political strategist
Mike Murphy. ''I think it really tells the story of the difference
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast for Korean War veterans in Saratoga Springs
earlier Tuesday, Lazio himself questioned the first lady's
commitment to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it goes back to, you know, 'What have you done for New
York?''' Lazio said. ''When New York needed Mrs. Clinton to fight
for veterans health benefits, where was she?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also publicized his support for a number of
veterans-related initiatives in Congress and also claimed he has
fought Clinton administration efforts to divert funding for
veterans benefits from New York to ''southern states like Arkansas
and Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said:
''Rick Lazio's rhetoric doesn't match his record. While Hillary
Clinton worked to make treating Gulf War illness a government
priority, Rick Lazio was voting (in 1995) to cut $1 billion from
the Administration's veterans budget.''

<HEADLINE> Canada's huge energy exports boost state's fortunes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - What is one of the biggest energy suppliers
to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Try Canada (the trick is including natural gas). And that means
a boost in energy commerce for New York state, The Buffalo News
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're using a lot more natural gas than we were years ago, and
we're finding significant supplies of it in Canada,'' said Gary
Davidson, a spokesman for the New York State Energy Research and
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Between 20 and 30 percent of the natural gas burned in New York
state now comes from Canada, and that's expected to jump in coming
years as pipeline capacity expands dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The increased supply should help hold down Northeast energy
costs in the long run, although short-term prices are rising
because demand is high and some planned pipelines are not yet
operating.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies are rushing to tap into the huge supplies of
natural gas and oil in geologically rich Western Canada. The
imported fuel from the north leaves the United States a little less
dependent on the volatile Arabian peninsula and gives Western New
York businesses and consumers a chance to capitalize on our
proximity to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian natural gas exports to the United States nearly tripled
in the last decade, and oil exports doubled. Canada now exports
more than 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year and almost
1.2 million barrels of oil a day to the United States. At 42
gallons a barrel, that's 50 million gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Natural gas is a fuel of choice for electric generation these
days, because it's clean,'' said Phil Teumim, director of the
office of gas and water for the New York Public Service Commission.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's PRI Party Tries to Regroup  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Reeling from the first presidential election
loss in 71 years of power in Mexico, the head of the country's
ruling party has offered to resign and party leaders were in a
power struggle Tuesday to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Institutional Revolutionary Party say many
leaders were resisting President Ernesto Zedillo's choice to lead
the party -- a sign of the dramatic changes that have occurred since
the opposition victory in Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a president's word was virtually law within the
party known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are angry with Zedillo. There is a lot of
irritation and a lot of anger and some even blame him that we
lost,'' said Alfonso Ayenza, an adviser to the defeated
presidential campaign. ''There are people who do not accept it'' --
the president's involvement in choosing the new party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials were expected to meet Tuesday night to decide
whether to accept the resignation offered by Maria Dulce Sauri
almost immediately after the defeat became obvious early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Oceguera, a member of the party's national executive
committee, told reporters that Sauri decided to resign because ''it
was the most natural thing to do after failing to achieve the
objective of winning the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and others would fight to keep her as president, but
many powerful figures were backing other candidates following the
PRI's greatest political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Governors and politicians solemnly shuttled in and out of the
party's sprawling headquarters Tuesday, some speaking briefly with
hordes of reporters waiting outside, others brushing past without a
word.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the PRI's defeated presidential candidate,
Francisco Labastida, his arms raised skyward under the word
''Invincible,'' still decorated the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Zedillo had proposed former Hidalgo state Gov.
Jesus Murillo Karam as the new party president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is only one vote as a party activist,'' said
Angel Rangel, a backer of Tabasco state Gov. Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   While party leaders often have made similar statements, it was
usually immediately after quickly obeying presidential requests.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, other party leaders have proposed Cesar Camacho,
former governor of Mexico state; Manuel Bartlett, a former governor
and interior secretary, and Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett and Madrazo lost to Labastida in the party's first open
primary in November, and had accused him of being Zedillo's
hand-picked candidate. The allegation seemed to help Labastida win
the support of the party's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is the first president to break the party tradition of
naming the candidate who would succeed him -- a freedom that many
party activists did not appreciate, particularly after Labastida
fell to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several party officials have blamed Zedillo for contributing to
the defeat through political reforms and for accepting it too
quickly Sunday night. One party faction even suggested expelling
him from the PRI -- which in the past would have been a bit like a
priest suggesting expulsion of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   President Plutarco Elias Calles founded the PRI in 1929 to help
strengthen presidential control and to resolve the often-bloody
power struggles among the victors of the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The party became synonymous with the government, almost the
nation itself, adopting the red, white and green colors of the
Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   It grew to include the country's leading labor, farm, business
and social action groups, with representatives in every village and
city neighborhood in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Political reforms over the past 15 years gradually eroded its
monopoly on power -- which collapsed spectacularly on Sunday when
Vicente Fox of the National Action Party won by 43 percent to 36
percent over Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat means the party loses control over most of the tens of
thousands of patronage jobs and the social welfare programs that
helped cement its control for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Oceguera said that in the next few days the party will have to
continue working ''without losing the serenity, without rushing
ourselves and without losing the touch and the sense of a
politically democratic direction.''

<HEADLINE> Conserve Wins Firecracker Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Conserve, ridden by Shane Sellers, set
the early pace and held off Riviera by a neck-length for a
wire-to-wire victory in Tuesday's $287,000 Grade II Firecracker
Breeders' Cup for 3-year-olds and up at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Conserve, winner of the Makers Mark Mile at Keeneland in his
last start in April, covered the mile on firm turf in 1:35.12 and
paid $7.60, $3.60 and $2.60.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera, trained by California-based Bobby Frankel and ridden by
Craig Perret, stalked the pace in third but was unable to gain the
lead in the final strides and paid $3.20 and $2.80. King Slayer
finished another two lengths back in third and paid $2.80.
</P>
<P>
   Conserve, the 4-year-old gelded son of Boundary, is owned and
bred by Claiborne Farm and trained by Frank Brothers, who teamed up
to win the Louisville Handicap earlier in the meet with Buff.
Conserve earned $177,940 to increase his lifetime bankroll to
$473,974. The win was his sixth in in 18 career starts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- James Grogan, a figure skater who
won the 1952 Olympic bronze medal and was a four-time silver
medalist at the world championships, has died. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan died suddenly Monday of multiple organ failure at St.
Bernardine's Medical Center, said his son, J.D. Grogan.
</P>
<P>
   He won Olympic bronze in Oslo, Norway in 1952 as Dick Button of
the United States won the gold. Grogan won the silver medal at four
consecutive world championships, beginning in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Association Hall of
Fame in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving competition, Grogan went on to appear in Arthur
Wirtz's ''Hollywood Ice Review'' and starred in the Ice Capades in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to skate while serving in the Army, where he was
pulled from basic training to appear with Olympic skater Sonja
Henie's European troop show, said Cindy Lang, a publicist with the
Ice Castle International Training Center at Lake Arrowhead, where
Grogan was a coach since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan was instrumental in developing the Ice Castle into a
mecca for world-class skaters such as Michelle Kwan, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Yasuko Grogan, daughter Roko Grogan,
and his son.

<HEADLINE> Successor to embattled mayor who resigned will continue polices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - In his first public statement since embattled
and turbulent Mayor Edward A. Hanna resigned unexpectedly, interim
mayor Timothy J. Julian said he will continue the policies of his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, a Utica political fixture with a knack for drawing
attention nationally for his unconventional, combative style,
resigned unexpectedly effective Tuesday morning. The 78-year-old
Republican said health concerns prompted him to resign. He also
faces sexual harassment allegations made in June by four men who
allege their employment was tied to their responses to the mayor's
advances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hanna denied the allegations, calling them part of
a ''cleverly orchestrated conspiracy to extort money, including
political rewards and control.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's lawyer, Joseph Policelli, countered by telling the
Utica Observer-Dispatch: ''People don't blackmail people by
claiming that they had homosexual activities with somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna's legacy is peppered with outrageous incidents. He once
proposed closing city government and he also built a Tower of Hope
next to City Hall to honor Bob Hope. Hope has no connection to
Utica.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna was also a stern fiscal watchdog. When the city's bonds
received the poorest rating of any city in the country in 1996, the
mayor opined, ''We got just what we deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said he will help Julian, 35, who was common council
president, in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran with the mayor last year believing in his principles and
his theories. I still believe in them and still believe they will
move the city forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna was a self-made millionaire who said he brought ''sound
business practices'' to city government in two two-term stints as
mayor, the first time in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's decision to begin his term as interim mayor with a
hastily arranged news conference was itself a departure from the
style of Hanna, who typically communicated with the media by press
release.
</P>
<P>
   After his prepared statement, Julian answered questions from
reporters for another 20 minutes, until his brother, Robert Julian,
the Republican leader of the Oneida County Board of Legislators,
brought the question and answer session to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Julian said he learned only at 9 p.m. Monday that Hanna had
decided to resign, according to the Utica Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe (he) has been the best mayor this city has ever
had,'' he said. ''I regret his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Julian did not refer to the allegations of sexual misconduct
against Hanna that preceded his resignation, but he stressed that
the business of government would continue without pause despite the
tumult of recent weeks that Hanna referred to as a pressure cooker.

	   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) - A 4-year-old girl's condition improved
Tuesday after she was injured in a weekend head-on collision in
Warren County that killed four people and sent seven others to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Johnelle Ponton of Newark, Del. was in fair condition at UNC
Hospitals in Chapel Hill, a hospital official said. She had been in
critical condition on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's accident occurred when the driver of a Mercury Grand
Marquis hit a guardrail and lost control of the car about 7 miles
south of the North Carolina-Virginia border, the Highway Patrol
said. The car then crossed the median and into the path of a Toyota
Camry.
</P>
<P>
   All of the dead were in the Toyota. The driver, Lailaa Fofana,
53, of Philadelphia, was killed as were passengers Rodney Chavis,
57, of Harrisburg, Pa.; Mary Chavis, 74, of Willlingboro, N.J.; and
Tonia Austin, 15, of Newark, Del. Johnelle and another woman in the
Toyota survived the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The five people in the Mercury were injured - one remained in
the hospital in satisfactory condition. The driver, Estelle
Douglas, 57, of Austell, Ga., was treated for injuries and
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol is not sure why Douglas lost control of the
car. No charges have been filed.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 11, Devil Rays 0  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Dean Palmer had two homers and four
RBIs, and Dave Mlicki won for the first time since May 20 as the
Detroit Tigers beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 11-0 Tuesday for their
season-high fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson and Deivi Cruz also homered for the Tigers, who
got a solo shot from Palmer in the third and three-run shot in the
ninth for his first multihomer game since April 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (3-9), who went 0-4 in six starts since beating Boston,
scattered eight hits in seven innings. He struck out four, walked
none and only allowed two runners beyond first base.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski and Steve Sparks finished the nine-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson and Palmer both hit their 17th homers off Cory Lidle
(1-4). Higginson's was a three-run drive in the first and Palmer's
a solo shot in the third that made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who drove in two runs in the series opener won on Damion
Easley's 10th-inning homer Monday night, finished the Tigers'
four-run third with his three-run homer off reliever Tanyon
Sturtze.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the eighth in nine games for Detroit, which also has
won six in a row on the road. Tampa Bay has lost six of seven,
including four straight.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki allowed two-out, ground singles to left in each of the
first four innings. The Devil Rays didn't get a runner past first
until Jose Guillen was stranded at third after he and Felix
Martinez singled to begin the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Eight different Tampa Bay batters singled off Mlicki, who in two
previous starts -- sandwiched around a pair of scoreless relief
appearances -- had allowed 14 runs and 18 hits in 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit's Juan Gonzalez (left foot strain) and Tony Clark
(back spasms) sat out for the second straight game. Both are day to
day. ... The Tigers have hit 38 homers in their last 18 games. ...
After going 15-11 in June for the best one-month record in
franchise history, the Devil Rays are 0-4 in July ... Tampa Bay
manager Larry Rothschild decided against activating Greg Vaughn
(right hamstring strain) from the disabled list. He's improving and
wants to play, but Rothschild doesn't want to rush his return. The
next target date for getting him back in the lineup is Friday at
Florida.

<HEADLINE> Russia Imposes Curfew in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops in Chechnya threatened to
fire without warning on violators of a new curfew Tuesday as they
rounded up more than 58 suspects in connection with a series of
suicide truck-bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The troops searched several Chechen towns and cities for
suspected rebels Tuesday. Police detained 46 people in the
southwestern town of Urus-Martan, the site of one of Sunday's five
blasts, and a dozen other rebels were captured elsewhere, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian
general staff, said Tuesday that the official military toll from
the bombings was 33 soldiers killed, 84 wounded, and six missing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 civilians were killed, according to the Emergency
Situations Ministry. At least six rebels died when the trucks blew
up.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Federal Security Service, the main successor to
the KGB, on Tuesday blamed lax military commanders for failing to
prevent the bombings despite intelligence warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts ''are the failures of the commanders who are in
charge there,'' Nikolai Patrushev was quoted by the Interfax news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of one the worst bombings recalled the attack on their
barracks in the village of Argun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was watching television with the guys. It's the last thing I
remember. I regained consciousness when the guys were digging me
out of the ground,'' Lt. Vladimir Volodin told The Associated Press
on Tuesday. He suffered a broken leg and a chest injury, and was
scarred by shrapnel wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Volodin was recovering in a hospital in the city of Vladikavkaz,
just west of the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   That blast, which killed 26 soldiers, was one of the attacks on
Russian forces in Chechnya that night -- the Russians' biggest
setback in months. The attacks underscored the difficulty Russia is
having in defeating the rebels, despite far more troops and fire
power.
</P>
<P>
   Volodin said fighting was raging as he regained consciousness
and it took two hours before he was extracted from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Another soldier injured in Argun said that despite shrapnel
wounds and a broken pelvis, he managed to return rebel fire after
the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the explosion, I managed to get out of the debris on my
own,'' said Lt. Sergei Yefremenko. ''Fighting was in progress. I
rushed to my platoon's location, unaware of the pain, snatched a
machine gun and began firing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yefremenko said rebels opened fire with grenade launchers after
the blast. He said he passed out from the pain after he started
shooting and didn't see the end of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have now threatened to fire without warning on
any vehicle that violates a new curfew in Chechnya. Security was
also tightened in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft and artillery on Tuesday bombarded the Argun
and Vedeno gorges, which are key rebel refuges, and the southern
regions of Itum-Kale and Shali.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned in September, after Islamic militants raided several
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in a series of apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the alleged leaders of the Dagestan invasions, Magomed
Tagayev, was arrested in Turkey last week, Dagestan police said
Tuesday. They said Russia will ask Turkey to extradite him.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 9, Mets 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mark Kotsay tied the score with a two-run double
and came home with the go-ahead run on the front end of a double
steal as the Florida Marlins used a six-run fifth inning to beat
the New York Mets 9-8 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which began its comeback from a 5-0 deficit on Alex
Gonzalez's three-run homer in the fourth, has won five straight for
the first time since a seven-game streak last Aug. 6-13.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby M. Jones (0-1), recalled from the minor leagues before the
game, led 5-3 in the fifth but walked pinch-hitter Mark Smith, then
allowed Luis Castillo's single and Kotsay's double.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd reached on an infield single, with Kotsay advancing.
Pat Mahomes relieved and Floyd broke for second on the first pitch
to Preston Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   When catcher Todd Pratt threw to second, Kotsay broke for the
plate and scored as Pratt's one-hopper got away from shortstop
Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   After walks to Wilson and Derrek Lee loaded the bases, Mora's
two-out error on Mike Redmond's grounder allowed Floyd to score.
Smith followed with a two-run single that made it 9-5, with Redmond
tagged out during a rundown between home and third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza's 21-game hitting streak ended when he pinch hit in
the ninth and grounded into a fielder's choice. Piazza was not in
the Mets' lineup because of a slightly bruised left elbow sustained
in New York's 2-0 loss Monday night, when he was hit by Wilson's
back swing in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseco, who gave up a leadoff homer to Edgardo
Alfonzo, escaped a two-on, one-out jam for his major league-leading
26th save in 29 chances, striking out Pratt and Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile's two-run homer off Ron Mahay in the sixth had pulled
the Mets to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Darensbourg (4-0) pitched a scoreless inning in relief of
starter Brad Penny, who allowed five runs, three hits and six
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell had four RBIs, three on a fourth-inning homer, as the
Mets built their lead. Bell also was hit by an 0-2 pitch with the
bases loaded in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk before the game, gave up
seven runs -- six earned -- and six hits in four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Marlins rallied from five runs down to win for the
fourth time this season. ... To make room for Jones, the Mets
optioned RHP Jim Mann to Norfolk. ... With postgame activities
including fireworks and a concert by Eddie Money, the game drew
24,935.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Aims Toward Self-Sufficiency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba plans to become self-sufficient in the
generation of electricity within five years fueling power plants
entirely gas and oil from Cuban wells, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about half the electricity on the island of 11
million people is generated at plants fueled by fuels mined
domestically, said Eredio Puentes, head of business administration
for the state's Western Oil Drilling and Extraction Company, or
EPECO.
</P>
<P>
   Puentes told journalists touring Havana province, which
surrounds the capital city, that the other half of the fuel Cuba
needs for power is imported. He did not provide details on where
the crude comes from or how much it costs.
</P>
<P>
   Puentes said the nation's goal is not to import any at all
within four or five years
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has moved toward becoming more self-dependent in petroleum
and many other sectors of the economy in the decade following the
collapse of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eastern Bloc fell apart, Cuba was dependent upon its
former allies for most of its petroleum and the economically
difficult years on the island that followed were marked by
widespread blackouts caused by lack of fuel. Gasoline for vehicles
was strictly rationed and streets were near empty.
</P>
<P>
   Before the collapse, Cuba consumed about 11 million tons of
crude annually, Puentes said. The country has learned to live with
less through aggressive energy-saving programs and now consumes
about 8 million tons of crude every year, he said.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Rooney scored on a header in
the second half as the Miami Fusion rallied to beat the New England
Revolution 2-1 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney scored the game-winner in the 55th minute as he slid
across the goal in front of New England goalkeeper Jeff Causey, and
headed a short corner kick by Diego Serna. It was Rooney's fourth
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   New England took a 1-0 lead in the third minute on a goal by
Wolde Harris, who converted a pass from John Harkes.
</P>
<P>
   Miami tied it in the 30th minute when Henry Gutierrez converted
a penalty kick. It was the first successful penalty kick in four
attempts against Causey this season.
</P>
<P>
   An apparent tying goal for the Revolution in the 90th minute was
disallowed by referee Sergio Vega when he ruled that an own goal by
the Fusion's Pablo Mastroeni was a result of the Revolution's
Mauricio Wright pushing Mastroeni from behind.

<HEADLINE> Federal cash to come to Delaware beaches for rebuilding  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEWEY BEACH, Del. (AP) - To Robert Fredericks, the shorts and
sunglass-wearing mayor of this resort town, the sand under his feet
is no ordinary mineral.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sand is something we treat like gold,'' he said. ''We
groom it, we maintain it.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the attention may not be healthy. Some of Delaware's
beaches, visited by thousands from Maryland, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C. each weekend, are steadily being swallowed up by
the ocean. And the solution - the largest beach-rebuilding project
in state history - is on hold, awaiting action on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives has budgeted more than $3.5
million to rebuilding Delaware's beaches - half of what state
leaders say is needed to complete the Rehoboth Beach-to-Fenwick
Island project. If approved by the Senate, the budget must pass the
Clinton administration, a longtime foe of beach restoration
projects.
</P>
<P>
   If no federal dollars are budgeted for Delaware's beaches, the
state will do what it can with $3.4 million of its own money, said
Robert Henry, administrator of the Shoreline and Waterway
Management Section of the state Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control.
</P>
<P>
   Given the delays, tourists won't have more sand to lay their
towels on until the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches can't wait forever. A report released last week
found Sussex County has one of the highest rates of coastal erosion
in the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated
that rising sea levels will eat away at an average of 3-4 feet of
beach every year for the next 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting beach loss, however, is an inexact science, said
Wendy Carey, a coastal processes specialist with the University of
Delaware Marine Advisory Serve and Sea Grant College Program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been going to Rehoboth for 30 years now, and maybe the
beach is a little more narrow now, but not down at the south end of
the boardwalk,'' Carey said. ''It's the same as it was in 1964.''
</P>
<P>
   The science of restoring beaches is also subject to debate. Some
advocate for what is known as a ''retreat'' policy: Abandon the
beaches to nature's ebbs and flows, and allow homes and buildings
to fall in the ensuing erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks opposes letting nature take its course. Besides the
private houses that would be lost, there are millions of dollars
worth of coastal roads, sewers and other infrastructure that would
be swept away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't any sand deposited on the beach in a restructuring
project just eventually be lost again?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, Carey said. People tend to think of the beach
as only the area where they can lay their towels, she said.
Scientists, however, know the beach includes a wide, flat span in
front of the ''towel beach'' that lies under just a few feet of
water. Most of the sand that appears to wash away is simply moved
onto that flat span. When the currents change, the sand is
redeposited on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't disappear,'' Carey said. ''The sand stays in the
system, adjusting to the waves and the profile of the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding a beach is a massive public works project, with
bulldozers and graders smoothing out wet sand pumped up from the
ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps has yet to find a sand bar appropriate for the
Delaware beach project, Henry said. The Corps scrapped its first
choice of an offshore shoal after concerns of damage to shellfish
habitat were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes odd problems crop up in a beach replenishing project.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state pumped 1.3 million cubic yards of sand from
the ocean floor onto the beaches of Bethany Beach and Fenwick
Island.
</P>
<P>
   First, the grain of the sand turned out to be too small, making
the dunes more vulnerable to erosion. Then, treasure seekers found
unexploded 40 mm shells - believed to have been fired into the
ocean decades before by National Guard tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But that's no reason to give up beach restoration, supporters
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in pretty good shape now, barring a hurricane or a
nor'easter,'' Fredericks said. ''But we need this to happen. It
absolutely would be a death sentence if it didn't. Our beach would
surely, slowly go away.''

<HEADLINE> Janitors Write Demands in Blood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A group of striking public hospital
janitors used their own blood Tuesday, drawn with hypodermic
needles, to write out their demands for salary increases, better
working conditions and greater job security.
</P>
<P>
   About six janitors, demanding 50 percent pay hikes, wrote their
demands on white towels in front of Congress. Three nurses were on
hand to assist in drawing the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want dignified salaries,'' said Carlos Galvan, who led the
demonstration. ''We want money, funds so that hospitals can
function with dignity to the benefit of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The janitors earn an average monthly salary of about $50.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,000 public hospital workers, including janitors,
administrators and technicians, have been on partial strike since
late April. The strike has been carefully orchestrated to avoid
interfering with emergency medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Maria Perez said that ''with this blood, we want to
bring greater attention to the poor who have nowhere else to go,
other than the public hospitals'' for medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   President Gustavo Noboa said Monday that the cash-strapped
nation does not have the resources to increase hospital spending.
Meanwhile, Labor Minister Martin Insua pledged to negotiate a
solution to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Public school teachers ended a 46-day walkout on Thursday after
the government agreed to increase starting pay, which had stood at
dlrs 40, by 81 percent and promised not to privatize the public
school system.

   Four police officers were hospitalized Tuesday trying to break
up a scuffle at Ocean Beak State Park in New London. Police said
the scuffle started as a family dispute, and escalated into a brawl
around 3 p.m. Police used pepper spray to control the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were arrested. Two bystanders - including a
12-year-old child - also were entangled in the scuffle. None of the
injuries appear to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   As of noon Monday, state police said they had issued 551 tickets
for not wearing a seatbelt, and 1,380 tickets for speeding.
Authorities also made 67 arrests charging motorists with driving
under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   More arrests and tickets were issued Tuesday, but specific
figures would not be released until Wednesday, said Sgt. Paul
Vance, state police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers definitely are going to go up,'' Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   State police reported no major traffic tieups Tuesday evening,
but traffic was expected to build into the night as vacationers
returned home from the long holiday weekend.

<HEADLINE> Cops Attacked in Northern Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Anti-Catholic extremists
menaced the streets of Northern Ireland for a second night Tuesday,
with masked youths in hard-line Protestant neighborhoods hijacking
and setting vehicles on fire and police exchanging shots with
gunmen in a Protestant area of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Rage flared in the British territory, bracing for what is
expected to be a week of violent Protestant revolt over British
authorities' determination to restrict traditional Protestant
parades in Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary outlaws coordinating the mayhem from behind the
scenes have warned that rioting will intensify if the Orange Order,
a legal Protestant fraternal group, isn't allowed to conduct a
banned march through the main Catholic district of Portadown on
Sunday. Britain and the province's police commander, Chief
Constable Ronnie Flanagan, say that won't be allowed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Annual confrontations over Orangemen's thwarted efforts to
parade down the disputed Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 30 miles
southwest of Belfast, ignited widespread street violence in 1996,
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Relative peace reigned last year after Orange leaders opted not
to challenge a police blockade at their Portadown march's midway
point, an Anglican church near the Catholic area. But history
appears set to repeat itself with tensions and destruction mounting
-- and some of the province's most feared terrorists returning to
the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from all sides Tuesday criticized Johnny ''Mad Dog''
Adair, a leading Belfast member of the outlawed Ulster Defense
Association who was paroled from prison this year under the terms
of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said police returned gunfire after
they were fired on from an area near lower Shankhill Road, where
Adair is Ulster Defense Association commander.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, infamous for boasting about his past slayings of Catholic
civilians, led more than 100 supporters late Monday to the
confrontation zone outside Portadown where police and soldiers have
been blocking Orangemen from reaching the nearby Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Adair and his entourage cheered at three masked men from
a Portadown-based terror group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, as
they fired a volley of shots into the air from handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fellow loyalists, once again the British government and the
IRA are trying to take away our God-given right to complete the
march from Drumcree church,'' the lead masked figure said in a
speech widely broadcast Tuesday in Northern Irish news bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Step by step they are trying to walk over us and get us to lie
down. We cannot let this happen,'' the masked figure said,
concluding, ''It is up to us to defend our country. No surrender!''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Ulster Defense Association and Loyalist Volunteer Force
are supposed to be observing cease-fires, just like the Irish
Republican Army, which draws support from the most militant
Catholic areas, such as Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's demonstration was the first time the two anti-Catholic
groups had demonstrated such a close alliance in public, a sign
that extremists were taking a more coordinated approach to this
year's violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police set up a phone hotline to advise motorists
which areas to avoid. As darkness fell, Belfast's streets were
largely deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants ran onto roads to block cars in several places.
Those who didn't stop risked having their car pelted with missiles
and stolen.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter accelerated past a hail of stones
and bottles as he drove past a gathering of missile-wielding
teen-agers and men in predominantly Protestant east Belfast. Two
recently hijacked cars were already ablaze and sending plumes of
black smoke into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, several hundred Protestants gathered near the rows
of riot police and armored cars blocking the path toward Garvaghy
Road fanned out into the cow pastures flanking the Anglican
Drumcree church to throw firecrackers and gasoline bombs at police
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In response, police deployed two Belgian-designed armored cars
equipped with water cannons. One doused the lead ranks of rioters,
forcing them back up the hill toward the church.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported that Protestant protesters had blocked key roads
in at least six other towns in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic protest groups led by paroled IRA members began
blocking the most controversial Orange parade routes in 1995,
forcing police to decide whether to confront the protesters or the
marchers. In Portadown, a bastion of support for the conservative
Protestant brotherhood, Orange leaders have refused to negotiate
with the Garvaghy Road protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics despise Orange parades, which often feature
drum-thumping ''kick the pope'' bands and commemorate Protestant
victories over Catholics. More than 2,000 such parades are staged
each summer, only a few dozen of which go through predominantly
Catholic areas.

<HEADLINE> Military Unrest in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- High-rise offices were empty and
streets abandoned in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Tuesday as
soldiers erected makeshift barricades and raced around in stolen
vehicles with rifles bristling.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by disgruntled army officers demanding perks closely
resembled a brief army mutiny that led to the nation's first coup
d'etat last December. And while officials and soldiers were
negotiating an end to the latest impasse, many civilians feared
another takeover in what had been one of Africa's most stable and
prosperous nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of these soldiers using guns to disrupt our
lives. We want democracy,'' said Nogbou Mensah, a taxi driver in
the Cocody suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest began with a burst of gunfire at 4 a.m. that lasted
for 30 minutes in several parts of Abidjan. Another round of
shooting occurred in the posh residential and commercial district
of Deux Plateau, around 9:30 a.m., and a smattering gunfire was
heard later.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy buildup of soldiers on foot and in armored personnel
carriers was visible around the airport, state broadcasters and the
presidential mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. and Canadian embassies both said the
security situation was unclear and advised their citizens not to
venture into the streets. Some border posts were reportedly closed
and at least two airlines, Air France and British Airways, on
Tuesday suspended international flights from Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   State radio announced a general curfew between 7:00 p.m. and
6:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers also blocked roads in several other Ivory Coast cities
and sporadic shooting was reported near a military base in the
northern town of Korhogo.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mostly young army officers, have demanded lump
sums of $9,000 each to buy houses. Ivory Coast's cash-strapped
government cannot afford to meet the soldiers' demands, Information
Minister Henri Cesar Sama said.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy talks with military leader Gen. Robert Guei, a
spokesman for the rebels, Corp. Aboukary Kone, called on his
comrades to return to their barracks, saying the government had
agreed to form a committee to assure the soldiers' demands were
met.
</P>
<P>
   But Kone, who appeared in a television broadcast wearing
camouflage fatigues and surrounded by five churlish colleagues, was
unrepentant for the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time a soldier takes up his arms, it is not against the
people. It is about fighting injustice,'' Kone said.
</P>
<P>
   In another state television address, Guei accused soldiers whom
he called ''sick in the head'' of robbing banks in Korhogo and the
central city of Bouake. He said the military regime was doing its
best to meet the soldiers' demands for 2,500 houses. Yet he stopped
short of making promises to the rest of the estimated 10,000-strong
military.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, protesting soldiers -- some drinking beer and
threatening civilians who ventured into the streets -- continued to
cruise the streets in taxi, jeeps and other seized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At a military checkpoint outside the state television station, a
surly soldier driving a luxury car said: ''Tell the world this: The
government is stealing from the treasury and we have had enough. We
want our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Sama, the Information Minister, accused
unnamed politicians of fomenting the unrest ''in order to gain
power by any means.'' Authorities were searching for the
instigators, he said. No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to avoid bloodshed. It is still not over,'' Sama
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military protest came amid mounting political and ethnic
tensions in this West African country, which until the December
coup had long been one of the continent's most prosperous and
stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer and the
scare prompted cocoa prices on the London futures exchange to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections for Sept. 17, but has not said
whether he will run.

<HEADLINE> Gay Advocates Arrested at Protest  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A day before the Episcopal Church's national
debate on homosexuality, dozens of gay and lesbian advocates were
arrested Tuesday during a protest and conservative members unveiled
a campaign saying homosexuals can change their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   At issue at the 10-day Episcopal General Convention, which
begins Wednesday, is a proposal to codify the 2.4 million-member
denomination's unofficial policy of letting each diocese decide the
role of gays and lesbians in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives complain the measure violates church and biblical
teachings. Liberals say it doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Soulforce, a gay and lesbian advocacy group that protested on
the steps of the Colorado Convention Center, just wants the debate
to stop and homosexuals to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 30 years they've been discussing this. We're asking them
now to resolve it,'' said Mel White, a founder of Soulforce and a
minister in the Metropolitan Community Churches.
</P>
<P>
   The group protested at recent Presbyterian and United Methodist
national conventions, where delegates opposed consecrating same-sex
unions and ordaining gays.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, White led more than 100 protesters wearing T-shirts
with the slogan ''Stop spiritual violence.'' After singing songs
from the civil rights movement and listening to speakers, the
activists held hands in front of the convention center and waited
for police to handcuff and lead them away to be cited for
trespassing and disobeying police.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first arrested was Jimmy Creech of Raleigh, N.C., a
United Methodist minister who was defrocked in November for
blessing same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, members of the American Anglican Council, a
group of conservative Episcopal clergy and lay members, launched a
campaign aimed at refocusing the church on traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   The council acknowledged that the claim by some religious groups
that homosexuals can be converted to heterosexuality is
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. David Anderson of Newport Beach, Calif., said the
''God's love changed me'' campaign is intended to reconcile
Episcopalians, not drive them apart.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Cox Ejected After Argument  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was ejected from
Tuesday night's game with the Montreal Expos in the second inning
following a lengthy argument with plate umpire Derryl Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   With the Expos leading 2-0 and a runner on second with one out,
Cox popped out of the dugout to argue when Cousins called a 2-2
pitch by Greg Maddux a ball on Expos batter Peter Bergeron.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux also disagreed and, after a few words, Cousins pointed at
Maddux to get back on the mound and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After Bergeron struck out, Cox again came out of the dugout and
went nose-to-nose with Cousins, noticeably infuriated.
</P>
<P>
   This time the argument apparently was over catcher Fernando
Lunar's setting up with one of his feet outside the catcher's box.
</P>
<P>
   After Cox's non-stop outburst lasted some two minutes, he was
ejected by Cousins. Cox then appeared to bump Cousins' side with
his elbow as he followed the umpire halfway down the third base
line.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta coach Pat Corrales and third base umpire Jeff Nelson
finally got between the two as Cox was cheered on by the big crowd
to the chants of ''Bobby, Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cox was leaving the field, the crowd stood and gave the
manager a huge ovation.

<HEADLINE> Michigan has Liberty, Freedom and Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIBERTY, Mich. (AP) - Michigan is a state with Liberty, Freedom
and Independence - according to the map anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like most states, Michigan has its share of patriotically named
cities, townships and lakes that might be perfect places to
commemorate the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the original settlers were drawing a town on the map, it
was usually an individual or a few individuals who were naming
it,'' said Sandra Clark, director of the Michigan Historical
Center. ''They'd name cities according to what their whims might
be, and they often were trying to make a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, a town in southern Jackson County, came from
Revolutionary War activist Patrick Henry's famous speech: ''Give me
liberty or give me death,'' according to the book ''Michigan Place
Names.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the town founder's apparent zeal for American
patriotism, don't look for an exciting Independence Day celebration
in Liberty. The closest festivities are in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Early settlers weren't always as showy with their patriotism as
the founders of Liberty, where the township hall proudly proclaims
''freedom rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Lansing for example. A group of settlers from New York
named the city after Lansing, N.Y., which itself was named after a
Revolutionary War hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've usually got is a small group of farm families
getting together and deciding they're a town,'' Clark told The
Jackson Citizen Patriot for a story published Tuesday. ''If they're
going to form a town, they need a name, and they often choose the
place they moved from.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true of Independence Township in Oakland County. It was
named after Independence, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For some in the Detroit area, patriotic names came from local
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Hamtramck received its moniker from the American
colonel who oversaw the transfer of Detroit in 1796 from Britain to
the United States, according to Michigan Place Names.
</P>
<P>
   Some Detroit residents in 1825 named Ypsilanti after Demetrius
Ypsilanti, a hero in the Greek war of independence in the early
1820s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for every unusual name, Clark says, there are dozens of
obvious examples of early patriotism in action. The names of the
United States' first presidents show up frequently.
</P>
<P>
   And some Michigan counties - Van Buren, Calhoun and Eaton - were
named in the early 1830s after members of President Andrew
Jackson's cabinet.

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - The Declaration of Independence
painstakingly copied to a cloth 9 feet by 12 feet is hanging again

</P>
<P>
   James Mathias' tribute on white drop cloth complete with the
founding fathers' signatures waved for 40 July Fourths at his
Saratoga Springs home 25 miles north of Albany. The former history
professor at Yale University spent a full winter on the work he
displayed proudly since the late 1950s. But when he died seven
years ago, the tradition died, too.
</P>
<P>
   This year his wife, Barbara, 87, who also has a doctorate in
history with a concentration in British history, revived the
tradition elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the black script on white background waved from the
Woodlawn Commons senior citizen apartments. Barbara Mathias says
she's thrilled she could renew the tribute.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Rescued in South Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DASSEN ISLAND, South Africa (AP) -- Lying on his stomach, Tony
Williams reached into a burrow, grabbed a terrified penguin chick
by the neck and put it in a ventilated cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   The chick rescued Tuesday was one of more than 10,000 birds
relocated since Sunday from Dassen Island off South Africa's west
coast to save them from swimming through an oil tanker's spill.
</P>
<P>
   Dassen Island has the world's largest colony of penguins, and
the three-day operation is the largest evacuation of wild birds
ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster began when a Panamanian tanker, the Treasure, sank
six miles off Cape Town on June 23 with 1,300 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
   The slick quickly hit Robben Island, which has the world's third
largest number of African penguins, and last Wednesday reached
Dassen Island.
</P>
<P>
   Marine biologist Dr. Tosh Moller said at least 500 tons of oil
had escaped from the Treasure, 100 tons more than other estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The animal welfare fund said about 44 percent of the African
Penguin population, estimated at between 150,000 and 180,000 birds
had been affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Dassen Island's bays, where up to 4,000 penguins
usually nest, just a few hundred remain.
</P>
<P>
   Williams estimated between 5,000 and 10,000 birds on Dassen
island had become contaminated with oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to remove oiled birds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Captured birds were flown off the island by helicopter Tuesday,
then trucked eight hours up the coast, where they will be released
into the ocean to swim home -- a journey expected to take about 11
days.
</P>
<P>
   However, with cleanup operations hampered by unfavorable
weather, there are growing fears the oil slick will still be there
when the penguins return home.
</P>
<P>
   The International Fund for Animal Welfare, said its survey
flight Monday showed the slick now covered about 20 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-mile-long stretch of coast -- which includes some of the
city's most popular beaches -- has also been coated in oil. Cleanup
operations are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of oil-coated birds are being treated at
rehabilitation centers in Cape Town -- the bulk of them collected
from Robben Island, four miles off Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   International wildlife experts from the United States, Britain,
Europe and Canada have flown in to help deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Scarth, South Africa director of the fund, said Tuesday
the rehabilitation process was beginning to run smoothly and they
soon would be washing between 500 and 1,000 birds a day.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists turned their attention Tuesday to the older
chicks who will be ready to fend for themselves within a few weeks.
In the interim, they are to be hand-reared on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are far fewer birds on the island than we thought --
clearly many are still at sea,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The island's birds were fenced in Friday to prevent them from
entering the polluted water to fish. The fences were removed
Tuesday to enable those birds who had not been captured to resume
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists hope they will not encounter the oil slick.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A Continental Airlines flight was
forced to return to Anchorage when a passenger hurled a can of beer
at a flight attendant and bit one of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Linda Lozano, 38, address unknown, was arrested and
charged with crimes aboard an aircraft, which include interfering
with the flight crew and assault, according to the FBI in
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurred aboard Flight 120 Tuesday as it headed to
Seattle and then Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Lozano began arguing with her boyfriend and
became unruly when a flight attendant asked her to calm down. She
threw a full can of beer which she brought aboard the aircraft,
hitting the flight attendant and splashing beer on passengers,
including a 3-month-old baby, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer left the cockpit to help. When he tried to
restrain Lozano, she bit him on the wrist, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers kept the woman restrained until the flight reached
the gate and she was removed from the plane. The flight took off
about three hours later.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Kazutoyo Arai, pencil-slim at 5 foot 6 and 100
pounds, led a Japanese sweep of Tuesday's annual hot dog eating
contest at Nathan's in Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   Arai, 32, of Saitama, Japan, ate a record 25 hot dogs during the
12-minute contest. He was the 1997 champion with 24.
</P>
<P>
   Arai was named the 2-to-1 favorite to win the contest by Bally's
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 was 24-year-old Misao Fujita, who ate 24 franks. Their
teammate, 22-year-old Takako Akasaka, the lone female contestant,
placed third with 22.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner, Steve Keiner, 51, of Egg Harbor, N.J., was
far back in the pack with a mere 15 hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Keiner's 1999 victory was tarnished when TV replays seemed to
indicate he started eating a split second before the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest has been
held for 85 years on the Fourth of July.

Mexico's President-Elect Lays Out Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect today laid out sweeping plans
for a new justice system, a more human rights-oriented foreign policy and a
multiparty Cabinet. Opposition leader Vicente Fox, who won Sunday's presidential
elections, also pledged to eliminate the posturing and tension in U.S.-Mexico
relations over the two countries' border, where immigration-related incidents
have sometimes broken into violence in recent months.

Teachers Debate Bonus Systems
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- As a teachers' union meeting in Chicago began reconsidering
longtime resistance to bonus systems, another union reported today from
Philadelphia that teachers still get paid much less than other professionals.
''The teaching profession often isn't even in the horse race,'' Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers, said at a news conference in
Philadelphia. In the 1998-99 school year, the average teacher made $40,574, the
AFT said in its annual salary report.

Bush Back in Texas for Holiday
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELTON, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush spoke of patriotism today as he
joined a small town Independence Day parade, never mentioning presidential
opponent Al Gore. ''I love the 4th of July. I love Texas, it's an honor to be
here,'' Bush told about 2,000 people outside the courthouse. Bush, the
presumptive Republican nominee for president, said, ''Americans cherish liberty
and Americans have sacrificed for it.''

Santa Monica Pier Hostages Rescued
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A gang member wanted for murder shot and wounded
five people and took 15 others hostage on the Santa Monica Pier before being
talked into surrendering and releasing his last two captives early today, police
said. The pier and its small amusement park, restaurants and arcade remained
closed much of the day as police collected evidence and interviewed more than
100 witnesses who were huddled at the west end of the pier during the five-hour
hostage crisis.

Prison Population Drops in Calif.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's prison population declined slightly over the
past year, the first decrease after two decades of spiraling growth. As of late
June there were 161,401 inmates in the nation's largest prison system -- 360
fewer than at the same time last year. Officials said prison population growth
began to slow three years ago. They cited a range of factors, including lower
crime rates, the strong economy and better supervision of parolees.

Tall Ships Parade Through N.Y. Harbor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Like pages of a history book sprung to life, the towering
tall ships led thousands of craft today through New York Harbor for an inspiring
OpSail 2000 that opened the Fourth of July with a visual bang. Spectators came
in from across the metropolitan area and around the world for a rare look at the
floating parade, which included two dozen warships from 14 countries in only the
sixth International Naval Review in history. President Clinton, standing on the
flight deck of the USS John F. Kennedy, was among those impressed by the 11-mile
line of seafaring craft of all sizes and shapes.

Military Unrest in Ivory Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- High-rise offices were empty and streets
abandoned in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Tuesday as soldiers erected
makeshift barricades and raced around in stolen vehicles with rifles bristling.
The protest by disgruntled army officers demanding perks closely resembled a
brief army mutiny that led to the nation's first coup d'etat last December. And
while officials and soldiers were negotiating an end to the latest impasse, many
civilians feared another takeover in what had been one of Africa's most stable
and prosperous nations.

Helms: No Decision on 2002 Race

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms was characteristically blunt about
everything but his own plans in an interview published today, saying he has not
decided whether he would run for a sixth term two years from now. ''I don't
think anybody better get cranked up raising money for the Senate unless they
want to run against me,'' Helms, who has battled health problems, quipped in an
interview in the Raleigh News &AMP; Observer. But he quickly added: ''That's not to
say I'm going to run.''

Armstrong Drops To Third in Tour
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong slipped 24 seconds off the lead
in the Tour de France Tuesday, but it could have been worse. If not for a
penalty on the leading team, Armstrong would have been 44 seconds back. Led by
Laurent Jalabert, who became the overall leader on the third day of the of the
race, the Once team had eight of the top 10 finishers in the day's time trail,
43 miles from Nantes to the Atlantic port of Saint Nazaire, in 1 hour, 25
minutes, 36 seconds. Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was second in the time trial.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Blue Jays-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO: RHP John Frascatore was sensitive about questions
regarding his error in the seventh inning when the Blue Jays' three
miscues allowed the Indians to score six unearned runs and rally
for a 9-4 win. ''We're not allowed to make errors?'' Frascatore
said. ''It was a physical mistake. They weren't mental errors.
Physical errors are part of the game.'' Toronto entered the game
second in the AL -- Cleveland is first -- in fielding. ... Despite
leading the AL East, the Blue Jays didn't have any starters voted
into this year's All-Star game. Toronto's top vote-getter was
Carlos Delgado, who finished fifth amongst first baseman. ''The
All-Star game is an honor. We have players who deserve to be
there,'' said third baseman Tony Batista, who along with Delgado,
will receive strong consideration to be named a reserve. ''I think
those that deserve it will get to go.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RF Manny Ramirez, out since May 29 with a strained
left hamstring, is expected to leave on a second minor league rehab
assignment this week. Ramirez, voted onto the AL All-Star team on
Tuesday despite missing 34 games, took batting practice with the
Indians and has been running outside the past three days. ''I see
him hitting all those homers in BP and I want to stick him in the
lineup,'' said Indians manager Charlie Manuel. ''They (trainers)
keep telling me he's getting better everyday.'' Ramirez
re-aggravated his injury during his first rehab assignment for
Double-A Akron. ... Kenny Lofton hadn't stolen a base in 12 games
before swiping two on Tuesday. In the fourth, he made a headfirst
slide while stealing second. It was the first time he had slid that
way since dislocating his left shoulder while diving into first
base during last year's playoffs. ''It was probably about time for
me to start,'' he said. ''The doctors said I could try it and I
did.''
Orioles-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Mike Mussina, eligible for free agency following
the season, said he won't waive his no-trade clause. Mussina would
be the most attractive pitching prospect available around the July
31 trade deadline. ''When all is said and done, I'd rather play in
Baltimore,'' he said before the Orioles beat the Yankees 7-6
Tuesday. ''I have a no-trade clause and it's my decision and I'm
not giving it up. '' ... Albert Belle, who drove in a team-record
37 runs in June, was selected as AL player of the month. ... SS
Mike Bordick hit his career-high 14th homer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: David Cone lost his fifth straight decision and is
winless in 11 starts since April 28. The last Yankees pitcher to go
winless in 11 starts was Pascual Perez in 1991. ... DH David
Justice was 0-for-4 in his home debut with the Yankees. INF Jose
Vizcaino, also spending his first home game with the Yankees, did
not play. ... OF Bernie Williams, elected to start in the All-Star
game, extended his hitting streak to 14 games, but failed to score
a run, snapping a 13-game stretch. He was five games from tying the
team and major league record of Red Rolfe set in 1939.
Tigers-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Shane Halter caught the eighth inning Tuesday and now
has played all nine positions in the majors. He has played eight
positions for the Tigers and pitched for the Royals against Seattle
in an 18-5 loss on July 17, 1998. ... Todd Jones leads the AL with
24 saves in 25 opportunities. He has not allowed a run since May 24
when he allowed two to Cleveland. He's appeared in 15 games since
then, working 14 1-3 innings. His only blown save was against Tampa
Bay on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Nine hits equaled the most the Devil Rays have ever
allowed in a shutout loss. ... Tanyon Sturtze worked 5 2-3 innings
in relief, matching the longest ever stint for a Tampa Bay
reliever. Bryan Rekar also did it on May 23 against Oakland. ...
The Devil Rays are 0-3 and have been outscored 33-4, including a
pair of shutouts, in three national or regional television
appearances.
Red Sox-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Red Sox pitchers have allowed 39 home runs in the last
18 games. ... SS Nomar Garciaparra was back in the lineup on
Tuesday after a rare day off Monday. He is hitting .424
(53-for-125) since coming off the disabled list May 27. He has
multi-hit games in 11 of his last 15 contests and 30 overall, which
ties him for fourth in the American League. ... Mike Stanley is
hitting .183 (22-for-115) in his last 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: General manager Terry Ryan said even though his No. 1
priority was taken care of when the team agreed to terms with Brad
Radke on a four-year $9 million contract Monday. He still hasn't
made progress on trying to trade second baseman Todd Walker. Walker
is hitting .332 and has scored 46 runs in 55 games at Triple-A Salt
Lake. He also has 10 errors. ... It was ''Dog Day'' at the
Metrodome and fans who bought $5 tickets for their dogs sat in the
left-field bleachers. Money from the event benefited a local
chapter of the Humane Society. The dogs and their owners paraded
around the field prior to the game. About 100 dog tickets were
available.
White Sox-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: After winning in Kansas City on Monday night, the White
Sox had a 12-game road winning streak that was best in the major
leagues since Detroit opened the 1984 season with 17 consecutive
victories away from home. After homering in their first two at-bats
Tuesday night, the White Sox were on pace to shatter their club
record of 198 home runs set in 1998. ... Jon Garland was the
youngest White Sox pitcher to make his major league debut since
Edwin Corea on Sept. 18, 1985. Corea was 19 years, 142 days.
Garland was 20 years, 280 days.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Brian Johnson, who was hitting .208 when he was
outrighted by Kansas City last week, finished seventh in fan
balloting among catchers for the All-Star Game. Mike Sweeney also
finished seventh at first base, although he was batting .352 before
Tuesday night's game with 14 home runs and 75 RBIs.
Athletics-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi became the first A's player to be voted
onto the All-Star team by the fans since 1992 (Mark McGwire and
Jose Canseco). ... Oakland relievers struggled in their first six
games against Texas this season. The A's bullpen allowed 22 earned
runs and 38 hits in 16 innings vs. the Rangers for a 12.37 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers reached the halfway point of the season on
Tuesday night with their worst record since 1990 when the team was
37-44. ... All-Star C Ivan Rodriguez hit 25 homers in his first 78
games this season. He reached 25 homers in his 104th game last
season.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: In their five Wrigley Field games this season, the
Pirates have now scored 17 ninth-inning runs. They had seven
Tuesday for a 10-4 victory and had rallied for six in the final
inning May 6 for an 11-9 win. ... Francisco Cordova, who had to
leave Monday's game after four innings because of a sore elbow,
could miss one start, manager Gene Lamont said. ''It's nothing
serious. Tendinitis,'' Lamont said. Lamont said reliever Jason
Christiansen, who had back spasms Monday, had improved. ... No one
has enjoyed Jason Kendall's remarkable comeback more than friend
and backup catcher Keith Osik, who went to the hospital a year ago
when Kendall dislocated his ankle and needed surgery. ''I didn't
want him to be there alone,'' Osik said. ''He's such a great
player, the way he bounces back. He never gives in. What a battler
he is. Nothing stops him.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Sammy Sosa summoned reporters to his locker Tuesday,
but not to give a trade update or critique of the coverage he's
been receiving the last two weeks. Sosa, saying he wanted to talk
about something different, invited the press to attend his November
birthday bash in the Dominican Republic. He said he also plans to
invite several celebrities, including Donald Trump and Jesse
Jackson. ... Sosa's selection to the All-Star game was his fourth
and the second time he's been voted in by the fans. ''I've just
been a lucky guy with everybody voting for me,'' Sosa said. ''To
have the people behind me supporting me is something special.'' ...
Sosa said he would participate in the home run hitting contest if
asked, although he didn't fare well in the competition last year in
Boston. ... Rick Aguilera's sixth blown saves in 23 chances this
season makes the Cubs' bullpen just 21-of-36 on saves this season.
Reds-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reliever Scott Williamson made his first appearance
in eight days, allowing four runs in 3 1-3 innings after starter
Ron Villone was knocked out in the first. Since May 27, Williamson,
the NL rookie of the year last season, has allowed 16 earned runs
in 16 2-3 innings. ''He hadn't pitched in a week and had plenty of
rest,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ''The games last week never were
the right situation for him.'' ... Pete Harnisch makes his second
start since coming off the disabled list from a shoulder injury on
Wednesday. In his first start he beat Arizona for his first victory
in five decisions, allowing four runs in six innings. ... The Reds
have gone 83 games without a complete game, a franchise record
according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The 1997 team went 80 games
before Dave Burba threw a complete game. The Padres are the only
other team in the majors without a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Pat Hentgen makes his second straight start against
the Reds on Wednesday. He threw five shutout innings, allowing only
two hits, in a 7-3 loss at Cincinnati last Wednesday. ... The
Cardinals have totaled three runs in Andy Benes' three losses. ...
J.D. Drew was 0-for-1 with a walk after entering the game as a
pinch hitter in the sixth, ending a career-best 10-game hitting
streak. He was 15-for-37 during the streak. He played all three
outfield positions, one inning apiece. ''I should have pitched,''
he joked. ... Mike Matheny, who entered the game 1-for-16 against
Cincinnati pitching, matched his career best with three hits and
had three RBIs. He had a two-run single in the first, doubled in
the fourth and had an RBI single in the sixth. ... Eli Marrero, the
Cardinals' backup catcher who's on the disabled list with a thumb
injury, finished eighth in the balloting at his position. ... Andy
Benes is 37-20 with the Cardinals and 103-102 elsewhere. ... Keith
McDonald became only the third player in team history to homer on
his first career at-bat when he connected off Andy Larkin as a
pinch-hitter in the eighth. The 27-year-old rookie joins Wally Moon
(1954) and Eddie Morgan (1936), who also did it as a pinch-hitter.
Mets-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: When Bobby M. Jones started for the Mets on Tuesday,
it marked the first time in New York Mets' history that two
pitchers with the same last name started games in the same season
for the team. Bobby J. Jones pitched six innings Monday night. ...
Mike Piazza, who was not in the starting lineup because of a
slightly bruised elbow, entered the game with a 21-game hitting
streak, longest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Derrek Lee's game-ending homer Monday night was the
first of his career and 12th in Marlins' history. ... The Marlins'
42-41 start is the second-best in team history. The 1997 World
Series champions were 50-36 at the All-Star break.
Expos-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: 2B Jose Vidro has already surpassed his home run total
and matched his RBI total of a year ago. In 1999, he hit .304 with
12 homers and 59 RBIs in 140 games. Prior to Tuesday night's game,
Vidro was hitting .371 with 15 homers and 51 RBIs in 74 games.
''Fifteen home runs was my goal for the whole year. It's
unbelievable that I've already got more than all of last year. I
think the difference is right-handed,'' said the switch-hitter, who
had only one home run a year ago from that side and has five
already this season.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Andruw Jones, who is the only major leaguer to play in
every inning of every game this year, played Tuesday night with a
sore right thumb, which was taped. He hurt it during a swing in
Monday night's 17-1 loss to Montreal. Manager Bobby Cox said Jones
''tweaked'' a ligament in his thumb, but indicated he could play.
Phillies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies won their fourth straight game for
the first time this season, rallying to beat Milwaukee 7-4 Tuesday.
They last won four straight in August 1999. ... The Phillies, up
2-0 in this four-game series, have won their last five series,
taking three of four from Atlanta and two of three from the Mets,
Expos, Brewers and Pirates. They hadn't won five straight series
since 1995. ... Jeff Brantley, who allowed a leadoff home run to
Marquis Grissom in the ninth and then loaded the bases on a double
and two walks, still managed his 12th save by striking out Geoff
Jenkins to end a 5-3 victory over the Brewers on Monday night.
Wayne Gomes also converted 12 straight in 1999. Brantley notched
another save Tuesday afternoon, making him 13 for 13 in 2000. ...
OF Ron Gant may miss antiquated County Stadium. Going into his last
two games there on Wednesday and Thursday, Gant has a .365
(23-for-63) all-time batting average in this park.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Prior to Tuesday's 7-4 loss to Philadelphia, Brewers
managed Davey Lopes talked about Jeromy Burnitz ''breaking loose.''
Burnitz, moved to the cleanup spot despite his .215 average, hit
two doubles, scored once and drove in one as the Brewers rallied
from a 3-0 deficit before surrendering four in the ninth. ... Bob
Wickman blew his second save in his last three opportunities,
giving up four runs to the Phillies. .. The five Brewers starters
have allowed 22 earned runs in their last 75 2-3 innings. All of
those runs were scored in 15 innings. ... Wednesday's starter,
Jamey Wright (4-1), is vying for his seventh straight win against
an NL East opponent. ... The Brewers lead the NL in double plays
with 100 after turning one Tuesday.
Rockies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies are participating in their second road
split doubleheader, though the team has played 11 of them in Coors
Field since the park opened in 1995. ... The Rockies are assured of
a winning record at the All-Star Break for just the second time in
franchise history (1995) ... OF Larry Walker was back in the lineup
after missing Monday's game to rest his sore right elbow. ...
Entering Tuesday's games, the Rockies are 19-18 in games in which
they have not hit a home run. The Rockies' all-time single-season
high for wins without a home run is 20 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants are playing their first day-night
doubleheader in San Francisco history. The second game was added
because the Giants and Rockies were rained out May 7. It's San
Francisco's fifth Fourth of July doubleheader. The last was in
1984, when the Giants were swept by St. Louis. The other three were
in the 1960s. ... OF Barry Bonds missed the doubleheader with a
stress fracture in his right thumb. ''The worst case scenario is he
should be better before the All-Star Game,'' said Giants head
trainer Stan Conte. ... 2B Jeff Kent overcame a 138,000 vote
deficit in the final week to be named as the NL's starting 2B in
the All-Star Game. ''This is a perfect example of a person getting
what he deserves,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker. ''It took Jeff
awhile to get to this point. I'm glad for him big time.'' ... July
4 is the 17th anniversary of Dave Righetti's no-hitter at Yankee
Stadium. Righetti is the Giants' pitching coach.
Diamondbacks-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Randy Johnson isn't the only former Houston Astros
player in the Arizona lineup. Luis Gonzalez is a former Astros
player who has happily adjusted to the Diamondbacks outfield.
''It's exciting to come back here and see some of the people I used
to work with in the Astrodome,'' Gonzalez said. ''I guess the
losing is tough on the veteran guys. There has been a lot of
transition the last couple of years. It doesn't bother us. We're in
first place. We've jelled and come together as a ball club. You
come to the ball park every day knowing that you have a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros' first-to-worst decline in the NL Central
frustrated manager Larry Dierker, but he's understands the process.
''I think it (new faces) is probably good for baseball,'' Dierker
said. ''It will be the exception and not the rule that a low
payroll team gets to the playoffs but it is refreshing. It makes
other teams feel they have a chance. That said, for someone to
rise, someone else has to fall. I'd rather this it be someone else
falling out than us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Bernard Gilkey got off to a great start in
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Signed earlier in the day by the Boston Red Sox after 10 seasons
in the NL, Gilkey singled, doubled and then homered in his first
three at-bats Tuesday night against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, 33, played in 38 games with the Arizona Diamondbacks
this season and became a free agent when he was designated for
assignment June 24. He was hitting .110 and in a 2-for-48 slump
when he was let go.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey has led NL outfielders in assists three times (1993,
1998, 1997). He had been working out with the Red Sox for several
days before he was signed to a contract.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Gilkey, Boston designated outfielder Curtis
Pride for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also recalled left-handed pitcher Tim Young from
Triple-A Pawtucket and optioned infielder Wilton Veras to
Pawtucket.

<HEADLINE> Sports Drug Agency To Investigate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Australian Sports Drug Agency will
investigate claims by a former Olympic discus thrower that
high-ranking Australian Olympic officials had secretly encouraged
widespread drug use among athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Reiterer, a finalist at the 1992 Olympics, said doping
tests had been timed so he would escape detection for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Australians swimmers and track athletes were still using the
banned performance-enhancing substance, human growth hormone, he
was quoted saying in Wednesday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone is undetectable using conventional doping
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterer, the 1994 Commonwealth Games gold medalist, retired
before the 1996 Olympics but made a comeback in 1997 before
quitting again earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was subtly encouraged to take drugs following his
return, adding that he was given advice from ''an Olympic
administrator'' about pending doping tests and about what levels of
certain substances were acceptable in the testing.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were contained in his book ''Positive,'' which
was set to be launched Wednesday in Sydney. He said he didn't mind
being the whistle blower because he wanted Australians to see his
case was just the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterer said he ''witnessed the complicity, mass delusion and
shadowy hypocrisy of sport's public face.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was another guilty athlete swallowed up in a sporting
culture largely organized around the use of illicit drugs,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Sports Drug Agency chief executive Natalie Howson
said there was no evidence to support Reiterer's allegations, ''but
I'll be looking into them very thoroughly and treating them very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our systems are set up against international standards that
are designed to minimize athletes avoiding testing,'' Howson told
the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut inmate dies of heart failure at Wallens Ridge  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A 50-year-old Connecticut inmate at a
maximum-security Virginia prison has died of apparent heart
failure, correction officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence James Frazier, formerly of Bridgeport, died at 1:14
a.m. Tuesday at Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va. ,
said John Armstrong, the state's corrections commissioner. Frazier,
who was serving a 30-60 year sentence for multiple counts of sexual
assault, was pronounced dead at Lonesome Pines Hospital, Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's conviction stems from an incident in 1974 in which he
was convicted of repeatedly raping a woman during a robbery in her
home in Westport, said corrections spokesman Scott Semple.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier had been taken to the prison's medical unit on June 29
for a health problem, but was stabilized, the commissioner said.
After Frazier was cleared by a doctor, Armstrong said, the inmate
became a behavioral problem.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was then restrained in a medical cell, Armstrong said,
where he was later found unresponsive. Staff members tried to
revive him, and Frazier was taken to the hospital on June 29 and
remained on life support until he died Tuesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said preliminary reports show that Frazier suffered
heart failure. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Connecticut and Virginia will investigate the
death.
</P>
<P>
   Wallens Ridge has come under fire in recent months. In April,
David Tracy, a 20-year-old inmate from Bridgeport, hanged himself
in his cell at Wallens Ridge. A month earlier, three Connecticut
inmates were shot with rubber bullets by guards trying to break up
a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Alvin Penn, D-Bridgeport, said inadequate medical
attention was a concern he heard voiced by inmates and their family
members during his recent to the Virginia prison. Penn said he
heard complaints about both the prison's routine medical and
emergency response procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a situation that is occurring at Wallens Ridge,'' he
said. ''There is a pattern that seems to be forming. There needs to
be answers.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Connecticut's contract with Virginia, Wallens Ridge
will not accept inmates with serious medical conditions, said state
Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven. As a result, Lawlor said, the
prison provides ''the bare minimum'' in terms of medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If Frazier had a known medical condition, Lawlor questioned why
the man was sent to Wallens Ridge in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very risky thing to have 500 inmates down there,''
Lawlor said, adding that should there be a lawsuit in connection
with the prison contract, Connecticut would be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But Semple said Tuesday that Frazier met all of the health
criteria to make him eligible for Wallens Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities has
launched an investigation into allegations that the overwhelmingly
white prison staff has hurled racial insults at Connecticut
inmates, beat them and denied access to lawyers and religious
services.

<HEADLINE> Unruly passenger forces flight to return to Anchorage  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE (AP) - A Continental Airlines flight was forced to
return to Anchorage Tuesday when a passenger hurled a can of beer
at a flight attendant and bit one of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Linda Lozano, 38, address unknown, was arrested and
charged with crimes aboard an aircraft, which include interfering
with the flight crew and assault, according to the FBI in
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was somewhat violent,'' said special agent George P.
Stecko.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurred aboard Flight 120 as it headed to
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and then on to Newark, N.J.
The plane left Anchorage at 1:39 a.m. and returned just before 4:00
a.m. It continued on its way about three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Lozano began arguing with her boyfriend and
became unruly when a flight attendant asked her to calm down. She
threw a full can of beer which she brought aboard the aircraft,
hitting the flight attendant and splashing beer on passengers,
including a 3-month-old baby, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Another flight attendant and several passengers intervened. The
first officer was alerted to the problem and left the cockpit to
help. When he tried to restrain Lozano, she bit him on the wrist,
said special agent Phillip B.J. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the captain had already decided to return to
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers kept the woman restrained until the flight reached
the gate and she was removed from the plane.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken into custody by FBI agents and was being held at
the Sixth Avenue Pretrial Facility in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Roy, a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines, said it is
the airline's policy to deny boarding to anyone who is intoxicated
or threatening other passengers. But she said sometimes it's hard
to tell before the flight if a passenger will become unruly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the passengers told authorities the woman was acting
strangely before the flight departed.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said the airline has no record of such an incident occurring
before on a Continental flight departing Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Peacekeepers Make Advances  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers captured a
strategic town from rebels in Sierra Leone, the force commander
said Tuesday, after a rebel attack drove government troops from the
town.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Vijay Jetley said Indian and Jordanian peacekeeping troops,
known as UNAMSIL, moved into the town of Masiaka Tuesday afternoon
following a series of rebel attacks prompted government troops to
pull out of the town overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much fighting occurred and whether there were
any U.N. casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had earlier denied the rebel Revolutionary
United Front had captured the town. Masiaka lies on a key road
junction 45 miles from the capital on the edge of a horseshoe
shaped government cordon around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were not immediately available to comment
on the U.N. takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Masiaka is now under UNAMSIL control,'' Jetley said. ''The
situation is still fluid. We are clearing out the RUF. We are in
considerable strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. advance marked the first time the U.N. peacekeeping
force has used its offensive capabilities to capture territory in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels abandoned a peace accord in May when they seized 500
U.N. hostages and began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, but a fragile alliance of
pro-government forces has lost momentum after initially driving the
rebels further from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a group of rebels ambushed a unit of Jordanian U.N.
peacekeepers on their way from Masiaka, killing one and injuring
four others. The peacekeepers returned fire, killing 11 bodies
which were identified as rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands of
civilians and systematically maimed many more during the West
African country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has vowed to give more muscle to its
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, the world's largest at nearly
13,000 troops, and says it will no longer tolerate attacks on its
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than 200 U.N. armed peacekeepers and unarmed observers
remain surrounded in a U.N. compound in the rebel stronghold of
Kailahun, about 200 miles east of Freetown.

<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- James Grogan, a figure skater who
won the 1952 Olympic bronze medal and was a four-time silver
medalist at the world championships, died Monday of multiple organ
failure. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   He won Olympic bronze in Oslo, Norway in 1952 as Dick Button of
the United States won the gold. Grogan won the silver medal at four
consecutive world championships, beginning in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Association Hall of
Fame in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving competition, Grogan went on to appear in Arthur
Wirtz's ''Hollywood Ice Review'' and starred in the Ice Capades in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to skate while serving in the Army, where he was
pulled from basic training to appear with Olympic skater Sonja
Henie's European troop show.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan was instrumental in developing the Ice Castle into a
mecca for world-class skaters such as Michelle Kwan.
C. Stanley Ogilvy:
</P>
<P>
   MAMARONECK, N.Y. (AP) -- C. Stanley Ogilvy, a mathematics
professor at Hamilton College who wrote as expertly about geometry
as sailing, died June 21. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy taught for 20 years at Hamilton and wrote books and
articles on mathematics, while dozens of articles were written
about his expertise in sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the nautical community as the ''Wise Professor,'' he
raced the class of boat known as the Star, a 23-foot-long, two-man
boat, for more than 30 years, placing third in the world
championships in 1949. Among his numerous victories were the North
American championship and the Austrian national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He then progressed to a larger class of boats, the Etchells,
which use a three-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy's books on sailing included ''Successful Yacht Racing,''
''Thoughts on Small Boat Racing'' and ''Win More Sailboat Races.''

</P>
<P>
   JOHNSBURG, N.Y. (AP) -- Leslie Arthur Sirkin, a geologist who
mapped glaciers' effects on coastlines from Baja California to Long
Island as well as studying local features like the Hudson River,
died on June 25 of a heart attack. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Sirkin was an expert in the stratigraphy, the layered
arrangement of rocks, of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, a vast
expanse of time from 225 million years ago until after the most
recent ice age. It witnessed cataclysmic lava flows, spawned the
dinosaurs, lifted up the Rockies, encased the Northern Hemisphere
in continental glaciers and, toward the end, gave rise to modern
human culture.
John Philip Sousa:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John Philip Sousa, a former reporter for The
Associated Press and travel editor of The San Diego Union who
played a small role in the 1959 Marilyn Monroe movie ''Some Like it
Hot'' died June 30 of cancer. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rosario, Argentina, Sousa became an American citizen
in his late teens and at some point after his arrival, he changed
his last name to Sousa from Guerrico for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sousa worked for the AP in Sacramento, San Diego and Los Angeles
and helped to cover the murder of actress Sharon Tate by Charles
Manson and fellow cult members in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he became a reporter for The San Diego Union and was
named travel editor two years later. He left the paper in 1992
after its merger with The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Sousa, using the stage name Phil Marco, had a number of small
parts in ''Some Like it Hot'' in 1959 with Monroe and Tony Curtis
and ''The Buccaneer'' with Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   Sousa also had a role in the yet-to-be released television movie
''Running Mates'' starring Tom Selleck and Faye Dunaway.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister and a brother.

<HEADLINE> Elian Pays Visit to Hometown  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Without the hordes of journalists who chronicled
his movements in the United States, Elian Gonzalez on Tuesday made
a quiet visit to his hometown for the first time since returning to
Cuba last week, the government said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian visited
the homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents in Cardenas,
about 90 miles east of Havana, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Elian also stopped by his school, where he will resume his
studies in the fall, and played with several of his schoolmates
before he and his family returned to Havana later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   During the day trip, the 6-year-old also went swimming in a pool
at a national park in the nearby tourist resort of Varadero, where
the elder Gonzalez had worked when the national custody dispute
began seven months ago, state television said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the steps have been taken to guarantee the maximum
normality possible,'' said a statement read on a new afternoon
public affairs program designed to inform Cubans about U.S.
policies that affect the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people (of Cardenas), as expected, cooperated completely
to prevent excessive crowds and contribute to the success of the
visit,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement said that the visit was a necessary
step in the child's readjustment after his seven months away. Elian
had never left Cardenas in his life -- not even to visit the capital
of Havana -- before his mother put him on a boat bound for the
United States last November.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after arriving in Havana on Wednesday, Elian asked his
father ''when he could travel to Cuba,'' the statement said. For
Elian, Cuba was Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he knows perfectly well that his homeland is much
larger,'' the statement said. It characterized Elian as
''extraordinarily happy'' and described his health as
''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His schooling is advancing at the speed of light,'' it added.
Elian attended school only sporadically when he stayed with his
great-uncle and second cousin for five months in Miami and Cuban
teachers are working with him to ensure he is ready to enter the
second grade in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The boat carrying Elian to the United States sank off the coast
of Florida, killing his mother and 10 others. After two men on a
fishing trip found the boy floating on an inner tube, the child's
Miami relatives received temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives fought to keep Elian in America but lost the
battle last week. The relatives sought a political asylum hearing
for Elian, saying that the first-grader would suffer political
persecution if returned to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez traveled to the United States to fight to be reunited
with his first-born son and return with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family have been kept away from the media since
shortly after their homecoming last Wednesday. Cuban officials all
along said that they would fight to prevent the kind of massive
media coverage that plagued the child during his stay in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, journalists were allowed to document the arrival at the
airport from a great distance, but police have kept them away from
the specially prepared boarding school where Elian has been staying
with his family since their return.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that Elian and his family would live in the
Havana boarding school for two to three weeks, then take a week's
holiday before resuming their former lives in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro for months has said that his government
would strive to provide Elian and his family with a normal life as
possible and forbade large public celebrations for their
homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he did not want to cause the child to further trauma
by making him a national spectacle, Castro opted not to greet Elian
and his family when they arrived at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the Cuban people's curiosity about the boy, the
government announced that on Wednesday it would put on sale a
special news supplement dedicated to the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-page supplement, entitled ''Elian in his homeland,'' was
to hit the streets in the morning, Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus Prevents Tax Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The government payments that support Queen
Elizabeth II in her official duties will be frozen at $11.9 million
a year for the next decade, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very substantial efficiencies'' by the royal household have
helped create a surplus of $53 million, Blair told the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Blair added that cost-cutting by the royals had reduced overall
spending on the monarchy by 55 percent in real terms over last
decade, though he did not announce those figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the royal household has tightened its
belt, scrapping the royal yacht Britannia and trimming maintenance
costs for its handful of palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy still costs British taxpayers $56 million a year --
including $23 million last year for the upkeep of occupied royal
palaces and $13 million for travel.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement pays for staff wages and other official expenses.
It is reviewed every 10 years, and the present rate of support has
been in effect since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A lower-than-expected inflation rate contributed $23 million to
the surplus. Unspecified royal household cost-cutting saved $12
million, and interest added $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not all politicians were so impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pretty big winter heating allowance,'' said Labor
lawmaker Dennis Skinner, referring to the subsidy received by
pensioners.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Defuses Troop Protest  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military quelled a protest by troops at a
Fiji army base Wednesday, but said local chiefs threatened
disturbances in support of rebels who have been holding 27 people
hostage for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three soldiers who were sympathetic to rebel leader
George Speight had confiscated arms and ammunition Tuesday inside
the base at Labasa, on the northern island of Vanua Levu.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the arms are back in the armory and the soldiers have
resumed normal duty,'' Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told The
Associated Press. ''But some of the chiefs in the area who
apparently were behind this move are still holding on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the chiefs had not undertaken any specific actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more the threat that they represent,'' Tarakinikini said.
''They can cause disturbances. Police have gone around and warned
shops that they might have to be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight had predicted Tuesday the mutiny would spark a ''domino
effect'' across the country, but there were no signs of other
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed on Fiji's main two islands, a day after five
rebels were wounded in a shootout with troops outside the
Parliament compound.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at Parliament was reported to be tense but calm.
Tarakinikini said efforts were under way to arrange ''preliminary''
talks aimed at ending the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The new government, installed Tuesday by the military over
Speight's objections, was settling in to face a massive task: how
to stem the economic decline sparked by the May 19 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Most top tourist resorts have been hit hard, with some reporting
occupancy rates of only 10 percent, and rebuilding confidence among
foreigners will be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, a former banking executive,
has said ending the hostage crisis will remain the military's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how a 15-minute firefight on Tuesday -- which each
side accused the other of starting -- would affect those efforts. No
negotiations have been held since a near-agreement broke down at
the last minute last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the military on Monday to appoint a new
government comprised entirely of indigenous Fijians would appear to
meet Speight's stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his men stormed Parliament on May 19, he said he
only was trying to safeguard native rights.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase said the 1997 Constitution would be replaced to strike a
balance between ensuring the rights of indigenous Fijians come
first and serving as a ''framework for living together as a
multiracial and multicultural society.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Speight was angry at the military's
unilateral appointments because they did not include his choice to
head the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actions of the army are ... considered insulting,
provocative and devoid of any consideration of the stability of the
country,'' the former insurance executive said, adding that he did
not expect the new government to be in power long.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after the
coup, appointed the interim leaders. He has said he will retain
power until the captives are freed.
</P>
<P>
   The army has given in to most of Speight's demands to
disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indians, including firing Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- the first Fijian of Indian ancestry to
lead the country. Chaudhry is among the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers for rich sugar cane
fields. They make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population;
indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones homered, doubled and drove in three
runs Tuesday night as Greg Maddux and the Atlanta Braves rallied to
beat the Montreal Expos 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind victory followed Atlanta's worst outing of
the season, a 17-1 loss to the Expos on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones had three hits for Atlanta, including his 22nd home
run in the eighth inning. Chipper Jones followed with his 20th
homer, both off reliever Anthony Telford.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was ejected by home plate umpire
Derryl Cousins in the second inning. Cox then appeared to bump
Cousins' side with his elbow as he followed the umpire halfway down
the third base line.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (10-3) allowed six hits, three runs -- two earned -- walked
one and struck out four in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker worked a perfect ninth for Atlanta. It was his first
appearance since last Thursday, having been sidelined by a broken
callus on his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1 in the sixth, the Braves came back Dustin Hermanson
(6-6), who had held Atlanta to three hits entering the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras opened the inning with a double and took third on
a single by Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who earlier Tuesday was named the NL All-Star
starter at third base, then doubled off the glove of a diving
Rondell White on the warning track in left field, scoring both
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan drew a one-out walk and, after a forceout, Walt
Weiss doubled down the right-field line, scoring two more runs.
Weiss had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's first run came on a solo homer from Bobby Bonilla in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored a run in the first on an RBI single by Lee
Stevens, added another in the second on a run-scoring double by
Orlando Cabrera and made it 3-1 in the fifth with an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bergeron reached on a one-out error when first baseman
Andres Galarraga dropped a throw from shortstop Weiss. Bergeron
stole second, took third on a single by Jose Vidro and scored on a
two-out single by Vladimir Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the fourth time this season Cox had been throw out
of a game for arguing. ... In his last five starts prior to Tuesday
night, Maddux was 2-2 with a 5.24 ERA, including his worst outing
of the year when he went only two innings in Saturday's 9-1 loss to
New York, giving up seven hits and seven runs. ... Montreal
pitchers Ugueth Urbina and Carl Pavano will be accompanied by head
trainer Ron McClain when they visit with Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham, Ala., on Wednesday. Urbina will likely undergo surgery
on Thursday to remove a bone chip from his right elbow and will
miss the season. Pavano, placed on the DL June 27 with right elbow
tendinitis, will have his elbow checked.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Jolt Japanese Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook a string of volcanic
islands off Tokyo on Wednesday amid more aftershocks from a
powerful temblor that killed a man last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the
quake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 and struck at 6:51
a.m., said a night duty official at the municipal office on
Miyakejima, an island where about 4,000 people live.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said the latest quake was centered in
''shallow waters'' near the island, 120 miles, south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake rocked Miyakejima and
nearby Kozushima, where a 34-year-old fisherman was killed by
falling rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, more than 6,000 tremors, about 10 percent of
them strong enough to be felt by people, had been registered on
both islands through Wednesday morning, the Meteorological Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the residents on Miyakejima, just southeast of
Kozushima, were allowed to return to their homes last Friday after
fears of a volcanic eruption subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Dark Moondancer pressed the pace
inside, eventually took the lead in the stretch and went on to win
the $150,000 American Handicap at Hollywood Park on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A slight favorite at odds of 9-5, the 5-year-old British-bred
justified his support by beating Sardauker by 1&AMP;frac12; lengths. Ridden by
Chris McCarron and carrying high weight of 122 pounds, Dark
Moondancer covered 1[ miles in 1:46 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron angled his horse off the rail as they neared the far
turn and assumed the lead as the field turned into the stretch. He
slowly drew clear without being seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Street, who engaged Dark Moondancer for the early lead,
held on to third -- a neck behind the rallying runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer paid $5.80, $3.40 and $2.40. Sardauker, who
carried 113 pounds, paid $5 and $2.80, while Sunshine, carrying 119
pounds, paid $2.60 to show.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was worth $90,000 for owner Charles Cella and
increased Dark Moondancer's career earnings to $775,245.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon Flight, Martiniquais and Takarian rounded out the order
of finish.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Oil Firm Caught in Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- An increasingly strident border
dispute could cost both Guyana and Suriname a fortune in oil
revenues and kill the Caribbean's most promising exploration,
officials of a Canadian oil company said at a regional summit
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CGX Energy Inc.'s rig was ready to start drilling a month ago
when Surinamese military moved in on boats and ordered it away,
since the site is in disputed waters at the mouth of the Corentyne
River on South America's northeast coast. Suriname says the border
extends from the river at a 10-degree angle; Guyana says it's a
24-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday -- the second day of talks at a summit of the
14-nation Caribbean Community -- Surinamese government spokesman
Borger Breeveld said his country was not open to a Guyanese
proposal to share the profits from the oil but leave the border
where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sharing the oil would set a precedent. Next time Guyana will
come up with the same thing,'' Breeveld said. ''Suriname wants to
settle the border issue once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sully, president of the Toronto company, said the company
could decide this week to postpone exploration under its 10-year
concession in Guyana for several years until the issue is settled.
</P>
<P>
   He said the exploration could benefit Suriname as well because
the disputed area is key to unlocking the entire Suriname-Guyana
basin -- which the U.S. Geological Survey estimates holds 15 billion
barrels in oil reserves, more than 1 percent of the estimated world
total. The disputed area itself could hold 850 million barrels,
producing about 200,000 barrels a day and earning about dlrs 2
billion a year, the company believes.
</P>
<P>
   That would not put Guyana on par with nearby Venezuela and
Mexico, which together produce more than 3 million barrels a day.
But it would double the output of the Caribbean's current petroleum
leader, Trinidad and Tobago, and dramatically affect Guyana.

<HEADLINE> Senegalese Court Dismisses Charges  </HEADLINE>
By CHIKELUBA KENECHUKU
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- A Senegalese court dismissed torture
charges against the exiled Chadian dictator Hissene Habre, saying
Senegal's courts lacked international jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups immediately attacked the
ruling, which came just 24 hours after Senegalese President
Abdoulaye Wade removed the judge presiding over the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first time that a former African head of state
has been charged with human rights violations by the court of
another country.
</P>
<P>
   Alioune Tine of Senegal's African Assembly for the Defense of
Human Rights lamented the court's decision in ''the most important
human rights case in Senegal's history.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Human Rights Watch, which helped initiate the
criminal action in January, called the decision a ''slap in the
face'' to Habre's victims and said it would protest the
''wrongheaded ruling'' in an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement announcing the decision, the Dakar Regional
Court said it had no authority to rule in cases of international
scope.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal has no law that specifically authorizes or bars its
courts to try cases involving human rights violations committed in
another country.
</P>
<P>
   Bounta Diallo, a lawyer representing one of Habre's alleged
torture victims, described the ruling as a ''miscarriage of
justice'' and accused Senegal's government of manipulating the
court by replacing Judge Demba Kandji, who first indicted Habre in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Habre ruled the central African nation from 1982 to 1990, and
was backed by the United States and France as a buffer against
Moammar Gadhafi's Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Habre, 57, is a French-trained military tactician from northern
Chad. During his rule, the United States and France gave Chad
millions of dollars in weapons and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A commission established by the government of Chad's current
president, Idriss Deby, has accused Habre's regime of 40,000
political murders and 200,000 cases of torture.
</P>
<P>
   Habre has lived in Senegal since he fled Chad in 1990, after his
ouster by Deby.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the case include seven Chadians and one French
woman along with the Chadian Association of Victims of Political
Repression and Crime, which represents 792 alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   They include Samuel Togoto, 53, who says his hands and legs were
bound behind his back for so long he became temporarily paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The case was inspired by charges of human rights abuses brought
against Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet by a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wade was elected in March, ousting incumbent President
Abdou Diouf, Senegal's courts were the most respected in Africa.
Senegal is a signatory to the U.N. Convention Against Torture,
which obliges states to either prosecute or extradite alleged
torturers who enter their territory.

   OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Lu Ravi took the lead at midstretch then
held off a late challenge from Silverbulletday for a head victory
in the $300,000 Molly Pitcher Breeders' Cup Handicap at Monmouth
Park on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Ravi, sent off the 9-5 second choice in the field of seven
fillies and mares, covered 1 1-16 miles over a good track in 1:43.
She won her second stakes of the year, having taken the Sixty Sails
on May 7 at Sportsman's Park in her last outing.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Pat Day, Lu Ravi carried 113 pounds and paid $5.60,
$2.60 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   Favored Silverbulletday, an Eclipse Award winner each of the
past two years, was ridden by Corey Nakatani, carried high weight
of 118 pounds and returned $2.40 and $2.20. Front-running Bella
Chiarra was another 5&AMP;frac34; lengths back in third in the field of seven
and was $2.80 to show.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's other feature race, Chilukki, last year's
2-year-old filly champion, bested a field of older fillies and
mares to win the $75,000 Regret Stakes. She was challenged until
the eighth pole, when she drew off to win by five lengths,
finishing the six furlongs in 1:09.2.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki, the odds-on favorite ridden by Nakatani and carrying
116 pounds, paid $2.40. Superduper Miss was five lengths back in
second in the field of six.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Quill scored twice and Mamadou Diallo
got his league-leading 17th goal as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat D.C.
United 3-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Valderrama got his 19th assist on Quill's second goal,
tying United's Marco Etcheverry for the league record.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama found Quill splitting D.C. United's defense in the
46th minute for Tampa Bay's final goal.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo sent a shot from 18-yards that deflected into the net off
the left post in the 26th minute. He also setup Quill's first goal
in the 37th minute during a 2-on-1 break.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United, the defending league champions, have an MLS-worst
4-12-5 record and have allowed 42 goals. It was just the fifth time
in 17 meetings United lost to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped 34 minutes into the first half because of
lightning associated with a heavy thunderstorm. Some of the
fireworks for a postgame display went off after a nearby lightning
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was resumed after an 86-minute delay.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 14, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Bernard Gilkey, signed earlier in the day as
a free agent, hit a home run, double and single and drove in four
runs Tuesday night as the Boston Red Sox beat the Minnesota Twins
14-4.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was hitting .110 in 38 games before he was let go by the
Arizona Diamondbacks. He was in a 2-for-48 slump when he was
designated for assignment June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, who had spent his entire 10-year career in the National
League, made an immediate impact for the Red Sox. He singled in the
second inning, doubled in the third and homered in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a triple for the cycle, Gilkey grounded out in the
seventh. The right fielder left the game in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (4-5) won his second straight start
since being moved into the rotation June 29. In only his fifth
start this season -- he has 24 relief appearances -- Wakefield
pitched six innings, giving up three runs and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett had three hits for the Red Sox and Troy O'Leary hit
his 100th career home run.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary put the Red Sox up 11-1 in the fourth with his 388-foot
shot to right-center. It was his second homer in two days after
going 31 games without connecting.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Milton (8-3) lasted just three innings, giving up seven
runs on nine hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   In four career decisions against the Red Sox, Milton has given
up 26 earned runs in 28 innings for an 8.36 ERA. He had been 6-1
with a 2.63 ERA in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   Boston broke open the game in the fourth against Jason Ryan,
scoring five times on four straight extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox went ahead 5-1 in the second with four consecutive
hits to start the inning. O'Leary singled and Jason Varitek doubled
him home.
</P>
<P>
   After Gilkey singled, Manny Alexander hit a 360-foot homer, his
first since July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Florie pitched the last three innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz doubled twice and scored two runs for the Twins.
Notes: Ryan has given up 13 earned runs in 8 1-3 innings this
season, for a 14.04 ERA. He was 7-0 with a 4.18 ERA in 13 starts at
Triple-A Salt Lake before being called up. ... Alexander's last
home run came for the Chicago Cubs. ... Twins pitchers didn't have
a 1-2-3 inning until Johan Santana retired Boston in order in the
sixth. ... Twins second baseman Jay Canizaro, who left in the
eighth inning of Monday's game with a strained back, didn't play.
He said he was day-to-day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands gathered on the National Mall
Tuesday, a day of festivities in the nation's capitol that included
a parade, a concert featuring singer Ray Charles and a fireworks
show that lasted half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Red, green, gold and blue flashes streaked across the night sky
and illuminated the Washington Monument, which is undergoing a $10
million facelift.
</P>
<P>
   An unembarrassed young man showed his patriotic fervor with a
nearly naked romp along the east side of the monument, with only a
few red, white and blue ribbons to protect him from the mosquitoes
and the night air.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spent part of the day in New York for an
international naval review but returned before the fireworks began.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia officials expected a half million visitors
for the day's events, which began early in the morning with actors
representing George Washington and other notables of the period
moving among the crowd to explain their roles in history.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a solemn reading of the Declaration of
Independence, a demonstration of uniformed British and colonial
military maneuvers on Constitution Avenue and a traditional parade.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the fireworks began to the strains of Aaron Copland's
''Fanfare for the Common Man.'' Thousands strained for a glimpse at
the multicolored explosions that seemed to hover over the
reflecting pool.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In a campaign to clean up its
police force, a state government in Brazil fired or suspended 353
police officers linked to such crimes as car theft, torture and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers had been convicted but were allowed to keep
working as they appealed their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The removed officers had spent years on the police force after
practicing homicide or getting caught red-handed stealing cars,''
state Anthony Garotinho, governor of Rio de Janeiro state.
</P>
<P>
   Garotinho said he had prepared a second list of 70 prison guards
and 38 firefighters who would be suspended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also appointed public prosecutor Celma Alves to head the
police internal affairs department.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time, police will not be judged by the police
themselves,'' Garotinho said.
</P>
<P>
   Although corruption among Rio's 40,000 police officers was
hardly a secret, it became a major issue in March when then-State
Security Coordinator Luiz Eduardo Soares publicly accused
high-ranking officers of links to extortion, torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Garotinho fired Soares for breaking the chain of command but
created what he called Operation Clean Hands to root out the
''rotten band'' in the police.

<HEADLINE> America's Newest Citizens Take Oath  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS KAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- In business suits, saris and checked
sundresses, 84 people from 27 countries stood on the steps of
Monticello Tuesday and became United States citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The new Americans who took the oath of citizenship during the
annual Independence Day ceremony at Thomas Jefferson's home
included a Bolivian fisherman, an educator from Pakistan and a
Chinese biologist, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who spoke at the
ceremony, said they reminded her of the fears she felt when she
came to the United States from Czechoslovakia at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never occurred to me that I would be secretary of state and
have Thomas Jefferson's job,'' Albright told the crowd of about
1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the country there were parades, picnics, games
and, of course, fireworks to mark the anniversary of America's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 150 tons of explosives fueled the nation's most
spectacular fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets' red-white-and-blue glare exploded in an
extravaganza that capped off OpSail 2000's daytime parade of tall
ships and naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Pyrotechnics lit up the sky all around Manhattan's edges,
creating dramatic, fiery displays against the glamorous backdrop of
the city skyline. ''I was thrilled,'' said Betty Gatzke, visiting
from New Orleans. ''It was colorful, noisy, it rocked my soul!''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, several hundred thousand showed up at the Esplanade
along the Charles River Tuesday night for the traditional Boston
Pops concert and fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   In cloudy Seattle, people were in jackets, carrying umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, summer doesn't usually start around here until July
12,'' said Kirsten Willman, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like 85 last week, but you can't let the weather get
you down around here,'' said Kevin Jackson, 35, of Seattle, who was
at Gas Works Park with his wife and 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Boston, a small group of Hawaiians mourned
the loss of their islands' independence. Blowing conch shell horns,
about two dozen Native Hawaiians and their supporters gathered
where American colonists threw British tea into the Boston Harbor
in 1773 to protest colonial rule. The Hawaiians threw garlands of
the Hawaiian plant Ti -- also pronounced ''tea'' -- into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The group hoped to draw attention to the United States' 1893
takeover of the eleven Hawaiian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a little while for people to understand our
situation in Hawaii, but it's got to start somewhere,'' said
activist John ''Butch'' Kekahu.
</P>
<P>
   In Irving, Texas, every house in the University Hills
neighborhood had at least one flag on its lawn after neighbors
pitched in to buy 1,000 flags. The neighbors' efforts reward the
longtime ritual of Nell Anne Hunt, who for years has planted her
own flags in as many neighbors' yards as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so lucky to be born in this country at this time in
history,'' said Hunt, who last year planted 450 flags by herself on
neighbors' lawns. ''It's good to remember that, at least on the
Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Monticello, the citizenship ceremony was the final step
in a lengthy naturalization process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very special. All my other encounters have been in
dingy offices with gruff immigration officers,'' said Zohra
Siddiqui, 58, as she looked across the manicured lawn of the
Jefferson estate.
</P>
<P>
   Siddiqui, a former boys' school principal, said she came to the
United States from Pakistan eight years ago to be closer to her son
and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kannan Selvaratnam, 30, was looking for acceptance and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is extraordinary,'' said Selvaratnam, who fled Sri Lanka
in 1983 when ethnic fighting destroyed his village. Selvaratnam,
who works at a New York advertising agency, said his family
scattered to different countries for safety.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult being exiled from a place where you have so many
emotional ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this means we really can triumph one day,'' he said, a
small American flag poking from his coat pocket.

Fiji Military Defuses Troop Protest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military quelled a protest by troops at a Fiji army
base Wednesday, but said local chiefs threatened disturbances in support of
rebels who have been holding 27 people hostage for seven weeks. Two or three
soldiers who were sympathetic to rebel leader George Speight had confiscated
arms and ammunition Tuesday inside the base at Labasa, on the northern island of
Vanua Levu. ''All of the arms are back in the armory and the soldiers have
resumed normal duty,'' Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told The Associated Press.

Elian Pays Visit to Hometown

   HAVANA (AP) -- Without the hordes of journalists who chronicled his movements
in the United States, Elian Gonzalez today made a quiet visit to his hometown
for the first time since returning to Cuba last week, the government said
afterward. Accompanied by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian visited the
homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents in Cardenas, about 90 miles east
of Havana, state television reported. Elian also stopped by his school, where he
will resume his studies in the fall, and played with several of his schoolmates
before he and his family returned to Havana later in the day.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect today laid out sweeping plans
for a new justice system, a more human rights-oriented foreign policy and a
multiparty Cabinet. Opposition leader Vicente Fox, who won Sunday's presidential
elections, also pledged to eliminate the posturing and tension in U.S.-Mexico
relations over the two countries' border, where immigration-related incidents

Teachers Debate Bonus Systems

   CHICAGO (AP) -- As a teachers' union meeting in Chicago began reconsidering
longtime resistance to bonus systems, another union reported today from
Philadelphia that teachers still get paid much less than other professionals.
''The teaching profession often isn't even in the horse race,'' Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers, said at a news conference in
Philadelphia. In the 1998-99 school year, the average teacher made $40,574, the

here,'' Bush told about 2,000 people outside the courthouse. Bush, the
presumptive Republican nominee for president, said, ''Americans cherish liberty

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A gang member wanted for murder shot and wounded
five people and took 15 others hostage on the Santa Monica Pier before being
talked into surrendering and releasing his last two captives early today, police
said. The pier and its small amusement park, restaurants and arcade remained
closed much of the day as police collected evidence and interviewed more than
100 witnesses who were huddled at the west end of the pier during the five-hour

Prison Population Drops in Calif.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's prison population declined slightly over the
past year, the first decrease after two decades of spiraling growth. As of late
June there were 161,401 inmates in the nation's largest prison system -- 360
fewer than at the same time last year. Officials said prison population growth
began to slow three years ago. They cited a range of factors, including lower
crime rates, the strong economy and better supervision of parolees.

OpSail 2000 that opened the Fourth of July with a visual bang. Spectators came
in from across the metropolitan area and around the world for a rare look at the
floating parade, which included two dozen warships from 14 countries in only the
sixth International Naval Review in history. President Clinton, standing on the
flight deck of the USS John F. Kennedy, was among those impressed by the 11-mile

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones homered, doubled and drove in three runs
tonight as Greg Maddux and the Atlanta Braves rallied to beat the Montreal Expos
7-3. The come-from-behind victory followed Atlanta's worst outing of the season,
a 17-1 loss to the Expos on Monday night. Andruw Jones had three hits for
Atlanta, including his 22nd home run in the eighth inning. Chipper Jones
followed with his 20th homer, both off reliever Anthony Telford.

<HEADLINE> Peru President To Keep Chief Near  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori pledged Tuesday to
keep his shadowy security chief by his side, denying reports that
the Organization of American States urged him to fire Vladimiro
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos will continue his functions as adviser at the top
level of the intelligence service,'' Fujimori said of the man
widely feared for a spy network and seen by many as the power
behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   The statement broadcast late Tuesday came five days after a
top-level OAS delegation urged Fujimori to reform Peru's damaged
democracy following his tainted re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The mission -- led by OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy -- said last week that
Fujimori and government opponents had agreed on a list of OAS
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS agenda calls for reforms to establish an independent
judicial system, guarantee press freedom, correct flaws in the
electoral process and provide oversight of the armed forces and
intelligence services, which have been key allies in helping
Fujimori tighten his control over all branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has been accused by human rights groups and
Fujimori's foes of having links to death squads and spearheading
smear campaigns against Fujimori's opponents in the recent
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, a top narcotics trafficker testified during
his trial that for a year he had made monthly payments of $50,000
via an intermediary to Montesinos in exchange for use of a jungle
airstrip. His allegations were not pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, analysts say Fujimori has
kept him close by during a decade in power because he has proved
highly useful in defeating leftist rebels and undercutting
political foes.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was some discussion with the OAS officials about
making Montesinos' role ''more public.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week if the OAS delegation had discussed Montesinos,
Axworthy told reporters: ''There's no doubt that a great deal of
concern was expressed about the role that this gentleman plays and
we would hope that the government takes that into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori pledged to loosen his autocratic grip and fortify
democratic institutions after winning an unprecedented third
five-year term, following a campaign riddled with irregularities
and allegations of government fraud.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Alejandro Toledo, boycotted the runoff vote,
saying it was being rigged in Fujimori's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS refused to monitor the May 28 ballot after Fujimori
refused to delay it and correct irregularities, but sent the
follow-up delegation to ensure Fujimori keeps his postelection
promise.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 10, Astros 4  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Randy Johnson predictably outpitched Jose Lima,
with rookie Jason Conti hitting a bases-loaded double in a
seven-run third inning Tuesday night to lead the Arizona
Diamondbacks over the Houston Astros 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (13-2), who leads the NL in victories, allowed four hits
in six innings. He struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (1-13) dropped his 13th straight decision and leads the
majors in losses. He left after Arizona's burst in the third
inning, highlighted by Conti's three-run double and Damian Miller's
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who struck out 13 in beating the Astros in his last
start Thursday, held Houston hitless until Jeff Bagwell's 22nd home
run in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't allow another hit until Bagwell singled, Richard
Hidalgo doubled and Moises Alou hit a three-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season Johnson allowed a homer with
runners on base after yielding 12 solo home runs. His six innings
matched his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, a 21-game winner last season, hasn't won since his first
start of the season on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the big hits by Conti and Miller in the third, Luis
Gonzalez hit an RBI single and Lima issued a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time this season Houston pitchers allowed
seven runs in one inning. The last came June 24 against the Giants.
Notes: Houston has three victories in its last 14 games. Scott
Elarton was the winning pitcher in all three. ... Bagwell is the
only Astros opening day starter who hasn't been on the disabled
list this season. ... The Diamondbacks have homered in nine of
their last 10 games.

<HEADLINE> Unruly Woman Forces Flight Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A Continental Airlines flight was
forced to return to Anchorage when a passenger hurled a can of beer
at a flight attendant and bit one of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Linda Lozano, 38, address unknown, was arrested and
charged with crimes aboard an aircraft, which include interfering
with the flight crew and assault, according to the FBI in
Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurred aboard Flight 120 Tuesday as it headed to
Seattle and then Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Lozano began arguing with her boyfriend and
became unruly when a flight attendant asked her to calm down. She
threw a full can of beer which she brought aboard the aircraft,
hitting the flight attendant and splashing beer on passengers,
including a 3-month-old baby, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer left the cockpit to help. When he tried to
restrain Lozano, she bit him on the wrist, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers kept the woman restrained until the flight reached
the gate and she was removed from the plane. The flight took off
about three hours later.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Henderson Gets Ejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Seattle Mariners left fielder Rickey
Henderson was ejected by plate umpire Bill Welke after looking at a
third strike in the third inning of Tuesday night's game against
the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who was called out on a 2-2 pitch in the first
inning, didn't offer at Kent Bottenfield's 0-2 pitch on the inside
corner his next time up.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson never said a word after Welke's arm went up. Close-up
television replays confirmed that Henderson's lips did not move
from the time the pitch came until the time Welke tossed him.
</P>
<P>
   But Welke apparently did not appreciate the fact that Henderson
remained in the batter's box for more than five seconds after the
called strike with his head down, staring at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had plenty to say to Welke, however, following his
first ejection of the season -- as did manager Lou Piniella.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jackets Sign Tugnutt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Free agent goaltender Ron Tugnutt signed a
four-year, $10 million contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team later announced it would introduce its first head coach
at a news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jackets spokesman Todd Sharrock declined comment when asked
who Doug MacLean, the team's president and general manager, had
chosen as coach.
</P>
<P>
   But four Columbus TV stations reported Tuesday night that former
Calgary head coach Dave King had been chosen over former Calgary
head coach Brian Sutter, Colorado Avalanche assistant Bryan
Trottier and former Edmonton Oilers head coach Ron Low.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jackets spokesman Dan Jones said Tuesday he could neither
confirm nor deny King's selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's being reported locally, they're getting it from other
media sources, but not from us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean had plenty to say about Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is an outstanding player, a tremendous leader and will team
with Marc Denis to give us one of the top goaltending tandems in
the league,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt played for Ottawa and Pittsburgh last season, compiling
a 22-14-8 record with a 2.52 goals-against average in 51 games.
</P>
<P>
   He also has played for Quebec, Edmonton, Anaheim and Montreal
during his 12-year NHL career, appearing in 398 regular-season
games. He has a 134-170-49 record and 3.22 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great opportunity,'' Tugnutt said about joining
the expansion Blue Jackets. ''I've done this before with the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks. It was a fantastic time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first year (with) an expansion team is always electrifying
and always exciting. Going to the rink today, people are going to
enjoy themselves there. It's going to be a party.''

<HEADLINE> McDonald Homers in First At-Bat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Keith McDonald became only the third player in
St. Louis Cardinals' history to homer in his first career at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a 27-year-old rookie pinch hitting for Edgar Renteria,
connected off Andy Larkin on a 2-2 pitch in the eighth inning
Tuesday, joining Wally Moon (1954) and Eddie Morgan (1936).
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm numb,'' McDonald said. ''I was running with my head down.
I didn't even see it go out and I almost tripped over first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who played only one season with the Cardinals, also did
it as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'It must be an easy league,'' manager Tony La Russa
said. ''What a thrill that must be.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's contract was purchased from Triple-A Memphis on
Sunday, a day after Eli Marrero, the Cardinals' backup catcher,
injured his left thumb with a head-first slide stealing second.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald hit only one homer in 177 at-bats at Memphis and
totaled 28 homers in six minor league seasons before this year.
He's not sure what he'll do with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't even thought about it,'' he said. ''I barely made it
around the bases.''

<HEADLINE> Western Slope Fires Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAIG, Colo. (AP) -- Two wildfires on Colorado's Western Slope
surged forward Tuesday in conditions so dry that brush burning at
one location was likened to kindling.
</P>
<P>
   A blaze in the Dinosaur National Monument in remote northwestern
Colorado was burning an estimated 9,000 acres, while a smaller fire
about 35 miles southwest of Grand Junction had consumed about 2,500
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Winds were reported at 20 mph at several points and temperatures
ranged into the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Dinosaur blaze, which began Monday, was burning mostly on
federal land, said Lynn Barclay, spokeswoman with the Craig
Interagency Dispatch center. No structures were immediately
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was likely to run into natural barriers in some spots,
but firefighters were concerned strong southwesterly winds could
send sparks across the Green River and threaten buildings in the
Browns Park Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, firefighters feared dry conditions and strong
winds would cause the smaller blaze -- burning in kindling-like
pinon, juniper and oak brush -- to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's extremely dry fuel,'' said David Lehmann, spokesman with
the interagency firefighting center in Grand Junction. ''It will be
several days before we get it controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolores River lies between the fire and Gateway, population
300, and normally would be an adequate barrier, he said. ''With
these conditions, it's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   A third blaze also was reported, burning across 200 acres about
50 miles southwest of Rangley, near the Utah border in northwestern
Colorado, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In southwestern Wyoming, two wildfires believed to have been
started by lightning had burned about 1,600 acres of shrubs and
grass on public and private land over two days.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires came less than a month after two blazes burned
about 21,000 acres on the more densely populated eastern side of
the Continental Divide, destroying dozens of homes and other
structures.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Opens Echelon Probe  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA VON DERSCHAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French prosecutor has opened a preliminary
investigation into a U.S.-led spy network that has left many
Europeans suspicious that their businesses are being monitored,
judicial sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paris prosecutor Jean-Pierre Dintilhac in May asked the DST,
France's internal security service, to carry out the preliminary
inquiry, according to a report in Tuesday's Le Figaro newspaper.
The report was confirmed by judicial sources who spoke on condition
they not be named.
</P>
<P>
   The Echelon issue surfaced in February when a European
Parliament report discussed the existence and activities of the
network, whose members also include Britain, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   It said Echelon has surveillance-interception stations across
the globe that intercept ''billions of messages per hour,''
including telephone calls, fax transmissions and private e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The report by British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell
was presented to the EU assembly. It urged the EU to take action
against unwanted interception of communications, insisting that
this violated human rights and could be used for industrial
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have offered reassurances that
Echelon is not involved in economic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But some Europeans remain concerned that the network may be
compromising businesses, and many European parliament members have
asked for a deeper probe. On Wednesday, EU lawmakers are expected
to decide whether to create a temporary inquiry commission on
Echelon, Le Figaro said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Matt Clement pitched four-hit ball for 8 1-3
innings and the San Diego Padres sent the Los Angeles Dodgers to
their third straight loss, 7-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (8-7), making his 51st start in the majors, came close
to his first career complete game. He got the first out in the
ninth inning, but left after a hit batter and walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres and Cincinnati are the only teams without a complete
game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, who homered, Bret Boone and Ruben Rivera each drove
in two runs for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Clement won for the third time in four starts, including two in
a row against the Dodgers. He struck out six and walked four in his
longest outing in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead with a homer in the
second. Los Angeles added an unearned run in the third on Shawn
Green's single.
</P>
<P>
   Clement then retired 10 straight batters and 13 out of 14 before
pinch-hitter Dave Hansen's leadoff single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone, the Padres' best hitter the last month, had a
two-run single to key a three-run fourth that made it 3-2. He also
scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's single off Chan Ho Park (9-5) gave him 21 RBIs in the
Padres' last 13 games. Boone doubled in the sixth and scored on
Ruben Rivera's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera hit two doubles and Klesko hit a solo homer in the
eighth, his 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Park gave up six runs -- five earned -- on seven hits in six
innings. The right-hander struck out eight and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Clement led off the fifth with single and moved to third on Cory
DeHaan's single. When Green's throw from right field sailed into
the stands, Clement scored, DeHaan went to third and scored on
Klesko's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Park lost for just the sixth time in his last 22 decisions,
dating back to last season. ... Boone was 2-for-13 (.154) with one
RBI lifetime against Park before his two-run single. ... San Diego
manager Bruce Bochy batted Dave Magadan in the cleanup spot despite
being mired in a 1-for-27 slump. ... Green was back in the lineup
after sitting out Sunday at San Francisco, his first game missed
after starting the first 79. ... Padres OF Eric Owens and 3B Phil
Nevin were held out of the starting lineup. Owens, with one hit in
his last 14 at-bats, has a bothersome left hand, while Nevin is
hitting only .196 since June 1. ... San Diego SS Damian Jackson,
who recently lost his starting job to Kevin Nicholson, committed
his 15th error, tied with Nevin for the team high.
