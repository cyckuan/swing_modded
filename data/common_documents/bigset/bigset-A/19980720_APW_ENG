Thousands evacuated as Indonesian volcano rumbles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 3,000 people fled villages
on the slopes of Indonesia's most active volcano as Mount Merapi
ominously spewed out hot poisonous gasses, ash and lava, officials
said Monday.
	   Volcanologists said activity within the 2,968-meter (9,737-foot)
peak has been building for weeks. They fear a major eruption is
possible.
	   Merapi sits in the middle of Central Java, one of the world's
most densely-populated regions.
	   The evacuation was ordered on Sunday after the mountain threw up
two huge clouds of super-hot gas. Lava poured out of the crater
along with ash and dust.
	   There have been no reports of casualties so far.
	   Rohadih, a local government official helping to coordinate the
evacuations, said at least 3,225 villagers from three districts
fled their homes. Many were being housed in makeshift camps in
safer areas.
	   Authorities said thousands more residents, within an 8-kilometer
(5-mile) radius of the peak, were on standby to leave.
	   Officials denied a local media report on Monday that 6,000
people had been evacuated from the area near the city of
Yogyakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Officials fear hot or toxic clouds could hit villages on the
mountain's slopes. During a sudden eruption in 1994, a steam cloud
flattened one village, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Villagers choose to live on the sides of the volcano despite the
ever present danger because the soil there is extremely fertile for
farming.
	   Volcanologists reported that a 4.5-kilometer (2.7-mile) trail of
lava had poured down the mountain's southwest slope, The Jakarta
Post newspaper reported.
	   The newspaper also said that volcanic ash had fallen on towns
and villages as far away as 20 kilometers (12 miles).
	   Merapi is regarded as the most dangerous of Indonesia's 500
volcanoes. Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300
people in 1930.

Chinese scientists seek to clone endangered pandas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese scientists hope to clone a giant panda
within five years in an effort to save the highly endangered animal
from the threat of extinction, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   Scientists will attempt to produce a panda calf by planting a
panda cell into an egg cell from another animal species, project
leader Chen Dayuan said in a Xinhua report late Sunday.
	   This ``trans-species cloning technology'' is far more complex
and difficult than methods already used to clone farm animals, it
quoted Chen saying. Chen is a researcher in animal studies at the
state-supported Chinese Academy of Sciences.
	   British and Japanese scientists have used intra-species cloning
_ implanting a cell into an egg from the same species of animal _
to reproduce sheep and cattle.
	   The giant panda is native only to China. Because of poaching and
deforestation, only 1,000 remain scattered among natural reserves
in China's provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. In some
reserves, groups of only a few to 100 pandas live in isolation, and
inbreeding has become a problem.
	   The animals are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity, and
some zoos have resorted to artificial insemination to produce panda
cubs.

Philippines adopts lower economic growth targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has lowered
its economic growth targets and raised its inflation prediction to
reflect the impact of the Asian currency crisis and El Nino
drought.
	   The government now expects the gross national product will grow
between 2.5 percent and 3 percent this year instead of its earlier
forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent.
	   Gross domestic product, which unlike GNP excludes money sent
home by overseas Filipino workers, is expected to range between 2
percent and 2.4 percent, down from the original 2.4 percent and 3.5
percent.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said over the weekend the
revised targets, recommended by the inter-agency Development Budget
Coordination Council, take into account the worse-than-expected
impact of the Asian financial crisis and a severe drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   He said inflation this year is now expected to average between
9.4 percent and 10 percent, up from the earlier target of 7.5
percent and 8.5 percent.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said the revised targets would
be reviewed again after the release of second-quarter economic
figures next month.
	   ``By that time, we'll have new data to evaluate in time for the
first program review of the International Monetary Fund,'' he said.
	   The Philippines is currently under a two-year IMF precautionary
borrowing program. The program allows the government access to as
much as dlrs 3.7 billion in standby credit to protect the peso in
the event of a worsening of the Asian currency crisis.
	   Under the IMF program, the Philippine government pledged to
achieve a GNP growth rate of 3 percent and maintain an average
inflation rate of 8 percent this year.
	   But the economy already showed signs of strain in the first
quarter, with GNP growth sinking to 2.5 percent from the
year-earlier 5.4 percent. After posting single-digit inflation
rates since last year, the inflation rate hit 10.3 percent in May,
and rose further to 10.7 percent in June.

Chinese dissidents hunger strike to protest arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident was on hunger strike Monday
and another three dissidents planned to join him to protest a
police crackdown on an opposition political party.
	   Xie Wanjun, from eastern Shandong province, said he stopped
taking food Sunday evening and would drink only liquids for the
next 48 hours.
	   Another three dissidents from southeastern Zhejiang province
also planned not to eat for 48 hours starting from midday Monday,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The hunger strikes were to protest a police roundup of
organizers of the China Democracy Party, an opposition political
group set up by dissidents to challenge the ruling Communist
Party's monopoly on power.
	   Police have detained 11 party organizers since July 10. Five are
still being held and authorities may be preparing to charge them
with subversion, the Information Center said.
	   In a ``Hunger Strike Manifesto,'' the three Zhejiang dissidents
_ Wu Gaoxing, Ye Wenxiang and Fu Quan _ said the detentions
represented a serious violation of human rights, the Information
Center reported.
	   Efforts by organizers of the China Democracy Party to legally
register their group were in line with China's constitution and
``absolutely did not violate any specific law,'' the dissidents
said.
	   Xie, who took part in the massive pro-democracy demonstrations
centered on Tiananmen Square in 1989, said he also was protesting
the crackdown on the China Democracy Party.
	   ``The government wants dissidents to follow the law, but we also
want the police to follow the law and constitution,'' the
unemployed 33-year-old said in a telephone interview from his home
in Shandong.
	   Dissidents announced the formation of the China Democracy Party
on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in China on
a nine-day visit.
	   But authorities refused to the let the party register, as
required by law.

More than 3,000 Malaysians laid off in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 3,000 Malaysians have
been laid off from a Singaporean shipyard due to the regional
economic crisis, a news report said Monday.
	   Regional currencies have depreciated sharply to the Singaporean
dollar, which has raised the cost of business for neighboring
countries and forced many ship owners to send their vessels
elsewhere for repair, the Star newspaper reported.
	   At one shipyard near Sembawang in Singapore, where Malaysians
made up 90 percent of the facility's 10,000 workers, some 3,000
were let go over the past three months as business has slowed, said
dockworker Alex Tan.
	   ``The shipyard has been receiving few orders to repair ships
lately and worse still, it has not received any contract to build
new ships,'' Tan, who works at the shipyard, was quoted as saying.
	   Tan said that many ship owners were now doing business in
countries where their currency was stronger and labor was cheaper,
such as the Philippines.
	   Meanwhile, unemployment has risen sharply in Malaysia, where the
currency, the ringgit, has lost nearly 40 percent of its value to
the U.S. dollar. As a result, banks have tightened lending policies
forcing many building projects to be shelved.
	   Malaysia's Human Resources Ministry said that 39,511 workers
were laid off between January and June, 21,806 of whom were factory
workers.

Blue sapphire to be auctioned this week in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ An egg-sized blue sapphire discovered
in central Sri Lanka will go on sale at an auction later this week,
an official said Monday.
	   Buyers from Thailand, Japan, South Korea, India, the United
States and Europe are expected to bid for the 880-carat gem on
Saturday at Ratnapura, 70 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of
Colombo, said A.E.T. Ellawala, chairman of Sri Lanka's Gem and
Jewelry Authority. Ratnapura is the center of Sri Lanka's gems
industry.
	   Ellawala refused to disclose the minimum price at which bidding
will start.
	   Leslie Punchihewa, an expert, said the sapphire, if cut and
polished properly, could become one of the world's 10 most valuable
gems. It was found at a gem mine earlier this month.
	   Sri Lanka has produced the three largest blue sapphires ever
found, including the ``Star of India'' on display in New York's
Museum of Natural History. Its gems have been renowned since the
days of the 13th Century Venetian traveler Marco Polo.
	   The country's gem exports have suffered in recent years due to
low production and increased competition from new producers like
Tanzania, Madagascar and Vietnam.

Final count confirms Harvard graduate's win in Ecuador vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Election officials announced Sunday night
that Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad is the winner of Ecuador's
presidential runoff, confirming early results that showed him
defeating a banana tycoon who has charged fraud.
	   Mahuad, who studied at Harvard University in the United States,
had 51 percent of the vote vs. 49 percent for populist Alvaro Noboa
in last Sunday's vote, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said.
	   The announcement ended seven days of post-vote tension during
which both candidates had claimed victory and Mahuad had already
started forming a new government.
	   After hearing of the tribunal's final decision, Noboa told
reporters he wouldn't recognize Mahuad's victory and repeated his
call for officials to recount the votes in his home province of
Guayas on Ecuador's Pacific coast.
	   In the days before Sunday's final decision, Noboa paid for radio
and television ads calling on his supporters to hold peaceful
vigils to protest alleged fraud by the Mahuad camp.
	   Except for small protests by Noboa's supporters outside the
vote-counting office in the port city of Guayaquil, there has been
little post-vote violence.
	   Observers from the Organization of American States who were
present during the election have rejected the fraud charges and
pronounced the vote as fair.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31.
	   Mahuad, who holds a master's degree in public administration
from Harvard, earned a reputation as an honest, effective
politician during his six-year stint as mayor of Quito. He had the
support of Ecuador's political and business elite, who saw him as
the best hope to end the chronic political instability in this
Andean nation of 12 million people.
	   Noboa called himself the candidate of the poor despite being
Ecuador's richest man and promised to create one million jobs if
elected.
	   When Mahuad takes office Aug. 10, he will end 18 months of
interim government that followed Congress' removal from power of
eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram for ``mental incapacity''
in February 1997.
	   Congress named Fabian Alarcon as Bucaram's interim replacement.

Buddhist monks march for peace in election campaign marred by
</HEADLINE>
violence &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Buddhist monks and nuns marched and
prayed for peace in a violence-marred election campaign Monday, and
hundreds of ruling party supporters confident of victory drove
through the capital in a motorcade of trucks.
	   Election observers from the European Union were due to arrive to
monitor the balloting Sunday, which critics say has been rigged by
strongman Hun Sen with violence and packing electoral authorities
with his supporters.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said in a statement that three
supporters have been murdered in the past week and that the
National Election Committee overseeing the vote had done nothing to
halt the violence.
	   The party called the committee ``little more than a cover for
the ruling party's effort to legitimize itself through a fraudulent
election.''
	   Samraing Kimsan, a spokesman for the NEC, told a news conference
that the body was planning a Buddhist chanting ceremony Thursday in
an effort to diminish public fears. The leaders of the NEC and the
political parties were expected to participate.
	   The NEC now expects to release preliminary election results Aug.
1, three days earlier than previously planned, Samraing Kimsand
said.
	   A clear-cut victory for any of the three major parties appears
increasingly unlikely and their leaders all say they are
considering a coalition, which could lead to more power sharing but
also create fresh instability and more turmoil.
	   On a dusty, sun-baked country road about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Phnom Penh, some 150 Buddhist monks and nuns
marched and prayed for peace. They sprinkled water with jasmine
petals on villagers kneeling to be blessed.
	   The ``Pre-election Peace Walk'' set out from a temple Sunday and
will conclude Friday in front of the royal palace. The monks were
supported by novices and lay people carrying banners reading, ``A
peaceful nation makes a peaceful world.''
	   In the capital, scores of trucks carrying hundreds of supporters
of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party roared through the
capital, with loudspeakers blaring slogans and supporters waving
flags.
	   The motorcade had been planned for Sunday but was postponed to
avoid potential clashes with supporters of Sam Rainsy, who had
their own motorcade, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who rallied at
the city's biggest stadium.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody
takeover a year ago. The strongman has called elections and
permitted Ranariddh to return from exile to contest them in an
effort to win back international aid and legitimacy.
	   Khmer Rouge guerrillas, considered all but extinct after losing
their last major stronghold to a government offensive in April,
have vowed to disrupt the polls and have been blamed for an attack
on a convoy of election workers Friday that killed two people and
injured five.
	   The National Election Committee said Monday it is weighing
whether to close four of 11 polling stations in the region around
the former base, Anlong Veng, considered most vulnerable.

 &UR; Rangers 7, Devil Rays 4 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez homered and drove in two
runs, giving him a major league-leading 105 RBIs, as the Texas
Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Gonzalez hit his 27th homer, and his first since July 5, in the
second inning off Bryan Rekar (0-2). He added an RBI grounder in a
five-run fifth.
	   Gonzalez has four RBIs in the last two games after going a
season-high nine games without driving in a run.
	   Will Clark hit a two-run homer and Rusty Greer added a two-run
double in the fifth for Texas. Tampa Bay has lost 15 of its last 17
games.
	   John Burkett (6-10) survived a shaky outing to win for only the
second time in his last eight starts. He allowed four runs and 10
hits in seven innings.
	   John Wetteland recovered from Saturday night's blown save to
pitch the ninth for his 27th save.
 &UR; Orioles 7, Angels 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Troy Percival walked four batters in the
ninth inning to force home the go-ahead run and Cal Ripken followed
with a two-run single as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Anaheim
Angels.
	   Eric Davis hit two home runs as Baltimore won for the 10th time
in 11 games.
	   Percival (2-4) walked Jeff Reboulet to open the ninth. He then
got two straight outs before three consecutive walks, the last to
Rafael Palmeiro. Ripken's single gave the Orioles a three-run lead.
	   Jesse Orosco (4-1) pitched 1 2-3 perfect innings for the win.
Armando Benitez got two outs for his 13th save.

CINCINNATI: the win.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Dodgers 4 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire slid home just ahead of Charles
Johnson's tag, scoring the winning run on John Mabry's two-out
single in the bottom of the ninth inning Sunday night to give the
St. Louis Cardinals a 5-4 victory over Los Angeles.
	   McGwire drew a one-out walk from Scott Radinsky (4-5) and Ron
Gant was hit by a pitch with two outs.
	   Mabry followed by slicing a single to left field, and McGwire
was running all the way from second base. Left fielder Trenidad
Hubbard's throw beat McGwire to the plate but was a few feet up the
first-base line, and Johnson tried to make a diving tag.
	   McGwire managed to get his foot on the plate barely before
Johnson reached him. Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman and several of
his players argued with plate umpire Bill Hohn, but television
replays showed the call was correct.
	   Mabry got his first RBI in 12 games since July 2. McGwire,
leading the majors with 42 home runs, went 1-for-3, including a fly
ball to the warning track in left-center field in the seventh.
	   Mark Petkovsek (6-4) retired all four batters he faced to earn
the victory.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 6, Rockies 4
	   In Phoenix, rookie Travis Lee completed a sizzling series with a
triple and an RBI single as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the
Colorado Rockies to match their longest winning streak of the
season at four games.
	   The Rockies had leads of 2-0, 3-2 and 4-3 but couldn't hold off
the Diamondbacks, who swept a three-game series for the second time
in their brief history, the first time at home.
	   Mike Lansing drove in three runs with a home run and double for
the Rockies, who lost their fifth in a row. Vinny Castilla had two
hits and an RBI for Colorado.
	   In three games against the Rockies, Lee was 7-for-12. Even when
he struck out Sunday night, the Diamondbacks scored on the play.
	   Aaron Small (1-0) got one out in the seventh for the victory,
and Alan Embree pitched two innings for his first save since Aug.
21, 1995.
	   Mike Munoz (2-1) was the loser.

 &UR; U.S., Indian negotiators meet on nuclear weapons &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A U.S. envoy closeted himself in talks
with a top aide to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Monday in an attempt to narrow the nuclear policy gap between
Washington and New Delhi.
	   The talks, the third round between U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott and Indian foreign policy adviser Jaswant
Singh, are at such a sensitive stage that neither side was willing
to say anything about them. At a previous round of talks in
Frankfurt, Germany, earlier this month, the venue wasn't disclosed,
allowing the two to avoid reporters.
	   They posed stiffly for photographers before beginning their
meetings Monday at a government guest house in New Delhi.
	   Talbott and Singh first met in Washington in June, soon after
India and neighboring Pakistan set off a series of tit-for-tat
underground nuclear tests. India and Pakistan have fought three
wars since both gained independence from Britain in 1947, and their
shared frontier remains tense, raising fears of a nuclear
conflagration in South Asia.
	   Talbott was expected to spend most of Monday in talks with
Singh. He was scheduled to meet later Monday with Vajpayee and Home
Minister Lal Krishna Advani. Advani recently took charge of
security in the northern state of Kashmir, subject of a territorial
dispute between India and Pakistan that lies at the heart of their
dangerous rivalry.
	   India wants to persuade the United States that it is a
responsible nuclear power that should not be the subject of
economic sanctions and that it should be allowed access to nuclear
energy technology Washington has denied it due to its military
program. India says it needs a nuclear deterrent because of the
threat posed by neighbors Pakistan and, particularly, China.
	   Washington argues the May tests set back international progress
toward ridding the world of all nuclear weapons. It has called on
both to sign an international test ban treaty.
	   In June, the United States joined the other four permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ Britain, China, France, and
Russia _ in urging India and Pakistan to refrain from testing,
converting nuclear capability into weaponry, deploying missiles
capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and producing any more
enriched uranium or plutonium or other nuclear weapons material.
	   There are signs the differences between Washington and New Delhi
are narrowing, with India indicating some willingness to sign the
international treaty banning nuclear tests.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was required by law to cut off loans
and aid to India and Pakistan following their nuclear tests, and
only the U.S. Congress can lift the sanctions. Last week, the U.S.
Senate gave Clinton the power to waive sanctions against India and
Pakistan for up to 12 months.

Vietnam lowers growth target to 6-7 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Battered by manmade and natural disasters,
Vietnam has lowered its growth target for this year, a senior
legislator said Monday. Several major infrastructure projects are
being postponed.
	   For years, the government has set a goal of 9 percent annual
growth in gross domestic product. But it recently said growth for
the first half of the year was 6.64 percent, down from 8.8 percent
for all of 1997.
	   Ngo Dinh Giao, vice chairman of the National Assembly's Economic
and Finance Committee, said the National Assembly's Standing
Committee decided Friday to lower the GDP growth target to between
6 percent and 7 percent.
	   An official announcement is expected soon, he told The
Associated Press by telephone.
	   Giao cited the slowdown in GDP growth in the first half,
shrinking purchasing power, declining export markets and
difficulties in attracting development investment.
	   In addition, the country has been hurt by the Asian economic
crisis, poor government performance and an ongoing series of
weather calamities.
	   ``The weaknesses of the economy left behind by the
central-command economy which have not been overcome have been
aggravated by the recent regional economic crisis,'' Giao said.
	   ``It is necessary to adjust the GDP growth to be more realistic
to the situation.''
	   Damage from Typhoon Linda last September and the worst drought
in a century earlier this year has been estimated at dlrs 1
billion, and there are worries of major floods if the La Nina
weather phenomenon sets in. Some areas already have been hit.
	   The string of problems has led the government to focus on food
security to ensure that its 78 million people have enough to eat.
	   Vietnam has developed into the world's second-largest rice
exporter, but officials said last week that the target of selling 4
million tons overseas has been dropped to 3.5 million tons. The
nation's food reserves are being increased by 10 percent.
	   Giao said the National Assembly, in its April session,
authorized the Standing Committee to adjust the GDP growth target.
The decision is final, he added.
	   Vietnam has refused to heavily devalue the dong while most
regional currencies have plunged over the last year.
	   Instead, the government _ fearing the higher costs of
dollar-denominated debt and badly needed imports _ has made three 5
percent cuts, with expectations in the financial community of
another in the works.
	   The Youth newspaper, meanwhile, reported that Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai last Thursday announced the postponement and
rescheduling of some major infrastructure projects because of the
budget strains.
	   The postponements include the ambitious north-south highway, the
dlrs 8 million port of Qui Nhon and expansion of Danang's airport.
	   Others that are being rescheduled include a 30-kilometer
(19-mile) highway connecting Hanoi with the proposed satellite city
of Hoa Lac, the Yazun reservoir and renovation of Ho Chi Minh
City's main theater.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A U.S. envoy closeted himself in talks
with a top aide to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Monday in an attempt to narrow the nuclear policy gap between
Washington and New Delhi.
	   The talks, the third round between U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott and Indian foreign policy adviser Jaswant
Singh, are at such a sensitive stage that neither side was willing
to say anything about them. At a previous round of talks in
Frankfurt, Germany, earlier this month, the venue wasn't disclosed,
allowing the two to avoid reporters.
	   They posed stiffly for photographers before beginning their
meetings Monday at a government guest house in New Delhi.
	   Talbott and Singh first met in Washington in June, soon after
India and neighboring Pakistan set off a series of tit-for-tat
underground nuclear tests. India and Pakistan have fought three
wars since both gained independence from Britain in 1947, and their
shared frontier remains tense, raising fears of a nuclear
conflagration in South Asia.
	   Talbott was expected to spend most of Monday in talks with
Singh. He was scheduled to meet later Monday with Vajpayee and Home
Minister Lal Krishna Advani. Advani recently took charge of
security in the northern state of Kashmir, subject of a territorial
dispute between India and Pakistan that lies at the heart of their
dangerous rivalry.
	   The vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force
Gen. Joseph Ralston, accompanied Talbott to New Delhi and was to
hold separate talks with Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes.
	   On Tuesday, the Talbott team planned to travel to Pakistan for
discussions with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Puerto Rico rallied from a 19-point deficit
early in the second half to defeat the United States 84-76 in their
Goodwill Games basketball opener. The Madison Square Garden crowd
favored the defending Goodwill champions by a 2-1 margin and
cheered loudly as Eddie Casiano scored 26 of his 31 points in the
second half. Puerto Rico trailed 55-36 with 15 1/2 minutes left,
then outscored the American college players 48-21 the rest of the
way. Elton Brand of Duke led the United States with 24 points.
	   Shane Heal scored 18 points and former Seton Hall star Andrew
Gaze added 17 as Australia opened the tournament with an 84-72
victory over Argentina. Marcelo Nicola had 23 points for the
Argentines.
	   Lithuania beat Russia 79-72, with Darius Lukminas coming off the
bench to score 21 points, and Brazil defeated China 75-60.

	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) _ Dominique Moceanu, the youngest, shortest
member of the ``Magnificent Seven'' gold-medal team in Atlanta, won
the all-around women's gymnnastics title.
	   She led from the start and finished with a score of 38.662, well
in front of Maria Olaru of Romania with 37.975. Another Romanian,
Simona Amanar, was third with 37.850.
	   World champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia finished seventh at
37.412 after a slip near the end of the floor exercise.

	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) _ Bill May of the United States was in line
to win two of the first medals ever awarded to a man in an
international synchronized swimming event. May and partner Kristina
Lum, the national champions, were in second place in the duet after
the short program, trailing Olga Brousnikina and Maria Kisseleva of
Russia by 0.733 points. Miho Takeda and Miya Tachibana of Japan
were third.
	   The United States was second behind Russia in the team event,
too, with May and Lum reserves, 98.600-97.467. Japan was third.
	   Male athletes are barred from synchronized swimming in the
Olympics and most other international meets, but the Goodwill Games
allowed May to compete.

	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) _ Marion Jones won her ninth consecutive
100-meter race despite a false start. On her second try, Jones
burst out of the blocks and raced to a three-yard (meter) victory
at the Goodwill Games Sunday night. Although her time of 10.90
seconds was her second-slowest of the year, it was the eighth
straight time she had broken 11 seconds. No other sprinter has done
it more than six times.
	   Ato Boldon, the 200 world champion from Trinidad and Tobago,
blazed around the curve and raced to a two-meter victory over Tyree
Washington in 20.15. John Godina, the world leader in the shot put
and discus, won the shot at 70 feet, 4 1/2 inches (21.4503 meters).
And after the first five events of the decathlon, U.S. champion
Chris Huffins led Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder Dan

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 students from Irian Jaya
staged a peaceful protest outside a United Nations' building in
Jakarta, calling on the world body to support their demand for
independence from Indonesia.
	   The peaceful protest in Indonesia's capital follows a series of
violent demonstrations in the territory, which comprises the
western half of New Guinea and lies about 3,200 kilometers (2,000
miles) east of Jakarta.
	   One policeman and one demonstrator were killed in recent trouble
in the remote province. During one protest, police opened fire when
a crowd raised the rebel flag of the outlawed Free West Papua
independence movement.
	   Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonizers in
1963.
	   Indonesian sovereignty was formalized in 1969 after a
U.N.-supervised ballot there favored incorporation with the rest of
Indonesia, itself a former Dutch colony.
	   Despite this, small bands of guerrillas have fought a low-key
war against Indonesian troops over the decades.
	   Calls for independence have grown in recent weeks following the
resignation in May of autocratic ex-President Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has relaxed controls
against protests as part of a wide ranging reform agenda.
	   Monday's protesters complained the 1969 U.N. vote had been
flawed and said most indigenous people in the province want
independence.
	   ``We have suffered for too long. We want our freedom or, at
least, a new referendum,'' said protester Ronalda Upuya.
	   A small delegation of protesters briefly met U.N. officials.
	   The protest coincided with a visit to Indonesia by Jamsheed
Marker, a special U.N. envoy for East Timor, where separatists are
also demanding independence from Indonesia.
	   Habibie has said that he is willing to grant a measure of
autonomy to East Timor, but not outright independence. Still, the
United Nations is hopeful a peaceful settlement can be reached for
the former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Irian Jaya, meanwhile, is Indonesia's largest and least
developed province. Though much of it consists of rugged mountains
or thick jungle, it has large mineral deposits and other natural
resources.
	   About 90 percent of its 1.5 million people are indigenous
Melanesians.
	   The other 10 percent are largely made up of settlers from other
parts of Indonesia. The presence of the economically more
successfully outsiders has been the source of friction there.

	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Bodies, shattered coconut palms
and the remains of flimsy huts floated off the shores of this
Pacific nation after a wall of water crashed into three villages.
The death toll Monday was at least 700, but could rise to 3,000
people.
	   Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted John Tekwi, governor of
West Sepik Province, as saying the 3,000 figure was
``conservative.'' Shortly before that, Papua New Guinea's national
radio quoted provincial officials as saying the toll could top
2,000.
	   There was no warning before the 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water
crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on
the island of New Guinea north of Australia, where some people live
a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The devastating wave, known as a tsunami, shattered the region
Friday after a magnitude-7 earthquake.
	   On Monday, many survivors were in shock. Rescue officials said
they expected to have a better idea later Monday on the death toll.
	   Entire villages have disappeared.
	   The village of Arop was built on a sand spit and had a
population of about 2,000 people. It no longer exists. There are no
people to be seen. Three other villages have also been destroyed.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, whose wife was killed. Romme, who broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and shoulder, spoke to Australian
Associated Press by telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health
Center.
	   Romme said he saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me''
before he was hurled into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano
lagoon.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and a 100-strong team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   ``Our first Hercules transport aircraft landed this morning at
Vanimo, and that hospital is beginning to function and treat
casualties,'' Australian defense department spokesman Colonel Keith
Jobson said in Canberra.
	   Jobson said up to 700 people had been buried and hundreds of
people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures. He said
sanitation equipment had been sent to make water supplies safe.
	   ``Until those missing come out of the bush, if indeed they do
come out of the bush, it is very difficult to determine how many
were actually killed,'' he said.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all. The prime concern at the moment is to
treat the injured and of course provide the survivors, those that
were uninjured, with food, water and shelter.''
	   New Zealand is sending a Hercules aircraft with relief supplies
and another medical team.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said that he couldn't even count the
number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (603
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province,
hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Port
Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged. The area, which was home to up to 10,000 people, was
deserted after villagers fled to higher ground.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Magnitude 6.1 earthquake hits Tibet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck
Shigatse county in central Tibet on Monday morning, but there were
no reports of damage or injuries, the Central Seismology Bureau
said.
	   The quake struck at 9:05 a.m. (0105 GMT), and was centered in
the lower part of the Tibetan plateau about 400 kilometers (250
miles) east of the provincial capital Lhasa, seismologists said.
	   A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage.
	   China's worst earthquake in recent history struck the northern
Chinese city of Tangshan in July 1976, killing more than 240,000
people.

Singapore posts unexpectedly good trade figures amid economic gloom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hounded by increasing fears of recession and
months of repeatedly poor trade performance, Singapore received
some unexpectedly good news on Monday as mid-year trade rebounded.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indication of overall economic
performance, rose 6.1 percent in June compared to last year,
according to the Trade Development Board.
	   The growth ran counter to most economists' expectations of a
decline for the month, raising hopes that the vulnerable Southeast
Asian city-state may be able to resist an overall contraction this
year.
	   The government board _ a division of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry _ added that non-oil domestic exports for the first half
of 1998 were up 5.1 percent from the same period last year, when
the economy posted a 0.2 percent increase.
	   Total non-oil exports in June were 7.9 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.7 billion) compared with 7.06 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.2 billion) in May, the board's report said.
	   Singapore stocks were up on the positive news, with the
benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index rising 1.1 percent above
the opening level to 1106.99 in mid-afternoon trading.
	   The island republic's currency was also boosted by the surprise
trade figures, jumping to 1.7025 Singapore dollars to the greenback
in early afternoon trading from a high of 1.7103 shortly before the
news emerged.

O'Meara a two-time major champion with British Open win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise reference to Baker-Fitch. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Maybe now, Mark O'Meara will invite
Ian Baker-Finch over to his house to share a drink out of the Auld
Claret Jug.
	   If he does, he might do it while wearing his green jacket.
	   The confidence O'Meara gained only three months ago in winning
the Masters proved crucial on a rainy day at Royal Birkdale, where
sun broke through Sunday just in time for him to hoist the British
Open trophy and give it a kiss on the 18th green.
	   O'Meara survived the shifting weather off the Irish Sea to shoot
even par for 72 holes, only to applaud politely when Brian Watts
hit a miracle shot out of a bunker on No. 18 to force a four-hole
playoff.
	   O'Meara then calmed the nerves that had also popped up at
Augusta for a steady performance against a player who had never
been in contention in a major before.
	   At 41, O'Meara became the oldest player to win two major titles
in one year and the first to win the Open and Masters in the same
year since Nick Faldo in 1990.
	   ``It's just an incredible feeling,'' O'Meara said. ``If I could
put my finger on it, I would have done it earlier in my career.
It's just not that easy.''
	   In 1991, Baker-Finch won at Birkdale playing alongside O'Meara,
then invited his friend to drink out of the jug with him. On
Sunday, it was O'Meara's turn, as he made his way through light
rain with a final round of 68 that appeared to be all he would
need.
	   When it wasn't, he got up from his perch on the grass
surrounding the 18th green, kissed his wife, and went out to birdie
the first playoff hole and par the next three to win his first jug.
	   After beginning the year as not even the best golfer in a
neighborhood that includes Tiger Woods, O'Meara can now
legitimately claim to be the best in the world.
	   ``Even though I'm nervous, even though certain things have
transpired throughout my career, I realize that more times than not
that I've been able to finish off the deal and get the job done,''
O'Meara said.
	   He got the job done at Birkdale, just as he did at Augusta. This
time, he got it done because he was able to master conditions that
ranged from howling winds and rain to bright sunshine over four
days.
	   And, in the end, he got it done because Watts could not hit two
shots of a lifetime out of bunkers fronting the 18th green, the
second in the playoff.
	   Woods almost made it to the playoff, too, roaring from behind
with birdies on three of the last four holes. He closed with a 66,
tied with Scotland's Raymond Russell for the best round of the day,
to finish at 281.
	   Four players tied for fourth at 282: Russell, Jim Furyk, Jesper
Parnevik and the 17-year-old amateur Justin Rose of England. It was
the best showing by an amateur since Frank Stranahan in 1953.
	   Rose thrilled his countrymen by staying in the tournament until
the end, capping his performance with a 45-yard (41-meter) chip-in
on No. 18 that brought a thunderous ovation from the crowd.
	   The last hole also proved to be the key for Watts.
	   After forcing the playoff with a spectacular chip shot from a
greenside bunker to within tap-in distance, Watts didn't come close
when he tried to hole a shot out of an adjacent trap in a desperate
bid to keep the match going.
	   ``I knew I had to hole the bunker shot to have any kind of
chance,'' Watts said.
	   Watts, who held a two-shot lead entering the final round, played
solidly, shooting an even-par 70 that included a crucial 18-foot
(5.49-meter) birdie putt on the 17th hole.
	   When the playoff began, though, experience took over. Watts has
won 10 times in Japan, but never completed a successful year on the
U.S. PGA Tour. O'Meara is the Masters champion, and has a game
honed by regular practice matches with his friend Woods.
	   On the way to the 15th tee to begin the playoff, caddie Jerry
Higginbotham reminded him of those matches.
	   ``I told him just pretend you've got Tiger out for an emergency
nine at night because he beats him all the time,'' Higginbotham
said.
	   If Woods hadn't run out of holes in front of him, he might have
joined him for this little match, too.
	   Woods sank a 30-foot (9.14-meter) chip on the 17th hole that got
his fist pumping, then followed it with a 30-foot (9.14-meter)
birdie putt on 18 to get to 1-under and a tie for the lead. When
O'Meara birdied 17 behind him and Watts followed suit, Woods'
chances were over.
	   ``I'm very happy I shot 66, but going out I knew that probably
even par was going to be the number and I just didn't do it,'' he
said.
	   Woods had to be satisfied that he was in contention in a major
for the first time since winning the 1997 Masters. Middle rounds of
73-77 were his undoing in a tournament he opened with a 65 and
closed with a 66.
	   If he had been able to contend with the winds Friday and
Saturday a bit better, it might be Woods with two majors instead of
O'Meara. At the beginning of the year, few in golf would have
predicted that O'Meara would have more majors than his friend.
	   Now, he's got a chance in the PGA Championship next month
outside Seattle to be the first player to win three majors in a
year since Ben Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in
1953.
	   That fact certainly wasn't lost on O'Meara, whose previous
closest brush to the claret jug came when Baker-Finch invited him
over to his Florida house and they drank together from the trophy.
	   ``He said, `Look, I can't tell you how much it meant that I
played with a good friend and how supportive you were to me,'''
O'Meara recalled.
	   Since that time, of course, Baker-Finch's game has gone sour. He
was at Birkdale as a TV commentator, not a player.
	   O'Meara's game, meanwhile, has never been better. Despite 14
victories in 18 years on the PGA Tour, he had never been mentioned
as one of the game's best, and he doesn't think that should change.
	   ``I think I'm a very nice player, a good player,'' O'Meara said.
``I don't classify myself as a great player.''
	   If he keeps winning claret jugs and green jackets, some people
might.

Thai oil company president wins Magsaysay prize for public service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Thai oil company president who
helped rural community groups and cooperatives become gasoline
dealers was named winner Monday of the 1998 Ramon Magsaysay Award
for public service.
	   The awards board cited Sophon Suphapong, president of Bangchak
Petroleum Ltd., for encouraging these small groups to ``own and
operate businesses as affiliates of one of Thailand's major oil
companies.''
	   This helped rural areas benefit more from the country's rapid
economic growth, it said.
	   After joining the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, Sophon, 52,
was assigned to rehabilitate a debt-ridden state-owned oil
refinery. He reorganized the company and restored it to
profitability, and was named president of the re-named Bangchak
Petroleum in 1985.
	   Sophon pursued a marketing plan which concentrated on rural
areas and encouraged the formation of community organizations and
cooperatives to distribute and sell Bangchak products.
	   As the government considers selling its remaining 80 percent
stake in the company, Sophon is in the forefront of a campaign to
give Thai citizens priority over foreign investors in the ownership
of Bangchak stocks.
	   Sophon is the second Magsaysay winner to be named this year.
Last week, Adibul Hasan Rizvi, director of Karachi's Sindh
Institute of Urology and Transplantation, was named winner for
government service.
	   Three other recipients of this year's Magsaysay Award will be
chosen in the areas of international understanding, community
leadership, and journalism, literature and creative arts.
	   The winners will be honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies
in Manila on Aug. 31, the birth date of Magsaysay, a popular
Philippine president who died in a plane crash in 1957.
	   The winners of the award, considered the Asian equivalent of the
Nobel Prize, each receive a certificate, medallion and dlrs 50,000.

Five more South Korean diplomats to be withdrawn from Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs throughout with agreement to limit number of
intelligence officials
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five South Koreans are being withdrawn
from Russia under an agreement to limit the number of intelligence
agents each country assigns to its diplomatic missions, Seoul's
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   ``The withdrawal is in accordance with an agreement between the
intelligence authorities of both countries,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Lee Ho-jin told reporters.
	   Lee said the agreement will limit the number of intelligence
officials each country will keep in its diplomatic missions in the
other's territory to two.
	   Lee hoped that the agreement would resolve a diplomatic row
which began early this month when each country expelled one
diplomat on charges of spying.
	   In negotiations that followed, Russia acknowledged that it has
two intelligence agents at its embassy in Seoul and proposed that
South Korea limit to two the number of its intelligence officials
in Russia, Lee said.
	   South Korea accepted the proposal, Lee said, and has ordered the
withdrawal of two agents from its embassy in Moscow and three from
its consulate in Vladisvostok.
	   Lee refused to disclose further details but other ministry
officials said the five agents would be brought home after the
foreign ministers of the two countries meet next week.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is scheduled to meet
his South Korean counterpart, Park Chung-soo, during a meeting of
the Asian Regional Forum in Manila next Monday.
	   The diplomatic row began July 4 when Russia ordered the
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spy charges.
Cho's alleged Russian contact, a senior Foreign Ministry official,
was arrested on treason charges.
	   Four days later, South Korea retaliated by ordering the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat in Seoul, Oleg N. Abramkin _ an
action Moscow said was unwarranted.
	   It was the most serious diplomatic dispute reported between
Moscow and Seoul since the former adversaries opened formal
diplomatic relations in 1990. Russia's predecessor, the former
Soviet Union, was a longtime ally of Seoul's rival, communist North
Korea.
	   Relations between Seoul and Moscow have warmed significantly in
the recent past, while ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have
cooled considerably.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Air raid sirens wailed and church bells
peeled in mourning as Greek Cypriots commemorated Monday the
anniversary of Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus.
	   Greek Cypriots, wakened at dawn by sirens that marked the time
Turkish paratroopers landed after a coup by supporters of union
with Greece, packed churches for memorial services for the more
than 5,000 people who were killed and disappeared in the fighting
that followed the invasion.
	   Citizens on the Greek side of this divided island planned to
stage demonstrations later Monday to protest the continuing Turkish
occupation of the northern third of Cyprus.
	   For their part, Turkish Cypriots planned to celebrate the
invasion. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and five of his
ministers are scheduled to visit northern Cyprus on Monday. Turkey
maintains some 35,000 troops in Cyprus and is the only country to
recognise the Turkish Cypriots' breakaway statelet.
	   An aerobatics team of the Turkish air force was due to put on a
display of precision flying and six Turkish warships have docked in
northern Cypriot ports.
	   The Cyprus government accused Turkey on Sunday of ``threatening
peace'' by sending the warships and planes to the occupied part of
the island.
	   This year's anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than
usual because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriot decision
to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey has vowed
to prevent the missiles' deployment and Greece, a fellow member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has warned it will respond
to any attack on Cyprus.

Philippine stocks fall sharply, peso lower on regional weakness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended sharply lower
Monday because of foreign selling prompted by expectations that the
country's economic fundamentals aren't as healthy as proclaimed by
the new government, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar
in step with other regional currencies.
	   ``It's now time for a reality check for investors,'' said Noel
Reyes, vice president for research of Anscor-Hagedorn Securities
Inc. ``They realize that the new administration isn't telling the
entire story. Our budget deficit is growing and the government just
announced that it downgraded its economic growth targets.''
	   The government incurred a budget deficit of 24 billion pesos
(dlrs 585 million) in the first half of 1998. The government also
said over the weekend it has lowered its growth targets and raised
its inflation estimates this year because of the impact of the
Asian financial crisis and a drought attributed to the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.81 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,734.45, after slipping 9.74 points, or 0.5
percent, on Friday.
	   Decliners outpaced advancers 64 to 19, while 39 issues were
unchanged.
	   President Joseph Estrada is scheduled to deliver his first state
of the nation address later this month and his deputies have said
he will come clean with the true state of the economy.
	   Traders said investors, fearful of more bad news, have sold down
Manila shares ahead of Estrada's address.
	   The onset of the earnings season also has investors worried,
traders said.
	   Shares of oil refiner Petron Corp. fell 4.9 percent following
the release of flat first half earnings early Monday. Also dragging
down Petron shares was state-owned Philippine National Oil Co.'s
recent announcement that it may sell part of its remaining 40
percent stake in Petron.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.633 pesos in morning
trading, up from 41.392 pesos on Friday.
	   Dealers said with Tokyo closed for a holiday Monday, attention
focused on other key Asian currencies such as the Thai baht and the
Singapore dollar.
	   The Philippine peso tends to shadow movements of the Thai baht,
dealers said.

Thai children's rights group says abuse cases soaring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's economic crisis is proving
trouble for children, a rights groups said Monday, citing a soaring
number of abuse cases, particularly in Bangkok.
	   The Child Protection Foundation, a volunteer organization,
released statistics that showed 119 children were reported victims
of serious abuse through the first six months of 1998, compared
with 174 for all of 1997 and just 63 in 1996.
	   ``Child abuse in Thai families is increasing at a critical pace
this year,'' said Montri Sinthavichai, secretary general of the
foundation.
	   He said the number of children suffering abuse was the highest
since he began working in the field more than a decade ago.
	   Montri blamed Thailand's economic crisis and the pressures of
urban living for rising rates of abuse. Thailand's economy hit the
skids after the country floated its currency in July last year.
	   The International Monetary Fund is supervising a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout of the economy, but so far it hasn't prevented many
companies from going bankrupt or scaling back operations.
	   As a result, more than a million Thais have lost their jobs
since the economy turned sour last year.
	   ``Parents are under so much pressure because they are either
unemployed or their income can't keep up with rising prices, so
many families are poor now. Parents become angry and frustrated and
take it out on their children,'' he said.
	   Urban living, which fuels financial desire and where families
are split up while parents work away from the home, also
contributes to the problem, he said.
	   Of the 119 victims of child abuse, 57 were harmed by their own
parents. In 33 cases, the abused children were less than four years
old, and in 30 cases they were between four and six years old.
	   ``Some children are abused for years before their cases come to
our attention,'' Montri said, adding that some parents had used
weapons on their children, or burned them with irons and
cigarettes.
	   So far this year, 14 children have been killed, compared with 21
for all of last year.
	   Child labor and abuse is a serious problem in Thailand that goes
far beyond the statistics compiled by Montri's foundation.
	   The United Nation Children's Fund has estimated that 300,000
children are prisoners in Thai brothels while many more are
enslaved in sweatshops.
	   Children's rights advocates say many Thai families view their
children as property to be used, sold or dispensed with as the
parents see fit.
	   Thailand still has a better record regarding children's rights
than some of its neighbors, such as Myanmar and Cambodia, where
children are forcibly conscripted into the army or are fighting the
government as members of insurgent groups.

Reports of crime in Indonesia shake investor confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Looting and other crime continued in
some parts of crisis-ridden Indonesia over the weekend, adding to
investor fears over the stability of the country, according to
local media reports Monday.
	   Some 500 people looted cooking oil from a fair organized by the
country's cooperatives, state-owned news agency Antara reported.
	   Cooperatives Minister Adi Sasono, however, denied the looting
reports, saying ``the cooking oil was just given by the
cooperatives to the people crowding at the kiosk when it was
raining.''
	   The disturbance adds to the looting last week at shrimp farms,
coffee plantations and food warehouses in East Java.
	   Reports also said hundreds of people in Bogor, West Java, took
over some parts of a cattle ranch, owned by former President
Suharto.
	   Local villagers say they rightfully own the land that was
developed into a ranch by Suharto in 1972.
	   Unconfirmed reports said that some had slaughtered a number of
the former leader's steers.
	   Late last week military commander Gen. Wiranto called for an end
to lawlessness, which began with the resignation in May of Suharto.
	   Suharto ended 32 years as president after Jakarta and other
cities were hit by a wave of protests and riots.
	   Wiranto has said that his troops will crack down hard on mobs
who flout the law as Indonesia struggles with its worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Many fear crime will worsen as unemployment and inflation soar.
	   Dealers said looting reports helped depress gains made last week
by the rupiah.
	   By midday Monday Indonesia's currency had worsened to around
14,000 rupiah to one U.S. dollar, compared with 13,775 rupiahs at
its close on Friday.

Arranged marriages appeal to Indians trying to keeping traditions
</HEADLINE>
alive &QL; 
 &UR; By PAISLEY DODDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (AP) _ A Hindi proverb talks about a
kernel of grain being smashed between two grindstones. In English,
the phrase is being caught between a rock and a hard place.
	   Sandip Bhojani knows both well.
	   The 30-year-old likes his new life in the United States. He has
a good job as a hotel manager. He has lots of friends. Lots of
party invitations. Fast car. Loud stereo.
	   But he also has strong ties to his native traditions. He still
lives with his parents. He has a 2 a.m. curfew. And he is
considering a custom many of his American-born friends might find
unusual _ an arranged marriage.
	   ``My parents grew up in an old time,'' said Bhojani, who came to
the United States from India as a teen-ager. ``They don't
understand how things work. I want to have my own life but I also
want to make them happy. It can be really difficult.''
	   To make it easier, the Indian community scattered across the
United States has turned to the Internet to find ways to stay
connected to the ancient traditions of language and customs _ and
to find a suitable match in marriage.
	   Research suggests that the person Bhojani marries could help
determine whether those traditions stay alive.
	   ``Typically, by the second generation, immigrants are not
inclined to marry within their own ethnic group and that has a lot
of bearing on whether native traditions survive,'' said Stephan
Thernstrom, a history professor at Harvard University.
	   Arranged marriages, like many fixtures of Indian culture,
evolved in part out of the caste system.
	   Marriages were not only a union between two people, but they
also served as a social contract between two families of the same
caste. It was not uncommon for two people to see each other only
briefly before they wed, and it was not unusual to see child
marriages.
	   ``We know that someday, they (his son and daughter) will mix in
with the rest of society and perhaps some of the traditions will be
lost,'' said Sandip's father, Navin Bhojani, 56, of Waltham. ``But
we would like to see him with a woman from a similar background.''
	   For Bhojani, that means a woman who is educated, from India's
Gujarat province, Hindu, vegetarian, and preferably from the same
subcaste.
	   That's a tall order to fill in Massachusetts, so Bhojani's
parents looked to the Web.
	   Usha Sodha, owner of ``Marriage.Com,'' an Indian Internet
matrimonial service in Orange, California, has Bhojani on file.
``In India it is a close community. But here, it's hard for people
to find a good match,'' she says.
	   The membership costs between dlrs 150 and dlrs 250 for two
years. It entitles people to sift through the files of
marriage-minded Indians and Southeast Asians. Like dozens of other
matrimonial services now on the Web, they come complete with
pictures, caste, subcaste, religion, language and astrological
chart.
	   ``We've had about 50 or 60 marriages since we've opened,'' Sodha
said. For an extra fee, she will help in the matchmaking process
herself.
	   Besides the Internet, parents can search for suitable matches
for their sons and daughters through Indian television programs,
newspapers and magazines.
	   Bhojani has already seen pictures of several women with similar
backgrounds over the Web. But he's still looking for someone that
both he and his parents like.
	   His tradition-minded parents are convinced that a proper
marriage builds a strong family.
	   ``He (and his wife) will live with us for a while,'' Navin
Bhojani said. ``We are Hindus. We don't eat meat or eggs. We go to
temple every weekend. Compatibility is important.''
	   Compatibility was exactly what Paresh Shah, a 35-year-old
attorney in Anaheim, California, was looking for when he signed up
over the Internet.
	   Within four months, he found the woman he married.
	   ``We both could have gotten people on our own, the way other
Americans find each other, but our parents recommended this and we
agreed,'' he said.
	   Bhavani Srinivasan, a pediatrician who lives on New York's Long
Island, married his wife three weeks after meeting her.
	   ``My parents checked to see if we would be compatible, they
checked our astrological charts, and that's how my marriage took
place,'' he said. ``It was something like a blind date but it's
worked.''
	   Bhojani says he's in no hurry. He would like to fall in love
first _ in India that's called a ``love marriage'' _ but he's not
opposed to an arranged marriage.
	   ``I certainly won't do something I don't want to do, but they've
been pushing me since I was 25,'' he said. ``I'm trying to keep an
open mind.''

Nobel laureate Gordimer becomes U.N. goodwill ambassador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Nobel Prize winning author Nadine Gordimer has
been named to help promote programs to combat poverty in developing
countries, the U.N. development agency said Monday.
	   South African Gordimer, 64, who received the Nobel for
literature in 1991, is renowned for her writing on the country's
apartheid era.
	   She joins American actor Danny Glover, who in March was named as
the U.N. Development Program's first ``goodwill ambassador.''
	   ``Ms. Gordimer's commitment to social justice and her outspoken
support for the disenfranchised have established her as a strong
international voice for the world's poor and disadvantaged,'' UNDP
said in a statement.
	   The agency has anti-poverty programs in 174 countries.

Opposition party says three supporters killed in past week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A leading opposition party claimed
Monday that three supporters have been killed in politically
motivated attacks in the past week and that election officials have
done nothing to halt persistent violence in the run-up to voting
Sunday.
	   But a human rights investigator, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that at least one of the victims appeared to have
numerous enemies and politics may not have been the murder motive.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party blamed supporters of strongman Hun Sen for
the killings. In one, a party organizer went fishing with a local
police chief and did not return. His body was found in a fishing
basket with a bullet in his head.
	   The party, led by dissident Sam Rainsy, said in a statement that
the National Election Committee had failed to investigate numerous
complaints and was ``little more than a cover for the ruling
party's effort to legitimize itself through a fraudulent
election.''
	   Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
in a bloody coup last year. Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party
and the Sam Rainsy Party are the two principal challengers to Hun
Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party in the election
for 122 seats in the National Assembly.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Air raid sirens wailed and church bells
peeled in mourning as Greek Cypriots commemorated Monday the
anniversary of Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus.
	   Greek Cypriots, wakened at dawn by sirens that marked the time
Turkish paratroopers landed after a coup by supporters of union
with Greece, packed churches for memorial services for the more
than 5,000 people who were killed and disappeared in the fighting
that followed the invasion.
	   Citizens on the Greek side of this divided island planned to
stage demonstrations later Monday to protest the continuing Turkish
occupation of the northern third of Cyprus.
	   For their part, Turkish Cypriots planned to celebrate the
invasion. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and five of his
ministers are scheduled to visit northern Cyprus on Monday. Turkey
maintains some 35,000 troops in Cyprus and is the only country to
recognize the Turkish Cypriots' breakaway statelet.
	   An aerobatics team of the Turkish air force was due to put on a
display of precision flying and six Turkish warships have docked in
northern Cypriot ports.
	   The Cyprus government accused Turkey on Sunday of ``threatening
peace'' by sending the warships and planes to the occupied part of
the island.
	   This year's anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than
usual because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriot decision
to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey has vowed
to prevent the missiles' deployment and Greece, a fellow member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has warned it will respond
to any attack on Cyprus.
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, justified
the deal in an address to the nation Sunday night, saying the
missiles were required because of ``the ever-threatening presence
of the Turkish occupation troops who are in an attack formation.''
	   He rejected U.S. criticism of the purchase, saying Cyprus would
not accept restrictions on its defense.
	   On the northern side of the U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone,
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reminded his community Sunday
night of their suffering in the years before the invasion when
there was inter-factional fighting and ethnic cleansing.
	   ``In the 1963-74 period, the Greek Cypriot knife was held to our
throat. We held our heads high. We trusted (Turkey) and we won,''
Denktash told the local Bayrak radio.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island
collapsed in August 1967 after Denktash insisted on the recognition
of his breakaway state and that Cyprus abandon its bid to join the
European Union.

Korean-language computer program maker cancels deal with Microsoft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An ailing Korean-language computer
program maker found a new local investor Monday and canceled an
earlier deal with U.S. computer giant Microsoft.
	   Early last month, Hangul and Computer Co. signed a letter of
intent to accept a dlrs 20 million investment by Microsoft. In
return, it promised to immediately discontinue developing its
Korean-language programs and stop selling existing products within
a year.
	   The decision provoked an angry reaction from Korean computer
users, who said it would lead to a monopoly by Microsoft in the
Korean-language program market.
	   The Korean Venture Business Association, claiming 700 member
companies in the computer and technology industry, launched a
fund-raising campaign to save Hangul and Computer.
	   On Monday, the association said it would invest 10 billion won
(dlrs 7.1 million) in Hangul and Computer with funds raised by its
member companies. It promised an additional investment, if needed.
	   In return for the investment, Hangul and Computer will
immediately discontinue talks with Microsoft.
	   Lee Chan-jin, head of Hangul and Computer, said the letter of
intent his company signed with Microsoft in June was not legally
binding.
	   ``It is a regrettable decision, but it will not change
Microsoft's support for South Korea's computer software industry,''
said Kim Jae-min, head of Microsoft's South Korean operation.
	   Founded in 1989, Hangul and Computer Co. developed a series of
Korean-language programs that hold about 81 percent of the dlrs 15
million market in South Korea. Microsoft has 12 percent of the
market.
	   Experts say Hangul and Computer's Korean programs are superior
to Microsoft's because they recognizes more combinations of the
24-character Korean alphabet, known as Hangul, including some
archaic ones.
	   Hangul and Computer defaulted on dlrs 180,000 in debt in May,
blaming its financial troubles on illegal copying of its products.
It began looking for an investor, but initially no South Korean
company showed interest.

United States reportedly will sell warships to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The U.S. Navy will sell Taiwan four
Knox-class missile frigates to help boost the island's sea defenses
against China, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Such plans would be a sign that Washington plans to help Taiwan
keep a credible defense against China, despite President Bill
Clinton's recent visit to the mainland. Clinton caused concern here
by publicly stating U.S. policy that it would not support Taiwan's
independence or membership in organizations such as the United
Nations.
	   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on reports carried by
the United Daily News, which quoted unidentified Taiwanese naval
officials.
	   Two of the frigates, now in service with the U.S. Navy, are
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan in September 1999, and the two others
will be sold as scrap for logistical support, the paper said.
	   In addition, it said the 13,700-ton USS Pensacola, a transport
ship used in aircraft carrier groups, would be leased to Taiwan.
The ship currently is in service at Pearl Harbor, it said.
	   Taiwan has leased six other 30-year-old Knox-class frigates from
the U.S. Navy. The report said Taiwan will undertake a massive
program to upgrade the frigates' air defense, anti-submarine and
electronic warfare capabilities to make them the backbone of the
naval force early next century.
	   Taiwan also has bought six French-built Lafayette frigates in an
overhaul to retire aging World War II vessels.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalists who fled the communist
takeover of the Chinese mainland in 1949 following a civil war. The
two sides are technically still at war.

millionaire Steve Fossett came in at 11:05 a.m. EDT (1505 GMT) for
a finishing time of 19 hours, 50 minutes, 32 seconds. That tops the
previous multi-hull course record of 29:35:22, also set by Stars
and Stripes in 1996.
	   Stars and Stripes also was first across the line in the previous
weekend's Port Huron to Mackinac yacht race. In a different sport,
Fossett fell short in January of setting a new world record for
solo, around-the-world hot air ballooning.
	   Three other boats in the Chicago-to-Mackinac Island event had
crossed the line by 10 p.m. EDT (0200 GMT Monday). They included
two other multi-hull competitors _ RX-Site and Earth Voyager.
	   The other boat across the line was the first mono-hull finisher,
Sayonara. Skippered by Larry Ellison, it came in at 5:22 p.m. (2122
GMT) with a time of 25:52:48. That was 2 minutes, 4 seconds short
of the course-record set by Dick Jennings' Pied Piper in 1987.
	   The race's winners will be determined based on a system of
handicaps based on each boat's speed potential. The results are
expected Monday afternoon.
	   ``We believe it still to be the second fastest race in Mack
history,'' said race spokeswoman Penny Beatty.
	   Winds, which had been 15-20 knots with two- to three-foot (up to
1 meter) waves in the Straits of Mackinac at 6:30 p.m. (2230 GMT),
had dropped off to seven knots by 10 p.m. (0200 GMT Monday), with
swells one foot or less.
	   The bulk of the fleet was near the Manitou Islands at 10 p.m
(0200 GMT Monday). and would be expected to finish ``between
breakfast and lunch'' Monday, Beatty said.
	   One boat had to withdraw because of equipment trouble, leaving
298 boats still in the race or across the line, Beatty said.

Thai sugar exports sour amid Asian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's sugar exports to most of its
Asian customers dropped off sharply in this year's first five
months because of the region's economic crisis, the government's
Office of Cane and Sugar Board said Monday.
	   Thailand is one of the top sugar exporters in the world.
	   Sugar exports to Indonesia, Thailand's largest customer, totaled
708,750 metric tons from January to May, compared to 915,900 tons
for the same period last year, a decline of 22.6 percent.
	   Exports to South Korea, the second major importer, registered a
drop of 77.4 percent, to 116,255 tons from 515,317. Sugar exports
to Malaysia dropped by 72.5 percent, from 260,050 tons to 71,510.
	   Exports to China were down by 33.8 percent, from 114,200 tons to
75,640.
	   However, exports to Japan continued to show modest growth,
increasing 16.2 percent to 362,065.92 tons from 311,651.41.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ With fighting intensifying and the
death toll mounting in Kosovo, a broad coalition of Serbian
opposition leaders Monday called on the United States to take the
lead in helping to end the conflict.
	   The ``Alliance for Change,'' consisting of Serbs opposed to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was meeting the United
States' senior Balkans diplomat, Richard Gelbard, for talks aimed
at persuading the international community to broker a cease fire
and prevent more arms getting into Kosovo.
	   ``We are Serbs and we want peace,'' former Yugoslav Premier
Milan Panic said ahead of the meeting. ``We know what the results
were in Bosnia, we want to avoid a repetition of that.''
	   Panic planned to ask Gelbard to push the international community
to send observers to the province of Kosovo in an attempt to halt
five months of fighting between Yugoslav forces and ethnic
Albanians who demand independence.
	   Alliance members, who include reformist Serbs from Kosovo and a
Serbian Orthodox bishop from the province, support broad autonomy
for Kosovo, but say negotiations are essential to discuss the
province's future.
	   As they gathered in The Hague Sunday night, hundreds of Serb
police were battling the Kosovo Liberation Army's secessionist
guerrillas for control of the central Kosovo town of Orahovac. At
least 100 people died over the weekend fighting for the town.
	   ``The problem is that the KLA is growing and pretty soon most
Albanians will be part of that army,'' said Vesna Pesic, president
of the Serbian Civic Alliance.
	   The group wants Western support for democratic reforms within
Yugoslavia, saying democracy is key to peace in the region. They
also are seeking to establish themselves as viable alternatives to
Balkan strong man Milosevic.
	   ``It is wise to have political consultations not only with
Milosevic but with other people who are politically active in
Serbia,'' Pesic added. She described Milosevic as ``the main factor
of instability in the Balkans.''

	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built
on a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people. It no
longer exists.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, who said he saw ``the sea rising up and
coming toward me.''
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7
undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages
Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New
Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia,
where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and
swamps.
	   The official death toll Monday was at least 700, but John Tekwi,
governor of West Sepik Province, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. as saying at least 3,000 people had died.
	   Brother Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary from Vanimo
who is cordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press about 1,000 bodies had been buried so far and ''at least
3,000 are still missing.''
	   Missionaries and villagers are burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches.
	   Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets to try and
reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, said villagers
had told him giant salt-water crocodiles which live along the coast
were feeding on the corpses.
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the wave hurled
him into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano lagoon. His wife
was killed.
	   On Monday, many survivors were in shock.
	   ``There's a lot of people coming out of the jungle, dazed still,
after three days,'' said an AP photographer at the ruined village
of Cissano.
	   ``They're fishing an awful lot of bodies out of the lagoon, and
finding an awful lot of bodies around the village as well,'' he
said.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and a 100-strong team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   Hundreds of people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures,
Australian defense department spokesman Col. Keith Jobson said in
Canberra.
	   ``Until those missing come out of the bush, if indeed they do
come out of the bush, it is very difficult to determine how many
were actually killed,'' he said.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all. The prime concern at the moment is to
treat the injured and of course provide the survivors, those that
were uninjured, with food, water and shelter.''
	   New Zealand is sending a Hercules aircraft with relief supplies
and another medical team.
	   The combined population of the district is not precisely known,
but government chief secretary Robert Igara estimated it at
betweeen 6,000 and 10,000 people.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remotness of the
region. Australian transport planes had to fly 2,350 miles(3,780
kilometers) to the disaster scene.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said that he couldn't even count the
number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (603
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Chinese dissidents stage hunger strike to protest arrests

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with other dissidents joining hunger strike,
quotes from hunger striker, ADDS background, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Three Chinese dissidents began a hunger strike
Monday, joining a fourth hunger striker, to protest a police
roundup of democracy campaigners who tried to set up a political
party to challenge China's communist rulers.
	   The crackdown on organizers of the China Democracy Party has
provoked an unusually vocal and unified response from China's
small, embattled dissident community.
	   Aside from Monday's hunger strikers, 79 dissidents _ from
prominent campaigners to one well-known government critic inactive
in recent years _ signed their names to a petition last Thursday
denouncing the arrests.
	   The swelling protests reflect concerns among dissidents that the
crackdown runs counter to recent government promises to strengthen
human rights protections. It may also mark an end to the tolerance
that the Communist Party displayed over the past 18 months as it
sought to improve relations with the United States.
	   ``We hope that this comparatively relaxed political atmosphere
will not be cut short,'' said Wu Gaoxing, a 56-year-old dissident
from eastern Zhejiang province detained for two days in the
crackdown.
	   Wu said he stopped taking food at midday Monday and planned to
live on water for 48 hours. He said two colleagues _ Ye Wenxiang
and Fu Quan _ vowed to fast as well. They could not immediately be
contacted by telephone.
	   The fourth hunger striker, Xie Wanjun, said he stopped taking
food Sunday evening and would drink only liquids for the next 48
hours to show his ``extreme anger'' over the police crackdown.
	   ``The government wants dissidents to follow the law, but we also
want the police to follow the law and constitution,'' Xie, an
unemployed 33-year-old, said in a telephone interview from his home
in eastern Shandong province.
	   Dissidents announced the formation of the China Democracy Party
on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in China
for a nine-day visit. But authorities refused to let the party
register, as required by law.
	   The crackdown on party organizers started on July 10, a week
after Clinton left. Eleven people have since been detained, five of
whom remain in custody. They may be charged with subversion, the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy
Movement in China said.
	   The crackdown has brought dissidents together even though their
views of how to push for democracy in China differ.
	   Wu Gaoxing, the Zhejiang hunger striker, said he originally
opposed setting up the China Democracy Party. Before the crackdown,
he argued with Wang Donghai, a party founder now in jail, that
China was not ready for an opposition party.
	   ``Setting up a multiparty political system is a long-term goal.
But I don't think that the conditions exist at present,'' Wu said.
	   But Wu, who was detained at the start of the crackdown, said he
felt compelled to protest the suppression.
	   ``The police were wrong,'' he said. By seeking to register their
party, Wang and others ``didn't break the law.''

Nelson gives Irwin scare in Ameritech Senior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Though he was smiling as he walked
off the course, Hale Irwin couldn't help but feel as if Larry
Nelson had beaten him. And on this day, Nelson had.
	   But when the unhappiness over his poor play wears off, all
that's going to matter is that Irwin, not Nelson, took home the
trophy from the Ameritech Senior Open.
	   ``Certainly, earlier, I felt Larry was the winner because he
truly played inspired golf,'' Irwin said. ``When I get home ... it
will feel a lot better than it does now.''
	   Taking an eight-stroke lead into Sunday's round, Irwin faltered
and needed some breaks to hang on and beat Nelson by three strokes.
His 73 was his first plus-70 score in 11 rounds, and he finished at
15-under 201. Nelson shot a 68.
	   ``I've played extremely well over the last three weeks,'' Irwin
said. ``There was going to be a down day, and this was the down
day. Fortunately, I had a little bit of a cushion to fall back
on.''
	   It was Irwin's fourth Senior U.S. PGA Tour victory this season,
and 17th overall on the senior tour. His first senior victory was
in 1995 at this tournament at Stonebridge Country Club.
	   The senior circuit's money leader picked up dlrs 195,000 for the
victory, giving him dlrs 1,735,250 for the year. Nelson, who has
won two tournaments this season, earned dlrs 114,400.
	   ``I felt really comfortable at times and felt like there was a
chance he might make a mistake,'' Nelson said. ``He is human.''
	   Nelson was the only one who refused to concede the tournament
after the second round. He kept the pressure on the three-time U.S.
Open winner all day, getting eight birdies and trying a gutsy drive
over 60-foot (18.29-meters) trees on the 18th.
	   But he put two shots in the water on the back nine, and missed
birdie putts on the 17th and 18th.
	   ``I made enough birdies to catch him, but I just made too many
mistakes,'' Nelson said. ``But if I hadn't taken those risks, I
wouldn't have gotten some of the birdies.''
	   It was hardly the finish anyone expected after the first two
rounds. Irwin's 10-under 62 Friday set a record at Kemper Lakes
Golf Course, and his eight-stroke lead tied the senior tour record
for largest lead. He also tied the record for 36 holes in relation
to par _ which he set in last year's Vantage Championship _ with
his 16-under 128.
	   But Irwin said he'd felt this day coming.
	   ``The way I've been playing, there was going to be a time I'd
tweak it a little,'' he said. ``And this was the day.''
	   Irwin didn't get his first birdie until the par-5 7th, when he
put a trap shot within three feet of the pin and then tapped in to
go 17-under. He gave the stroke back on No. 9 when his par putt
skipped over the rim of the cup. As he handed his putter to his
caddy, Irwin shook his head in disgust.
	   Nelson, meanwhile, started a run of five straight birdies with a
chip-in from 15 feet (4.57 meters) on No. 3. As he walked up the
eighth fairway, one fan in the gallery yelled out, ``C'mon Larry,
keep charging! Keep charging. Go get him!''
	   By the turn, he was four strokes behind Irwin and the rest of
the field had faded.
	   ``I've been taught never give up, never give up, never give
up,'' Nelson said. ``I've seen a lot of funny things happen. I've
also played with an eight-shot lead, and I know that can be
difficult.''
	   Nelson bogeyed No. 10, and then got into big trouble on the
11th. Instead of laying up on his second shot, Nelson went for the
green and watched his ball skip into the water. He ended up with a
bogey that dropped him to 10-under.
	   Nelson birdied Nos. 12, 13 and 14, but the water got him again
on the 16th. This time it was his drive that went into the water,
and the bogey left him at 12-under.
	   On the par-3 17th, Irwin sent his tee shot into the water and
then two-putted for a double-bogey, cutting his lead to just two
strokes.
	   Nelson had one more trick left. Instead of playing it safe and
taking two shots, he went straight for the green off the 18th tee,
firing over a group of trees. But Nelson ended up just short in the
bunker, and Irwin birdied the hole for the third straight day.
	   ``I fell into a complacency that par is OK,'' Irwin said. ``It
wasn't as if I was playing badly. I continued to hit good shots _
not as good as I had been _ but really, the only bad shot was on
17. I just didn't make any putts.''
 &UR; Divots: &LR;  Irwin is the Ameritech Senior Open's first two-time
winner. ... Defending champion Gil Morgan shot a 71 Sunday, putting
him at 3-under 213 for the weekend. ... Kemper Lakes pro Emil
Esposito finished in last place with a 26-over 242.

Springboks vow to turn their game around
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ South Africa's rugby union team
arrived in New Zealand on Monday promising a better performance
against the All Blacks than they produced to beat Australia last
Saturday.
	   Springbok coach Nick Mallett said his side's 14-13 win in Perth
_ their 11th in a row _ was one of the worst in his tenure as
coach.
	   He said a large improvement would be needed to win the third
match in this year's Tri-Nations series at Athletic Park in
Wellington on Saturday.
	   ``Saturday was one of those games we would have really regretted
if we hadn't have won,'' Mallett said. ``New Zealand is the
benchmark from our point of view.
	   ``Both us and Australia played poorly, and if either of us
played like that we'd lose by 20 points against the All Blacks.''
	   The win away from home was crucial for South Africa, who will
almost certainly deprive New Zealand of their third Tri-Nations
crown if they can win on Saturday.
	   The Australian test was punctuated by errors and misdirected
kicking, although the South Africans deserved to win, courtesy of a
slight forward edge and better opportunity-taking.
	   Mallett suggested the lack of real physical contact in the test
had left his side relatively injury-free. The only concern was

	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built
on a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people. It no
longer exists.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, who said he saw ``the sea rising up and
coming toward me.''
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7
undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages
Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New
Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia,
where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and
swamps.
	   The official death toll Monday was at least 700, but John Tekwi,
governor of West Sepik Province, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. as saying at least 3,000 people had died.
	   Brother Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary from Vanimo
who is cordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press about 1,000 bodies had been buried so far and ''at least
3,000 are still missing.''
	   Missionaries and villagers are burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches.
	   Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets to try and
reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, said villagers
had told him giant salt-water crocodiles which live along the coast
were feeding on the corpses.
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the wave hurled
him into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano lagoon. His wife
was killed.
	   On Monday, many survivors were in shock.
	   ``There's a lot of people coming out of the jungle, dazed still,
after three days,'' said an AP photographer at the ruined village
of Sissano.
	   ``They're fishing an awful lot of bodies out of the lagoon, and
finding an awful lot of bodies around the village as well,'' he
said.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and a 100-strong team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   Hundreds of people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures,
Australian defense department spokesman Col. Keith Jobson said in
Canberra.
	   ``Until those missing come out of the bush, if indeed they do
come out of the bush, it is very difficult to determine how many
were actually killed,'' he said.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all. The prime concern at the moment is to
treat the injured and of course provide the survivors, those that
were uninjured, with food, water and shelter.''
	   New Zealand is sending a Hercules aircraft with relief supplies
and another medical team.
	   The combined population of the district is not precisely known,
but government chief secretary Robert Igara estimated it at
betweeen 6,000 and 10,000 people.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remotness of the
region. Australian transport planes had to fly 2,350 miles(3,780
kilometers) to the disaster scene.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said that he couldn't even count the
number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (603
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Chechnya's outgoing premier to oversee army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's outgoing prime minister will become the
No. 2 man in charge of the military as the breakaway republic
attempts to rein in the lawlessness plaguing the territory, news
reports said Monday.
	   Shamil Basayev, who resigned as acting prime minister at the
beginning of the month, has been appointed deputy
commander-in-chief of the Chechen military, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   Basayev failed to make much progress in solving Chechnya's
law-and-order problems during his six months as prime minister. But
he is still widely respected in Chechnya, where he was one of the
most prominent rebel figures during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   However, Russia has characterized him as a terrorist for
kidnapping civilians during the war, and has been reluctant to deal
with Basayev.
	   Since the end of the war, the southern Muslim republic has
remained awash in kidnappings and other crime despite government
efforts to contain it.
	   Last week, a clash between government forces and armed members
of a fundamentalist Islamic sect, the Wahhabis, left at least six
people dead.
	   Following the fighting, President Aslan Maskhadov disbanded the
so-called Shariah guard and the Islamic regiment under control of
the Wahhabis and ordered their commanders arrested, the Interfax
news agency reported on Monday.
	   Last week, Maskhadov accused the Wahhabis of attempting to
``impose a hostile ideology and ... to justify the abduction of
people.''
	   In a further move to strengthen the government's control over
warlords, Maskhadov on Sunday ordered the mobilization of 5,000
military reservists.
	   Basayev lost to Maskhadov in Chechnya's presidential elections
last year but has retained popular support.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of 1996
and considers itself independent, but the Kremlin says it remains
part of Russia.

Singapore posts unexpectedly good trade figures amid economic

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hounded by increasing fears of recession and
months of poor trade performance, Singapore received some
unexpectedly good news Monday as midyear trade rebounded.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indication of overall economic
performance, rose 6.1 percent in June from a year earlier, the
Trade Development Board reported.
	   The growth ran counter to most economists' expectations of a
decline for the month, raising hopes that the vulnerable Southeast
Asian city-state may be able to resist an overall contraction this
year.
	   The surprisingly strong performance in June came after two
months of negative figures. Non-oil domestic exports shrank 4.8
percent in April and 1.7 percent in May.
	   The government board _ a division of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry _ said non-oil domestic exports for 1998's first half were
up 5.1 percent from the same period last year, when the economy
posted a 0.2 percent increase.
	   Total non-oil exports in June were 7.9 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.7 billion), compared with 7.06 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.2 billion) in May, the board's report said.
	   Singapore stocks gained on the positive news, with the benchmark
Straits Times Industrial Index rising 1.1 percent above the opening
level to 1,107.17 in midafternoon trading.
	   The island republic's currency was also boosted by the surprise
trade figures, jumping to 1.7025 Singapore dollars to one U.S.
dollar in early afternoon trading from 1.7103 shortly before the
news emerged.
	   The trade report said exports of computer disk drives,
integrated circuits and assembled printed circuit boards recorded
``modest growth after two consecutive months of weak performance.''
	   The electronics industry forms the bedrock for this small,
resource-poor nation's manufacturing sector, and accounts for about
70 percent of the country's non-oil domestic exports.
	   As global demand for electronics products shrank, particularly
due to an oversupply of disk drives, Singapore's vulnerable economy
also had slowed.
	   The report noted that continuing oversupply of key computer
products led to a second-quarter decline of 2 percent in
electronics exports after a 8.6 percent increase in the first. The
critical sector was able to grow a modest 3 percent in the first
half compared with a year ago.
	   The positive June results were also tempered by a sobering
updated forecast for total trade in 1998.
	   The board expects Singapore's total trade to decline 4.5 to 5.5
percent this year because of the Asian crisis, slower growth in the
U.S. and European economies, continued oversupply of electronic
products and persistently weak oil exports.

Three soldiers, two rebels killed in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Government forces and Muslim separatists
clashed in the disputed northern territory of Kashmir near the
India-Pakistan border, killing at least five combatants, police
said Monday.
	   The fight began Sunday night when government forces raided a
jungle hideout of the militants. Three soldiers and two separatist
fighters died in a three-hour gun battle, a police officer said on
condition of anonymity.
	   At least four rebels may have escaped into Pakistan, police
said. India accuses Pakistan of arming and training militants
operating in India's part of Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge.
	   Such clashes occur almost daily in Jammu-Kashmir state, where
separatist fighters and Indian troops have killed more than 15,000
people since 1989.
	   A dozen or more militants groups are fighting to make Indian
Kashmir independent or to join with Islamic Pakistan. Jammu-Kashmir
is the only Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu India.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they won
independence from Britain in 1947. Two of the wars were over
control of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir that is now divided
between them.

Thousands evacuated as Indonesian volcano rumbles

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 3,000 people fled villages
on the slopes of Indonesia's most active volcano as Mount Merapi
ominously spewed out hot poisonous gases, ash and lava, officials
said Monday.
	   Volcanologists said activity within the 2,968-meter (9,737-foot)
peak has been building for weeks. They fear a major eruption is
possible.
	   Merapi sits in the middle of Central Java, one of the world's
most densely populated regions.
	   The evacuation was ordered Sunday after the mountain threw up
two huge clouds of super-hot gas. Lava poured out of the crater
along with ash and dust.
	   There have been no reports of casualties so far.
	   ``Merapi remains in an eruptive phase. There are glowing rocks
on its summit and lava flows,'' said volcanologist Antomus
Ratdomopurbo. Sunday's eruption was the third since July 11, he
said.
	   Rohadih, a local government official helping to coordinate the
evacuations, said at least 3,225 villagers from three districts
fled their homes. Many were being housed in makeshift camps in
safer areas.
	   Ratdomopurbo said activity within the mountain had subsided
slightly Monday and some people would be allowed to return to their
homes soon.
	   However, authorities said thousands more, living within an
8-kilometer (5-mile) radius of the peak, were on standby to leave
if the situation worsened again.
	   Officials denied a local media report Monday that 6,000 people
had been evacuated from the area near the city of Yogyakarta, about
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Officials fear hot or toxic clouds could hit villages on the
mountain's slopes. During a sudden eruption in 1994, a steam cloud
flattened one village, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Villagers choose to live on the sides of the volcano despite the
ever present danger because the soil there is extremely fertile for
farming.
	   Volcanologists reported that a 4.5-kilometer (2.7-mile) trail of
lava had poured down its southwest slope, The Jakarta Post reported
Monday.
	   The newspaper also said that volcanic ash had fallen on towns
and villages as far away as 20 kilometers (12 miles).
	   Merapi is the regarded as the most dangerous of Indonesia's 500
volcanoes. Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300
people in 1930.

Chinese athletes, coaches punished for doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese sports authorities have banned two
athletes from competition for two years and their coaches for one
year for doping, an official newspaper said Monday.
	   Authorities also handed warnings to two other athletes for
stimulant use, annulled their competition results, and banned their
coaches for three months, the Guangming Daily said.
	   Stung by a series of doping scandals in recent years, Chinese
sports officials have vowed to take tough measures against drug
cheats and their coaches. As part of stepped-up anti-drug measures,
the Chinese Swimming Association plans to impose life bans on
first-time steroid offenders.
	   The two athletes suspended for two years were Li Yi, from
eastern Jiangsu province, and Zhou Jing, from northern Hebei. The
Guangming Daily did not say what their sports were, although it
said the punishments were handed down by the Chinese Track and
Field Association.
	   Zhou tested positive for steroid use, the newspaper said.
	   Aside from being banned for a year, their two coaches also had
to pay a 5,000 yuan (dlrs 600) fine, the newspaper said.
	   The two athletes who received warnings were Chen Yuxiang, from
eastern Shandong province, and You Hanshan, from the southeastern
city of Xiamen.

Driving while phoning an offense in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan police are cracking own on
motorists who use cellular phones while driving.
	   In the past week, police booked 44 phoners for negligent driving
and collected 11,000 rupees (dlrs 1,692) in fines, Wilfred
Wijewardena, the senior superintendent of traffic police, said
Monday. He said phoning was a dangerous distraction for a driver.
	   ``We have told the motorists that if they really have to talk,
they can park their vehicles, talk to their heart's satisfaction
and only after that proceed,'' Wijewardena said.
	   Police in some cases seized phones and asked motorists to
collect them from the courts.
	   A motorist pays a fine of 250 rupees (dlrs 4) for the first
offense, 500 rupees (dlrs 8) for the second and 750 rupees (dlrs
12) for the third _ and loses the right to drive after that.
	   Four cellular phone companies are operating in Colombo with a
total of 136,000 subscribers.

Opposition battles Taliban to try to retake northern areas
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban soldiers fought a ferocious
battle over the weekend to stem an opposition counteroffensive and
hold on to strategic territory in northern Afghanistan, sources on
both sides of the conflict said Monday.
	   Taliban officials in the capital, Kabul, said their troops
repulsed several attacks by opposition soldiers trying to recapture
key districts in northwestern Faryab province.
	   There were no independent reports of casualties.
	   One week ago, the Taliban religious army pushed troops loyal to
former communist general Rashid Dostum out of Faryab province,
handing the nrothern-based anti-Taliban alliance its most serious
setback in more than a year.
	   Opposition spokesman, Shamsul Haq Arianfar told The Associated
Press that anti-Taliban troops retook the strategic district of
Qaysar in Faryab province, a claim the Taliban army disputed.
	   The area is remote and claims by the warring factions are
difficult to confirm independently.
	   The Taliban, which rules in Kabul and most of Afghanistan, has
imposed a strict brand of Islamic law that prohibits most forms of
light entertainment and forces women to stay indoors, unless they
are fully covered by a robe called a burqa and accompanied by a
male relative.
	   The opposition accuses the Taliban of enacting laws that reflect
tribal traditions rather than Islamic teachings. The opposition's
strength lies in northern Afghanistan.
	   Western sources said the Taliban still controls Maimana, the
capital of Faryab province, but they said the opposition is
pounding away at its positions.
	   On Sunday the Taliban said it shot down a jet fighter belonging
to the opposition.
	   Both sides have a fleet of Russian-made jet fighters, and both
sides use them to bomb enemy positions. The opposition has accused
the Taliban of bombing civilian areas in northern Afghanistan.
	   Opposition forces have retaliated by rocketing the combined
military and civilian airport in Kabul, causing the United Nations
to suspend all its flights into the capital.
	   The United Nations also has accused the opposition of breaking a
promise not to target the airport during the morning hours so as to
allow the organization to fly workers and supplies to Kabul.

Myanmar military blocks Suu Kyi car on trip out of Yangon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the second time this month,
Myanmar's military government has detained pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi as she tried to travel outside of Yangon to meet a
member of her political party.
	   Security officers in the village of Anyarsu, 32 kilometers (20
miles) south of the capital, stopped Suu Kyi, a fellow party member
and two drivers in her car Monday morning, the government said in a
press release received in Bangkok.
	   Seeing that Suu Kyi was not accompanied by the government
security squad that follows her everywhere, the local officers
refused to let her proceed, it said.
	   It appeared that she had not returned to the capital by
midafternoon. The government did not say whether she was being held
at the site or was refusing the officers' order.
	   Foreign media are rarely allowed access to the country, and are
restricted from meeting the opposition leader.
	   On July 7, Suu Kyi was stopped by the authorities on a similar
trip. She refused to return to Yangon, however, until she had met
with a party member, which she did after a nearly 24-hour standoff
in which 30 soldiers lifted her car with her inside and turned it
around to face the capital.
	   The government insists that Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace
laureate, is neither under arrest nor subject to unnecessary
restrictions, and that the actions taken to limit her freedom of
movement are for her own safety.
	   The only time Suu Kyi has been physically attacked inside
Myanmar _ also called Burma _ has been by mobs apparently either
paid or directed by the government.
	   Suu Kyi has said government security personnel stationed outside
her compound played an active part in beating up members of her
party as she escorted them to her home earlier this month.
	   The Nobel laureate was either knocked to the ground or fell
during the attack.
	   ``In recent weeks, (Suu Kyi) has upped the ante by adopting a
confrontational stance,'' the government said Monday.
	   ``Definitely, some media and foreign governments will exploit
the opportunity to berate the government and portray Myanmar as an
unstable country about to explode with civil unrest and ethnic
rebellion,'' it added.
	   Suu Kyi has called on the government to allow parliament to
convene by Aug. 21. Her party won 82 percent of the parliamentary
seats in a 1990 election the military refused to honor despite
promising before the poll it would hand over power to the winners.
	   Of the 392 members of Suu Kyi's party who were elected, 181 are
either in jail, have been forced to resign by the government or
dismissed by the election commission, gone into exile or died.
	   Others are living under constant government harassment, the
party has said.
	   Another 48 independent candidates have had their parties banned
by the government.

Eight more drown, tornado hits flooded areas in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Eight people drowned in flood waters in
northern Bangladesh while a tornado ripped through villages
inundated by monsoon rains, injuring at least 25 others, officials
said Monday.
	   The eight died Sunday in Rangpur, Bogra and Comilla districts,
raising the death toll from more than a week of flooding to 90.
	   The tornado struck Sunday in Sirajganj district, 65 miles (105
kilometers) north of Dhaka, the capital, the country's
Meteorological Department said. The twister destroyed dozens of
mud-and-thatch houses already weakened by flooding.
	   Sunday was the first day in a week that no rain fell in northern
Bangladesh, and the flooded Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers began
receding, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said in Dhaka.
	   The floods have destroyed crops over thousands of acres
(hectares), breached embankments and damaged roads and rail tracks
in 27 of Bangladesh's 64 districts. As many as 8 million people
have been marooned, newspapers said.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 120 million people, is
buffeted by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every
year.
	   The country's worst floods in recent memory occurred in 1987 and
1988, when more than 1,500 people were killed.

Kurdish rebels hold up highway, kill two in central Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIVAS, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels held up several vehicles on
a highway in central Turkey and killed a teacher and a truck driver
in an overnight attack, reports said Monday.
	   Three off-duty policemen riding in a passenger bus opened fire
and chased the rebels away, the semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   The guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, first
stopped a truck near this central city some 350 kilometers (220
miles) east of the capital, Ankara, and killed the driver before
setting the vehicle on fire.
	   They later held up the passenger bus, another truck, a car and a
van. The teacher was killed as he got off the bus, the report said.
	   The PKK has stepped up attacks on Turkey's roads recently to
retaliate for the Turkish army's crackdown on the rebels. Last week
the guerrillas ambushed a military unit near the southeastern city
of Hakkari, killing 10 soldiers and seven pro-government village
guards.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the PKK's fight for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984.

New bad loan definitions mean losses for half of Thailand's banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Half of Thailand's 16 commercial banks
will report large second-quarter losses because of changes in the
definition of non-performing loans, Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu
Mongol Sonakul said Monday.
	   Thai financial institutions are due to report second-quarter
earnings this week.
	   The institutions are phasing in stricter rules defining which
loans are non-performing. Previously, fully collateralized loans
wouldn't be counted as non-performing until payments were missed
for 12 months.
	   In the second quarter, however, a non-performing loan is one
overdue for six months and in the third quarter, three months will
become the limit.
	   Half of Thailand's commercial banks would report operational
profits before taxes and provisioning in the second quarter, Chatu
Mongkol said at a news conference.
	   Losses recorded by Thai banks will decline in the second half,
he added.
	   Analysts estimate that non-performing loans account for around
35 percent of total loans.
	   Many Thai companies and individuals have been unable to make
payments amid a collapse in domestic demand, cash flow and credit,
while the Thai baht has depreciated more than 36 percent against
the dollar since it was floated in July last year.
	   The president of one of four banks that was taken over by the
government earlier this year said Monday that it would be a bad
idea for Thailand's central bank to merge his with other
nationalized banks.
	   The Bank of Thailand has hired the American financial company
J.P. Morgan to study ways to solve financial problems at the four
banks, which were slipping into insolvency.
	   One possible solution is to merge them together into one or two
banks before selling their licenses or stakes to foreign investors.
	   Aswin Kongsiri, appointed by the central bank to head Bangkok
Bank of Commerce, said, however, ``A merger will just lengthen the
time it takes to solve problems at BBC.''
	   The central bank plans to announce what it will do with the four
nationalized banks by the end of this month.
	   Besides Bangkok Bank of Commerce, the other three are Siam City
Bank, Bangkok Metropolitan Bank and First Bangkok City Bank.
	   Several Thai financial institutions tried unsuccessfully to
merge to survive Thailand's financial crisis. Fifty-six of the
country's 93 finance companies were closed by the government
because of shaky finances.
	   Banking experts have said mergers in Thailand often fail because
Thailand's notoriously poor transparency makes it extremely
difficult to determine companies' asset quality and to conduct due
diligence.
	   Troubles at Bangkok Bank of Commerce surfaced even before the
country's economic crisis broke last July. Several insiders and
politicians had been using the bank to obtain loans with inflated
or phony collateral, leaving the bank saddled with nearly dlrs 3
billion in bad debt.
	   The Bank of Thailand came under criticism for not adequately
supervising the bank's operations.

EU considers freezing aid to Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is considering a
freeze on humanitarian aid to the Afghan capital of Kabul because
of the treatment of women by the country's Taliban rulers,
officials said Monday.
	   The suspension of aid for new projects is expected to cover some
dlrs 4 million, or 40 percent of all aid which the EU's
humanitarian office had earmarked for Afghanistan for a 12-month
period starting in August.
	   Pietro Petrucci, a spokesman on humanitarian affairs for the
European Commission, said Taliban rules on the treatment of women
meant it was impossible to ``distribute aid without
discrimination.''
	   A decision to freeze the aid is expected to be announced in the
next few days.
	   Meanwhile, the Commission, the EU's executive body, has
recommended that aid agencies receiving EU aid pull out of Kabul
rather than accept a Taliban demand that they relocate to abandoned
student dormitories battered by civil war bombings.
	   However, Petrucci said the Commission would continue to
guarantee the costs of existing EU-funded aid projects run by
agencies that decided to stay on in the capital.
	   Most of the EU funding for Kabul goes on sanitation, health and
food aid projects.
	   Relations between international aid agencies and the Taliban
have been strained since the movement captured the capital in 1996
and began imposing laws based on its radical brand of Islam.
	   Within days of taking control of the capital, the Taliban closed
schools for girls and forced women to stop working outside the
home, making it difficult for aid agencies to help Afghan women and
for female aid workers to operate.
	   Relations appeared to improve in May when aid agencies and the
Taliban concluded a 24-point agreement that promised education for
young girls, equal access to health care for women and addressed
other issues never made public.
	   But last month the Taliban shut down more than 100 home schools
that were quietly educating thousands of children, including girls
and closed vocational training programs that allowed some of
Kabul's poorest to earn a living.
	   They also ordered most international aid workers to move into
crumbling dormitories.

Wife of Korean who died during war to receive remains of her
</HEADLINE>
husband &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The remains of a Korean who died in the atomic
bombing of Nagasaki in 1945 will be returned to his wife on Aug. 1,
a Japanese newspaper said Monday.
	   Seo Young-ja, 75, will take the remains of her husband, Yun
Pok-tong, to her hometown in Taegu, South Korea, after attending a
ceremony in Nagasaki, the newspaper Asahi said.
	   Offices of the Justice Ministry and Nagasaki city were closed
Monday because of a national holiday and authorities could not be
reached for comment.
	   Japan's Justice Ministry had refused to return Yun's body to his
wife because there was no proof they were married after documents
were destroyed in the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   But an investigation by Nagasaki city showed they were a married
couple and the ministry approved the return of the remains in
March.
	   The Asahi said that on Sunday, Seo and her daughter, Yun
Sung-ja, 55, visited the Peace Memorial Park in Nagasaki and the
site of the prison where her husband was being detained at the time
of the bombing.
	   ``The years separated from my husband were like a living hell,''
the Asahi quoted Seo as saying.
	   Seo has been requesting the return of the remains since 1990,
when Japanese officials found them at a temple in Nagasaki, 982
kilometers (614 miles), southwest of Tokyo, according to Seo's
friend, Nobuto Hirano.
	   Yun, then 33, was one of the 10,000 Koreans who died when the
United States dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.
A total of 70,000 people were killed in the nuclear attack and its
aftermath.
	   Seo and Yun came to Japan around 1935. Yun was arrested on
suspicion of providing his workers with a larger share of food than
allotted to them and was sent to jail on Aug. 6, three days before
the bombing, Hirano has said.

Iran and Russia agree on equal development of Caspian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Russia have agreed that all five
countries surrounding the oil-rich Caspian Sea should have a say in
its development, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov and his Iranian
counterpart, Morteza Sarmadi, signed a statement Sunday in Tehran
saying that, in principle, the Caspian's rich resources should be
divided equally among the littoral states, Tehran radio reported.
	   But they stressed that a final agreement on apportioning
resources would have to be agreed by all littoral states, the radio
said.
	   Of the five nations bordering the Caspian, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into
national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores.
	   But Russia and Iran, which have little or no oil near their
coasts, want the sea's resources to be shared by all.
	   The statement said that both Tehran and Moscow seriously opposed
proposed plans to lay oil pipelines along the Caspian seabed
because that could lead to a major environmental disaster, the
agency reported.
	   Several American and other Western oil companies have signed oil
development agreements with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and plan to
lay pipelines across the Caspian seabed, Iranian radio reported.
	   Iran has been pressing for a new demarcation of borders on the
Caspian ever since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, creating new
countries with shores on the sea.
	   Earlier this month the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan
signed an accord that divided the northern part of the Caspian
between their states.
	   But Pastukhov has said the agreement does not affect earlier
Soviet Iranian pacts that demarcated the Caspian into Soviet and
Iranian sectors.

Iranian president lays on pilgrimage for 5,200 senior citizens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Iranian president has arranged for some
5,200 senior citizens to make a pilgrimage to an Islamic shrine in
the northeastern city of Mashhad, the official news agency said
Monday.
	   President Mohammad Khatami decided on the move, with his office
footing the bill, after an old man in a nursing home asked him to
organize tours to the shrine for the elderly, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Mashhad, which is 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of the
capital Tehran, is home to the shrine of Imam Reza, an important
Shiite Muslim saint.
	   The pilgrims traveled in groups of 250 during the past three
months, the agency said.

As fighting rages in Kosovo, Serb reformists ask U.S. for help in

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ With fighting intensifying and the
death toll mounting in Kosovo, a broad coalition of Serbian
opposition leaders Monday called on the United States to take the
lead in helping to end the conflict.
	   The ``Alliance for Change,'' consisting of Serbs opposed to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, was meeting the senior U.S.
diplomat for the Balkans, Richard Gelbard, for talks aimed at
persuading foreign countries to broker a cease-fire and stop more
arms from reaching the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   ``We are Serbs and we want peace,'' former Yugoslav Premier
Milan Panic said ahead of the meeting.
	   Ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo have intensified their fight
to secede from Serbia since Serbs launched a bloody crackdown on
suspected separatists in February. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1 in the province. Serbia is the larger of two republics left
in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Panic planned to ask Gelbard to push the international community
to send observers to Kosovo in an attempt to halt the fighting
there.
	   Alliance members, who include reformist Serbs from Kosovo and a
Serbian Orthodox bishop from the province, support broad autonomy
for Kosovo but say negotiations are essential to discuss the
province's future.
	   As they gathered in The Hague Sunday night, hundreds of Serb
police were battling the Kosovo Liberation Army's secessionist
guerrillas for control of the central Kosovo town of Orahovac. At
least 100 people died over the weekend fighting for the town.
	   ``The problem is that the KLA is growing and pretty soon most
Albanians will be part of that army,'' said Vesna Pesic, president
of the Serbian Civic Alliance.
	   The group wants Western support for democratic reforms within
Yugoslavia, saying democracy is essential for peace in the region.
They also are seeking to establish themselves as viable
alternatives to Balkan strong man Milosevic.
	   Pesic described Milosevic as ``the main factor of instability in
the Balkans.''

Police search offices of anti-pedophile group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Police have raided the headquarters of
an anti-pedophile group, which claims to have files on dozens of
members of an international child-sex ring, Belgian newspapers
reported Monday.
	   According to the reports, police late Sunday searched the
offices of Morkhoven, which says it has gathered some 10,000 images
of child abuse and 3,000 administrative documents which prove the
existence of an international pedophile network.
	   Belgian police refused to comment on the reports Monday,
referring all queries to their Dutch colleagues.
	   Dutch police asked their Belgian colleagues to dig into the
Belgian group's activities after the discovery last month of
computer disks containing thousands of images of child abuse in an
apartment in the Netherlands.
	   The apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort belonged to
convicted German pedophile Gerrit Ulrich who was slain in Italy
last month. Italian police are holding a Belgian man on suspicion
of murdering Ulrich.
	   On Saturday Morkhoven reportedly refused to hand over its files
to Dutch police, saying the latter unfairly accused them of
breaking into Ulrich's apartment. Morkhoven claims the files were
handed over to them by Ulrich's family shortly after his killing.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Amid mounting accusations of a failure of
leadership, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa took his first public
tour of the cargo and passenger terminals at Hong Kong's troubled
new airport Monday.
	   Tung dismissed charges that he came too late, saying officials
had kept him well informed of the problems since the airport opened
July 6.
	   ``Although I have not been here, I feel that I understand the
situation well,'' Tung told reporters after the tour.
	   Unlike his deputy Anson Chan _ one of the territory's most
popular politicians _ and other senior officials, Tung had kept a
low profile since the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport opened.
Among its most serious problems is an inability to handle all of
Hong Kong's air cargo business until the end of August, which is
expected to cut 0.35 percent off this year's gross domestic
product.
	   The new cargo terminal, which has been stricken by serious
computer and mechanical glitches, handled about half the normal
amount of cargo Sunday.
	   Pressure has been mounting on Tung, a shipping tycoon China
picked to lead Hong Kong after it reassumed sovereignty, to become
a more visible leader. Despite his sincerity and dedication,
critics say he needs more visibility.
	   ``Mr. Tung has a tendency to turn up at a scene of a public
emergency well after the worst is over,'' the South China Morning
Post said in an editorial Monday. ``It is important for him to lead
from the front, and to be seen to be taking an active role at the
earliest opportunity.''
	   Tung told a group of visiting scholars and journalists last
Friday that he had taken some suggestions to be more visible, but
added: ``I am from the private sector. This is not my strong suit.
Getting things done is much more important to me.''
	   In the passenger terminal, Tung was greeted by three protesters
representing a small political party. ``The airport is chaotic. The
chief executive has lost face,'' they chanted.
	   Edmond Chan, a computer systems analyst who was flying to
Bangkok, said that Tung, ``as Hong Kong's chief executive, should
have come out earlier.''
	   ``He may not be able to solve our problems, but his coming out
in public would give Hong Kong people the needed boost in
confidence,'' Chan added.
	   Sonny Lo, a political scientist at University of Hong Kong, said
that although Tung has long-term vision as a leader, he lacks media
sensitivity.
	   Unlike his deputies, Tung avoided criticizing airport officials
Monday, and instead appealed for public understanding.
	   ``It is not the time to point fingers at different people
because it doesn't really help the situation,'' Tung said. ``What
(the airport officials) need and what we must give is support and
encouragement.''
	   Tung added the government would try to help small and medium
businesses, which are facing delayed shipments and canceled orders
because of the cargo problems.
	   Chek Lap Kok airport, built on reclaimed land at the tip of a
remote outlying island, replaced 73-year-old Kai Tak airport.

Criminal courts in Ho Chi Minh City are overloaded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A rise in crime and a shortage of judges
is overloading the judicial system in Ho Chi Minh City, a court
official said Monday.
	   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the city
Criminal Court's 28 judges handled 400 trials in July, with some
dealing with nearly 30 each. Postponements are common.
	   The newspaper Youth reported that Vietnam has 907 provincial
judges, only 77 percent of whom have obtained university law
degrees. Legislator Ngo Ba Thanh said earlier this year that
provincial courts are short more than 200 judges.
	   Crime has been on the rise in Vietnam since the country embarked
on its Doi Moi renovation process a decade ago.
	   The reforms have helped the economy grow but have been
accompanied by rises in corruption and social vices such as drug
addiction, prostitution and gambling.

Unemployment rate climbs to 4.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment in recession-bound Hong Kong
climbed to an estimated 4.5 percent in the three months ended June
30, and was likely to worsen before it gets better, officials said
Monday.
	   The figure was announced as Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
confirmed what most people here have suspected for some time _ that
the economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. That
technically puts Hong Kong in recession.
	   Officials cited continued weakness in the retail, restaurant and
construction sectors for most of the latest job losses. The problem
was worsened by the entry of new graduates in the job market.
	   ``The impact of the Asian financial crisis is much more
widespread and protracted for the whole region than anyone could
have expected,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said.
	   ``A high unemployment rate might remain with us for some time,''
he added. ``Things are likely to get worse before they get
better.''
	   Tsang said some government measures to boost the economy were
starting to take effect. He said a program to match jobs and the
jobless was steadily showing better results, and that 12 public
works projects would soon create about 1,600 jobs.
	   Tung, speaking as he was touring Hong Kong's new airport, said
the economy shrank again in the second quarter after a 2 percent
fall in the first three months of the year. He did not give a
figure.
	   Tung said results for the July-September period were unlikely to
be good, either.
	   In announcing the new unemployment figure, officials revised
downward the provisional figure for the previous three-month
period, from 4.2 percent to 4.1 percent. The 4.2 percent figure was
a 15-year high.
	   Both Tung and Tsang continued to express confidence that Hong
Kong would be among the first Asian economies to rebound from the
region's woes.

 &UR; With Papua New Guinea-Tsunami &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some facts about Papua New Guinea:
	   ___
	   PEOPLE: 4 million Melanesians, believed to have migrated from
Asia between 10,000 and 50,000 years ago. Seven hundred languages
are spoken, the most common of which is pidgin, known as tok pisin,
a hybrid of English, German and local languages.
	   ___
	   LAND: Lying 93 miles (149 kilometers) north of Australia, the
Sweden-sized country occupies half of the island of New Guinea; the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya occupies the other half.
	   Although most of the island is lush tropical rain forest, the
central highlands features peaks rising to 15,000 feet (4,500
meters), where snow often falls. The coast is broken up by
crocodile-infested rivers. Steep ravines and thick vegetation make
the interior almost impenetrable. With frequent mudslides,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and, more recently, severe drought,
the island is no stranger to natural calamities.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: Most island residents eke out a living as subsistence
farmers, growing enough food for themselves and some coffee as a
cash crop. In recent years, mining companies have started tapping
the island's massive reserves of gold, copper, oil and gas. Despite
this mineral wealth, Papua New Guinea is an impoverished country
plagued by urban crime and traditional tribal warfare in the
highlands.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Until World War I, the northern half of the island was
a German colony, and the southern half was administered by the
British. After Germany surrendered, Australia took over
administration of both regions. The island was the scene of fierce
fighting in World War II, as American and Australian troops fought
Japanese forces, for the first time stopping their advance across
the Pacific. Self-government was declared in 1973 and it became an
independent state in 1975 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.

Serb police appear to have retaken central Orahovac

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police claim to have prevailed
in a seesaw battle over the weekend for control of the central
Kosovo town of Orahovac, but independent reports said the fighting
was still raging.
	   Neither Serb authorities nor the ethnic Albanians fighting them
release reliable updated casualty counts. But figures provided by
the two sides indicated more than 100 people died in fighting in
Orahovac and a series of violent border clashes on Saturday and
Sunday.
	   The reports would make battles among the deadliest in nearly
five months of fighting.
	   ``We don't have reliable figures yet, but this has been the
worst weekend for killing since the start of the crisis'' in
Kosovo, said a NATO official in Brussels Monday, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He noted an ``enormous escalation'' and
said NATO was ``deeply worried.''
	   In an interview carried by the German private SAT.1 TV network,
Jakup Krasniqi, a spokesman for the underground Kosovo Liberation
Army, said Sunday it was his army's aim to unite all regions with
an Albanian majority, including those in Macedonia and Montenegro,
the smaller republic in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of refugees streamed into hills in the Orahovac area
Sunday, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the provincial
capital Pristina, in a desperate attempt to stay out of harm's way.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center in Pristina said that at
least 20 ethnic Albanian rebel fighters were killed early Sunday
when a few hundred tried to cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border
northwest of Djakovica, the scene of an even bigger attempted
incursion on Saturday.
	   The center claimed Monday that 16 foreigners were among the
armed Albanians who clashed with the Yugoslav border guards during
the weekend. It was not clear how many of them were killed or
arrested.
	   According to documents found at the scene, there were five
Albanians from Macedonia, six people from Saudi Arabia and one from
Yemen. Another four were apparently Arabs from Germany.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army now
controls about 30 percent of Kosovo.
	   Both sides claimed Sunday they controlled most of Orahovac.
However, explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout
surrounding hills and several buildings burned intensely. Orahovac,
with a normal population of 20,000, is the largest town yet caught
in the five-month ethnic conflict.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling.
	   The Serb Media Center said police captured most of the town
early Sunday.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku published in Pristina claimed
Monday that rebel forces controlled 80 percent of Orahovac late
Sunday, quoting its reporter on the scene. There were no new
reports on Orahovac early Monday.

Malaysia blames Netanyahu for damaging peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's foreign minister on
Monday blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the
stalled Middle East peace process.
	   ``Netanyahu has completely ignored whatever peace agreements
that have been entered into between Israel and the Palestinian
people,'' Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was quoted as saying by the
national news agency, Bernama.
	   ``This is certainly most regrettable,'' he said at a joint news
conference with Palestinian foreign affairs spokesman Farouk
Kadoumi, who arrived Sunday for a five-day visit.
	   ``We hope that the Palestinian people will have the right to
return to their homeland. The struggle of the Palestinian people is
the struggle for human rights,'' he said.
	   Malaysia long has supported the Palestine Liberation
Organization. On Monday, Abdullah reaffirmed his government's
commitment to the Palestinian struggle.
	   Kadoumi called for U.N.-sponsored punishment of Israel.
	   ``Action should be taken later by the United Nations and
economic sanctions should be imposed on Israel, similar to that on
the apartheid regime of South Africa in the past,'' he said.
	   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are meeting currently at the
behest of the United States.
	   The United States has called for Israel to carry out a promised
West Bank pullback, and for Palestinians to make greater efforts to
fight terrorism. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accepted the
plan, but Netanyahu has balked, citing security concerns.

Reports: Italian club eyes Argentine World Cup star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Sampdoria of Genoa is working to acquire Argentine
playmaker Ariel Ortega from Spanish club Valencia, Italian
newspapers reported Monday.
	   Ortega, 23, was one of the stars of the just-concluded World
Cup, where he helped Argentina reach the quarterfinals.
	   After finishing ninth in the 18-team Serie A with a 13-9-12
record last season, Sampdoria is revamping under new coach Luciano
Spalletti. The club has been looking for an imaginative striker or
midfielder since shipping another Argentine star, Juan Veron, to AC
Parma.
	   Asked if he is interested in signing Ortega, Sampdoria president
Enrico Mantovani told Gazzetta dello Sport, ``It's difficult to say
no. He is a great talent.''
	   Another sports daily, Corriere dello Sport, also reported
Mantovani would like to sign the diminutive player.
	   Ortega was in the spotlight for reasons good and bad at the
World Cup. He scored two spectacular goals, offered countless
assists to teammates, drew dozens of fouls and was sent off late in
Argentina's quarterfinal loss to the Netherlands.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built on
a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people. It no
longer exists.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, who said he saw ``the sea rising up and
coming toward me.''
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the 23-foot
(7-meter) wave hurled him into a coconut tree and then into the
Sissano lagoon. His wife was killed.
	   The wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7 undersea
earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday
night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea,
a nation on the island of New Guinea, where some live a near-Stone
Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The official death toll from Friday's disaster was at least 700,
mostly children and the elderly. But John Tekwi, governor of West
Sepik Province, where the wave hit, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. on Monday as saying at least 3,000 people had
died.
	   ``Where is everybody else?'' Tekwi asked.
	   The assistant defense attache at the Australian High Commission
in Port Moresby, Col. Richard Humby, said latest figures indicated
more than 1,000 villagers had died and at least 2,000 more were
missing.
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all,'' said Australian Defense Department
spokesman Col. Keith Jobson in Canberra.
	   Jobson said the primary concern was to treat the injured and
provide them with food, water and shelter.
	   About 1,000 bodies had been buried and at least 3,000 people
were still missing, Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary who
is coordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press.
	   ``You can smell the stench, you can smell the death in the
air,'' he said.
	   Missionaries and villagers were burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches. Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets
to try to reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' said fisherman Jerry Apuan. ``I was
afraid. It was the first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, about 60 miles
(96 kilometers) west of the area wiped out by the tsunami, said
villagers had told him giant salt-water crocodiles that live along
the coast were feeding on the corpses.
	   Vanimo is the main administrative center of Papua New Guinea,
located close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan
Jaya.
	   Many survivors were still in shock.
	   A lot of people were emerging from the jungle in a daze,
according to an Associated Press photographer in the ruined village
of Sissano.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 cargo planes
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and 100 doctors, nurses and engineers. New Zealand
was sending relief supplies and a medical team.
	   The combined population of the affected district is not
precisely known, but government chief secretary Robert Igara
estimated it at between 6,000 and 10,000 people.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remoteness of the
region. Australian cargo planes had to fly 2,350 (3,780 kilometers)
miles to the disaster scene.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (600
kilometers) northeast of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said the villages of
Nimas and Warapu also had been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were badly
damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area consists of jungle and swamps where tribes rely on
subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of jungle
materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

President of China's Islamic Association dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Imam al-Haj Salah An Shiwei, who rose from being
the leader of a Beijing mosque to the head of China's state-backed
Islamic Association, has died. He was 79.
	   The imam, who had been ill for several months, died last Tuesday
in Beijing. He was buried in accordance with Muslim tradition at a
funeral Friday attended by religious leaders and Communist Party
and government officials, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   An, a native of northern Hebei province and a member of the
Muslim Hui ethnic group, started studying the Koran at age 9. He
became imam of a mosque in Beijing's Handkerchief Lane in 1948.
	   After the Communist takeover of China a year later, An served as
imam in two other Beijing mosques. He started working for China's
Islamic Association in 1956, becoming its vice president in 1980
and president in 1993.
	   He also had served as a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, the top government advisory body, since
1978.
	   An ``offered decades of contributions to China's religious
freedom, national unity and social stability,'' Xinhua said

 &UR; BARBADOS: Chinese diplomat begins Caribbean tour &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Seeking to strengthen China's
diplomatic hand in the Caribbean, the Chinese vice premier began a
tour of five nations in the region on Sunday.
	   Vice Premier Qian Qichen was to meet with Barbadian officials on
Sunday and Prime Minister Owen Arthur on Monday, then travel to
Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica and Cuba.
	   ``The visit is to enhance mutual understanding and further
consolidate the existing friendship,'' Qian said upon arriving in
Barbados.
	   The countries remain key diplomatic outposts for China as its
rival, Taiwan, marshals its allies this month in a new campaign for
recognition by the United Nations. Five of the 27 countries that
recognize Taiwan are in the Caribbean.
	   Taiwan said July 8 they would join the island as it makes a
petition for U.N. membership for the sixth straight year.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Castro survived near-fatal illness, doctor claims
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro was placed almost in a
coma last October as doctors treated a potentially fatal illness
affecting his brain, a published report said Sunday.
	   El Nuevo Herald, Miami's daily Spanish-language newspaper,
quoting a Cuban surgeon who since has defected to Costa Rica, said
Castro spent nearly two weeks in a Havana hospital suffering from
an extreme rise in blood pressure. The surgeon said Castro has been
hospitalized two other times in the past year for other ailments.
	   ``Fidel is hyperactive and he had to be sedated fully,'' Dr.
Elizabeth Trujillo Izquierdo told the newspaper. She worked at
Havana's exclusive Center for Medical and Surgical Research until
she defected in April.
	   El Nuevo Herald said Trujillo's identity was confirmed through
documents and multiple sources. But it said no other sources in or
outside Cuba have confirmed her report of Castro's illness.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Most wanted criminal returned to Barbados
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The most wanted criminal in
Barbados, a death row convict who twice escaped police custody, was
handed over to island officials by Trinidadian police Saturday
night.
	   Winston Hall, 34, was arrested in Trinidad and Tobago on an
arson charge. Barbadian prison officials said he would be put in a
high-security cell specially built to hold him.
	   Hall was sentenced to hang in 1985 for the murder of the manager
of Francia Plantation, a farm on Barbados.
	   He escaped from police that year while on the way to a
courthouse and was recaptured in 1989 while stowing away on a
cruiser liner in St. Vincent. He broke out of jail again in 1991.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Lightning kills player during soccer game
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Lighting struck and killed a Jamaican
man as he played a game of soccer in central Clarendon, police
reported Sunday.
	   The man, Delroy Wilson, was playing with a community soccer
league on Saturday afternoon when lightning hit the field, injuring
him and two other players. He was pronounced dead at a local
hospital.
	   He is the third Jamaican in three years to be killed by
lightning while playing soccer. In August 1995, two teen-aged boys
died during a game in St. Catherine, in southeast Jamaica.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Earthquake rattles Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ An earthquake
measuring 4.5 in magnitude rattled the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico early Sunday but caused no damage.
	   The tremor struck at about 5:27 a.m. and was centered off the
northwest coast of St. Thomas, about 12 miles (20 kilometers)
northeast of the Puerto Rican island of Culebra and 55 miles (90
kilometers) deep.
	   It rattled windows across St. Thomas and in eastern Puerto Rico,
but there were no reports of damage. The earthquake did not cause a
tsunami because it was so deep, said Victor Huerfano, interim
director of the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Human rights group revived with European grant
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Independent Jamaica Council for
Human Rights, a lobbying organization that ran out of money and
closed in December 1996, has reopened with the help of a dlrs
250,000 (Jamaica dlrs 9 million) grant from the European Union.
	   The council led protests against Jamaica's death penalty, a
touchy topic as Britain and European rights groups pressure Jamaica
to stop hangings of murder convicts.
	   Supporters of the death penalty argued the group was ignoring
the rising murder rate in Jamaica. In 1997 there were a record
1,038 murders on this island of 2.6 million people.
	   Hilaire Sobers, the new executive director of the council, said
the group would begin new fund raising campaigns within 18 months.
 &UR; GRENADA: Dismissed junior cabinet minister vows to sue
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ An opposition politician who was
fired from his junior cabinet post last year is vowing to sue the
government for wrongful dismissal.
	   Clarence Rapier, a parliament member representing the Grenada
United Labor Party, said he wants Prime Minister Keith Mitchell to
compensate him for lost wages after he was fired from his post as
junior minister of cooperatives.
	   Rapier had helped give Mitchell's New National Party a 9-6
majority by joining the administration. Mitchell fired him only
weeks after the switch, claiming Rapier had fought in public with
the foreign owner of an inn. Rapier claims the man's dog had
attacked him.
	   Rapier was acquitted of disorderly behavior and unlawful conduct
charges.

Tsunami waves can tower, and crash with deadly result
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Papua New Guinea-Tsunami &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A tsunami is a series of sea waves caused by underwater
earthquakes, landslides or volcanos. Sometimes referred to as
``great sea waves,'' a tsunami can travel at speeds up to 450 miles
per hour (720 kilometers per hour) and waves range in height from a
harmless few inches (centimeters) to 100 feet (30 meters).
	   A magnitude-7 quake generated the deadly and destructive
23-foot-high (7-meter-high) wave that swamped Papua New Guinea's
northern coast Friday.
	   The worst tsunami on record followed the Aug. 27, 1883, eruption
of Krakatau volcano in the East Indies. Its 100-foot (30-meter)
waves killed more than 36,000 people on the coasts of Java and
Sumatra.
	   On April 1, 1946, an earthquake in the Aleutian Islands sent a
wave ashore on Unimak Island, Alaska, that killed five. Hours
later, it reached Hawaii, where it killed 159 people.
	   More recently, a July 12, 1993, quake under the Sea of Japan
spawned waves up to 100 feet (30 meters). About 200 people died.
	   Tsunami can occur anywhere, but are most common in the Pacific
Ocean. Use of the Japanese name for the waves reflects the fact
that Japan has been the most affected country, with more than
100,000 deaths recorded in about 250 tsunamis over the centuries.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was
re-elected Monday as chairman of the ruling National Democratic
Party at a congress broadcast live on state television.
	   The re-election was unanimous at the start of the party's
three-day congress at Cairo University, the NDP secretariat said.
	   After the announcement, thousands of delegates chanted ``long
live Mubarak'' and ``With our soul, with our blood, we salute you
Mubarak.''
	   A beaming Mubarak responded with a wave and said: ``I will work
hard to meet your expectations.''
	   Mubarak became president in 1981 after serving as vice president
to President Anwar Sadat whom Muslim militants assassinated.

Hong Kong share prices slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Monday after
four straight sessions of advances.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 135.68 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 8,493.25. On Friday,
the index had gained 42.36 points.
	   Turnover fell to 3.03 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 388
million), down from Friday's 4.72 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 605 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower and continued to fall
throughout the session as investors took profits following last
week's sharp gains.
	   They said trading was thin because many investors were awaiting
the government's announcement of unemployment figures.
	   After the market closed, the government said unemployment in
recession-bound Hong Kong rose to an estimated 4.5 percent in the
three months ended June 30, and was likely to worsen before it gets
better.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 3.50 Hong Kong dollars to
193.50, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.60 dollars to 32.20,
Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.40 dollars to 39.10, Cheung Kong fell 90
cents to 36.10, and Hang Seng Index fell 10 cents to 42.40.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Air raid sirens wailed and church bells
pealed as Greek Cypriots turned out Monday to mourn the anniversary
of Turkey's 1974 invasion of northern Cyprus.
	   Residents were awakened at dawn by sirens marking the hour 24
year ago when Turkish paratroopers landed on the island after Greek
Cypriot supporters of union with Greece launched an abortive coup.
	   Greek Cypriots packed churches for memorial services for the
more than 5,000 people who died or disappeared in the fighting that
followed the invasion.
	   Citizens on the Greek side of this divided island planned
demonstrations later Monday to protest the continuing Turkish
occupation of the northern third of Cyprus.
	   For their part, Turkish Cypriots planned to celebrate the
invasion. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and five of his
ministers were scheduled Monday to visit northern Cyprus, where
Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops. Turkey is the only country to
recognize the Turkish Cypriots' breakaway state.
	   An aerobatics team of the Turkish air force planned to put on a
display of precision flying, and six Turkish warships have docked
in northern Cypriot ports.
	   The Cyprus government accused Turkey on Sunday of ``threatening
peace'' by sending the warships and planes to the Turkish-occupied
part of the island.
	   This year's anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than
usual due to increased tension over the Greek Cypriot decision to
buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Turkey has vowed to prevent deployment of the S-300 missiles,
and Greece, a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, has warned it will respond to any attack on Cyprus.
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, justified
the weapons deal in an address to the nation Sunday night, saying
the missiles were required because of ``the ever-threatening
presence of the Turkish occupation troops who are in an attack
formation.''
	   He rejected U.S. criticism of the purchase, saying Cyprus would
not accept restrictions on its defense.
	   On the northern side of the U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone,
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reminded his community Sunday
night of their suffering during ethnic fighting in the years before
the invasion.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks for reunification of the island collapsed
in August 1997 after Denktash insisted on the recognition of his
breakaway state and that Cyprus abandon its bid to join the
European Union.

Kajiyama vows to clean up bad debts to save sinking Japan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy is in danger of collapsing if the
country's massive bad debt problem is not cleaned up quickly, a
leading candidate for prime minister said Monday.
	   Seiroku Kajiyama, one of three candidates vying to replace
resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, warned of the looming
disaster in a rare news conference with foreign media.
	   ``If we can't overcome our problems, the ship called Japan is
sure to sink,'' Kajiyama said. ``Unless we can put the problem of
the bad loans behind us, Japan may really go under. There is no
time to lose.''
	   Kajiyama said he would push for complete disclosure of banks'
inner dealings, a plan to set up ``bridge banks'' to handle the bad
debts, and the settlement of outstanding loans.
	   Japanese banks are burdened with some 77 trillion yen (dlrs 546
billion) in bad loans, many of them left over from the collapse of
Japan's real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   The comments came as the race to replace Hashimoto was heating
up. Kajiyama and two other top candidates _ Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi _ appeared in a
televised debate Sunday. On Monday, interviews with them were
published in three major dailies.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign last week after the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party was trounced in July 12 elections for the
upper house of Parliament.
	   The defeat is being widely viewed as a measure of voter outrage
over the government's failure to turn around a long troubled
economy, and the three candidates are coming out with competing
plans to pull Japan out of recession.
	   The LDP will vote Friday for a new party president, who is then
virtually certain to become prime minister, since the party
commands a comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house.
	   Kajiyama's candidacy has received a big boost from the
perception that markets favor him over Obuchi. The Tokyo stock
market rebounded immediately late last week on reports of a
leadership bid by the 72-year-old square-jawed, bespectacled
Kajiyama.
	   The market's major barometer, the Nikkei Stock Average, had
sagged earlier when Obuchi had emerged as the leading candidate.
Obuchi has a reputation for being a good moderator but lacking in
flash and decisive action.
	   Kajiyama also reiterated his apology for a 1990 remark comparing
prostitutes in Japan with blacks in America because they both
``ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into.'' He
retracted the remark at that time, after it set off protests in the
United States.
	   ``I regret what I have said in the past,'' Kajiyama said Monday.
``It was due to my ignorance of minority issues because where I
grew up, there were none.''
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy. All three
candidates have promised tax cuts to stimulate consumer spending.
They also say poorly performing banks should be allowed to
collapse.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Yomiuri published Monday,
Obuchi, 61, said he would propose a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71
billion) spending plan to pump life into Japan's stagnant
consumption, in addition to tax cuts of 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43
billion).
	   Koizumi, at 56 much younger than the other two candidates, has a
softer, nice-guy image that some say is more popular with the
public. He has promised to cut the number of government employees
by half over a decade to cut spending.
	   Kajiyama said he did not expect to be prime minister for long.
But he said he had the political muscle to push forward on the
sorely needed economic reforms.
	   ``I have the strongest sense of crisis,'' he said. ``We need
surgery in the financial system that entails a great deal of pain.
The situation can't be corrected with prescription drugs.''

Judge jails eight detained in raid on radical Basque paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge on Monday jailed eight people
arrested last week in a raid on a radical Basque newspaper linked
to the armed separatist group ETA.
	   After 12 hours of questioning that began Sunday afternoon, two
other suspects were freed on bail. Another was released but told to
report to the National Court every week.
	   Although not formally charged, the eight will remain in jail
until Judge Baltasar Garzon completes his investigation, legal
sources said.
	   They and the other three suspects are current or former members
of the board of directors of Orain, a company that owns the radical
Basque daily Egin and its sister radio station Egin Irratia.
	   Garzon, an investigating magistrate, closed both news outlets
last Wednesday after a series of pre-dawn raids on their offices in
four cities in the Basque country and the neighboring Navarra
region.
	   He acted on grounds that they helped ETA raise money for its
armed campaign to carve out an independent Basque homeland. News
reports have quoted officials as saying documents seized in the
raids showed that Egin also served as a bulletin board for ETA
leaders trying to communicate with commandos in the field.
	   Egin also regularly publishes ETA's statements, including its
claims of responsibility for attacks.
	   Garzon said the eight jailed are suspected of belonging to an
armed group, tax evasion, money laundering and fraud.
	   The suspects arrived at the court in police vans as a group of
50 relatives and friends waved placards reading ``Egin Freedom''
and shouted for the suspects to be released. Up to 15,000 people
took part in a rally Saturday in the Basque city of San Sebastian
to protest the arrests and closure of the paper and radio station.
	   ETA has been fighting for an independent homeland since the late
1960s. Its bombings and other attacks have left nearly 800 people
dead.
	   The group's name is a Basque-language acronym that stands for
Basque Country and Freedom.

Thai children's rights group says abuse cases soaring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's economic crisis is proving
to be trouble for children, a rights groups said Monday, citing a
soaring number of abuse cases, particularly in Bangkok.
	   The Child Protection Foundation, a volunteer organization,
released statistics that showed 119 children were reported victims
of serious abuse through the first six months of 1998, compared
with 174 for all of 1997 and just 63 in 1996.
	   ``Child abuse in Thai families is increasing at a critical pace
this year,'' said Montri Sinthavichai, secretary-general of the
foundation.
	   He said the number of children suffering abuse was the highest
since he began working in the field more than a decade ago.
	   Montri blamed Thailand's economic crisis and the pressures of
urban living for rising rates of abuse. Thailand's economy hit the
skids after the country floated its currency in July last year.
	   The International Monetary Fund is supervising a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout of the economy, but so far it hasn't prevented many
companies from going bankrupt or scaling back operations.
	   As a result, more than a million Thais have lost their jobs
since the economy turned sour last year.
	   ``Parents are under so much pressure because they are either
unemployed or their income can't keep up with rising prices, so
many families are poor now. Parents become angry and frustrated and
take it out on their children,'' he said.
	   Urban living, which fuels financial desire and where families
are split up while parents work away from the home, also
contributes to the problem, he said.
	   Of the 119 victims of child abuse, 57 were harmed by their own
parents. In 33 cases, the abused children were less than 4 years
old, and in 30 cases they were between 4 and 6 years old.
	   ``Some children are abused for years before their cases come to
our attention,'' Montri said, adding that some parents had used
weapons on their children, or burned them with irons and
cigarettes.
	   So far this year, 14 children have been killed, compared with 21
for all of last year.
	   Child labor and abuse is a serious problem in Thailand that goes
far beyond the statistics compiled by Montri's foundation.
	   The United Nation Children's Fund has estimated that 300,000
children are prisoners in Thai brothels while many more are
enslaved in sweatshops.
	   Children's rights advocates say many Thai families view their
children as property to be used, sold or dispensed with as the
parents see fit.
	   Thailand still has a better record regarding children's rights
than some of its neighbors, such as Myanmar and Cambodia, where
children are forcibly conscripted into the army or are fighting the
government as members of insurgent groups.

Indonesian military chief meets U.N. envoy on East Timor problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single names for Wiranto, Suharto are correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's top military commander
held talks with a U.N. mediator Monday as hopes ran high that peace
can be negotiated for troubled East Timor.
	   Military chief and Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto met U.N.
special envoy Jamsheed Marker for about 30 minutes at Jakarta's
military headquarters.
	   Neither commented after the meeting.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia sent in troops in
1975 and annexed it in 1976.
	   Since then, East Timor has endured years of guerrilla warfare
and human rights abuses.
	   Critics of Indonesian rule have called on Indonesia to scale
down its military presence in the territory.
	   Since he arrived in Indonesia last week, Marker has been upbeat
about the chances of reaching a deal on East Timor's future.
	   On Saturday, he met Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who had
promised earlier to grant some autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.
	   Habibie has rejected demands by separatists for a referendum on
outright independence. Indonesia regards East Timor as its 27th
province _ something the United Nations does not recognize.
	   Habibie became president in May when Indonesia's former
authoritarian leader Suharto stepped down. Suharto ordered the 1975
invasion and later steadfastly refused to make compromises despite
the prolonged separatist conflict.
	   Marker has made it clear that the political changes in Indonesia
represent an opportunity to solve the territory's problems.
	   On Sunday, Marker made a brief and secretive visit to East
Timor, where he held talks with local officials, leaders of the
Roman Catholic Church and local military commanders.
	   He said he was optimistic that peace could be achieved
eventually and announced that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal would meet for
talks in New York Aug. 4-5.
	   Marker is scheduled to leave Indonesia Wednesday.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ With Asian economic turmoil cutting deeply
into Taiwan's exports, a private think tank said Monday it had
lowered its economic growth forecast for 1998 to 5.24 percent, down
from 5.95 percent.
	   But the Chunghua Institute of Economic Research predicted a 6.18
percent growth rate next year in anticipation of a recovery in the
region.
	   ``As the whole world suffers from a slow economy, it's hard for
us to stay unscathed,'' said Chou Ji, a research fellow at the
institute.
	   ``The fundamentals of our economy haven't been shaken, but
enterprises need to be more careful in running their business,'' he
told a news conference.
	   Taiwan's exports fell 7 percent to U.S. dlrs 54.5 billion in the
first half of this year, compared with the same period last year.
Imports fell 3.5 percent to U.S. dlrs 53.3 billion.
	   Industrial production grew only 0.69 percent in May, compared
with 6.85 percent growth a year earlier.
	   The oversupply in the world's semiconductor industry and
excessive inventories also contributed to the lackluster
performance in exports, the institute said. The computer and
semiconductor industries contribute more than 40 percent of the
value of Taiwan's industrial output.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Half of Thailand's 16 commercial banks
will report large second-quarter losses because of changes in the
definition of non-performing loans, Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu
Mongol Sonakul said Monday.
	   Thai financial institutions are due to report second-quarter
earnings this week.
	   The institutions are phasing in stricter rules defining which
loans are non-performing. Previously, fully collateralized loans
wouldn't be counted as non-performing until payments were missed
for 12 months.
	   In the second quarter, however, a non-performing loan is one
overdue for six months and in the third quarter, three months will
become the limit.
	   Half of Thailand's commercial banks would report operational
profits before taxes and provisioning in the second quarter, Chatu
Mongkol said at a news conference.
	   Losses recorded by Thai banks will decline in the second half,
he added.
	   Analysts estimate that non-performing loans account for around
35 percent of total loans.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   HONG KONG (AP) The unemployment rate in recession-bound Hong
Kong marched upward to an estimated 4.5 percent in the three-month
period ending June 30, and was likely to worsen before it gets
better, officials said Monday.
	   The figure was announced as Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
confirmed what most people here have suspected for some time _ that
the economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. That
technically puts Hong Kong in recession.
	   Officials cited continued weakeness in retail, the restaurant
and construction trades for most of the latest job losses. The
jobless problem was made worse by the entry of new graduates in the
job market.
	   ``The impact of the Asian financial crisis is much more
widespread and protracted for the whole region than anyone could
have expected,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said.
	   ``High unemployment rate might remain with us for some time,''
he added. ``Things are likely to get worse before they get
better.''
	   Tsang said some government measures to boost the economy were
starting to take effect. He said a program to match jobs and the
jobless was steadily showing better results, and that 12 public
works project would soon create about 1,600 jobs.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hounded by increasing fears of recession and
months of poor trade performance, Singapore received some
unexpectedly good news Monday as midyear trade rebounded.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indication of overall economic
performance, rose 6.1 percent in June from a year earlier, the
Trade Development Board reported.
	   The growth ran counter to most economists' expectations of a
decline for the month, raising hopes that the vulnerable Southeast
Asian city-state may be able to resist an overall contraction this
year.
	   The surprisingly strong performance in June came after two
months of negative figures. Non-oil domestic exports shrank 4.8
percent in April and 1.7 percent in May.
	   The government board _ a division of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry _ said non-oil domestic exports for 1998's first half were
up 5.1 percent from the same period last year, when the economy
posted a 0.2 percent increase.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's sugar exports to most of its
Asian customers dropped off sharply in this year's first five
months because of the region's economic crisis, the government's
Office of Cane and Sugar Board said Monday.
	   Thailand is one of the top sugar exporters in the world.
	   Sugar exports to Indonesia, Thailand's largest customer, totaled
708,750 metric tons from January to May, compared to 915,900 tons
for the same period last year, a decline of 22.6 percent.
	   Exports to South Korea, the second major importer, registered a
drop of 77.4 percent, to 116,255 tons from 515,317. Sugar exports
to Malaysia dropped by 72.5 percent, from 260,050 tons to 71,510.
	   Exports to China were down by 33.8 percent, from 114,200 tons to
75,640.
	   However, exports to Japan continued to show modest growth,
increasing 16.2 percent to 362,065.92 tons from 311,651.41.

Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom to take stakes in each other
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Telekom, Germany's biggest
telephone service provider, said Monday it and France Telecom would
acquire 2 percent stakes in each other by the end of the year to
strengthen cooperation.
	   The two companies already work together on projects across
Europe. Each also holds 10 percent of the U.S. telecommunications
company Sprint Corp. and operate their Global One joint venture in
65 countries.
	   Deutsche Telekom said it expects total sales of joint ventures
between it and France Telecom to reach about 20 billion marks (dlrs
11 billion) by 2003.
	   In addition, Telekom said it will expand its cooperation with
France Telecom in the companies' operative, research and
development, multimedia, information systems and telephone card
businesses.
	   Deutsche Telekom, which has been partially privatized, said both
companies will request approval for mutual activities from the
European Union Commission.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hounded by increasing fears of recession and
months of poor trade performance, Singapore received some
unexpectedly good news Monday as midyear trade rebounded.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indication of overall economic
performance, rose 6.1 percent in June from a year earlier, the
Trade Development Board reported.
	   The growth ran counter to most economists' expectations of a
decline for the month, raising hopes that the vulnerable Southeast
Asian city-state may be able to resist an overall contraction this
year.
	   But the government board _ a division of the Ministry of Trade
and Industry _ cautioned that the June figures were ``statistical''
in nature.
	   Board chief Barry Desker said the downward trend was expected to
continue into next year and that it was ``too early'' to predict a
sustained rebound in trade.
	   The surprisingly strong performance in June came after two
months of negative figures. Non-oil domestic exports shrank 4.8
percent in April and 1.7 percent in May.
	   In its report, the board said non-oil domestic exports for
1998's first half were up 5.1 percent from the same period last
year, when the economy posted a 0.2 percent increase.
	   Total non-oil exports in June were 7.9 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.7 billion), compared with 7.06 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 4.2 billion) in May, the board's report said.
	   After an initial gain, Singapore stocks settled back to their
levels before the news emerged. The benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index ended .7 percent above the previous close, up 7.22
to 1,102.32 points.
	   But the island republic's currency was boosted by the surprise
trade figures, strengthening to about 1.70 Singapore dollars to one
U.S. dollar in late afternoon trading from 1.7103 shortly before
the data were announced.
	   The trade report said exports of computer disk drives,
integrated circuits and assembled printed circuit boards recorded
``modest growth after two consecutive months of weak performance.''
	   The electronics industry forms the bedrock for this small,
resource-poor nation's manufacturing sector, and accounts for about
70 percent of the country's non-oil domestic exports.
	   As global demand for electronics products shrank, particularly
due to an oversupply of disk drives, Singapore's vulnerable economy
also had slowed.
	   The report noted that continuing oversupply of key computer
products led to a second-quarter decline of 2 percent in
electronics exports after a 8.6 percent increase in the first. The
critical sector was able to grow a modest 3 percent in the first
half compared with a year ago.
	   The positive June results were also tempered by a sobering
updated forecast for total trade in 1998.
	   The board expects Singapore's total trade to decline 4.5 to 5.5
percent this year because of the Asian crisis, slower growth in the
U.S. and European economies, continued oversupply of electronic
products and persistently weak oil exports.

Swiss report on wartime refugee policy to be delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The publication of a report
investigating Switzerland's refugee policy during World War II is
to be delayed due to the complexity of the task, a member of the
panel compiling it said Monday.
	   The committee of independent historians set up to investigate
Switzerland's wartime past was expected to publish its study this
fall, but will now do so next spring, said panel secretary Linus
von Castelmur.
	   More time is needed largely because the material needed for the
study is dispersed in a number of state and private archives, von
Castelmur said.
	   The report on refugee policy follows the panel's reports on
Swiss gold dealings with Nazi Germany, published in November and
May.
	   The government-appointed panel of historians based in
Switzerland, the United States and Israel is to study other aspects
of Switzerland's wartime past. It aims to produce a final report on
all its investigations in the year 2001.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death.

Norsk Hydro net profits off 7 percent; falling oil prices blamed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norsk Hydro ASA reported Monday a seven
percent drop in net profits for the first half of 1998 from the
same period a year earlier.
	   It cited low world prices for oil, a major export; and weak
markets for fertilizer sales.
	   The 51-percent state-owned company, with interests in oil,
petrochemicals, light metals and fertilizers, gauged net profit at
2.823 billion kroner (dlrs 374.7 million), compared to 3.036
billion (dlrs 404.8 million) for the first half of 1997.
	   A company news release said operating revenue increased four
percent to 50.284 billion kroner (dlrs 6.70 billion), although
operating income slid by 30 percent to 4.198 billion kroner (559.7
million) from a year earlier.
	   The downturn was particularly sharp during the second quarter of
1998. Compared to the same three months of 1997, operating income
from oil and natural gas declined 51 percent. Its fertilizer
division was down by 30 percent.
	   Operating income from petrochemicals was 46 percent lower for
the quarter, largely due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown of a
key factory.
	   The company's light metals division reported a 20 percent
increase in operating revenues due to higher production and prices
for aluminum.
	   Managing Director Egil Myklebust noted the company signed a
letter of intent during the second quarter to merge its
petrochemicals division with EVC International of the Netherlands.
	   Norsk Hydro's sale of its 10.5 percent interest in the private
Norwegian oil company Saga Petroleum ASA had freed capital for use
in the concern's own petroleum operations, he added.
	   Norsk Hydro employs 38,000 people around the world. It is the
largest Norwegian company listed on the Oslo stock exchange.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Jittery gold traders and money
changers fearing rampant kidnappings and unrest from a violent
election campaign shut down their shops Monday despite appeals from
authorities for citizens to remain calm.
	   The shuttered shops signaled diminished confidence in law and
order six days before parliamentary elections that have been marred
by violence and rumors that strongman Hun Sun might call out the
army _ which looted the capital during a coup last year _ to retain
power if he loses.
	   ``Many people are very frightened about threats and other
intimidation that will come the day of the election,'' said Im
Suorsdei, spokesman for the National Election Committee. The NEC is
planning a religious ceremony Thursday to calm fears.
	   No extra security forces were deployed in the capital, though
many citizens fear the ill-paid and poorly trained security forces
may be involved in kidnappings that have terrorized the city's
wealthy and middle class in recent weeks.
	   A new anti-kidnapping police task force scored its first major
success Sunday, tracking down a gang of university students who had
kidnapped one of their schoolmates, the son of an official in the
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, and demanded dlrs 150,000
ransom. One of the abductors was shot and killed, but the incident
seemed only to intensify panic.
	   Gold trading shops closed in the capital's main markets and the
biggest money-changer, Lee Hour, had been closed several days.
	   ``Because the situation is so unstable, we're afraid of
everything, of kidnappings, robberies, election violence,
looting,'' said one gold trader, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Tensions had already been rising due to the electoral campaign,
which comes a year after Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a takeover that devastated parts of
the capital with tanks, mortars and rockets.
	   ``The current problems combine people's fears about the
uncertainty of the elections and the many rumors that have been
spread,'' said Sok Phal, a senior Interior Ministry official.
	   Earlier, about 50 election observers from the European Union
arrived, part of an international contingent already split by
disagreement over what will constitute a free and fair vote on
Sunday. Critics say Hun Sen has used murder and packed the National
Election Committee with his supporters.
	   Opposition candidate Sam Rainsy has said that three supporters
were murdered in the past week but that international observers,
especially from the EU, appeared ready to endorse the result
anyway.
	   ``I've never been here before under such circumstances and I am
quite optimistic that things are going well,'' said the head of the
arriving EU team, Michel Caillouet.
	   A clear-cut victory for any of the three major parties appears
unlikely. Their leaders all say they are considering a coalition,
which could mean more instability.
	   On a country road about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Phnom
Penh, some 150 Buddhist monks and nuns marched for peace and
sprinkled water with jasmine petals on villagers kneeling to be
blessed. Their peace walk will conclude Friday in front of the
royal palace.
	   In the capital, scores of trucks carrying hundreds of supporters
of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party roared through the capital
with loudspeakers blaring slogans. The motorcade had been planned
Sunday but was postponed to avoid clashes with the opposition.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC finished atop U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a coalition by
threatening civil war. Hun Sen has permitted Ranariddh to return
for the elections in an effort to win back international aid and
legitimacy.
	   The Khmer Rouge, considered all but extinct after losing its
last major stronghold in April, has vowed to disrupt the polls and
has been blamed for an attack on a convoy of election workers that
killed two people. Four polling stations in the most vulnerable
region may be closed.
	   Diehard guerrillas are estimated to number a few hundred. More
than 10,000 fighters have made peace over the past two years and
will be voting Sunday. The group caused the deaths of as many as 2
million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.

 &UR; Palestinians downbeat on talks; security tight after failed attack &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Palestinian, Israeli comment, changes
dateline and byline &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians offered a gloomy assessment Monday
of talks meant to jump-start the moribund peace process, while
Israel took a more upbeat line on the consultations, which were
continuing Monday.
	   Meanwhile, police stepped up security in Israeli cities in the
wake of what they said was a failed car bombing on Sunday in
Jerusalem. Police and soldiers, some with bomb-sniffing dogs,
patrolled crowded streets and markets.
	   A Palestinian man, described by police as a Hamas activist, was
arrested after a fire broke out inside the rental van he was
driving. He remained hospitalized Monday with severe burns.
	   Police discovered the van was full of flammable materials and
bags of nails, and said the man had been trying to carry out a
bombing.
	   Israeli media on Monday portrayed the episode as a narrow escape
from the kind of carnage caused by a pair of suicide bombings in
central Jerusalem last summer. ``Miracle in Jerusalem,'' said one
headline.
	   The incident created a tense backdrop for Sunday night's talks
between Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's aide
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. Senior aides to the two men
were to hold another session Monday afternoon.
	   Arriving Monday in the Gaza Strip, Arafat was asked if there had
been progress. ``Nothing,'' he replied.
	   Israel, though, portrayed the fact that the session had taken
place as progress.
	   ``The meeting...paved the way for renewal of direct contacts
between the two sides,'' Israel's Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh
said Monday. ``Direct contacts had not taken place for a long time,
perhaps too long.''
	   After Sunday's talks, an aide to Mordechai said both U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
been briefed by phone immediately.
	   ``We have discussed all the outstanding issues, dealt with them
from all their aspects and we will follow up in order to hear more
ideas,'' Abbas said at the conclusion of the meeting at a Tel Aviv
hotel.
	   ``We decided in the coming days to concentrate on the main
issues, and to look for solutions to bridge the gaps,'' Mordechai
said.
	   The meeting came at the urging of the United States, which had
called on the sides to negotiate face-to-face after its efforts
failed to resolve differences over a U.S. proposal calling for
Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat accepted the plan but Netanyahu has balked, citing
security concerns. After the meeting, Palestinian security chief
Mohammed Dahlan complained that Israeli negotiators had refused to
even discuss the U.S. pullout plan.
	   ``Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S. initiative, the
Israelis would say `not yet,''' Dahlan told The Associated Press.
	   Israel radio reported that the Palestinians had been given a
detailed report by Israel on changes they want to make in the U.S.
initiative, including further amendments to the Palestinian
covenent.
	   Palestinians say they have already deleted clauses in the
document calling for the destruction of Israel, but Israel is
pressing for further steps to ratify the changes.

South Korea's militant labor group calls another nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Defying a government warning, a
militant labor group said Monday it will call another round of
nationwide strikes this week to protest rising layoffs.
	   The Confederation of Korean Trade Unions said metal workers in
the auto, shipbuilding and other industries will begin an
indefinite strike Wednesday. Telephone, subway and hospital workers
will join the walkout the next day, it said.
	   The government said the walkouts would be illegal. Police armed
with arrest warrants already were seeking 85 labor leaders charged
with instigating illegal strikes earlier this month.
	   ``Our strike this week will continue indefinitely unless the
government accepts our demands,'' said Kim Hyong-man, a spokesman
for the confederation, which claims a membership of 500,000.
	   Among other things, the group wants Hyundai Motor Co. to cancel
its decision to lay off 2,678 workers and put 900 others on unpaid
two-year leave. The company already has laid off 5,000 workers.
	   After negotiations with management broke down, 4,000 Hyundai
workers began pitching tents Monday at their plants in Ulsan, 320
kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Seoul, in preparation for the
strike.
	   Hyundai, the nation's largest automaker, ordered a one-day
shutdown of its plants Monday in an effort to ease the tension, but
the union was calling in some of its 26,000 members to picket the
assembly lines.
	   Daewoo Motor Co., the nation's second largest automaker, with
20,000 workers, said it was closing its plants for three days
starting Monday, following its decision to lay off 2,900 workers.
	   Daewoo's labor union said it would join the nationwide strike in
an attempt to halt the layoffs.
	   Government officials are concerned that spreading labor unrest
could chase away badly needed foreign investment _ a key to
reviving South Korea's battered economy.
	   A mass exodus of foreign investors fueled a foreign currency
crisis in South Korea late last year, forcing the country to turn
to the International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have since collapsed.
Government officials said that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and is expected to reach 2 million by
year's end.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

New Beijing paper promises to voice readers' grievances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Beijing got a new color newspaper Monday that
sought to break into a competitive media market by promising to
help readers overcome the problems of city living.
	   In a front-page notice, the Beijing Morning Post's editors
described the newspaper as a ``lifestyle journal'' that would be a
``good friend'' to readers with grievances.
	   ``Please remember to call the Morning Post when you encounter
problems. We will not disappoint you,'' the notice said.
	   The eight-page inaugural edition featured color photos on its
first and last page, a rarity in China, where most newspapers are
black-and-white. Along with sports pages, international news and a
financial page, the newspaper carried stories about cheating on
college entrance exams and lethally dangerous elevators, written in
a breathless, first-person style.
	   Publishers hired a small army of vendors dressed in canary
yellow caps and T-shirts to sell the newspaper during the Chinese
capital's morning rush hour. The newspaper offered a 10 percent
discount on subscriptions through the end of 1999, and delivery by
6:30 each morning.
	   China's state-controlled media have long been typified by the
stodgy Communist Party flagship People's Daily. But it and other
ideological warhorses are now being challenged by other dailies and
weeklies that offer racier stories and less politics.
	   Though still heavily edited for criticism of the Communist Party
leadership, these brasher papers have won readers with snappier
writing and reporting, including on such sensitive issues as
official corruption.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An infant girl who was born with two heads
has died after 28 days, hospital officials said Monday.
	   The first child of a poor farming couple in the Mekong delta
province of Tien Giang had suffered from a heart complication since
birth and finally succumbed to it on Saturday, Ho Chi Minh's Tu Du
maternity hospital said.
	   The baby was born with two heads, two backbones, two lungs and
two hearts, but only one hipbone, one set of reproductive organs,
two arms and two legs. Doctors earlier had decided against any
separation surgery.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The bodies of two remaining
missing people _ a 7-year-old girl and a woman _ have been found in
a landslide in the southern Philippines, bringing the death toll to
seven, police said Monday.
	   The bodies were recovered late Sunday and the search for more
victims has been called off in Sergio Osmena town in Zamboanga del
Norte province, provincial police director Ronald Roderos said.
	   Rescuers also found a dead horse and two motorcycles under the
debris, Roderos said.
	   Heavy rain sent tons of boulders and mud down the side of a
mountain on top of several houses last Thursday.
	   Three people were rescued soon after the landslide. Rescuers
armed with shovels found two bodies Friday and three more were
recovered the next day.
	   Relatives of the victims blame years of heavy illegal logging in
Zamboanga's mountains for the landslide.

Russia to buy more Iraqi oil under oil-for-food deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian oil company has signed a
contract to buy 3.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq under the
United Nations' oil-for-food program, officials announced Monday.
	   The program, an exception to U.N. sanctions against Iraq, allows
Iraq to sell dlrs 5.25 billion worth of oil every six months to buy
food and humanitarian supplies, to soften the impact on ordinary
Iraqis.
	   The oil is to be shipped to Russia by late November, under the
contract signed last Thursday, officials at the Tyumen Oil company
said Monday, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The value of the deal was not announced, but Iraq sells its oil
for around dlrs 12 a barrel, which would make it worth around dlrs
43 million.
	   Russian companies earlier this year signed contracts to buy 94
million barrels of oil from Iraq under the deal.
	   Russia has been a leading buyer of Iraqi oil under the
oil-for-food program. Russia has signed billions of dollars worth
contracts to revitalize Iraq's oil industry once the sanctions are
lifted, and is eager to maintain close ties with Iraq.

Compulsory drug testing to be introduced in Royal Air Force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government is to introduce compulsory drug
testing in the Royal Air Force, bringing the service into line with
the army and navy, which already regularly check for drug abuse
among their personnel.
	   Armed Forces Minister Dr. John Reid said compulsory testing will
be introduced from Nov. 1 ''in line with the Ministry of Defense
policy of zero-tolerance to drug taking in the armed forces.''
	   ''This action, along with our program aimed at educating our
personnel on the dangers of drug taking, will help considerably as
a defensive measure against the increasing drug culture in society
at large,'' he said.
	   The army introduced compulsory testing in January 1995 and the
navy implemented similar measures in April 1997. Reid said it was
``logical for the Royal Air Force to follow suit.''
	   Officials will conduct random urine tests on a quarter of Royal
Air Force personnel each year, Reid said. The tests will cover all
ranks and bases.
	   Urine will be screened for signs of cannabis, cocaine,
amphetamines, opiates, barbiturates and LSD.
	   An individual who tests positive is likely to be discharged from
service, Reid said. Failure to provide a specimen will be
considered a disciplinary offense.
	   Since 1995, the army has tested a total of 178,194 personnel, of
whom 1075 tested positive. Eighty percent of those were discharged.
Since last year, the navy has tested 14,545 people, of whom 16
proved positive. All were discharged.
	   The Royal Air Force discharged 18 people for drug-related
offenses in 1996, the most recent year for which figures are
available.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
the key index in Seoul surging 6.1 percent as concerns eased over
labor unrest in South Korea.
	   Traders said worries over the labor issue appear to be tapering
off because, despite threats of a nationwide strike, many laborers
seem to be accepting the fact that layoffs are inevitable for
economic reforms.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   The stability of the Japanese currency against the U.S. dollar,
and falling local interest rates, also boosted the South Korean
market, traders said.
	   The dollar was trading at 139.355 yen, slightly lower than
139.50 late Friday in New York. Japanese financial markets were
closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 21.00 points to 365.18.
	   Philippine shares tumbled on foreign selling prompted by
concerns that the country's economic fundamentals aren't as healthy
as proclaimed by the new government, traders said.
	   The Philippine government registered a budget deficit of 24
billion pesos (dlrs 585 million) in the first half of 1998. The
government also said over the weekend it has lowered its growth
targets and raised its inflation estimates this year because of the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.81 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,734.45.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices slumped after four straight sessions
of advances.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 135.68 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at
8,493.25. On Friday, the index had gained 42.36 points.
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower and continued to fall
throughout the session as investors took profits following last
week's sharp gains.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher for the fifth
consecutive session. The market's key Weighted Price Index rose
7.87 points, or 0.1 percent, to 8,047.67.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 4.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,168.34.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly lower in
lackluster trading. The All Ordinaries Index fell 26.80 points, or
0.95 points, to 2,787.9.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed slightly lower. The
benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.03
point to 445.28.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher, boosted by much
higher-than-expected June trade figures. The Straits Times
Industrial Index rose 7.22 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,102.32.
	   JAKARTA: The key index closed higher following a surge in mining
and telecommunication shares. The Composite Index rose 2.451
points, or 0.5 percent, to 488.685.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly higher in brisk
trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 2.46 points, or
0.8 percent, to 297.74.

Desperate mother exhumes body of her son from his unmarked grave;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLANE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After two years of bureaucratic
haggling failed to win the return of her son's body, Mina Kikic and
her husband took shovel in hand, dug up the remains and buried them
``with dignity'' in a Muslim cemetery.
	   Now, Bosnian and international officials fear others may try the
same thing, sometimes risking death or serious injury by crossing
mine fields to reach mass graves left over from the 1992-1995
Bosnian War.
	   Such actions could also complicate efforts to account for
thousands still missing in the Bosnian war, which ended with the
Dayton accord in December 1995.
	   All that, however, means little to survivors such as Mrs. Kikic,
for whom the burial of a loved one helps bring closure to years of
grief and uncertainty.
	   ``Was I supposed to die waiting to find out where my son's body
is,'' she asked? ``I'm finally at peace.''
	   Mrs. Kikic's son, Almir, was 22 years old when he was killed in
1992 fighting near his home in Plane, 120 kilometers (75 miles)
north of Sarajevo.
	   After Bosnian Serbs drove the Muslims from the village, they
buried about 30 dead Muslim fighters, including Almir, in unmarked
graves.
	   The Dayton agreement left Plane in the part of the country ruled
by Bosnian Serbs. The Kikic family was among thousands of refugees
in the Muslim-Croat sector.
	   Hoping to retrieve Almir's body, Mrs. Kikic and her family
applied to Bosnian and international commissions responsible for
excavating mass graves and locating missing persons. But they
received no satisfaction.
	   Later, a young Muslim prisoner, who was exchanged for Serb
captives six months into the conflict, told the family he had been
forced to dig graves and recognized the body of Almir, whom he had
known before the war.
	   The young man told them where the grave could be found.
	   Following his instructions, Mrs. Kikic and her husband Osman
crossed through mine fields in February 1996, located what appeared
to be a grave and began digging. They found three skeletons, one
wearing clothing which the mother remembered buying for her son.
	   ``It was my child,'' she said. ``The molars in the skull were
missing,'' as were Almir's.
	   The couple reburied the bones and reported the location to the
three Bosnian commissions -- Muslim, Serb and Croat -- as well as
the International Commission for Missing Persons.
	   But none made any move to excavate the gravesite, since teams
are still trying to clear land mines from the area. Further appeals
to the Bosnian government and international organizations failed to
win the return of Almir's body.
	   After waiting more than two years, the Kikic family returned to
the site in May, excavated the remains themselves, wrapped them in
a blanket and drove them home in the trunk of the car.
	   The parents buried their son in a Muslim cemetery in Tesanj,
where they settled after the war.
	   ``We practically stole him,'' Mrs. Kikic said. ``We didn't have
any permission to do what we did.''
	   Jasmin Odobasic, deputy chairman of the Muslim Commission for
Missing Persons, said the family's action was illegal, although it
is doubtful they will ever be prosecuted.
	   But since no forensic tests were ever performed, the Muslim-led
government still considers Almir ``missing in action.''
	   That means little to his family.
	   ``After I saw him, I didn't need any pathologist to prove it was
Almir,'' Mrs. Kikic said. ``I gave birth to him.''

Iran and Russia agree on equal development of Caspian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Russia have agreed that all five
countries surrounding the oil-rich Caspian Sea should have a say in
its development, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov and his Iranian
counterpart, Morteza Sarmadi, signed a statement Sunday in Tehran
saying that, in principle, the Caspian's rich resources should be
divided equally among the littoral states, Tehran radio reported.
	   But they stressed that a final agreement on apportioning
resources would have to be agreed by all littoral states, the radio
said.
	   Of the five nations bordering the Caspian, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into
national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores.
	   But Russia and Iran, which have little or no oil near their
coasts, want the sea's resources to be shared by all.
	   The statement said that both Tehran and Moscow seriously opposed
proposed plans to lay oil pipelines along the Caspian seabed
because that could lead to a major environmental disaster, the
agency reported.
	   Several American and other Western oil companies have signed oil
development agreements with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and plan to
lay pipelines across the Caspian seabed, Iranian radio reported.
	   Iran has been pressing for a new demarcation of borders on the
Caspian ever since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, creating new
countries with shores on the sea.
	   Earlier this month the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan
signed an accord that divided the northern part of the Caspian
between their states.
	   But Pastukhov has said the agreement does not affect earlier
Soviet-Iranian pacts that demarcated the Caspian into Soviet and
Iranian sectors.

U.S. Navy to help South Korea combat infiltration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The U.S. Navy will send ships close to
South Korea to support efforts to detect North Korean infiltrators,
the U.S. military command in Seoul said Monday.
	   The plan was decided as South Korea's military came under
intense public criticism for failure to detect a recent series of
North Korean spy incursions by sea.
	   The decision was made in a meeting last week between Gen. John
H. Tilelli, the U.S. military commander in South Korea, and Gen.
Kim Jin-ho, chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the
command said.
	   ``Because of the difficult challenge of detecting North Korean
infiltrations and suspected ongoing attempts to send agents into
South Korea, the combined South Korea-U.S. operation is considered
a prudent measure,'' the command said in a statement.
	   The statement said ``details of the specific naval assets
involved and the duration of the combined counter-infiltration
operation'' would be kept secret.
	   Last week, the body of a suspected North Korean spy was found
washed ashore on an east coast beach. A fruitless manhunt for two
other North Korean agents who might have come ashore ended Sunday.
	   In June, a Yugo-class North Korean submarine was found entangled
in a fishing net off the same general area. The sub's nine
occupants were found dead in what South Korean officials believed
was a murder-suicide carried out by their superiors to avoid
capture.
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   The Koreas remain technically at war, having signed no treaty at
the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Their border is the world's most
heavily guarded, with 2 million troops deployed on both sides.

Polish premier may take over European ministry to stop wrangling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's prime minister said Monday he
will shake up his much-criticized ministry for European integration
to stop high-level bickering and may take over the chairmanship
himself.
	   ``I plan to introduce far-reaching organizational changes which
will resolve conflicts in management of the committee,'' Jerzy
Buzek told Polish public radio.
	   The ministry, which is supposed to be preparing Poland for
European Union membership, was accused of incompetence after the EU
cut aid to Poland by about 20 percent in May. Since then it has
been beset by internal conflicts, with its chief officials publicly
insulting each other.
	   Buzek said he would announce the changes ``at an appropriate
moment,'' adding he had not ruled out taking the chairman's job
himself, as was the case under the previous government.
	   Commenting on media reports about a possible broader government
shake-up, Buzek said that ``the best moment of evaluating the
Cabinet's work is after a year.'' Buzek's government was sworn in
Oct. 31.
	   According to newspaper reports, the ministers most likely to
leave the government are Agriculture Minister Jacek Janiszewski,
accused of allegedly awarding lucrative state orders to his
friends' companies; and Culture Minister Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa and
Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski, both of whom have been
criticized for incompetence.

	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 3,000 villagers returned
home Monday when Mount Merapi's volcanic activity subsided after an
outpouring of hot poisonous gases, ash and lava.
	   The villagers had fled four villages on the slopes of
Indonesia's most active volcano Sunday.
	   Volcanologists said activity within the 2,968-meter (9,737-foot)
peak has been building for weeks.
	   Despite the respite Monday, they fear a major eruption is still
possible.
	   Merapi sits in the middle of Central Java, one of the world's
most densely populated regions.
	   Kandar, a civil defense official, said a total of 3,501 people
were evacuated, but were later allowed to return.
	   Speaking in Dukun, one of the affected villages, Kandar said a
heavy blanket of ash had fallen Sunday, followed by acid rain.
	   ``People have returned home. But there is still some danger. So
they are still on alert,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The evacuation was ordered Sunday after the mountain threw up
two huge clouds of super-hot gas. Lava poured out of the crater
along with ash and dust.
	   There have been no reports of casualties.
	   ``Merapi remains in an eruptive phase. There are glowing rocks
on its summit and lava flows,'' said volcanologist Antonius
Ratdomopurbo. Sunday's eruption was the third since July 11, he
said.
	   Authorities said thousands of residents within an 8-kilometer
(5-mile) radius of the peak were on standby to leave if the
situation worsened again.
	   Officials denied a local media report Monday that 6,000 people
had been evacuated from the area near the city of Yogyakarta, about
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Officials fear hot or toxic clouds could hit villages on the
mountain's slopes. During a sudden eruption in 1994, a steam cloud
flattened one village, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Villagers choose to live on the sides of the volcano despite the
ever present danger because the soil there is extremely fertile for
farming.
	   Volcanologists reported that a 4.5-kilometer (2.7-mile) trail of
lava had poured down its southwest slope, The Jakarta Post reported
Monday.
	   The newspaper also said that volcanic ash had fallen on towns
and villages as far away as 20 kilometers (12 miles).
	   Merapi is the regarded as the most dangerous of Indonesia's 500
volcanoes. Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300
people in 1930.

U.S. dollar takes on central role in Cuban economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos SLJC101-102 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans these days tell a joke in which a wife
calls a psychiatric hospital to ask about her husband's odd
behavior.
	   All afternoon, he has stood on the balcony of his apartment
screaming to passers-by: ``I'm a bellboy at the Riviera Hotel!''
	   ``Madame,'' says the hospital's top doctor, ``your husband is
suffering from delusions of grandeur: He doesn't realize that he is
only a brain surgeon.''
	   The ravings of the fictional brain surgeon might be excused in
today's Cuba, where a worker at a tourist hotel can easily earn
more than the most distinguished government employee.
	   Why? The American dollar.
	   Since Cuba legalized possession of foreign currency in 1993, the
dollar has taken a central role in Cuba's socialist economy.
	   Five years ago, Cubans caught with dollars could be jailed. Now,
the government encourages use of dollars, which helps it obtain the
hard currency needed to save its struggling economy. As a result,
nearly half of the population has access to greenbacks, officials
say.
	   But while dollars are spurring economic recovery, they also have
created inequalities unknown since the triumph of the 1959
revolution. The average government worker earns about 200 pesos a
month _ dlrs 10.50. A bellboy can earn that in tips in a few hours.
	   ``If I had dollars I would buy a big pork steak with congri,'' a
dish of rice and black beans, said 69-year-old Anibal Granada, who
fought in the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power.
	   ``But I don't have anyone to send me dollars from Miami, so I
have to eat that picadillo,'' he said, referring to a soybean
mixture available by government ration. ``I think combatants of the
revolution deserve more.''
	   Still, resentment has eased since the early 1990s, a time of
severe hunger and gloom when Cubans begged tourists to exchange
dollars for pesos, and implored them to buy them toothpaste, rubber
thongs and other things available only in the dollar stores they
were barred from entering.
	   President Castro anticipated the inequalities when the dollar
was legalized on July 26, 1993: ``Some of these measures are
unpleasant,'' he said. ``We don't like them. There will be those
who have privileges others do not, because they have a family
member, because they have a relation, because they send them
money.''
	   Four years later, the Agencia de Informacion Nacional
acknowledged that ``those who have dollars can cover their
necessities. Those who do not have the green bills suffer the
rigors more.''
	   The government said late last year that an influx of dollars
contributed to a modest economic recovery of 2.5 percent in 1997,
despite a disappointing sugar crop, this Caribbean island's
traditional financial mainstay.
	   Today, dollars are used as commonly as Cuban pesos, and products
and services are increasingly offered in dollars. Dollar sales in
Cuba increased 17.8 percent last year.
	   The government says 1.4 million of the 4 million people actively
employed in Cuba now receive at least part of their monthly salary
in dollars, as a way to improve their standard of living and retain
them as workers.
	   Many work for hotels or other tourism enterprises held jointly
by the government and foreign partners.
	   Even if they don't earn part of their salaries in dollars, hotel
workers, waiters and government taxi drivers earn greenbacks
through tips.
	   So do those who illegally provide services to tourists:
prostitutes, unofficial taxi drivers, those who rent rooms without
government approval.
	   Owners of small family restaurants, artisans and others approved
for small private businesses also often earn dollars.
	   And then there are those with relatives abroad who send money.
	   Estimates of family remittances range from dlrs 400 million to
dlrs 800 million annually, making them one of Cuba's most important
hard currency sources.
	   While half of the population barely gets by on official rations
and their meager government salaries, the other half with dollars
can buy many things rarely subsidized under socialism: vegetable
oil, milk, most meat and vegetables, shampoo.
	   The flood of dollars keeps business brisk at the four-story
Carlos Tercero shopping mall the government opened here last fall.
	   Surrounded by air conditioning and elevator music, Cubans spend
dollars on things unavailable anywhere else: washing machines,
watches, toys and sporting goods.
	   Clothes, shoes, linens, dishes, stereos, even pricey Lancome
cosmetics are sold here. Videos of movies such as ``101
Dalmatians'' and ``The Cable Guy'' are for rent. Pizza and ice
cream are on sale at the food court downstairs.
	   Government stores that sell for pesos are generally dreary
places with shoddy goods on near-empty shelves.
	   The booming consumerism rankles some traditional communist
ideologues.
	   But most are biting their tongues until the economy improves,
and _ as officials promise _ the country returns to a peso-based
economy.
	   ``It's a risk that government leaders have decided to take ...
because they have no other alternative,'' the Agencia de
Informacion Nacional report said. ``But also because they are
confident that these are transitory circumstances.''

EU freezes new aid to Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU announces suspension of new aid, new quotes,
details; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union announced a freeze
Monday on new funding for humanitarian aid projects in Kabul
because of the treatment of women by the Taliban rulers of the
Afghan capital.
	   The suspension to the capital covers some dlrs 4 million, or 40
percent of all aid which the EU's humanitarian office had earmarked
for Afghanistan for a 12-month period starting in August.
	   ``There is a sort of sexual apartheid. Women are being
discriminated against. It violates all sorts of principles, in
particular the rules on humanitarian aid,'' said Pietro Petrucci,
an EU humanitarian affairs spokesman.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has also
recommended the aid agencies it works with pull out of Kabul rather
than accept a Taliban demand that they relocate to abandoned
student dormitories battered by civil war bombings.
	   However, Petrucci said the Commission would continue to
guarantee the costs of existing EU-funded aid projects run by
agencies that decided to stay on in the capital.
	   Petrucci said the Taliban authorities had failed to stick to the
terms of an agreement negotiated in May which aimed to ease
restrictions on the way international aid agencies could work under
the Taliban's radical brand of Islam.
	   He told reporters the EU would seek talks with the Taliban to
improve the situation.
	   ``We hope the temporary suspension will be brief,'' Petrucci
said. ``We hope to negotiate minimal conditions with the Taliban.''
	   Such conditions would include the right to distribute food and
medical assistance to men and women without discrimination and
increased freedom for female aid workers to carry out their tasks.
	   ``We cannot accept that female operators cannot do their jobs,''
Petrucci said.
	   He added conditions for aid workers outside the capital were
slightly better and aid to the rest of Afghanistan would not be
blocked. Most of the EU funding for Kabul goes on sanitation,
health and food aid projects.
	   Relations between international aid agencies and the Taliban
have been strained since the movement captured the capital in 1996.
Within days of taking control of the capital, the Taliban closed
schools for girls and forced women to stop working outside the
home.

Five more South Korean diplomats to be withdrawn from Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian official's remarks in grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five South Koreans are being withdrawn
from Russia under an agreement to limit the number of intelligence
agents each country assigns to its diplomatic missions, Seoul's
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   ``The withdrawal is in accordance with an agreement between the
intelligence authorities of both countries,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Lee Ho-jin told reporters.
	   Lee hoped the agreement would resolve a diplomatic row that
began early this month when each country expelled one diplomat on
charges of spying.
	   In negotiations that followed, Russia acknowledged that it has
two intelligence agents at its embassy in Seoul and proposed that
South Korea limit to two the number of its intelligence officials
in Russia, Lee said.
	   South Korea accepted the proposal, Lee said, and has ordered the
withdrawal of two agents from its embassy in Moscow and three from
its consulate in Vladivostok.
	   Lee refused to disclose further details but other ministry
officials said the five agents would be brought home after the
foreign ministers of the two countries meet next week.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is scheduled to meet
his South Korean counterpart, Park Chung-soo, during a meeting of
the Asian Regional Forum in Manila next Monday.
	   Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Russian Foreign
Minister Grigory Karasin as saying the two ministers will ``touch
upon different aspects of an unpleasant incident which took place
in our relations with South Korea.''
	   Karasin refused to say whether the two ministers' meeting might
finally bring an end to the spy dispute, Interfax said.
	   The diplomatic row began July 4 when Russia ordered the
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spy charges.
Cho's alleged Russian contact, a senior Foreign Ministry official,
was arrested on treason charges.
	   Four days later, South Korea retaliated by ordering the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat in Seoul, Oleg N. Abramkin _ an
action Moscow said was unwarranted.
	   It was the most serious diplomatic dispute reported between
Moscow and Seoul since the former adversaries opened formal
diplomatic relations in 1990. Russia's predecessor, the former
Soviet Union, was a longtime ally of Seoul's rival, communist North
Korea.
	   Relations between Seoul and Moscow have warmed significantly in
the recent past, while ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have
cooled considerably.

Intel and Beijing's Palace Museum settle website dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. computer chip maker Intel and Beijing's
Palace Museum have settled a dispute over photos used on an Intel
website, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Monday.
	   Officials from the museum in the former palace of China's
emperors had objected to the Intel website's use of museum photos
and claimed some of its information was incorrect, Xinhua said.
	   The two sides reached a deal whereby the museum agreed to
provide editorial advice and copyrights for photos of the Forbidden
City used on the website in exchange for advanced computer
equipment from Intel, Xinhua said.
	   Santa Clara, California-based Intel will post the museum's seal
of approval on the site and upgrade it with better photographs and
text, Xinhua added.
	   The Palace Museum in the Forbidden City, the former imperial
palace in the heart of Beijing, attracts millions of visitors a
year. A rambling maze of more than 800 buildings, the museum is
able to display only about 1 percent of the 1 million artifacts and
art works in its collection.
	   China has more than 1 million Internet users ``who spend most of
their time looking at information from the West,'' Xinhua said.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The official death toll from the
tidal wave that hit Papua New Guinea climbed Monday to at least 700
people, mostly children and the elderly. The true death toll was
feared far higher _ John Tekwi, governor of West Sepik Province,
where the wave struck Friday, was quoted by Australian Broadcasting
Corp. as saying at least 3,000 people had died. Hundreds of injured
were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were believed to
have fled to higher ground on the jungle island. Missionaries and
villagers were burying the dead where they lay on the beaches.
Disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said schools in three villages
will be shut down in the wake of the tidal wave. All the children
who used to go there, Dalle said, are dead. (PAPUA NEW

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban soldiers toting automatic
rifles shut down international aid organizations in Kabul on Monday
and ordered foreign workers to relocate to abandoned dormitories or
leave Afghanistan's war-shattered capital. The Taliban had ordered
the aid agencies to move two weeks ago, saying it was for their own
safety. Aid workers resisted, saying they feared clustering
together would make them more vulnerable to attacks and
kidnappings. Mohammed Nabi Majrooh, deputy head of Taliban
security, told The Associated Press that the Taliban religious army
now will give aid workers until Tuesday to move to the dorms as
demanded. If they're seen on the streets of Kabul after that, he
said, the Taliban will take action. (AFGHANISTAN-AID GROUPS)
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Air raid sirens wailed and church bells
pealed Monday as Greek Cypriots mourned the anniversary of Turkey's
1974 invasion of northern Cyprus. Residents were awakened at dawn
by sirens marking the hour 24 years ago when Turkish paratroopers
landed on the island after Greek Cypriot supporters of union with
Greece launched an abortive coup. Greek Cypriots packed churches
for memorial services for the more than 5,000 people who died or
disappeared in the fighting that followed the invasion. For their
part, Turkish Cypriots planned to celebrate the anniversary.
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was scheduled to visit northern
Cyprus, where Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops. This year's
anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than usual due to
increased tension over Greek Cypriots' decision to buy
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. (CYPRUS-ANNIVERSARY)

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriots marked the anniversary of
Turkey's 1974 invasion Monday, with Greeks going to church for
memorial services and Turks turning out for celebrations.
	   Greek Cypriots woke up at dawn as sirens wailed to signal the
hour that Turkish paratroopers landed on the plain north of Nicosia
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Bells tolled across the south of the divided island as residents
went to church for services in memory of the more than 5,000 people
who died and disappeared in the fighting that followed the
invasion.
	   On the Turkish side of the U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone,
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Turkish Cypriots their
festivities marked an event that ``ended Greek oppression and
rendered unsuccessful an attempt by Greece to annex Cyprus.''
	   Referring to his government's vow to stop the Greek Cypriot's
deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Yilmaz said:
``No one should doubt that we can oppose any kind of threat against
the security of Turkey and (northern Cyprus).''
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, whose breakaway state in
northern Cyprus is recognized only by Ankara, told a crowd in
Nicosia: ``It was the Greek Cypriots who forced us into creating
the Turkish Cypriot Republic.''
	   An aerobatics team of the Turkish air force was due to put on a
display of precision flying and six Turkish warships have docked in
northern Cypriot ports for the week-long celebrations. Turkey
maintains some 35,000 troops in north Cyprus.
	   In Greek Nicosia, Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis
Cassoulides, whose government has condemned the visit by Turkish
warplanes and ships, told a memorial service in St John Cathedral
that Cyprus could not remain the only divided country in Europe.
	   ``Europe cannot tolerate on its threshold the presence of an
occupation army in a country which the European Union itself
recognizes as meeting the criteria for joining the union,''
Cassoulides said.
	   Greece's Interior Minister Alecos Papadopoulos, who represented
the Athens government in Monday's commemorations, told the service:
``This anniversary is a day of shame for the international
community which today tolerates and even supports the abominable
Turkish occupation and military provocations against Cyprus.''
	   Archbishop Chrysostomos led the congregation in a prayer that
referred to the thousands of Greek Cypriots displaced from northern
Cyprus as a result of the invasion.
	   ``Oh Lord, help our refugees to return to their homes and their
churches which have been seized and desecrated by the barbaric
invader. Expel the barbaric invader from our homes,'' the
archbishop said.
	   Tens of thousands of Cypriots fled their homes during the 1974
fighting and the following year there was an exchange of
populations that involved more than 200,000 people.
	   Greek Cypriots planned to stage demonstrations later Monday to
protest the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   This anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than usual
because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriot missiles, which
are due to arrive later this year. Turkey's threat to prevent their
deployment has brought a warning from Greece, a fellow member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that it would respond to
any attack on Cyprus.
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, justified
the deal in an address to the nation Sunday night, saying the
missiles were required because of ``the ever-threatening presence
of the Turkish occupation troops who are in an attack formation.''
	   He rejected U.S. criticism of the purchase, saying Cyprus would
not accept restrictions on its defense.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island
collapsed in August 1997 after Denktash insisted on the recognition
of his breakaway state and that Cyprus abandon its bid to join the
European Union.

Philippine Airlines' financial losses worsen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines, battling
potential closure, said Monday its financial losses have worsened
this year, adding to a 14.93 billion peso (dlrs 364 million) loss
over the previous five years.
	   The airline said a preliminary financial report showed it lost
391.6 million pesos (dlrs 9.6 million) in the first two months of
the fiscal year that started in April, nearly four times its loss
in the same period last year.
	   PAL said the losses were largely caused by soaring
dollar-denominated payments during the period, which jumped from
253.3 million pesos to 861.4 million pesos, mainly because of the
depreciation of the Philippine peso.
	   The airline said it expects a much bigger loss in June because
of a devastating 22-day strike by its pilots' union.
	   PAL said it lost at least 150 million pesos (dlrs 3.6 million) a
day during the strike. The airline fired all the striking pilots
after they ignored a government return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than
13,000 workers to minimize its losses.
	   Hundreds of the dismissed pilots, flight attendants and ground
personnel staged a noisy demonstration Monday in front of PAL's
headquarters in Manila's Makati financial district to protest the
dismissals.
	   The union representing ground personnel has threatened to go on
strike to demand the reinstatement of the terminated workers but
the labor department assumed jurisdiction of the union's labor
dispute with PAL on July 10 and prohibited any work stoppage.
	   Labor officials also ordered the airline to suspend any more
layoffs.
	   Alex Barrientos, president of the Philippine Airlines Employees
Union, said that despite the prohibition, the union still plans to
walk out.
	   PAL officials have said another strike could force Asia's oldest
airline to close after 57 years of operation.
	   President Joseph Estrada said last week a closure of the flag
carrier would cause embarrassment to the country. He urged the
labor department to try to settle the labor dispute within two
weeks.
	   The company is drawing up a rehabilitation plan that broadly
calls for the downsizing of the airline and a restructuring of
debts, and has obtained permission from Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission to suspend payments on financial obligations
amounting to about dlrs 2 billion.

Taliban close aid offices, order workers into dormitories

 &UR; With BC-Afghanistan-Fighting &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Soldiers of the Taliban religious army
shut down offices of international aid organizations Monday and
ordered foreign workers to relocate to a complex of abandoned
dormitories or leave the capital.
	   ``The deadline for them has passed. We told them to move ... by
Sunday,'' said Mullah Mohammed Nabi Majrooh, deputy head of the
Taliban security department.
	   Two weeks ago the Taliban ordered the aid groups to relocate to
dormitories once used by students of the city's technical schools.
The war-battered buildings have been empty since 1992 when Islamic
insurgents swept Afghanistan's communists from power.
	   Aid workers say they can't afford to refurbish the dormitories
and fear for their safety there against possible attacks and
kidnappings.
	   ``If they don't move, and we see them on the streets in Kabul
tomorrow (Tuesday) we will take action under our laws,'' Majrooh
told The Associated Press. ``The deadline passed on Sunday, but we
gave them another 24 hours.''
	   While the United Nations and the International Red Cross have
been exempted from the relocation order, the United Nations objects
to it and has sent a letter to Taliban leaders asking them to
reconsider their ultimatum.
	   The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, has recommended that aid agencies receiving EU aid pull out
of Kabul rather than accept the Taliban demand.
	   The exact number of international aid workers still in Kabul was
not known.
	   A mass exodus of international aid organizations from Kabul is
expected to have a devastating effect on the estimated 750,000
people still living in the city. The groups provide subsidized
food, medicines and clothes and are repairing neighborhoods heavily
damaged by 20 years of civil war.
	   Kabul survived relatively untouched during the Soviet occupation
of Afghanistan that ended in 1989. But after 1992 and the fall of
the country's pro-Moscow government, the city was heavily damaged
by warring Islamic factions who captured the capital.
	   Relations between international aid agencies and the Taliban
have been strained since the movement began imposing laws based on
its radical brand of Islam.
	   The European Union is considering a freeze on humanitarian aid
to Kabul due to the Taliban's harsh treatment of women, officials
at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, said Monday.
	   The suspension of aid for new projects is expected to cover some
dlrs 4 million, or 40 percent of all aid that the EU's humanitarian
office had earmarked for Afghanistan for a 12-month period starting
in August.
	   Pietro Petrucci, a spokesman on humanitarian affairs for the
European Commission, said Taliban rules on the treatment of women
meant it was impossible to ``distribute aid without
discrimination.''
	   A decision to freeze the aid is expected to be announced in the
next few days.
	   Within days of taking control of Kabul, the Taliban closed
schools for girls and forced women to stop working outside the
home, making it difficult for aid agencies to help Afghan women and
for female aid workers to operate.
	   Relations appeared to improve in May when aid agencies and the
Taliban concluded an agreement that promised education for young
girls and equal access to health care for women.
	   But last month the Taliban shut down more than 100 home schools
that were quietly educating thousands of children, including girls.
Women are still publicly beaten if they are not completely covered
by an all-enveloping robe called a burqa.
	   The Taliban rule in roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan, while the
opposition controls the remaining 15 percent, much of it in
northern Afghanistan. Lawlessness in opposition-held areas has made
it virtually impossible for aid organizations to operate there.
	   In Kabul, one French aid worker who didn't want to give his name
said that his organization would not be relocating to the
dormitories.
	   ``And if that means we have to leave,'' he said, ``we are ready
to go.''

Diana's car for sale on the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The small silver car given to Princess Diana by
Prince Charles as an engagement present is for sale via the
Internet, and the owner says he has already turned down an offer of
more than dlrs 1 million.
	   Keith Lawson, an antique clock dealer from Scratby in eastern
England, bought the 1981 Ford Escort Ghia for his daughter three
years ago at a Sotheby's auction for 6,000 pounds (dlrs 9,800).
	   But since Diana's death, the car's value has rocketed, said
Lawson, ``and now I can't find anyone to insure it. That's why I'm
selling.''
	   Lawson said he has already refused an offer of more than dlrs 1
million from a Las Vegas, Nevada, casino.
	   ``I didn't feel that was the right place for it,'' he said. ``In
fact, I would rather it stayed in this country, perhaps in a
museum. I am prepared to take less money to see it gets a proper
home. The car is a piece of history and I hope it will be bought by
someone who will put it on public display.''
	   The small vehicle with a silver frog mascot on the hood has more
than 80,000 miles (128,740 kilometers) on it and would probably be
worth around 600 pounds (dlrs 985) without its Diana connection.
	   Lawson said the current highest offer for the car is dlrs
635,000 from an anonymous American bidder. The vehicle is for sale
through the U.S. company Classic Auto Network, which notes that it
is being sold ``with a leather-bound album, recording forever in
numerous period photographs, the princess with her favorite car.''
	   The silver frog is a copy of the original mascot, which Diana
attached to the hood. She kept the original when she sold the
vehicle.
	   Sotheby's vehicle experts were at an auction Monday and not
available to speculate on the current value of the car. A spokesman
at Christie's auction house said it would not be appropriate for
the company to comment.

Oxford University to offer first courses on the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, England (AP) _ With the help of a grant from Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen, Oxford University is to offer two courses on
the Internet for the first time.
	   Britain's oldest university said from January 1999, students
will be able to take two online courses run by its Department for
Continuing Education.
	   ``These are free-standing courses, and not part of a full degree
course,'' said Jonathan Darby, director of the department's
Technology-Assisted Lifelong Learning program. Students will
receive certificates.
	   One of the courses is offered to second-year undergraduates and
the university says it will appeal to students from a wide range of
occupations ``who want to use computers more effectively in their
work, or perhaps consider a career change to computing.''
	   The other course, at third-year undergraduate level, offers
practical training in the use of databases by historians, examining
original data from the Oxfordshire towns of Thame and Woodstock in
the 17th century, the university said.
	   Students will be carefully assessed and will receive full
technical support, regardless of whether they currently use the
Internet, said Dr. Geoffrey Thomas, director of the Department for
Continuing Education. ``They are designed around a completely new
concept of online tutorial support that for the first time brings
the Oxford tutorial within the reach of the distance learner.''
	   Specialist tutors will supervise studies using e-mail, Internet
discussions and voice-based conferencing.
	   The venture is backed by a 500,000-pound (dlrs 820,000) grant
from the Paul Allen Virtual Education Foundation based in
Washington State.
	   There are currently 15,000 students registered for courses
through the Department for Continuing Education.
	   The second-year computer course will cost 1,200 pounds (dlrs
2,000) and the local history course will cost 600 pounds (dlrs
985).

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians offered a gloomy assessment Monday
of talks meant to jump-start the moribund peace process, while
Israel took a more upbeat line on the consultations, which were
continuing Monday.
	   Meanwhile, police stepped up security in Israeli cities in the
wake of what they said was a failed car bombing on Sunday in
Jerusalem. Police and soldiers, some with bomb-sniffing dogs,
patrolled crowded streets and markets.
	   A Palestinian man, described by Israeli police as an activist
with the radical group Hamas, remained hospitalized Monday with
severe burns suffered a day earlier when a fire broke out inside
the rental van he was driving.
	   Police discovered the van was full of flammable materials and
bags of nails, and said the man had been trying to carry out a
bombing in Jerusalem's center.
	   Israeli media on Monday portrayed the episode as a narrow escape
from the kind of carnage caused by a pair of suicide bombings in
central Jerusalem last summer. ``Miracle in Jerusalem,'' said one
headline.
	   The incident created a tense backdrop for Sunday night's talks
between Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's aide
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. Senior aides to the two men
were to hold another session Monday afternoon.
	   Arriving Monday in the Gaza Strip, Arafat was asked if there had
been progress. ``Nothing,'' he replied.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said an accord on an
American initiative for an Israeli pullback from parts of the West
Bank was within reach.
	   ``We are working together as a team in order to achieve a
settlement. As for the Palestinians, we will know in the next few
days _ very soon _ if indeed they have received a similar
mandate,'' he said. ``If so, it will be brought to a conclusion.''
	   After Sunday's talks, an aide to Mordechai said both U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross and Netanyahu had been briefed by phone
immediately.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Men armed with automatic rifles and a
grenade launcher killed two security guards and wounded three other
people Monday but failed to get the money from a bank armored car,
police said.
	   Bank teller Ronaldo Cacatian, who was aboard the armored van,
said he was carrying 13.8 million pesos (dlrs 336,000) and 4
million yen (dlrs 28,700) collected from two branches of the
Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank.
	   Chief investigator Jake de Leon said the robbers blocked the
van's path with their car in Caloocan City, and opened fire on the
van's security back-up vehicle, killing two guards and wounding
another.
	   The men then turned their automatic rifles and grenade launcher
on the van, wounding its driver and the driver of a nearby vehicle.
	   De Leon said the remaining guards fought back and prevented the
robbers from nearing the van.
	   The robbers fled after police from a nearby police station
arrived, de Leon added.
	   Bank armored cars and isolated bank branches are the favorite
targets of robbers in the capital area.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who took office June 30, has pledged
to solve the country's severe crime problem within six months.

Lebanese electrical workers strike to demand higher pay, benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Thousands of workers of the state-run
electricity company walked off the job Monday to protest the
government's failure to respond to demands for better working
conditions and higher pay, a union official said.
	   Emile Jeha, president of the Electricity Employees and Workers
Union, told a news conference that 3,000 administrative and
maintenance workers in Beirut, its suburbs and the southern city of
Sidon took part in the one-day strike.
	   Some 800 employees at the privately run Kadisha Electricity
Company in north Lebanon walked out in support, Jeha said.
	   The strike was not expected to disrupt electricity supplies
since the strikers are not employed directly at the main Zouk power
plant. It was the second strike of its kind in the past 12 months.
	   Jeha said the union would take further action unless the
government met demands for higher pay scales, increased pension,
health and education benefits, and housing loans.
	   The electricity company has refused to comment on the demands,
saying that was the responsibility of the Water and Electricity
Ministry. The ministry has argued it has no funds to meet workers'
demands under the government's austerity program.
	   The Zouk plant, 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of Beirut, is
already operating below capacity due to a lack of spare parts and
funds.
	   Technical problems at Zouk mean some one million Lebanese,
roughly a third of the country's population, have had electricity
rationed four to six hours daily since July 1. The rationing is
expected to continue for at least a month more.

EU denies plan to ban car advertising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Monday
denied media reports that it was planning to ban advertising for
automobiles as part of a road safety drive.
	   ``These stories are totally false,'' said EU Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock. ``I wish to reassure everybody, industry
and consumers that there are no plans to ban car advertising.''
	   Reports in German newspapers over the weekend said the
Commission, the European Union's executive body, was planning a ban
or restrict automobile advertising.
	   Kinnock's spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said the reports seemed to
have been based on a study by the Commission this year on the
possibility of an EU-wide code of conduct by car advertisers to
would discourage ads that glamorized high-speed driving.
	   The study was carried out on the suggestion of Britain which
already has a code under which advertisers voluntarily agree not to
link publicity for cars on their speed performance.
	   However, Lambert said consultations with manufacturers,
advertisers and consumer associations found little support for such
a code across the 15-nation bloc and the Commission had no plans to
push for one.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
the key index in Seoul surging 6.1 percent as concerns eased over
labor unrest in South Korea. Traders said worries over the labor
issue appear to be tapering off because, despite threats of a
nationwide strike, many laborers seem to be accepting the fact that
layoffs are inevitable for economic reforms. Restructuring South
Korea's inefficient industries is a key condition set by the
International Monetary Fund, which bailed out the country's economy
late last year. The stability of the Japanese currency against the
U.S. dollar, and falling local interest rates, also boosted the
South Korean market. The dollar was trading at 139.355 yen,
slightly lower than 139.50 late Friday in New York. Japanese
financial markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. (ASIAN

	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. computer chip maker Intel and Beijing's
Palace Museum have settled a dispute over photos used on an Intel
website, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Monday.
	   Officials from the museum in the former palace of China's
emperors had objected to the Intel website's use of museum photos
and claimed some of its information was incorrect, Xinhua said.
	   The two sides reached a deal whereby the museum agreed to
provide editorial advice and copyrights for photos of the Forbidden
City used on the website in exchange for advanced computer
equipment from Intel, Xinhua said.
	   Santa Clara, California-based Intel will post the museum's seal
of approval on the site and upgrade it with better photographs and
text, Xinhua added. (CHINA-INTEL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian oil company has signed a
contract to buy 3.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq under the
United Nations' oil-for-food program, officials announced Monday.
	   The program, an exception to U.N. sanctions against Iraq, allows
Iraq to sell dlrs 5.25 billion worth of oil every six months to buy
food and humanitarian supplies, to soften the impact on ordinary
Iraqis.
	   The oil is to be shipped to Russia by late November, under the
contract signed last Thursday, officials at the Tyumen Oil company
said Monday, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The value of the deal was not announced, but Iraq sells its oil
for around dlrs 12 a barrel, which would make it worth around dlrs
43 million.
	   Russia has been a leading buyer of Iraqi oil under the
oil-for-food program. (RUSSIA-IRAQ-OIL)
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans these days tell a joke in which a wife
calls a psychiatric hospital to ask about her husband's odd
behavior. All afternoon, he has stood on the balcony of his
apartment screaming to passers-by: ``I'm a bellboy at the Riviera
Hotel!'' The hospital's top doctor sets the woman straight:
``Madame, your husband is suffering from delusions of grandeur: He
doesn't realize that he is only a brain surgeon.'' The ravings of
the fictional brain surgeon might be excused in today's Cuba, where
a worker at a tourist hotel can easily earn more than the most
distinguished government employee. The reason is the American
dollar, legalized in Cuba only in 1993. While dollars are spurring
economic recovery in Cuba, they also have created inequalities
unknown since the triumph of the 1959 revolution. The average
government worker earns about 200 pesos a month _ dlrs 10.50. A
bellboy can earn that in tips in a few hours. (CUBA-DOLLAR ECONOMY)

Top German court rules leading ex-communist was Stasi spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A leader of the former East German
communists lost his bid Monday to quash a parliamentary report that
found he spied for East Germany's dreaded Stasi secret police in
the 1970s and '80s.
	   Germany's highest court upheld key conclusions of parliament's
inquiry into the past of Gregor Gysi, who now is parliamentary
leader for the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to
East Germany's communists.
	   The panel's report, issued in May after a three-year probe,
found Gysi informed on dissidents he represented as a lawyer in
former East Berlin from 1975 until at least 1986.
	   Gysi, who argues the inquiry was a political witchhunt and
ignored exonerating evidence, denied the allegations in court
testimony. His lawsuit sought to block parliamentary debate and
official publication of the report.
	   Although the Federal Constitutional Court upheld the report's
key findings, four of the eight justices said its assertion that
Gysi helped the Stasi because he wanted to suppress democratic
dissent in East Germany went too far.
	   But under court rules, plaintiffs win only if a majority of the
judges backs their case.
	   Monday's ruling could open the way for parliament to lift Gysi's
immunity from prosecution if prosecutors decide there is enough
evidence to open a criminal probe.
	   Lawmakers from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party and the opposition
Social Democrats have called on Gysi to give up his legislative
seat.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriots marked the anniversary of
Turkey's 1974 invasion Monday, with Greeks going to church for
memorial services and Turks turning out for celebrations.
	   Greek Cypriots woke up at dawn as sirens wailed to signal the
hour that Turkish paratroopers landed on the plain north of Nicosia
after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Bells tolled across the south of the divided island as residents
went to church for services in memory of the more than 5,000 people
who died and disappeared in the fighting that followed the
invasion.
	   On the Turkish side of the U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone,
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Turkish Cypriots their
festivities marked an event that ``ended Greek oppression and
rendered unsuccessful an attempt by Greece to annex Cyprus.''
	   Referring to his government's vow to stop the Greek Cypriot's
deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Yilmaz said:
``No one should doubt that we can oppose any kind of threat against
the security of Turkey and (northern Cyprus).''
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, whose breakaway state in
northern Cyprus is recognized only by Ankara, told a crowd in
Nicosia: ``It was the Greek Cypriots who forced us into creating
the Turkish Cypriot Republic.''
	   An aerobatics team of the Turkish air force was due to put on a
display of precision flying and six Turkish warships have docked in
northern Cypriot ports for the week-long celebrations. Turkey
maintains some 35,000 troops in north Cyprus.
	   In Greek Nicosia, Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis
Cassoulides, whose government has condemned the visit by Turkish
warplanes and ships, told a memorial service in St John Cathedral
that Cyprus could not remain the only divided country in Europe.
	   ``Europe cannot tolerate on its threshold the presence of an
occupation army in a country which the European Union itself
recognizes as meeting the criteria for joining the union,''
Cassoulides said.
	   Greece's Interior Minister Alecos Papadopoulos, who represented
the Athens government in Monday's commemorations, told the service:
``This anniversary is a day of shame for the international
community which today tolerates and even supports the abominable
Turkish occupation and military provocations against Cyprus.''
	   Archbishop Chrysostomos led the congregation in a prayer that
referred to the thousands of Greek Cypriots displaced from northern
Cyprus as a result of the invasion.
	   ``Oh Lord, help our refugees to return to their homes and their
churches which have been seized and desecrated by the barbaric
invader. Expel the barbaric invader from our homes,'' the
archbishop said.
	   More than 200,000 Cypriots fled their homes during the 1974
fighting and the following year there was an exchange of refugees
between the two sides of the island.
	   Greek Cypriots planned to stage demonstrations later Monday to
protest the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   This anniversary has taken on a more ominous tone than usual
because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriot missiles, which
are due to arrive later this year. Turkey's threat to prevent their
deployment has brought a warning from Greece, a fellow member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that it would respond to
any attack on Cyprus.
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, justified
the deal in an address to the nation Sunday night, saying the
missiles were required because of ``the ever-threatening presence
of the Turkish occupation troops who are in an attack formation.''
	   He rejected U.S. criticism of the purchase, saying Cyprus would
not accept restrictions on its defense.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island
collapsed in August 1997 after Denktash insisted on the recognition
of his breakaway state and that Cyprus abandon its bid to join the
European Union.

George Bush, Colin Powell vacation in Aegean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Former President George Bush came to relax
in the land of the original white houses: gleaming island villages
overlooking the Aegean Sea.
	   Bush and retired U.S. Gen. Colin Powell and their families are
guests of Greek billionaire Yiannis Latsis aboard his 122-meter
(402-foot) yacht Alexander, newspapers reported Monday.
	   The holiday, which began Saturday, is expected to last until
early August.
	   The Bushes are close friends of the 87-year-old shipping magnate
and often visit Greece as his guest.
	   Shortly after Latsis bids goodbye to Bush and Powell he is
expected to host some more famous vacationers: Prince Charles and
his two sons, Princes William and Harry.

Newcastle chief: Shearer not for sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle will not sell England
captain Alan Shearer _ not even for 25 million pounds (dlrs 41.1
million), officials at the Premier League club said Monday.
	   Shearer has been linked in recent British newspaper reports to
20-million-pound (dlrs 32.8 million) transfer offers from Juventus,
Barcelona and Inter Milan.
	   But Newcastle chief executive Freddie Fletcher said Shearer was
not for sale ``at any price.''
	   ``If anybody did make an offer, they would be wasting their
time,'' he told the Newcastle supporters' hotline. ``Even if
someone offered 25 million (pounds), we would say `no way'.
	   ``We have one of the world's greatest strikers in Alan Shearer
and we are looking forward to the season now that he is back to
full fitness.''
	   Shearer, who led England's World Cup campaign in France, was
expected to return to St James' Park for pre-season training Monday
after a summer holiday.
	   Newcastle manager Kenny Dalglish said the English striker would
be playing for the Magpies when the league season commenced on Aug.

Singapore teen caught by urine detector admits attacking policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore teen-ager pleaded guilty Monday to
injuring a policeman responding to an alarm set off by the boy
urinating in an elevator, state-run television reported.
	   Sim Boon Kwang, 19, admitted to hurting police Cpl. Law Chye
Sing last month when he threw a flower pot at the officer while
trying to escape.
	   Some elevators in public housing estates, where more than 85
percent of Singapore's people live, are equipped with detectors
that automatically immobilize the lift once urine is detected on
the floor.
	   The detectors were installed some years ago when the practice
seemed to be on the rise. Those caught face a fine.
	   Sim was caught in an elevator in his own apartment block in
central Singapore.
	   The subordinate court called for a probation report prior to
deciding his punishment, and his case will be heard again next
month, the report added.
	   The report gave no figures for the number of people caught each
year by the detectors.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment in recession-bound Hong Kong
climbed to a 15-year high of an estimated 4.5 percent in the three
months ended June 30, and was likely to worsen before it gets
better, officials said Monday.
	   The figure was announced as Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
confirmed what most people here have suspected for some time _ that
the economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. That
technically puts Hong Kong in recession.
	   Officials cited continued weakness in the retail, restaurant and
construction sectors for most of the latest job losses. The problem
was worsened by the entry of new graduates in the job market.
	   ``The impact of the Asian financial crisis is much more
widespread and protracted for the whole region than anyone could
have expected,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said.
	   ``A high unemployment rate might remain with us for some time,''
he added. ``Things are likely to get worse before they get
better.''
	   Ian Perkins, chief economist for the General Chamber of
Commerce, said he expects joblessness to ease in the fourth
quarter, when the economies of neighboring countries start to
recover.
	   He said the recent troubles in air cargo shipments may hurt the
job market further. James Tien, the chamber's chairman, had said
some factories have been cutting operating hours and may have to
lay off workers because of a lack of overseas supply of
manufacturing material.
	   The main cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, announced
last week that cargo transport at the new Chek Lap Kok airport,
which opened July 6, will not be up to full speed until the end of
August because of serious computer and mechanical glitches.
	   Tsang said some government measures to boost the economy were
starting to take effect. He said a program to match jobs and the
jobless was steadily showing better results, and that 12 public
works projects would soon create about 1,600 jobs.
	   Perkins said the recently announced freeze in land sales,
expected to bring a budget deficit this year, is hurting the
government's ability to adopt tougher measures to boost the
economy.
	   The government ``is getting pretty restricted in what (it) can
do,'' he said. It ``is in a corner right now.''
	   Tung, speaking as he was touring Hong Kong's new airport, said
the economy shrank again in the second quarter after a 2 percent
fall in the first three months of the year. He did not give a
figure.
	   Tung said results for the July-September period were unlikely to
be good, either.
	   In announcing the new unemployment figure, officials revised
downward the provisional figure for the previous three-month
period, from 4.2 percent to 4.1 percent. The 4.2 percent figure had
been a 15-year high.
	   Both Tung and Tsang continued to express confidence that Hong
Kong would be among the first Asian economies to rebound from the
region's woes.

Albania asks Greece to help with Yugoslav authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Albania asked Greece on Monday to use its
close ties with Yugoslavia to help find a peaceful solution to the
crisis in neighboring Kosovo.
	   The request was made by the Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo during a meeting with his Greek counterpart, Theodoros
Pangalos, who is in Tirana for a two-day visit.
	   ``My Albanian counterpart asked me to use our ties with
Yugoslavia to help find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crises,
and I promised to do that,'' Pangalos told reporters.
	   Pangalos also said he would meet with Kosovo Albanian
representatives in Tirana, but didn't disclose their names.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, many of them using sanctuaries in
northern Albania, are fighting for independence for Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   The conflict has raised tensions between the two Balkan
countries.
	   On Saturday, Yugoslav forces shelled Padesh village on the
Albanian border in an attempt to disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network across the rugged mountain border.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. In a statement, the
Albanian government described the shelling as ``barbarian acts''
and called on foreign powers and organizations to help halt ``this
fascist aggression.''
	   The Yugoslav government countered by sending a note to the
Albanian Embassy in Belgrade protesting the ``series of serious
border incidents,'' which the Yugoslavs said numbered five in the
past two days.
	   ``This points to the fact that Albanian government is tolerating
terrorist activities and grave violations of the state border,
without taking any measures to stop them,'' the protest note said.
	   Greece has maintained good relations with Serb leaders of
Yugoslavia throughout the ethnic conflicts of this decade, in large
part because of their common Orthodox traditions.
	   During the visit, Pangalos is also expected to discuss bilateral
issues such as the legalization of the Albanian immigrants in
Greece and the appointment of three Greek priests in the Albanian
Autosephalos Church.
	   Pangalos also proposed the building of a ``Dalmatian road'' that
would connect the Italian port of Trieste and the Greek port of
Igoumenitsa and would run along the coast line through Croatia,
Yugoslavia and Albania.

Irish police confirm body found off Wales is French yachtsman Eric

Tabarly &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Police said Monday that dental checks
have shown a body retrieved from the sea off Wales is that of
French yachtsman Eric Tabarly, who has been missing since a boat
accident last month.
	   A French trawler, An Yvidig, discovered the body in its nets 30
miles (50 kms) southwest of Milford Haven port on Friday and landed
it later in Dunmore East in southeast Ireland. News reports said
clothing indicated it was 66-yearold Tabarly, but because the body
was badly decomposed, police had to send to France for Tabarly's
dental records before they could make a proper identification.
	   News reports said an inquest will be held later this week.
	   Tabarly, who crisscrossed oceans to win numerous solo titles,
was declared dead June 14 after falling overboard near Milford
Haven.
	   He was knocked into the sea two days earlier while changing the
main sail as his century-old sailboat _ the Pen Duick _ headed
toward Scotland in rough seas. Air and sea searches failed to
locate him.
	   Tabarly shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo
race across the Atlantic and achieved a series of victories in
other lone ocean racing events throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Born
in Nantes, he became a naval officer before making his name as a
yachtsman.
	   Described by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as ``the very
symbol of yachting for the people of France,'' Tabarly is survived
by his wife, Jacqueline, and his 14-year-old daughter, Marie.

Roma leader to demand compensation for Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A Bulgarian Roma leader said Monday
Germany must pay compensation to Bulgarian Gypsies for thousands of
their ancestors whom Nazi soldiers allegedly killed during World
War II.
	   Vasil Danev, head of the Federation of the United Roma
Communities, one of several Roma organizations in Bulgaria, said
Nazis killed up to 3,000 Roma in northeastern Bulgaria, or South
Dobrudzha, between 1939-40 when the territory was part of Romania.
	   Bulgaria had lost the province to neighboring Romania after
World War I in 1919, but got it back in 1940 when it allied with
Germany in World War ll. Romania was also a German ally.
	   Unlike in other countries allied with or invaded by Germany,
Jews and Gypsies were not deported or killed in wartime Bulgaria.
	   Danev said German troops, deployed in Dobrudzha, killed the
Gypsies while the province was under Romanian rule, but didn't
provide any evidence. He said the descendants of the victims now
live in Bulgaria.
	   Danev said his organization would file a formal request for
compensation with the German government this fall, but wouldn't
disclose the amount of money to be demanded.
	   Bulgaria, a Balkan country of 8.2 million, has a 300,000 Gypsy
or Roma minority, which is marginalized by society and plagued by
poverty and unemployment.

South Korea's militant labor group calls another nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hyundai extending shutdown of plants to three
days, labor leaders shaving their heads in protest, grafs 7-8 &QL; 
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Defying a government warning, a
militant labor group said Monday it will call another round of
nationwide strikes this week to protest rising layoffs.
	   The Confederation of Korean Trade Unions said metal workers in
the auto, shipbuilding and other industries will begin an
indefinite strike Wednesday. Telephone, subway and hospital workers
will join the walkout the next day, it said.
	   The government said the walkouts would be illegal. Police armed
with arrest warrants already were seeking 85 labor leaders charged
with instigating illegal strikes earlier this month.
	   ``Our strike this week will continue indefinitely unless the
government accepts our demands,'' said Kim Hyong-man, a spokesman
for the confederation, which claims a membership of 500,000.
	   Among other things, the group wants Hyundai Motor Co. to cancel
its decision to lay off 2,678 workers and put 900 others on unpaid
two-year leave. The company already has laid off 5,000 workers.
	   After negotiations with management broke down, 4,000 Hyundai
workers began pitching tents Monday at their plants in Ulsan, 320
kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Seoul, in preparation for the
strike.
	   Hyundai, the nation's largest automaker, ordered a three-day
shutdown of its plants starting Monday in an effort to ease the
tension, but the union was calling in some of its 26,000 members to
picket the assembly lines.
	   Five Hyundai union leaders shaved their heads in protest.
	   Daewoo Motor Co., the nation's second largest automaker, with
20,000 workers, said it was closing its plants for three days
starting Monday, following its decision to lay off 2,900 workers.
	   Daewoo's labor union said it would join the nationwide strike in
an attempt to halt the layoffs.
	   Government officials are concerned that spreading labor unrest
could chase away badly needed foreign investment _ a key to
reviving South Korea's battered economy.
	   A mass exodus of foreign investors fueled a foreign currency
crisis in South Korea late last year, forcing the country to turn
to the International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have since collapsed.
Government officials said that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and is expected to reach 2 million by
year's end.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

Serb police claim to have retaken central town in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from NATO spokesman, KLA spokesman, Serbs
saying fighters at border included 16 foreigners, Albanians
claiming they control 80 percent of Orahovac. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police claim to have prevailed
in what's believed to be one of the bloodiest clashes yet in four
months of fighting in the separatist province of Kosovo, but
independent reports said the battle for control of a central town
was still raging Monday.
	   Neither Serb authorities nor the ethnic Albanians fighting them
had reliable, updated casualty counts. But figures provided by the
two sides indicated more than 100 people died in fighting in the
town of Orahovac and a series of violent border clashes on Saturday
and Sunday.
	   ``This has been the worst weekend for killing since the start of
the crisis'' in Kosovo, said a NATO official in Brussels on Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted an ``enormous
escalation'' and said NATO was ``deeply worried.''
	   In an interview carried by the German private SAT.1 TV network,
Jakup Krasniqi, a spokesman for the underground Kosovo Liberation
Army, said Sunday it was his army's aim to unite all regions that
have an Albanian majority, including those in Macedonia and
Montenegro, the smaller republic in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of refugees streamed into hills in the Orahovac area
Sunday, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the provincial
capital, Pristina.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center in Pristina said that at
least 20 ethnic Albanian rebel fighters were killed Sunday when a
few hundred tried to cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border northwest
of Djakovica, the scene of an even bigger attempted incursion on
Saturday.
	   The center claimed Monday that 16 foreigners were among the
armed Albanians who clashed with the Yugoslav border guards during
the weekend. It was not clear how many of them were killed or
arrested.
	   According to documents found at the scene, there were five
Albanians from Macedonia, six people from Saudi Arabia and one from
Yemen. Another four were apparently Muslims from Germany.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army now
controls about 30 percent of Kosovo.
	   Both sides claimed Sunday they controlled most of Orahovac.
However, explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout
surrounding hills and several buildings burned intensely. Orahovac,
with a normal population of 20,000, is the largest town yet to be
caught in the conflict.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling.
	   The Serb Media Center said police captured most of the town
early Sunday.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku published in Pristina claimed
Monday that rebel forces controlled 80 percent of Orahovac late
Sunday, quoting its reporter on the scene. There were no new
reports on Orahovac early Monday.

Philippine stocks fall sharply, peso lower on regional weakness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended sharply lower
Monday because of foreign selling prompted by expectations that the
country's economic fundamentals aren't as healthy as proclaimed by
the new government, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar
in step with other regional currencies.
	   ``It's now time for a reality check for investors,'' said Noel
Reyes, vice president for research of Anscor-Hagedorn Securities
Inc. ``They realize that the new administration isn't telling the
entire story. Our budget deficit is growing and the government just
announced that it downgraded its economic growth targets.''
	   The government incurred a budget deficit of 24 billion pesos
(dlrs 585 million) in the first half of 1998. The government also
said over the weekend it has lowered its growth targets and raised
its inflation estimates this year because of the impact of the
Asian financial crisis and a drought attributed to the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.81 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,734.45, after slipping 9.74 points, or 0.5
percent, on Friday.
	   Decliners outpaced advancers 64 to 19, while 39 issues were
unchanged.
	   President Joseph Estrada is scheduled to deliver his first state
of the nation address later this month and his deputies have said
he will describe the true state of the economy.
	   Traders said investors, fearful of more bad news, have sold down
Manila shares ahead of Estrada's address.
	   The onset of the earnings report season also has investors
worried, traders said.
	   Shares of oil refiner Petron Corp. fell 4.9 percent following
the release of flat first-half earnings early Monday. Also dragging
down Petron shares was the state-owned Philippine National Oil
Co.'s recent announcement that it may sell part of its remaining 40
percent stake in Petron.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.718 pesos for the
day, up from 41.392 pesos on Friday.
	   With the dollar last traded at 41.840 pesos, close to its high
of the session, the U.S. currency is expected to test the sensitive
level of 42 pesos in early transactions Tuesday. However, a dealer
noted that there is relatively stiff resistance for the dollar to
break this level.
	   Dealers said that with Tokyo closed for a holiday Monday,
attention focused on other key Asian currencies such as the Thai
baht and the Singapore dollar.
	   The Philippine peso tends to shadow movements of the Thai baht,
dealers said.
	   Regional currency markets are also awaiting the announcement of
who will be Japan's next prime minister to see if the winner is
someone who will push for economic reforms to revive the Japanese
economy.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned last week
after his party lost in an upper house parliamentary election.

Georgian president offers deal to separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
said Monday that the breakaway province of Abkhazia might be
allowed to patrol its Black Sea coast if it stops opposing the
return of ethnic Georgian refugees.
	   Last week, Georgia began taking over sea patrols from the
Russian border guards who have been protecting Georgia's Black Sea
coast since 1994, including the stretch claimed by Abkhazia.
	   Abkhazian separatists, who drove out the Georgian government
troops in the 1992-93 war, strongly oppose the move and said they
would patrol the border themselves. They fear that the guard
changeover would help the Georgian government strengthen its
control over the rebel province and tighten a trade embargo.
	   Shevardnadze, speaking in a regular radio address on Monday,
said that Georgia would take over border patrols as planned but
indicated there was a room for compromise to take into account
Abkhazian demands.
	   ``Of course, there are some differences and contradictions,'' he
said. ``But this problem can be solved.''
	   Shevardnadze said he recently had sent Georgia's border guards
chief Valery Chkheidze to Abkhazia to ``search for reasonable
compromises ... on the basis of reciprocal concessions.''
	   ``I mean, first of all, the process of refugees' return,'' he
said.
	   The war has turned some 300,000 ethnic Georgians into refugees
and Abkhazians have balked at letting them back.
	   Only about 30,000 had returned home before an outbreak of
fighting in May that forced many to flee again.
	   Georgia's government has accused Russia, which has deployed its
peacekeepers in the region, of failing to help the refugees'
return.

Ukraine's foreign minister praises his country's relations with
</HEADLINE>
U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - This week's visit from U.S. President Al
Gore is a sign that Ukraine has achieved a ``strategic
partnership'' with the United States, Foreign Minister Borys
Tarasyuk said Monday.
	   Gore arrives Wednesday to discuss trade and economic cooperation
at a meeting of the U.S.-Ukraine commission, which he co-chairs
with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
	   The commission will address a number of problems that hamper
trade between the two countries, including stalled economic reforms
and pervasive corruption.
	   Gore is also to visit the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and
discuss a new international effort to raise hundreds of millions of
dollars to repair the sarcophagus, a hastily built structure over
Chernobyl's reactor No. 4, which exploded in 1986.
	   Tarasyuk praised the United States for being ``the first to
understand the importance of Ukraine'' after the Soviet collapse as
a ``link between north and south, west and east of Europe.''
	   Ukraine is the third-largest recipient of American financial
aid, receiving dlrs 225 million in 1998.
	   Tarasyuk acknowledged that many Ukrainian laws cause U.S. and
other foreign companies to ``feel uncomfortable'' in Ukraine.
Investors have complained about the complexity and random nature of
Ukrainian regulations.
	   These problems, together with the lack of reforms, have keep
foreign investment in Ukraine to dlrs 2.1 billion since 1991, far
less than some other nations in Eastern Europe.
	   Washington has been unhappy with the pace of economic reform in
Ukraine recently, and had even threatened to withhold part of its
assistance if the government fails to speed up reforms.
	   But the dlrs 90 million in aid was spared after Ukraine moved
actively to resolve complaints by U.S. investors and approved
measures to combat corruption and excessive bureaucracy.

Forest fire in Spain stretches across 25 kilometers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain, (AP) _ Up to 1,000 firefighters battled a
blaze Monday that has charred 7,500 hectares (20,000 acres) of
forest and scrubland in northeastern Spain, forcing the evacuation
of hundreds of people from holiday areas.
	   Two blazes that broke out over the weekend in the province of
Barcelona have now burned themselves into a single fire stretching
across a 25-kilometer (15-mile) front in the Sierra de Pinos area
west of Barcelona city, a spokeswoman for Catalonia's regional
government said.
	   No one has been injured, although the flames forced the
evacuation of dozens of people from a camping site, several country
houses and a holiday resort complex where 300 children had been
staying.
	   On Sunday, a pilot and a passenger were killed when their
helicopter crashed while taking part in efforts to extinguish a
separate fire in northeastern Spain.
	   Daily temperatures of up to 37 Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) were
making it easier for the fires to spread, authorities said Monday.

Off-beat show gets Lithuanians talking: What is fashion?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LIUDAS DAPKUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Evening dresses made from the inner
tubes of car tires, transparent suits constructed from fishing nets
and other impossible-to-wear clothes were highlights of an
alternative fashion festival that amused spectators and
participants alike.
	   ``I am amazed by the idea these guys can create models from any
material, even that found in the rubbish dump,'' said Jurga
Savickaite, a student at Vilnius Art Academy.
	   London designer Burnel Penthaul, costumed and performing as an
outsized creature that looked like a woman and sang like a man,
acknowledged such designs aren't likely to be worn by many people.
	   ``I do not create for money,'' he said. ``Everything I do is for
my satisfaction.''
	   The show, called Armada '98, took place last weekend in the
capital of this eastern European country on the Baltic Sea. ``Ar''
in Lithuanian translates roughly as ``is it,'' and ``mada'' means
``fashion.''
	   Held in the open-air courtyard of an abandoned yet all the same
romantic neighborhood, the fourth annual show attracted more than a
dozen designers and about 3,000 spectators.
	   The models' runway stretched between two derelict buildings
dating to the last century whose empty windows seemed to stare back
at the crowd.
	   During the decades that Lithuania was a Soviet republic,
dressing sharp was seen as decadent and ideologically suspect, and
racks in stores were full of ill-fitting and badly-made clothes.
	   Now Lithuanians are heartened to find that at least some
cutting-edge designs are available to most anyone.
	   Designer Andrew Logan, also from Great Britain, said, ``I am
here because I like extraordinary ideas.... ``For me, what I do is
more than fashion. It is the way to express the way I see the
world.''

World Bank to decide on dlrs 1.5 billion loan to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The World Bank will decide early next month
whether to release a dlrs 1.5 billion economic restructuring loan
to Russia, officials said Monday.
	   The decision will be strongly influenced by the International
Monetary Fund, which is considering that largest part of a dlrs 17
billion loan package to the country, the World Bank's Moscow
representative Michael Carter was quoted as saying by Interfax news
agency.
	   The IMF board was meeting Monday in Washington. Russia's chief
negotiator with the fund, Anatoly Chubais, said the chances for
loan approval were ``80 to 20.''
	   The World Bank's economic restructuring loans are conditional on
reforms in various sectors of the economy, but the funds are
distributed directly to the Russian Finance Ministry.
	   If the loan is approved, Russia will receive dlrs 800 of the
money this year, and the rest in 1999.
	   World Bank board hearing is scheduled for early August, and the
exact date will be announced next week, the official said.

 &UR; Palestinians pessimistic on talks; security tight after failed
attack &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Palestinian, Israeli comment, changes
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reported no
progress Monday in talks meant to jump-start the stalled peace
process, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted an
accord was within reach.
	   Meanwhile, police stepped up security in Israeli cities in the
wake of what they said was a failed car bombing on Sunday in
Jerusalem. Police and soldiers with bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled
crowded streets and markets.
	   A Palestinian man, described by Israeli police as an activist
with the radical group Hamas, remained hospitalized Monday with
severe burns suffered a day earlier when a fire broke out inside
the rental van he was driving.
	   Police discovered the van was full of flammable materials and
bags of nails, and said the man had been trying to carry out a
bombing in Jerusalem's center.
	   Israeli media on Monday portrayed the episode as a narrow escape
from the kind of carnage caused by a pair of suicide bombings in
central Jerusalem last summer. ``Miracle in Jerusalem,'' said one
headline.
	   The incident created a tense backdrop for Sunday night's talks
between Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Arafat's aide
Mahmoud Abbas. Senior aides to the two men were to hold another
session Monday afternoon.
	   Arriving Monday in the Gaza Strip, Arafat was asked if there had
been progress. ``Nothing,'' he replied.
	   Netanyahu, however, said an accord on an American initiative for
an Israeli pullback from parts of the West Bank was possible.
	   ``We are working together as a team in order to achieve a
settlement. As for the Palestinians, we will know in the next few
days _ very soon _ if indeed they have received a similar
mandate,'' he said. ``If so, it will be brought to a conclusion.''
	   After Sunday's talks, an aide to Mordechai said both U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross and Netanyahu had been briefed by phone
immediately.
	   The meeting came at the urging of the United States. It had
called on the two sides to negotiate face-to-face after its efforts
failed to resolve differences over a U.S. proposal calling for
Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat accepted the plan but Netanyahu has balked, citing
security concerns. After the meeting, Palestinian security chief
Mohammed Dahlan complained that Israeli negotiators had refused to
even discuss the U.S. pullout plan.
	   ``Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S. initiative, the
Israelis would say `not yet,''' Dahlan told The Associated Press.
	   Israel radio reported that the Palestinians had been given a
detailed report by Israel on changes they want to make in the U.S.
initiative, including further amendments to the Palestinian
covenent.
	   Palestinians say they have already deleted clauses in the
document calling for the destruction of Israel, but Israel is
pressing for further steps to ratify the changes.

Arsenal to play Champions League games at Wembley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League and FA Cup champion Arsenal will
play its European Champions League matches at Wembley stadium this
season.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, on Monday cleared the
Gunners to switch their Champions League games from Highbury to
Wembley, potentially doubling the crowd capacity to 70,000.
	   UEFA spokesman Frits Ahlstrom said he supported the move because
it meant more genuine fans would be able to watch Arsenal play in
the European tournament.
	   ``It's a sensible option to use a larger venue,'' he said.
	   The move is expected to be ratified by England's Football
Association.
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he was happy to play at
Wembley because the extra support would give his team a huge lift.
	   Wenger told the Evening Standard newspaper that a big pitch like
Wembley suited his team and his tactics better than the tighter
confines at Highbury.

Angolan officials, aid workers flee to Zambia, paper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ At least 138 Angolan government officials
have fled border towns into Zambia amid attacks by UNITA fighters,
a Zambian government newspaper reported Monday.
	   Thirteen U.N. officials and an unspecified number of aid workers
from the Lutheran Federation for World Peace fled to the Zambian
town of Kalabo and traveled on to Zambia's capital Lusaka in recent
days, The Times of Zambia reported.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo has accused UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ of renewed breaches of a peace accord signed four years ago. The
Angolan government says more than 200 civilians and government
soldiers have been killed in attacks over the past two months that
have forced 15,000 refugees to flee to neighboring countries.
	   Another 60,000 people have been displaced inside Angola in the
same period, officials say.
	   The Times of Zambia said the Angolan officials had fled the
Mushiku and Kwanda Kubanga provinces bordering Zambia and were
flown back to the Angolan town of Luena from Mongu in western
Zambia.
	   The paper said Angolan villagers were also trekking across the
border to seek refuge. The size of the influx was unclear.
	   Under the peace deal that ended a two-decade civil war in the
former Portuguese colony, UNITA was to have disarmed and formed
itself into a political opposition party.

Top German court rules leading ex-communist was Stasi spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A leader of the former East German
communists lost his bid Monday to quash a parliamentary report that
found he spied for East Germany's dreaded Stasi secret police in
the 1970s and '80s.
	   Germany's highest court upheld key conclusions of parliament's
inquiry into the past of Gregor Gysi, who now is parliamentary
leader for the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to
East Germany's communists.
	   The panel's report, issued in May after a three-year probe,
found Gysi informed on dissidents he represented as a lawyer in
former East Berlin from 1975 until at least 1986.
	   Gysi, who argues the inquiry was a political witchhunt and
ignored exonerating evidence, denied the allegations in court
testimony. His lawsuit sought to block parliamentary debate and
official publication of the report.
	   Although the Federal Constitutional Court upheld the report's
key findings, four of the eight justices said its assertion that
Gysi helped the Stasi because he wanted to suppress democratic
dissent in East Germany went too far.
	   But under court rules, plaintiffs win only if a majority of the
judges backs their case.
	   Gysi claimed a partial success, saying the dissenting judges
backed his argument that the probe was politically motivated.
	   He told reporters the court had not ruled on the substance of
the Stasi allegations and that he would seek new legal steps to
clear his name.
	   But the chairman of the parliamentary probe, Dieter
Wiefelspuetz, said the court had found the major allegations
against Gysi ``unobjectionable.''
	   Monday's ruling could open the way for parliament to lift Gysi's
immunity from prosecution if prosecutors decide there is enough
evidence to open a criminal probe.
	   Lawmakers from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party and the opposition
Social Democrats have called on Gysi to give up his legislative
seat.
	   But Gysi's party rallied behind him. ``We're raising our heads,
not our hands,'' party chairman Lothar Bisky said.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Soldiers of the Taliban religious army
shut down offices of international aid organizations Monday and
ordered foreign workers to relocate to a complex of abandoned
dormitories or leave the capital.
	   ``If they don't move, and we see them on the streets in Kabul
tomorrow (Tuesday) we will take action under our laws,'' Mohammed
Nabi Majrooh, deputy head of Taliban security, told The Associated
Press. ``The deadline passed on Sunday, but we gave them another 24
hours.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Taliban ordered the aid groups to move to
dormitories once used by students of the city's technical schools.
The war-battered buildings have been empty since 1992, when Islamic
insurgents swept Afghanistan's communists from power.
	   Aid workers say they can't afford to refurbish the dormitories
and fear they would be more vulnerable to attacks and kidnappings
there.
	   While the United Nations and the International Red Cross have
been exempted from the relocation order, the United Nations objects
to it and has sent a letter to Taliban leaders asking them to
reconsider their ultimatum.
	   The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, has recommended that aid agencies receiving EU aid pull out
of Kabul rather than accept the Taliban demand.
	   The exact number of international aid workers still in Kabul was
not known.
	   A mass exodus of international aid organizations from Kabul
could have a devastating effect on the estimated 750,000 people
still living in the city. The groups provide subsidized food,
medicines and clothes and are repairing neighborhoods heavily
damaged by 20 years of civil war.
	   Relations between international aid agencies and the Taliban
have been strained since the movement began imposing laws based on
its radical brand of Islam.
	   In Brussels on Monday, the European Union announced it would
freeze new funding for humanitarian aid projects in Kabul because
of the Taliban's treatment of women. Within days of taking control
of Kabul in 1996, the Taliban closed schools for girls and forced
women to stop working outside the home, making it difficult for aid
agencies to help Afghan women and for female aid workers to
operate.
	   The suspension to the capital covers some dlrs 4 million, or 40
percent of all aid that the EU had earmarked for Afghanistan over
the next 12 months.
	   ``There is a sort of sexual apartheid. Women are being
discriminated against. It violates all sorts of principles, in
particular the rules on humanitarian aid,'' said Pietro Petrucci,
an EU spokesman.
	   Petrucci told reporters the EU would seek talks with the Taliban
to improve the situation.
	   ``We hope the temporary suspension will be brief,'' Petrucci
said.
	   He added conditions for aid workers outside the capital were
slightly better and aid to the rest of Afghanistan would not be
blocked. Most of the EU funding for Kabul goes on sanitation,
health and food aid projects.
	   The Taliban rule in roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan, while the
opposition controls the remaining 15 percent, much of it in
northern Afghanistan. Lawlessness in opposition-held areas has made
it virtually impossible for aid organizations to operate there.

Seek renewal _ and avoid splits _ Archbishop of Canterbury tells
</HEADLINE>
Lambeth Conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP ) _ The Archbishop of Canterbury on
Monday urged the Anglican Communion to seek renewal at its
once-a-decade Lambeth Conference, avoiding division over issues
such as the ordination of women and the place of homosexuals.
	   But speaking on the first day of conference business, Archbishop
George Carey referred only obliquely to vociferous calls for the
church to liberalize its stance on homosexuality.
	   Later Monday, bishops attending the conference were to split
into groups to discuss several themes, including one titled ``Being
Fully Human.''
	   ``This section will have a particularly busy time with so many
controversial issues: the environment, freedom and international
debt _ to say nothing of human sexuality!'' said Carey.
	   He urged the more than 700 bishops to make the conference ``a
place of transformation and of renewed vision.''
	   ``In a world where so many people talk in extreme terms, and
claim that their perception of the truth is the only one that
counts, let us remember that we have always been a communion where
diversity and difference has been cherished and, indeed,
celebrated.''
	   On Sunday, Carey reiterated the church's position that sexual
activity should occur only in marriage and all others should remain
celibate. The church will accept celibate homosexuals within its
ranks but will not permit the ordination of sexually active gays
and lesbians, he said.
	   A coalition of conservative bishops at the conference is pushing
for the adoption of a specific statement barring the ordination of
non-celibate homosexuals or the blessing of gay marriages.
	   But more liberal bishops want the issue referred to an inquiry
similar to that which studied the issue of women's ordination. The
Church of England ordained its first women priests in 1994.
	   That remains a sore issue among Anglicans. Some conservative
bishops are refusing to attend study groups with some of the 11
women bishops at the conference.
	   The Lambeth Conference, the main forum for consultation among
Anglicans, continues through Aug. 8. It can adopt resolutions but
has no authority to impose its will on the national churches.
	   Other business this time includes Third World wars and debt. For
the first time, this conference will devote a session to debating
its relations with Islam, Carey said.

Russia sells three military helicopters to Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has delivered three Mi-35 helicopter
gunships to Sri Lanka and helped train the ground personnel to
maintain them, a news agency reported on Monday.
	   The three choppers were supplied under a contract signed in
March, which also provided for the delivery of spares and personnel
training, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Mi-35 is an export version of the Mi-24 Hind gunship which
remains a mainstay of the Russian Air Force. Sri Lankan military
have earlier bought several second-hand Mi-24s from the former
Soviet republic of Kazakstan but had trouble getting spares for
them and had to address Russia.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built on
a sand spit. It no longer exists. The huge wave that wiped it off
the face of the earth killed at least 700 people on a South Sea
island. One official said 3,000 people were dead.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said Lusien
Romme, one of the 2,000 people who used to live in Arop. He said he
saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me.''
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the 23-foot
(7-meter) wave hurled him into a coconut tree and then into the
Sissano lagoon. His wife was killed.
	   The wall of water, propelled by a magnitude-7 undersea
earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday
night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea,
a nation on the island of New Guinea, where some live a near-Stone
Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The official death toll from Friday's disaster was at least 700,
mostly children and the elderly. But John Tekwi, governor of West
Sepik Province, where the wave hit, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. Monday as saying at least 3,000 people had died.
	   ``Where is everybody else?'' Tekwi asked.
	   Col. Richard Humby, assistant defense attache at the Australian
High Commission in Port Moresby, said latest figures indicated more
than 1,000 villagers had died and at least 2,000 others were
missing.
	   Hundreds of people were injured and were awaiting urgent medical
help, while others were believed to have fled to higher ground in
the interior. An estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all,'' said Australian Defense Department
spokesman Col. Keith Jobson in Canberra.
	   Jobson said the primary concern was to treat the injured and
provide them with food, water and shelter.
	   About 1,000 bodies had been buried and at least 3,000 people
were still missing, Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary who
is coordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press.
	   ``You can smell the stench, you can smell the death in the
air,'' he said.
	   Missionaries and villagers were burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches. Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets
to try to reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' said fisherman Jerry Apuan. ``I was
afraid. It was the first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, about 60 miles
(96 kilometers) west of the area wiped out by the tsunami, said
villagers had told him giant salt-water crocodiles that live along
the coast were feeding on the corpses.
	   Vanimo is the main administrative center of Papua New Guinea,
located close to the border of the Indonesian province of Irian
Jaya.
	   Many people who had fled the wave were emerging from the jungle
in a daze, said an Associated Press photographer in the ruined
village of Sissano.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 cargo planes
arrived at Vanimo Monday with emergency supplies including a field
hospital and 100 doctors, nurses and engineers. New Zealand was
sending relief supplies and a medical team.
	   The combined population of the affected district is not
precisely known, but government chief secretary Robert Igara
estimated it at between 6,000 and 10,000.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remoteness of the
region. Australian cargo planes had to fly 2,350 (3,780 kilometers)
miles to the disaster scene.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (600
kilometers) northeast of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said the villages of
Nimas and Warapu also had been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were badly
damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area consists of jungle and swamps where tribes rely on
subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of jungle
materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Japanese agency lowers Ukraine's credit rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Japanese agency has lowered Ukraine's
credit rating from BB+ to BB-, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry said
Monday.
	   The move by Japan Rating and Investment Information was in
response to the broader crisis in developing markets, along with
the election of a largely leftist parliament in Ukraine last March
and the suspension of International Monetary Fund credits, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Last week, the U.S. rating agency Moody's announced tentative
plans to lower its B2 credit rating for Ukraine, saying its outlook
for the country's rating has changed from ``stable'' to
``negative.''
	   Moody's said Ukraine might run out of reserves unless the IMF
comes to its aid, adding that presidential elections next year may
prolong what it called the republic's political paralysis.
	   Ratings assigned by international bond rating agencies
characterize a country's financial credibility and largely
determine the interest rate at which this country can borrow from
foreign lenders.

Potential German cultural affairs chief against Holocaust Memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A publisher designated to be the top man
on cultural affairs if opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder
unseats Chancellor Helmut Kohl in September spoke out Monday
against the planned national Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.
	   ``I fear that a nation that displays the biggest crime of its
history as an elegant, chic statue will sometime have to be accused
of shamelessness,'' Michael Naumann told Die Woche newspaper.
	   He said it was much more important to take care of the crumbling
former camps and their museums, where the horrors of the Holocaust
are more directly preserved.
	   Naumann, currently chief of Metropolitan Books-Henry Holt Inc.
in New York, was named by Schroeder over the weekend to be his
cultural affairs adviser if his Social Democrats win the Sept. 27
parliamentary election.
	   He would coordinate the 1.3 billion marks (720 million) that the
federal government spends annually on culture, including memorials.
	   Germany's national Holocaust Memorial has been controversial
since the project started more than a decade ago, with politicians
and intellectuals arguing over its design, location and purpose.
	   Germany's best-known living author, Guenther Grass, is among
those who want the project scrapped, arguing that an atrocity such
as the Holocaust cannot be remembered in a single monument.
	   Kohl rejected the winner of the first design competition in
1995, but has said he remains committed to the project, which
backers hope to build in 1999 with federal, city and private funds.
	   Announcement of the new design was expected at the end of March,
but was delayed so Kohl could consult with the artists.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 students from western New
Guinea staged a peaceful protest outside a United Nations building
Monday, urging the world body to support their demand for
independence from Indonesia.
	   The peaceful protest in the Indonesian capital followed a series
of violent demonstrations in the territory, known as Irian Jaya,
about 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Meanwhile, in Irian Jaya's capital, Jayapura, security personnel
were mobilized Monday as a precaution against possible unrest
following the death in a hospital of a university student shot
during a July 3 protest.
	   Steven Suripaty, a 22-year-old law student of the University of
Cenderwasih, died Sunday night after being in a coma for 16 days,
the official Antara news agency said.
	   A policeman and another student also died in last month's
unrest. During one protest, police opened fire when a crowd raised
a rebel flag of the outlawed Free West Papua independence movement.
	   Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonizers in
1963.
	   Indonesian sovereignty was formalized in 1969 after a
U.N.-supervised ballot there favored incorporation with the rest of
Indonesia, itself a former Dutch colony.
	   Despite this, small bands of guerrillas have fought a low-key
war against Indonesian troops over the decades.
	   Calls for independence have grown in recent weeks following the
resignation in May of autocratic ex-President Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has relaxed controls
against protests as part of a wide-ranging reform agenda.
	   Monday's protesters complained that the 1969 U.N. vote had been
flawed and said most indigenous people in the province want
independence.
	   ``We have suffered for too long. We want our freedom or, at
least, a new referendum,'' said protester Ronalda Upuya.
	   A small delegation of protesters briefly met U.N. officials.
	   The protest coincided with a visit to Indonesia by Jamsheed
Marker, a special U.N. envoy for East Timor, where separatists are
also demanding independence from Indonesia.
	   Habibie has said that he is willing to grant a measure of
autonomy to East Timor, but not outright independence.
Nevertheless, the United Nations is hopeful a peaceful settlement
can be reached for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded
by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Irian Jaya is Indonesia's largest and least developed province.
Much of it consists of rugged mountains or thick jungle. It has
large mineral deposits and other natural resources.
	   About 90 percent of its 1.5 million people are indigenous
Melanesians.
	   The other 10 percent are largely made up of settlers from other
parts of Indonesia. The presence of the economically more
successfully outsiders has been the source of friction there.

Portugal biggest fish-eater in EU, Austria smallest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The average European Union resident
eats 22 kilograms (48.4 pounds) of fish a year, roughly the same
amount as in the United States, the EU's statistics agency reported
Monday.
	   Topping the scale are the Portuguese, who eat on average 57
kilosgrams (125.4 pounds) of fish a year, and the Spaniards, who
stand at an average 39 kilograms (85.8 pounds) a year, Eurostat
said.
	   The lowest averages can be found in landlocked Austria, with 10
kilograms (22 pounds) a year, followed by Germany and the
Netherlands, with 12 kilograms (26.4 pounds).
	   But Eurostat notes that the EU ``pales in comparison'' to the
Japanese who consume 68 kilograms (150 pounds) each a year or with
Icelanders, who eat on average 93 kilograms (205 pounds) of fish a
year.
	   Denmark is the largest producer of fish and fish products in the
EU, producing over two million tons in 1995. This represents 25
percent of the EU total.
	   Eurostat gives the following average annual figures for fish
consumption in the other EU countries, in kilograms (pounds):
	   Belgium, 18 (40); Luxembourg, 18 (40); Denmark, 20 (44); Greece,
24 (53); France, 27 (59); Ireland, 21 (46); Finland, 33 (73);
Sweden, 27, (59); Britain, 18 (40).
	   World production of fish and fish products stood at 112.3
million tons in 1995. Between 1970 and 1995, world production rose
by 73 percent.
