<HEADLINE> TV Series Being Produced for Moral Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A 100-episode TV series will
be promoted in primary and middle schools across China to be used
as supplementary material for moral education.
</P>
<P>
"Souls of the Chinese Nation," co-produced by the State
Education Commission (SEC) and the Zhujiang Film Studio from south
China's Guangdong Province, is scheduled to finish production by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale TV series tells the stories of 100 significant
figures, events and achievements in China's 5,000-year history.
</P>
<P>
Included in the series are shows about the philosopher
Confucius, whose thoughts have greatly influenced China's
politics, ideas, culture and education for more than 2,000 years,
the Silk Road, which illustrates ancient China's exchanges with
other countries, China's territories, the Communist Party of
China, cooperation between the CPC and Kuomintang, the Long March,
Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, as well as Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The show's producers are from six Chinese film studios,
including the Zhujiang Film Studio. Social science scholars and
experts served as scriptwriters and advisors.
</P>
<P>
Following two years of planning and production, 30 episodes
have been finished, at a cost nearly four million yuan (about
482,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, vice-minister of the SEC, said that the period when a
child is in primary and middle school is the prime time for
providing education about moral issues and standards.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that movies and TV films exert great influence on
children, and that good movies and TV shows can be used to provide
moral education at school.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jingyan, deputy general manager of Zhujiang Film Studio
Co., said he hoped that the series could give a general idea of
the motherland to compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, which
will return to the motherland in 1997 and 1999, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the TV series will be reproduced on
videocassette, video CD (VCD) and laser disc (LD) after the
production is completely finished.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bourse to Adopt Over-The-Counter Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- On October 1, the Shanghai
Security Exchange, one of China's two bourses, will officially
adopt over-the-counter bidding, to be used in conjunction with the
existing on-floor bidding, according to sources at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Since the security market opened six years ago, on-floor
bidding has been the only method for exchange, which now has over
5,100 seats.
</P>
<P>
From now on, over-the-counter investors can trade stocks
through the computer networks at home.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the exchange said that the move is to improve the
trading at the bourse in line with international practice and the
country's situation. This should help lower the operating cost for
its members and further improve the performance of the market.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has conducted experiments on the over-the-counter
trading system at the Jiangsu Security Company.

<HEADLINE> Germans Keen on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Politicians and businessmen
from the German port of Hamburg today said businessmen should
develop a positive outlook of Africa, saying the continent is no
longer the stereotyped land of famine, wars and disasters.
</P>
<P>
In speeches to mark the opening of the Zimbabwe-Hamburg trade
and investment conference, the Germans said there are indications
the continent is on the path to economic and political stability
and it deserves attention from German investors, a report
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
''The world is full of African pessimism, but we know of
another Africa of progress,'' said Nikolaus Schues, President of
the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said African economies are in many respects better than
what is portrayed in the international press.
</P>
<P>
He cited the World Bank projected average economic growth rate
of four percent in Africa and of Zimbabwe's recovery from a
decline in gdp of three percent in 1995 to seven percent this
year as signs of African progress.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe told German businessmen that
Zimbabwe's rich agricultural and mineral resources offer vast
opportunities for investment. Zimbabwe has introduced various
incentives that make the southern African nation an attractive
and safe investment destination.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe told the over 300 German and Zimbabwean
businessmen that Zimbabwe, like the rest of the continent, also
had problems such as droughts which have at times forced the
government to spend more money on feeding the people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Weapons, Terrorism Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today said that the U.S. has six priority goals to further
lift the threat of weapons of mass destruction and limit their
dangerous spread.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second day of the general debate of the 51st
session of the U.N. General Assembly, Clinton also vowed to fight
against terrorism with zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The six priority goals to control weapons of mass destruction
are as following:
</P>
<P>
-- protecting people from chemical attack and making it harder
for rogue states and terrorists to brandish poison gas by bringing
the Chemical Weapons Convention into force as soon as possible;
</P>
<P>
-- reducing the risk that an outlaw state or organization could
build a nuclear device by negotiating a treaty to freeze the
production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons;
</P>
<P>
-- continuing to reduce nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and
Russia;
</P>
<P>
-- reinforcing efforts against the spread of nuclear weapons by
strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;
</P>
<P>
-- protecting people from those who would use disease as a
weapon of war by giving the Biological Weapons Convention the
means to strengthen compliance; and
</P>
<P>
-- ending the carnage caused by anti-personnel landmines -- the
hidden killers that murder and maim more than 25,000 people every
year.
</P>
<P>
On fighting terrorists, he said that the U.S. is pursuing a
three-part strategy: abroad, working more closely than ever with
like-minded nations; at home, giving its law enforcement the
toughest counter-terrorism tools available; and working to make
the airports and airplanes safer.

<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Violent offenses in England
and Wales went up by 10 percent in the year to June, the largest
rise in eight years, according to figures released by the Home
Office today.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime, such as assault, mugging and rape, increased
although crimes against property, particularly burglary and car
theft, which accounted for 93 percent of the total, fell for the
third year running, by 0.3 percent to 4.7 million, the Home Office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The total number of recorded crimes for the year, standing at
5.1 million, rose for the first time in three years by 0.4 percent
in the 12 months to the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The figures brought to an end three years of falling crime.
Recorded incidents decreased by 5 percent in England and Wales in
the 12 months to June 1995, 5.5 percent in 1994 and 1 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The increase was a setback for the government just before the
Conservative Party's annual conference next month and a personal
humiliation for Michael Howard, the home secretary.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Latvian defense minister
Andrejs Krastins reportedly said the three Baltic countries --
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- would welcome the U.S.-proposed
"Baltic Action Plan" if it helps them gain NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Krastins made the remarks, as reported by the local newspaper
Helsinki Sanomat today, during an interview with the daily paper
in Copenhagen Wednesday where he was attending a meeting on the
Baltic security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian defense chief said the plan is understandable if it
aims only at countries that will be intergrated into NATO in the
future, it is negotiable when it covers Russia, a nation regarded
by the Baltics as a threat, not a partner.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Finnish defense minister Anneli Taina described
last week the U.S. action plan as a good form of cooperation
worthy of further efforts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Krastins was cautious about the establishment of
peaceful partnership ties in northern Europe among Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Denmark, plus three Baltic countries, as
proposed by the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
He noted these nations still hold different opinions on the
matter.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The British Royal Navy
ship HMS Edingurgh will dock in Kuwait Wednesday to lead the Gulf
Armilla patrol in the Gulf which the British navy maintains in
the region, a press release of the British Embassy said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the destroyer's arrival is a "further symbol of
Britain's continued commitment to Kuwait and to the security of
the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
The ship which is equipped with Sea Dart missiles and Sea
Skua anti-ship missiles mounted on the on-board helicopters
arrives in coincidence with the tense situation in the Gulf
Region following the U.S. strikes against Iraq and military
build-up in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Britain was one of the Western states involved in the Desert
Strom operation carried out by the allied forces led by the
U.S. in 1991 to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi seven-month
occupation.
</P>
<P>
It is also the only Western country that supports the
U.S. activities against Iraq in the current Gulf disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has deployed in Kuwait eight stealth F-117a fighters
and eight Patriot missiles launchers and sent 3,500 troops to
join the 1200 troops already in the country to round out a
mechanized brigade with 120 Abrams main battle tanks and 60
Bradley fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy statement said Edinburgh is scheduled to
stay here for three days. But it did not disclose the next
destination of the ship.

The Swedish Prime Minister will fly today to New York. He will

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Pledge Tough Measures to Rescue Beef Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
agriculture ministers promised to take emergency measures to
rescue their beef market, but they made no progress on how to deal
with Britain's suspension of a planned cattle slaughter program.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued today at the end of a three-day informal
meeting of EU agriculture ministers in the southern Irish town of
Killarney, said, "We recognize the extreme urgency of providing
sufficient intervention possibilities to avoid dislocation of the
beef market."
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers in the statement instructed a committee of
experts meeting early next month to prepare a text to ensure
adequate EU intervention in the beef market and supported a plan
to advance aid payments to beef producers in 1997 to the current
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU ministers failed to reach agreement on how to
tackle the thorny issue of Britain's decision to suspend the
planned cattle slaughter, according to reports from Killarney,
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The British government last Wednesday decided to put on hold
the slaughter of the 147,000 cattle most at risk of BSE in view of
the so-called new scientific findings that suggest the mad cow
disease would be over by the year 2001 without the planned massive
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler told a press
conference this afternoon that a ban on British beef exports would
not be lifted until the British government fully implemented its
agreement with its EU partners.
</P>
<P>
Fischler promised that he was prepared to study Britain's new
evidence on the mad cow disease, but he said that it was no excuse
for Britain to halt the planned slaughter program.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner also announced plans to buy into storage
around another 100,000 tons of beef in an effort to rescue the
depressed beef market.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Irish farmers demonstrated outside the conference
center and several hundred protesters broke through police cordons
when they realized that the three-day meeting made no major
breakthrough to resolve the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef products exports
on March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between the mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Leader on Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Newly appointed provisional
president of the Congress party Sitaram Kesri said today that his
top priority was to bring unity to the Congress party and make it
strong.
</P>
<P>
Kesri was chosen the chief of the Congress late last night by
the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making
body of the party, to replace P.V. Narasimha Rao who resigned on
September 21 following a Delhi court order summoning him to appear
in person before the court on September 30. Rao was involved in
the Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kesri, who formally took over the reins of the Congress,
however, qualified his statement saying that while he welcomed
those former congressmen whose entry would strengthen the party,
"we will have to think about re-admitting those elements who could
prove detrimental to unity."
</P>
<P>
He virtually ruled out departure from the policies pursued by
his predecessor P.V. Narasimha Rao. He said, "it will be improper
to adopt a different approach from the one followed by Rao."

<HEADLINE> China Among 1st to Sign Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China was among the
first countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
at the United Nations headquarters this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen,
representing China, signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Also among the first group to sign the treaty were the United
States, France, Russia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a key note
speech before the signing of the treaty that it was "a major
milestone" that has been reached on the road to making the world a
safer and more secure place for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the occasion, the Chinese government declared
that China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and the realization of a
nuclear-weapon-free world.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it is in favor of a comprehensive ban
on nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards this
objective. The Chinese government is deeply convinced that the
CTBT will facilitate nuclear disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation, it added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said, "China supports the conclusion, through
negotiation, of a fair, reasonable and verifiable treaty with
universal adherence and unlimited duration and is ready to take
active measures to promote its ratification and entry into force."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government appealed that major nuclear
weapon states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence.
States with huge arsenals should continue to drastically reduce
their nuclear stockpiles, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "All countries that have deployed nuclear
weapons on foreign soil should withdraw all of them to their own
land. All nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any
circumstance, commit themselves unconditionally to the non-use or
threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states
or nuclear-weapon-free zones, and conclude, at an early date,
international legal instruments to this effect."
</P>
<P>
China called on all nuclear weapon states to pledge their
support to proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones, respect their status as such and undertake corresponding
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said no country should develop or deploy space
weapon systems or missile defense systems undermining strategic
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
And an international convention on the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded
through negotiations, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Chinese government endorses the
application of verification measures consistent with the
provisions of the CTBT to ensure its faithful implementation and
at the same time it firmly opposes the abuse of verification
rights by any country, including the use of espionage or human
intelligence, to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries
and impair their legitimate security interests in violation of
universally recognized principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the present day world where huge nuclear
arsenals and nuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of
nuclear weapons still exist, the supreme national interests of
China demand that it ensure the safety, reliability and
effectiveness of its nuclear weapons before the goal of
eliminating all nuclear weapons is achieved.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are ready to continue to
work together with governments and people of other countries for
an early realization of the lofty goal of the complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," said the statement.

LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's BBC World Service is
to make radio programs in Cantonese available on the worldwide
computer network while cutting back on its short wave broadcasts.
</P>

JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Steering
Committee for the Development of the Jordan Valley and the Arava
met in Tel Aviv today amid reports of Amman's unhappiness about
the slow pace of the economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprised of representatives from Jordan and
Israel, is operating within the framework of the
Israel-American-Jordanian Tripartite Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The chairman is from the United States which, more than playing
the role of an active partner, is acting as a facilitator,
according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman's statement.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, a total of 25 special projects, to
be presented to participants at the forthcoming Cairo regional
economic summit, are expected to be selected, with an eye toward
attracting interested entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The report and the feasibility study of the projects were
conducted by the American firm HARZA, with Italian government
funding.
</P>
<P>
Also participating are some 20 Jordanian representatives,
including the directors-general of Jordanian government
ministries, directors of economic corporations and various experts
in relevant fields, whose Israeli counterparts are also present.

It said in a statement that the postponement had been made

<HEADLINE> Sweden Insists on Non-alignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister
Goeran Persson has said that there is no need to send out signals
that it is time for Sweden to change its policy of non-alignment.
</P>
<P>
Persson made these remarks at a press conference given during
his visit to Iceland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, the prime minister was
irritated that U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry questioned
the value of Sweden's non-alignment while visiting Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The policy had served Sweden well and kept the country outside
war for many years, Persson said, adding that those who consider
that non-alignment has had its day are often too short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
He commented that Perry's description might seem correct right
now, but it was not known today what would be the case in 20-40
years. Persson stressed that one had to take a long view when
judging Sweden's security policy.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the U.S. defense chief, Swedish Defense
Minister Thage G Petersson also declared that the policy of
non-alignment was important to Sweden and was deeply rooted in the
consciousness of the Swedish people.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Oliverio Rincon raced away to
victory, beating team mate Alex Zuelle in the mountain finish of
Tuesday's 17th stage in Cerler.
</P>
<P>
Tour of Spain leager Zuelle was left several seconds adrift by
team mate Laurent Jalabert and fellow Swiss rider Laurent Dufaux,
who both picked up bonus time after following Rincon home, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert gained a provisional 18 seconds in the overall
classification, leaving him one minute 10 seconds behind Zuelle,
while Dufaux is still over four minutes further back after
gaining nine seconds on the leader.
</P>
<P>
Zuelle was still short of breath five minutes after finishing
the climb, which ended at nearly 2,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
"It's not over until Madrid," Zuelle was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The riders are likely to take Wednesday's straightforward
222-km stage from Benasque to Zaragoza easily, before facing the
last mountain sections of the Vuelta on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The race concludes with Saturday's time-trial and the largely
flat final stage in Madrid on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Denounces Opening of Underground Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
leader Yasser Arafat denounced as "a breach of signed agreements"
Israel's opening of a tunnel underground of the holy Moslem sites
in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in the Gaza Strip after hundreds of
east Jerusalem Palestinians scuffled with Israeli police to
protest against the opening of the 500-yard tunnel under the
Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime against our religions and holy places. It is
completely against the peace process, It is a clear breach of what
has been agreed upon and what has been signed," the
apparently-angered Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Some Moslem protesters threw stones and bottles at Jewish
prayers in the Western Wall Monday night and today, slightly
injuring a Jewish youth.
</P>
<P>
The prayer in the Western Wall resumed after the clashes,
while the Temple Mount remained closed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert denied that the opening
of the tunnel was politically motivated, but only for
archaelogical and tourism needs. Israel said that the tunnel
provided easy access to tourists and archaeologists to various
archaeological sites underground.
</P>
<P>
Olmert also stressed Israel's self-claimed sovereignty over the
city, saying it was wrong for the Palestinians to think that
everything was open to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are the sovereign (authority) of the city. And this is
something can be done, ought to be done. It is fully justified and
is good for the whole city and every citizen of the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Olmert also warned the Palestinians against any linkage of the
opening of the tunnel to the peace process. He sternly rejected
any attempt by the Palestinians to try to divide the holy city,
claimed by Israel as its only eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian chief negotiator Seab Erekat denounced
Israel's move as "another provocation" that would unravel the
peace process. He said Palestinians would totally rejected the
fait accompli policies by the Israeli government to gain complete
rule over the city.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the volatile disputes
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli new hardline government has ruled out any
compromise on its self-proclaimed sovereignty over the city, while
the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of a
future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, the status of Jerusalem
should be settled through the final-status talks which are
expected to end by May 1999. But the talks, first opened
in May by the Israeli former Labor government, has been frozen
ever since.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Has Bright Future, Britain Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has a bright
future, as part of China, and as one the world's leading cities,
as long as the promises of the Sino-British Joint Declaration are
turned into reality, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the current session of the U.N. General Assembly,
Rifkind said that 1997 will be a special year for Hong Kong. Less
than 300 days from now the world will witness history, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the peaceful transfer of sovereignty over a
territory of 6 million people is an event unparalleled in modern
times. A transfer on the basis of an international treaty,
registered at the U.N., guarantees that for 50 years after 1997
there will be "one country two systems" and that "Hong Kong people
will rule Hong Kong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has made clear its determination to
preserve Hong Kong's prosperity, stability and way of life as a
free and open society based on the rule law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a prosperous Hong Kong will contribute
enormously to growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific
region.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Israel for Opening Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today
condemned Israel for opening a tunnel stretching beneath Al-Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem, saying that Israel must end its policy of
imposing a fait accompli on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Cairo-based league called on the United
Nations Security Council, the United States, Russia and the
European Union member states to take serious and immediate steps
to force Israel to halt the opening of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia are the co-sponsors of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Israeli action provokes the
Moslems and Christians worldwide and contravenes with the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League accused Israel of trying to carry
out its scheme to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and destroy its Arab and
Islamic features.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the league described the opening of the
tunnel as an aggression on Al-Aqsa Mosque in a way that threatens
to devastate this ancient Islamic site.
</P>
<P>
Israel today broke the last stretch of a tunnel that runs
along the Western Wall and the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, the third
holiest shrine of Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that such Israel practices in the
Palestinian territories would heighten tension in the area and
have a negative impact on the regional peace march.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is believed to be the most contentious
one in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible
capital, while the Palestinians regard it as the capital of their
 future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East
war.

CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen, believed
to be Moslem militants, opened fire and wounded eight persons
including two policemen today in Kahk village near the city of
Fayoum, some 80 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
First Lieutenant Mohamad Fathi Mahmoud, chief of the Kahk
Police Station, spotted a car carrying no number plates, and then
he began to chase the suspected car, according to Egypt's news

The passengers of the car opened fire, wounding the officer,
his assistant and six civilians, MENA quoted an Interior Ministry
security source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to hospital, and the militants escaped.

Police have fiercely cracked down on Moslem militants who have
waged a violent campaign since 1992 against the government in an

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said here today that the best help the
developed world can give to the developing is to buy what they
produce.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, Rifkind urged the developed countries to
demolish the barriers they still maintain against imports from the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
"When I look around the world, I see many developing countries
bursting with exports to sell: textiles, food, manufactured goods.
But, tragically, the markets of the developed world are often
closed to these exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the recent report of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) predicted that poor countries could
triple their exports to the North over the next 10 years if import
quotas were phased out.
</P>
<P>
"Protectionism is starving the developing countries of their
oxygen, the oxygen of growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the European Union's record is better than most, he
said, the EU obstructs imports of Palestinian cut-flowers, fruit
juice from South Africa, strawberry jam from Bulgaria. Other
developed countries are even less generous. The U.S. targets
imports of Mexican tomatoes; Japan restricts imports of rice from
South East Asia. The list could go on.
</P>
<P>
He described protectionism as not simply selfish, but also
short-sighted. "Growth and prosperity in the developing world
will, over time, increase, not diminish, the wealth of the
industrialized world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Free trade is not just helpful to developing countries, he
said. Its benefits are spread wide, to the producers and consumers
in the developed and developing worlds alike, who can profit from
the greater efficiency that free trade engenders, who can buy the
best and the cheapest products available on the world markets, he
said.

ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Chief of General
Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi announced that nearly 1,000 rebels
of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in
clashes with government forces since August 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted Karadayi,
who is visiting southeastern Turkey, as saying that the PKK was
in a state of what he termed as complete disarray as a result of
its heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the PKK's actions were now in the form of
isolated attacks and harassment shooting aimed at proving that
it was not finished.
</P>
<P>
The agency also said that Turkish security forces began
military operations against a group of about 250 PKK elements
encircled in Kinzir Forest near Hozat town in eastern province
of Tunceli Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven PKK rebels were killed in clashes today and there were
no casualties among the government troops, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the death toll of the PKK
militants may be much higher since they were having difficulties
reaching the most rugged places in the operation zone which was
being bombed from the air.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale military operations will continue until the
area is completely cleared of the PKK rebels, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that another large-scale military operation
started Monday against a PKK group on the Silo Plateau near
Semdinli town in Hakkari province bordering Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Elite mountain commandos and Cobra helicopter gunships are
taking part in the operation, said Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war in
southeastern Turkey for self-rule since August 1984 and more
than 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and government
 troops have been killed in clashes since then.

percent economic growth in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister on Conditions for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeni Primakov listed three conditions for achieving
durable peace of the world in his speech delivered today at the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that the old fronts of bloc confrontation are not
replaced with new lines of division.
</P>
<P>
The formation of skills of equal partnership among the many
"poles" rather than the revival of relexes of rivalry and balance
of power represents the way towards the establishment of a system
of comprehensive security.
</P>
<P>
No sanctions should be used as means to punish peoples or as an
instrument to overthrow governments, according to the Russian
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The second condition Primakov listed is the emancipation from
the mentality of "those who lead" and "those who are led".
</P>
<P>
Such a mentality draws on illusions that some countries emerged
as winners from the Cold War, while others lost it, he said. It
would also directly pave the way for a tendency to establish a
unipolar world.
</P>
<P>
No state today wields enough power to address individually a
host of problems, he added. Attempting to impose unilateral
decisions on others only provoke rivalry and, eventually, a
chaotic and unpredictable drift of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The third condition for the stable peace lies in coordinated
activities of the international community, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister also listed a number of tasks to
this end. They include: the settlement of conflicts; new steps
towards the reduction of arms; legal components of security; as
well as assistance and support to countries that experience
difficulties in their development.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the minister also gave the Russian position on
the Bosnian settlement, the ban on the comprehensive nuclear tests
and a number of other issues.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Broader Participation in UNCITRAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador
Wang Xuexian said here today that United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) should create favorable
conditions to facilitate participation by the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth Committee of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he urged the developed countries to make
contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
UNCITRAL should include in its agenda items such as
"build-operate-transfer (BOT)" projects, that concern the vital
interests of developing countries, in order to attract more
developing countries to the commission's enactive activities.
</P>
<P>
Thereby, the uniform laws formulated by UNCITRAL will be
universally accepted by them, he said.
</P>
<P>
While carrying out activities for unified enactment, UNCITRAL
should pay more attention to co-ordinating activities of
corresponding areas by other relevant organizations, so as to
avoid repetition and overlapping, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the relevant countries to support and attach
greater importance to the work of the commission, which harmonizes
and unifies international trade law.

<HEADLINE> France to Boost Trade with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France is to boost its trade
with Iraq by sending for the first time since the Gulf War a trade
councillor to Baghdad at the beginning of October, the Paris-based
French-Iraqi Council of Trade and Industry (CCI) said today.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Sarnelli, who is also France's trade representative in
Vietnam, will be the new trade councillor in the Iraqi capital,
said CCI's president, General Jeannou Lacaze, who is former chief
of staff of the French army.
</P>
<P>
France, which opened an office in charge of its interests in
Iraq in the Romanian embassy in Baghdad, is eager to see the
application of the U.N. oil for food plan with Iraq, as many
French oil, medical and food companies are becoming more and more
interested in the perspective of the Iraqi market.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.N. bans any country to sign trade contracts with
Iraq, the oil for food plan will allow the sale of food, medical
products and other humanitarian goods to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the National Council of French Bosses (CNPF)
visited Baghdad in the spring of 1996, and the CCI has lately
opened an office in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The CCI is planning to organize in the beginning of 1997 a
French agriculture saloon in Baghdad to promote the sale of French
cattle, seeds, irrigation equipments, agricultural machines and
genetic products.
</P>
<P>
France will also discuss with the Iraqi Agricultural Ministry
plans to train Iraqi agricultural engineers and technicians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Keeps Short-term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) left current interest rates unchanged today in the last
policy-making meeting before the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The Fed announced that they had met and said there would be no
further announcement--a usual signal that rates were held steady.
</P>
<P>
It apparently convinced a moderating economy is not threatening
a new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had been divided over whether the U.S. central bank
would tighten credit or hold monetary policy steady in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected that the Fed would raise the
short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point as a
pre-emptive strike against inflation, since little evidence exists
so far that prices are rising substantially despite a still robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
But others predicted the Fed panel would not act until after
the November election. The next meeting of Fed's policy-maker, the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is on Nov. 13, eight days
after the election.
</P>
<P>
The split was underscored by a detailed leak last week that
eight of the 12 Fed regional banks were in favor of a hike in the
Fed's discount rate with three of the banks seeking a half-point
increase. The U.S. government is making an investigation into the
leak.
</P>
<P>
After the economy posted its strongest growth in two years in
the second quarter of this year, U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
said the central bank believed the economy would slow during the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the Fed would act if "the weight of incoming
evidence persuasively suggest an oncoming intensification of
inflation pressures."
</P>
<P>
Recent data show that the U.S. economy may be slowing, but not
as fast as some Fed officials would like. Although retail sales
have flattened, housing construction and industrial production
remain at high levels and unemployment is at a seven-year low.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed has not increased the interest rates since
February of 1995. The current federal funds rate, the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans, is 5.25 percent and the
discount rate is 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Annual Production Growth around 6.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts of the economic
institute in Belgrade has forecast that this year's industrial
production growth in Yugoslavia could be 6.5 percent, and
inflation below 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Such forecasts are the result of surveys conducted among
businessmen, and estimated by the institute's experts, Prof.
Miroljub Labus of the institute said at a news conference in
Belgrade on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Yugoslavia's economy was devastated by
the international sanctions which was suspended by the end of last
year and is expected to be lifted in the next few days under the
Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Talking about economic trends indicators, Labus said the
foreign trade sector was characterized by a growing deficit that
reached 1.164 billion U.S. dollars in the last eight months,
despite a growth of exports.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the institute of economy, in their economic policy
recommendations, stressed that the monetary and fiscal policy must
be kept under control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr. Jurij Bajec, Labus's colleague, said production
and other economic results must be maintained and improved,
because their influence is decisive for the future position of key
world financial organizations towards the Yugoslav economy.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authorities, he said, must maintain a stable rate
of exchange of the Yugoslav Dinar, while resources for future
economic activities, and for enlarging foreign currency reserves,
are to be found in the "unfreezing" of Yugoslav assets abroad,
returning of foreign currency exports' revenue, and obtaining
foreign currency credits from certain firms.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Stand-By Credit for Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today said it has approved a 12-month stand-by credit
equivalent to some 10 million U.S. dollars for Lesotho to back the
government's 1996-97 economic program.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at achieving a real GNP growth rate of 10.2
percent, limiting the increase in the consumer price index to no
more than 10.0 percent and reducing the external account deficit
to 1.8 percent of GNP from 2.0 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The program envisages major structural reforms to achieve
sustained economic growth. The government will deregulate
agricultural markets, taking measures to promote further expansion
in manufacturing and move decisively to reform the operations of
the principal state-owned public utilities. The government's
strategy for poverty reduction under the program contains efforts
to sharpen priorities in education and health, and to increase the
efficiency of the social safety not through administrative
improvements. Spending on education will increase in real terms
and will focus on improving primary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho joined the IMF in July 1968. Its quota is about 35
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently
totals about 35 million dollars.

remain in effect until an appeal overturns it.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a court of appeal in Cairo upheld an original
ruling in 1995 ordering Nasr Abu Zeid, a professor of Arabic
literature, to divorce his wife on grounds that his writings made
him an apostate.
</P>
<P>
One who has renounced his faith in Islam can not remain
married to a Moslem woman, according to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid has protested against the ruling by the court of
appeal, saying that his writings are just a scholarly analysis of
the language of the Koran and he just exercised his right to
freedom of thought under Islam.
</P>
<P>
The emergency court ruling today marked a victory for secular
thinkers in their fight against Egyptian activists who want to
impose strict Islamic law in the country. But lawyers against Abu
Zeid promised to fight the decision.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid, 53, and his wife, 38-year-old art history professor
Ibtihal Younis now teach at Leiden University in the
Netherlands. They have been married for four years and have said
in the past they would not divorce.

<HEADLINE> Central Conference on Poverty-Relief Ends (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun delivered the closing speech at
today's meeting. Jiang said the main goal of the poverty-relief
effort and development work is to solve the problems of food and
clothing for the poor, so that by the end of the century, all
Chinese will have enough food and clothing, except those who rely
on government subsidiaries, such as the handicapped, widowers,
and widows.
</P>
<P>
He urged all provinces, ethnic minority autonomous regions and
municipalities to formulate and perfect their poverty-alleviation
programs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has selected nine economically-powerful provinces
and municipalities and four cities in the east to help 10 poor
provinces and autonomous regions. Jiang called this a strategic
measure for accelerating the poverty-relief campaign and gradually
shrinking the economic gap between the east and west.
</P>
<P>
He urged the poor areas which are slow in developing the
socialist market economy, to further free themselves from old
ideas and update their viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
The poverty-stricken areas should improve their ecological and
agricultural conditions, develop farm technology and curb
population growth, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called on all related departments and
localities to attach great importance to the implementation of
poverty-alleviation policies and timely allocation of the funds.
</P>
<P>
To realize the national poverty-alleviation program is the
urgent demand of the country's 65 million poor farmers, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is the country's top priority and, however difficult the
task, we must reach the established goal without hesitation," he
said.

LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The English Football
Association (F.A.) charged Coventry coach Ron Atkinson and his
assistant Gordon Strachan Wednesday on bringing the game into
disrepute, a report said.
</P>
<P>
The same charge was also brought against Coventry's central
defender Liam Daish following incidents during a match with
Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in August.
</P>
<P>
Atkinson and Strachan were seen on television remonstrating
from the touchline with officials following a highly-disputed
goal after Chelsea's Dan Petrescu appeared to handle the ball but
was not penalised and Frank Leboeuf went on to score, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Daish was sent off by referee for foul and abusive language
during the melee that followed Leboeuf's goal. The charge against
Daish, the Ireland international, relates to an incident following
the game outside the referee's dressing room.
</P>
<P>
All three have been given 14 days to respond to the charges
and decide whether to request a personal hearing.

<HEADLINE> France Not to Arrange Peace Talks Between Israel, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- France has made it clear that
it holds no illusion of arranging any peace talks between Israel
and Syria and persuading Israel to fulfill its agreements signed
with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A French government official said so while Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived here this morning on his
official European tour.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has ruled out any possibility of letting Palestinians
set up an independent state, withdrawing from the Golan Heights,
and separating Jerusalem into two capitals for both Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
France regrets Israel's latest decision to dig a tunnel near an
esplanade of the Mosque Aqsa in east Jerusalem, said French
Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new regrettable factor in the tensions between
Israelis and Palestinians," said Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
France has sharply criticized Netanyahu for his hardline policy
and is urging Israel to adopt a realistic stand by pursuing the
peace process on the basis of "land for peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
One major objective of Netanyahu's visit is to draw new
investments from Europe to the Palestinian areas, where the
unemployment rate is high and the economy has been repeatedly hit
by Israeli blockades.
</P>
<P>
The countries of European Union, as well as some Arab countries
which have economic links with Israel, are reluctant to make new
investments in the Palestinian area because of the high tension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu's plan to attend a dinner hosted by the
French section of the Likud Bloc, Likud France, has drawn
criticism from the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions
of France (CRIF), the biggest Jewish organization in France.
</P>
<P>
Henri Hajdenberg, president of CRIF, accused the Likud-France
of trying to benefit from the visit and destabilizing the
representative organs of the Jewish community in France.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
reached the eastern suburb of Kabul today, said a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The advancing Taliban was locked in fierce fighting with the
Afghan government troops near the Kabul Military Academy and the
Customs House, which are only six kilometers from the presidential
palace, said the report.
</P>
<P>
While the main offensive was from the east, the Taliban also
launched fresh attacks on the government forces from the south and
west of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that another batch of Taliban soldiers
were advancing towards the Bagram Airbase, about 50 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Now the Bagram Airbase has become the only exit for people who
want to flee Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban side claimed that Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani was preparing to flee from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the Taliban captured the strategic town of
Sarobi, about 75 kilometers east of Kabul, after fierce overnight
fighting with heavy government troops.
</P>
<P>
Some government soldiers who fled to Kabul from Sarobi were
quoted as saying that the fighting at Sarobi had been brutal as
the Taliban sent waves of soldiers and tanks across heavily mined
fields.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government also confirmed the fall of Sarobi later.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Taliban has overran three provinces in eastern
Afghanistan and its current target is the capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has been demanding Rabbani's resignation and
calling for the establishment of an Islamic government in the
country.

BRUSSELS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU),
through its executive European Commission (EC), today adopted a
draft nuclear program which assesses the various features of
nuclear energy in the regional alliance, said an EC press release.
</P>
<P>
The draft Illustrative Nuclear Program was also aimed to serve

evolving energy market organization, the need to protect the
environment and the changed geo-political situation in Europe.

The code of conduct also contains basic principles such as the
right of the EU member nations to decide whether or not to develop
the peaceful use of nuclear energy, the obligation to ensure a
high degree of nuclear safety and to respect non-proliferation
requirements, said EC Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis in
the release.
</P>
<P>
"Both Member States and operators of nuclear installations must
share a collective responsibility towards our citizens for
ensuring these high standards," he added.
</P>
<P>
The draft program will be published in order to allow the
European Parliament and various organizations and interested
parties to express their views before the EC adopts a final one.

<HEADLINE> Central Conference on Poverty-Relief Ends (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The key to relieving poor
counties from poverty is to choose qualified county-level
leadership, especially magistrates and the Communist Party county
committee secretaries, a senior Party official said at a central
conference on poverty-alleviation and development of poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said central and local government departments have sent cadres to
poverty-stricken counties to make in-depth investigations and find
solutions to poverty-relief problems, but they are not authorized
to direct all aspects of the work.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which closed today, was jointly held by
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu urged that relief funds be used more
efficiently, and that leaders in these areas must be careful to
study the market and choose cost-effective poverty-alleviation
projects.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also vice-premier, called for the further
improvement of the banking services used by these projects and
stressed that funds must be allocated on time and not be used
improperly.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference is important, as it carries out the
decisions made at the 14th CPC Congress's Fifth Plenary Session
and the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Speeches made at the conference by General Secretary Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng represent the general mobilization
efforts for implementing the poverty-alleviation campaign, and are
of great significance for unifying the understanding of the
poverty-relief work and for speeding up the pace of the work, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole Party, leaders at all levels in particular,
to study and understand the core ideas of the speeches and to
carry them out, in order to realize the strategic goal of
basically wiping out poverty by the end of the century.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuba, Brazil, China and
Russia will vie for the crown of the 470,000 U.S. dollars World
Women's Grand Prix in the finals starting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The top four Olympic finishers qualified for the three-day
round-robin comeptition after four-week preliminary legs in eight
Asian-Pacific cities, which also featured South Korea, Japan, the
Netherlands and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said on Wednesday fatigue and
inconsistent play were the major problems her team would have to
cope with in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"We are competiting here with same lineup as the Olympics and
they are really tired after the four weeks, " said Lang, whose
team was fourth in last year's finals here.
</P>
<P>
"We have not an edge over the teams on players' height but
don't play the tactics well to make up it. So the outcome of the
finals will depend on the players' performance on the court," Lang
added.
</P>
<P>
Coach Antonio Perdomo, who took over Olympic gold medalists
Cuba after his predecessor Eugene George was sacked in August,
said without three Olympic starters, it was not easy to win the
title here.
</P>
<P>
"The four teams are all strong. I am happy that my team only
lost one of the 12 matches in the preliminaries. We had had hard
times but now we are finally here, " Perdomo said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba won the preliminaries, followed by Brazil and
China. Russia edged the defending champions the United States in
the Hong Kong lege to finish fourth.
</P>
<P>
"It was a long and hard way for us to fight up here, " said
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol, "We are aiming for a better position
in the finals."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's quest was somewhat hampered by the absence of
veteran Marina Nikoulina, who was ill after the last leg in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that the same four teams clash with each
other in the finals since the event was inaugurated in 1993. From
then, Cuba, Brazil and China never missed the finals.

<HEADLINE> Three People Found Dead in Landslide in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A landslide which stopped the
flow of a river in southwest China's Guizhou Province has caused
three deaths, forced more than 1,000 people to leave the area and
still poses a threat to more than 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local water conservation officials said they have discovered
the bodies of three victims killed in the landslide.
</P>
<P>
The landslide was caused by a sudden downpour early on
September 19, at a spot 4.1 kilometers outside the seat of
Tujia-Miao Autonomous County of Yinjiang, in the northeast region
of the province.
</P>
<P>
The 1.17-million cubic meter landslide covered a 300-meter
section of the Yinjiang River bed, has stopped the river's flow,
and is forcing the river levels to rise about one meter daily.
</P>
<P>
The river water that has returned has submerged the Xiniudong
Power Station and highways from Yinjiang County to Songtao County
and Tongren City, broken optic fibre telecommunications, high
voltage power lines, and cut off supplies of running water to
people in the county seat.
</P>
<P>
More than 450 organized militiamen are clearing dangerous rocks
and evacuated people in the areas affected by the landslide. So
far, more than 1,000 local people have moved out of the danger
areas.
</P>
<P>
Security and epidemic prevention forces have arrived at the
scene. Experts sent by the provincial water conservation
department are making a plan to deal with the landslide.
</P>
<P>
A working team led by vice-governor Zhang Yuqin has come to the
disaster area with more than 300,000 yuan (about 36,000 US
dollars) of relief funds.
</P>
<P>
The water continues to rise, and is forming a temporary
reservoir of five million cubic meters. The disaster relief work
is still underway to remove the threat to 500,000 people in the
river's downstream area.

<P>
The New York Times:

</P>
<P>
-- Shaken by a child sex scandal, Belgium came before the
United Nations to discuss the subject and proposed making sexual
abuse of minors an internationally recognized criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>

economic growth already is slowing enough to check inflation, made
no change in short-term interest rates at a policy-making session
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
-- Robert Dole issued an unusual campaign rebuke Tuesday,
telling critics who have portrayed President Clinton as a
poll-driven politician of no principle that they have
misunderstood a man with a deep commitment -- to liberalism.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal jury found Sun-Diamond Growers, a big California
agricultural concern, guilty of giving illegal gifts to former
Agriculture Secretary Espy and making illegal campaign

investigation.

<P>
ABU DHABI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa
bin Suleiman al-Khalifa met in Manama today with King Hussein of
Jordan who is currently visiting Bahrain for the first time
since the 1991 Gulf war, according to media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two leaders reviewed ways of
promoting the bilateral relations between Bahrain and Jordan in
all fields in addition to a number of regional and international
issues, especially the Middle East peace process, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
While praising Jordan's wisdom in tackling Arab and Islamic
issues, Sheikh al-Khalifa affirmed that King Hussein's current
visit to Bahrain would have positive effects on the ties of
cooperation and friendship between the two countries, the media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In response, King Hussein expressed his satisfaction at the
growing ties of friendship and cooperation between his country
and Bahrain, hoping that Jordanian-Bahraini cooperation would be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein also praised Bahrain's cultural and development
achievements, as well as the wise policy adopted by Bahrain on
both the regional and international scenes.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said the Jordanian monarch's current
visit to Bahrain may indicate that the relations between the two
countries have returned to normalcy after a period of frigidity
caused by the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, during which Jordan expressed
sympathy with Iraq while Bahrain supported Kuwait. Iraqi troops
invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and were driven out of the country
in February 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king and his party arrived in Manama Tuesday
afternoon for a brief visit to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is due to leave the Bahraini capital this
afternoon for the Qatari capital of Doha to continue his Gulf
tour.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Calls for Ceasefire in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy to
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, today appealed to all the warring
factions in the country to immediately enforce a ceasefire and
find a solution to their conflict through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
All the factions should refrain from further use of military
force to resolve their problems, Holl said in a press release
issued here.
</P>
<P>
"Those factions should begin earnestly and seriously
negotiations for a lasting political settlement and peace in their
country to spare the lives of the innocent civilians who have
already suffered enough from years of useless bloodshed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged those countries with influence on Afghanistan to
persuade the warring parties to abandon the course of war and
cooperate with the United Nations in a genuine search for a
sustainable resolution of the Afghan tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Taliban Militia is advancing
toward Kabul after capturing the strategic town of Sarobi, 75
kilometers east of the capital city, early this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I have been following with increasing concern the recent
development in Afghanistan," Holl said in the release. "The great
concern to the U.N. is the determination of the warring parties to
resort to military means rather than peaceful talks."
</P>
<P>
"These developments are all the more regretful as they are
happening when the U.N. is intensifying its peace efforts in the
region," he declared.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Sees Record Trade Deficit in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in
August scored a record high of 3.03 billion U.S. dollars up from
the previous month's 2.74 billion dollars, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 9.92 billion dollars worth of goods in
August, down 4.5 percent from the same month last year, while
imports topped 12.95 billion dollars, up 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has attributed the sharp drop in August exports
mainly to a 50 percent decline in semiconductors exports from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The August increase in imports was primarily attributed to an
increase in machinery imports.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's exports in the first eight months of this year
totaled 85.2 billion dollars, up 7.3 percent from the same period
last year, while imports topped 98.6 billion dollars, up 11.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thus the eight-month-period trade deficit rose to 13.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, South Korea's trade deficit
this year will approach 20 billion dollars, surpassing the final
line set by the government: 18 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Large Consortia Stream to Qaidam Basin to Tap Rich Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A remote basin described as
China's 'treasure bowl' in northwest China has become a booming
area for world-wide oil and chemical giants.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai province is
helping to change and improve the lives of thousands of local
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars have been invested, and new towns and
cities built - with the prospects of even greater growth in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of China's economic growth strategy westwards
helped to arouse the interests of international consortiums to
invest in the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
US petroleum giant ESSO has invested 10 million US dollars in
cooperating with Chinese geologists to prospect oil and natural
gas in the area of 11,000-sq-km Dafengshan Mountain in the basin.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Incorporated (UDA) and the Dead Sea
Company of Israel set up a Sino-Israeli joint venture, Qinghai
Potash Fertilizer Company in Qaidam, with a total investment of
4.67 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
NOV Company of Canada, as well as other foreign companies have
made a host of inspection trips to Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"Qaidam's rich mineral resources, the preferential policies
formulated by the provincial government towards investors, and
honest employees in the Qinghai Oilfield have helped them to
confide in investment cooperation," said James f. Devaney,
vice-president of AMOCO Company, USA.
</P>
<P>
AMOCO Company, which took the lead in entering the Chinese oil
market, is working in cooperation with the Qinghai Oilfield to tap
natural gas, and making use of resources from salt lakes.
</P>
<P>
"If it is successful, bilateral cooperation will last for 20 to
30 years," a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The American company has spent 1.5 million US dollars on
purchasing Chinese technical data and relevant materials, and the
Qinghai Oilfield has invested two billion yuan in the earlier
stage development.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwestern Qinghai, the Qaidam Basin, renowned as
a "treasure bowl", covers a 250,000-sq km area that abounds in
oil, salt, coal, potash and metal resources.
</P>
<P>
the Chinese Government have spent tens of billions of yuan over
the past 40 years in building a number of cities and towns to the
service of local oil, salt and chemical industries.

<HEADLINE> Israel Trying To Reduce Tension Over Opening Of Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Acting Israeli Prime
Minister Moshe Katzov is keeping in contact with the Palestinian
Authority in a bid to reduce the mounting tensions over Israel's
opening of a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani made the
disclosure when he toured the tunnel this morning, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
A general strike called by PA President Yasser Arafat in
Gaza Tuesday night went into effect at noon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier hundreds of Palestinian youths clashed with Israeli
policemen and border policemen near the Damascus Gate of the Old
City, but no injures were reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters tried to enter the Old City, but were prevented
from going through the gate.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say that the tunnel endangers the security and
integrity of Al-Aqsa Mosque and of the foundations of the
Islamic structures existing above the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud Mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, argued that the
tunnel had been opened for the sake of development of tourism and
Israel, which he said has the exclusive sovereignty over whole
Jerusalem, is "justified to do anything it deems necessary."
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Assaf Hafetz said that police had
been mobilized to prevent any possible violence and will
remain on alert until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Two deputy ministers of the Religious Affairs, who were also
on hand, announced that their ministry will invest another 16
million shekels (5.3 million U.S. dollars) to develop the area of
the Western Wall and the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Labor Member of Knesset (parliament) and former minister of
tourism Uzi Baram called the timing of the tunnel opening stupid,
saying that the Labor government would put it off three times in
the past because of tensions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tensions are mounting in other parts of the West
Bank, including Hebron and Ramallah. The Israeli authorities has
declared Ramallah to be a closed military zone.

These emerging cities and towns, including Golmud, Delingha,
Daqaidam, Lenghu, Manya-Huatugou and Dunhuang-Qilizhen, are linked
by criss-crossed asphalted roads, and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway
running from Golmud, the central city in the basin, to Xining,
capital of Qinghai province, to join the Lanzhou-Lianyungang
Railway across China from the west to the east.
</P>
<P>
Golmud has an airport able to accommodate Tu-154 and other
medium-sized planes.
</P>
<P>
To help tap its abundant natural resources and boost local
economies, the central government plans to add 10 billion yuan,
including the use of foreign funds, to further assist the
development of Qaidam.
</P>
<P>
At present, the vast Qaidam basin is dotted with oil derricks,
drilling rigs and storage tanks, and Chinese and foreign
geologists are busily prospecting oil reserves and studying core
samples.
</P>
<P>
More chemical plants are going up around some 100 salt lakes,
where bulldozers and dredgers are buzzing round the clock, and
rows of salt-loaded trucks moving to nearby chemical works and
railway stations for shipment to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The development of oil, petro-chemical and salt industries in
Qaidam Basin is helping modernize the lives of local residents,
particularly ethnic minority groups, who are provided with cooking
gas, electricity and chemical fertilizer," said Yi Kesheng,
secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
During his recent inspection tour of Qinghai province, Premier
Li Peng encouraged Qinghai to absorb more foreign capital and
advanced technology to speed up Qaidam's development.
</P>
<P>
Qaidam's potash fertility in the basin is much needed in China,
and its development of oil and natural gas is promising, Li
said. Qaidam is playing a growing role as the country shifts its
strategy of land oil prospecting and development westwards.

<HEADLINE> Containment, Isolation Policy Won't Work: China's Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that the containment and isolation policy
of some Western countries towards China will not succeed.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with John Baker, chief of the Australian Defense
Force, Chi said some Western countries view China "from a wrong
perspective" and spread the "China threat" fallacy in an attempt
to contain or isolate China.
</P>
<P>
However, the general noted, China should not be contained or
isolated and such a policy will not succeed.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission,
said the development of friendly relations and cooperation between
China and Australia, both countries of influence in the
Asia-Pacific region, will not only benefit the two countries, but
will be conducive to peace in the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is willing to develop friendly relations
and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equal
consultation, mutual benefit and seeking common ground while
reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
This demands more exchanges and dialogues so as to increase
mutual understanding and trust, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Baker said Australia attaches importance to the relations with
China, saying the two countries have the common goals in
maintaining peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia and China have many opportunities for
cooperation, adding that the two countries will have more
cooperation in the area of national defense as bilateral relations
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Baker is here as a guest of Fu Quanyou, chief of the general
staff of the People's Liberation Army.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Publicity Drive to Popularize Coal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China launched a massive
publicity campaign today to popularize the Coal Law among its
seven million coal workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The country's first law, aimed at promoting sound production
order of the coal industry, goes into effect on December 1,
according to the Minister of Coal Industry Wang Senhao.
</P>
<P>
The law contains explicit stipulations to guide and ensure the
exploration of coal resources, safe production, issuing of coal
production permits, special protection of coal miners as well as
transportation and marketing of coal, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has long been without a law to govern coal
production, despite the fact that it produces 1.3 billion tons of
raw coal annually and is the world's largest coal producer and
consumer.
</P>
<P>
China's coal sector accounts for 75 percent of the country's
energy resources production and consumption, he added, but it has
always been managed by administrative control rather than by legal
means. This resulted in the illegal mining of coal resources,
overall waste in the industry, accidents which led to injuries and
death, damage of coal mines, and irregular transportation and
management of coal products.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the new law will help the country meet
its ambitious target of producing 1.45 billion tons of coal
annually by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Arab League to Hold Emergency Meeting on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League will hold an
emergency meeting here Thursday to discuss the current situation
in Jerusalem in the wake of Israel's opening of a tunnel in the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
The member states' permanent delegates to the Cairo-based
league will attend the meeting to be convened at the request of
the Palestinians, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes after Israel opened an over 400-meter-long
tunnel near Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine of Islam,
after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League said in a statement Tuesday that the action
provoked the Moslems and Christians worldwide and contravened with
the Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member league said that the opening of the tunnel was
part of Israel's attempt to Judaize Arab East Jerusalem and
destroy its Arab and Islamic features.
</P>
<P>
But Israel says that opening the tunnel will give tourists
easier access to archaeological sites beneath the Wailing Wall,
Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Wakfs and Islamic affairs in the Palestinian
Authority Hassan Sahboub told Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of
Arabs) Radio today that the Palestinians would work to close the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
He added that all citizens of Jerusalem were angry with such
an Israeli measure, affirming that the Intifada (uprising) against
Israel was probably back.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. nuclear-powered
attack submarine will take part in military exercises at
Shoalwater Bay off the Queensland coast next year, a defense
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Adrian D'Hage, director general of the Australian Defense
Forces' public information, confirmed that the U.S. submarine
would be part of a fleet of 20 major warships in Operation Tandem
Thrust.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 U.S. and 4,000 Australian personnel will be
involved in the exercise in March next year, with about 8,000
troops expected to land on the bay and the remainder to be
stationed offshore.
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalist Pat O'Brien said green groups were
concerned about the nuclear threat and ideologically opposed to
nuclear weaponry. He also raised concerns about contingency plans
in the event of a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
To counter these concerns, D'Hage said, "You can never put your
hand on your heart and say military operations have no risk but we
do everything possible to minimize the risk."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) warned on Wednesday that the 2000 Olympics would
face disruption by Aborigines or other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
IOC coordination commission chairman Jacques Rogge, fresh from
finishing his three-day visit in Sydney, said games organizers
should not be held responsible for Australia's social ills but
that it was unavoidable interest groups would try to use the event
for their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, IOC was "very satisified" with the policies of the
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) in terms
of Aboriginal and ethnic minorities issues.
</P>
<P>
Rogge, whose coordination commission has responsibility for
overseeing Sydney's preparations for the Games, said that they
were extremely satisfied about the preparation for the Olympic
Games in Sydney, but the commission knew there were still
problems. Transport would be a major challenge for organizers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Defense Minister Chi
Haotian stressed here today that the strategy of China's national
defence is a defensive one.
</P>
<P>
Such a strategy is adopted in an effort to effectively
safeguard the country's sovereignty and territory, to create a
peaceful environment for the economic construction, and to
safeguard the people in their work, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission,
made the remarks when he met with Zimbabwean Defence Forces
Commander Musungwa Gava Zvinavashe this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The general said China has adhered to the long-term policy of
non-confrontation, non-alignment, and not deploying garrison
troops on foreign territories.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop cooperative ties with those
countries which treat China on an equal basis so as to make

<HEADLINE> Russia Says British Newspaper Report Not True </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Russian
security chief Alexander Lebed Tuesday denied a western report
which said Lebed has threatened economic penalties against western
firms for NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Alexander Barkhatov, who described a British
newspaper report as a fabrication of "an overt provocative
nature," said what has been reported was not true, as Lebed never
gave such an interview.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph newspaper carried an interview on Tuesday,
quoting Lebed as saying that Russia will take sanction measures
against western firms, especially those of the United States and
Germany, if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) goes
ahead with its eastward expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no mistake, Germany and American industrial
interests in Russia will suffer directly as a result of (NATO)
enlargement plans," the report entitled "Lebed Prepares For Power
With Attack on NATO" quoted Lebed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted Lebed as suggesting that such an
enlargement could be seen as an attempt to build a "Fourth Reich."
</P>
<P>
"Is this (NATO enlargement) the work of the new generation of
(German) post-unification policy-makers, building a Fourth Reich?"
Lebed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barkhatov said Lebed does have a firm stand against NATO's
eastward expansion because the security adviser believes the
expansion is not in keeping with Russian interests and would lead
to "bloc concept."
</P>
<P>
But Lebed's words were intentionally misinterpreted by some
western media reports in an attempt to picture him as an
"impatient politician," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Barkhatov added that Russia would not exert any pressure on
foreign companies operating in Russia unless they break Russian
law.
</P>
<P>
He described the Daily Telegraph report as an attempt to cause
non-confidence among foreign investors in Russia.

MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Five suspected members of the
New People's Army (NPA) were killed in two recent separate
encounters with government troops, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Jose Solquillo, chief of the Southern Luzon
Command, said that the government troops were conducting routine
operations in Liliw, Laguna province in the central Philippines
when they suddenly encountered about 20 armed NPA rebels on
September 17.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides exchanged fire which resulted in the
death of three rebels and an army solider. Then the rebels fled to
a mountain.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, two NPA members were also killed while two
army soldiers were wounded in a 15-minute encounter between the
government troops and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The two incident, together with fighting which broke out
recently between the followers of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) chief Nur Misuari and some ex-members of the MNLF,
indicated that peace is not certain to befall the country although
the government has signed a peace accord with MNLF, the biggest
rebel group in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Quicker Localization of Macao Higher-Ranking Civil Servants Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) has urged the Portuguese
side to speed up the localization of higher-ranking civil servants
in the Macao Government.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, head of the Chinese side of the Three Leading
Issues Work Group under the JLG, told reporters after meeting with
his Portuguese counterpart on Tuesday that the localization
process of civil servants at the level of head of department and
head of sub-department should be quickened.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side has again urged the Portuguese side to step
up the working process of the three leading issues of the
transitional period," he said. "In particular, the localization
process of civil servants above the level of head of department
and head of sub-department should pick up speed."
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil servants, the localization of law and
the use of Chinese as an official language are the three leading
issues in the transitional period of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese side appreciates the efforts made
by the Macao Government in the localization process, and said that
it is the belief and hope of the Chinese side that the
localization of civil servants above the level of section chief
and head of group will be finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Macao governor issued an order that all
civil servants above the level of section chief and head of group
be localized by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But, Wang pointed out that efforts made by the Portuguese side
still fall behind the needs for a smooth handover of power and a
stable transition, saying that he hopes the Portuguese side would
make still greater efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the two sides should strengthen
consultations on law.
</P>
<P>
He said he also hopes the Portuguese side would take measures
to speed up the translation of major laws and promote the use of
Chinese to a larger sphere.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendes, Wang's Portuguese counterpart, said that solid
foundation has been laid in some aspects and that the future
Special Administrative Region government will function effectively
after the handover of power in 1999.

<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced on Tuesday that his
government will take full responsibility for its economic and
political policies in parliamentary debate due to start next
week. Parliament members of the ruling Rassemblement pour la
Republique and the Union pour la Democratie Francaise, who make up
the majority of the National Assembly, have already vowed to side
with the premier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a poll by the Paris Match magazine shows that the
support rate of President Jacques Chirac and Juppe dropped to
their record low of 40 and 31 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
-- The political scene of Russia was suspended on Tuesday until
a verdict is made by a council of doctors on whether to perform a
multiple heart bypass operation on President Boris Yeltsin. The
council, joined by the American heart transplantation pioneer
Michael DeBakey, could hammer out a decision by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- By holding his government responsible for all its policies,
Prime Minister Alain Juppe wants again to put the ruling majority
under his control. He warned members of the Union pour la
Democratie Francaise, which is maintaining a ruling majority with
his Rassemblement pour la Republique, that their deadly enemy is
dissidence and division, and called for a "renewal of the
contract" among members of the majority.
</P>
<P>
-- The Stock Exchange in Moscow dived by 10 percent in its
share values on Tuesday after a council of doctors did not decide
whether to operate on President Boris Yeltsin or not. The
president, too weak for a heart bypass operation, is waiting for a
verdict by the doctors, who could decide to postpone the surgery.

<HEADLINE> 39 Killed in Meningitis Outbreak in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Viral meningitis has so far
caused 39 deaths in Romania since its outbreak in late July, the
World Health Organization (WHO) said in a press release issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the total 450 cases have occurred in the
capital city Bucharest. Most of the deaths were among the elderly
patients.
</P>
<P>
Colder weather is expected to help prevent the spread of the
epidemic because the population of virus-carrying mosquitos would
be slashed by the cold weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests showed the West Nile virus as the cause of the
outbreak, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
There is not specific drug treatment nor commercially available
vaccine against the meningitis diseases caused by different
viruses.
</P>
<P>
Quaratine measures or the imposition of restrictions on travel
to and from Romania will have no effect in containing the spread
of viral meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The West Nile fever occurs in many other countries of Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, particularly those lying along the
route of the migratory birds which are the natural reservoir of
the virus.
</P>
<P>
Infection with the virus causes fever, and severe cases may be
complicated by inflammation of the brain and surrounding
membranes.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Steps Up Bid to Build IT Mega Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
stepping up its efforts to make Singapore the Information
Technology (IT) Mega Hub of the Asia Pacific region, Deputy Prime
Minister Tony Tan said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Comdex Asia 96, a major IT show in
the region, Mr Tan said that this goal could be achieved by
extending Singapore's services beyond its shores.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the IT Mega Hub would have a number of hubs
dedicated to niche areas where Singapore could excel in. These
included making Singapore a center for communications and
information exchange in the region.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved by using the country as a testbed for
advanced technology development and a center for electronic
commerce activities, he said, adding that international IT
companies will find it worthwhile to invest and take part in
Singapore's mega hub.
</P>
<P>
IT companies can also build up their credibility in Singapore
as the first port call and then use the country as a springboard
to the region, he said.

<HEADLINE> 100 Nigerians Missing Since Latest Bakassi Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Nigerian
soldiers and civilians have been missing since the latest clash
between Nigeria and Cameroun over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula
in April this year, the "Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The information was contained in a 40-page document submitted
by Nigerian government to the United Nations facts-finding team
which has justed ended its four-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions yesterday from defence correspondent,
acting Nigerian defence spokesman Colonel Godwin Ugbo reportedly
accused Cameroun of attacking Nigeria over Bakassi continuously
since 1964.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed Cameroun for including the disputed Bakassi in
a hurriedly drawn map and presenting it to the UN team. This map,
the spokesman said, is different from the one Cameroun has
submitted to the international court of justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, hailed the UN team visit to Nigeria a
success, saying that "the team was impressed because there were
no contradictions from Cross River to Akwa Ibom (Nigerian states
on the disputed peninsula) because all the people and the
community leaders spoke in voice to further demonstrate that
Bakassi belongs to Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
The UN team yesterday left Nigeria for a second visit to
Cameroun, after which they will meet with Togolese President Gnasingbe
Eyadema, who has been mediating the Nigerian-Camerounian dispute, the
newspaper said. Endtiem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Determined to Defend Itself with Help of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is determined to
defend its lands from any outside aggression with the help of the
U.S. military forces, Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheikh Ahmed
Al-Humoud Al-Sabah said here today.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made the remarks at a welcome party
attended by high ranking officers of the American forces currently
deployed in Kuwait and senior Kuwaiti military commanders in
Kuwaiti Military College.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kuwait would always welcome the U.S. cooperation
in safeguarding Kuwait's sovereignty and integrity, adding that
"here we are standing shoulder to shoulder to safeguard the
security of the region and the sovereignty of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
While praising the role of the U.S. military deployment in
Kuwait, he expressed his thanks to "the men and women who work and
train side by side with our Kuwaiti soldiers to ensure that no
enemy dares to question the sovereignty of our loved Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Now the U.S. military forces deployed in Kuwait include eight
stealth F-117a fighters, 4,700 ground troops equipped with heavy
armored equipment and eight Patriot missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing joint military training near the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders, the defense minister said: "we are joint in
exercise, joint in preparedness and joint in resolve and
commitment (and) our combined joint efforts can not and will not
be defeated."

</P>
<P>
In response to a question whether Kuwait could defend itself
from possible foreign aggression with its present military
strength, he said that now "we have a stronger army, we are
determined to defend ourselves, that's why we have tried to buy
the best weapons in the world and have the best people to train
our solders."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about how long the newly arrived American
troops would stay in Kuwait, he said that "Kuwaitis are always
happy to find their American friends to be with them."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Rao's Resignation and Its Impact (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- P.V. Narasimha Rao's
resignation from the Congress party presidency has caused some
ripples on India's political scene.
</P>
<P>
His move has not only had impact on the Congress party itself
but also on the United Front government as well as the political
situation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Rao announced his decision to resign soon after a Delhi court
issued an order on September 21, summoning him as co-accused in
the Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US dollars to appear before
the court on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, senior Congress leader Sitaram Kesri was
appointed provisional president of the party.
</P>
<P>
Since the failure of the Congress party in the general
elections in April-May this year, some Congressmen including a
number of party leaders have blamed Rao's arbitrary style of
ruling and asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
With the Central Bureau of the Investigation (CBI) making
public some economic scandals involving Rao himself and other
Congress leaders, they further pressed for Rao's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Some Congressmen said that Rao has split the party and without
him the party will be reunited.
</P>
<P>
They have asked those who have left the party since 1969 to
come back.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not an easy job to do. Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram, who was commerce minister in the Rao cabinet, in his
recent statement said that he and his group split from the
Congress earlier would not join the party.
</P>
<P>
Congress new chief Sitaram Kesri said here Tuesday, "We will
have to think about re-admitting those elements who could prove
detrimental to unity."

<TEXT>
<P>
At the moment, the major problem for the Congress is that it is
short of a person who enjoys great prestige and commands universal
respect in the party.
</P>
<P>
Kesri is about 80 years old and his term is not as long as half
a year. The Congress has decided to elect a regular president by
January next year.
</P>
<P>
Fight for the post has already started. It is still a question
mark whether the Congress could be strengthened without Rao.
</P>
<P>
With Rao's resignation, the CBI and various courts will speed
up their investigation and trial proceedings of corruption cases
involving Rao and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Pathak cheating case, the CBI is busy
investigating he pay-off case by the Rao government to buy four
MPs for their support to the then Congress government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party's prestige will be further damaged with more
and more Congress leaders' corruption cases being exposed.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government has maintained its rule due to the
support by the Congress headed by Rao. Any big change in the
Congress leadership will certainly have some impact on the
government's stability.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee of the United Front is expected to meet
soon to discuss the change and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
Rao's attitude was: supporting the United Front government, but
not joining the government.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of the new Congress chief and his colleagues is
yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
Some of the components of the 14-member United Front are
reported to be afraid of the Congress joining the government and
demanding more positions in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Karnataka Chief Minister J.H. Patel said Tuesday, "Mr. Rao's
resignation has created uncertainty not only in the United Front
but also in other parties."

counterpart Ali Osman Muhammad Taha and Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has told Iran that Sudanese planes did not bomb northern
Uganda but did attack southern Sudanese rebels inside Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's embassy in Nairobi said on Tuesday the denial was given
by Sudanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Mustafa Osman
Ismail by telephone on Monday to Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Sheikhul Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan will refute what ever has been published by some news
agencies that Sudanese aircraft attacked Ugandan territory,"
Ismail was quoted by the Iranian embassy statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement quoted Ismail as saying "some rebels in
southern Sudan were initiating a rebel attack against Sudan,
therefore Sudanese aircraft attacked their own territory within
eight miles of the Sudanese boundaries".
</P>
<P>
Ismail pledged, "if it is proved that aircraft mistakingly
raided Ugandan territory, his country will officially apologize
to the government of Uganda."
</P>
<P>
He said under the agreement between Sudan and Uganda mediated by
Iran, Khartoum was ready to send a high level mission to Iran
to take part in a tripartite meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is true we have been bombeed by Sudan ... It is surprising
that even before the ink dries on the agreement we signed they are
bombing us," Amama Mbabazi, Ugandan minister of state for defence
was quoted as saying.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province has
designated eight special tourist routes featuring historical
stories, the Great Wall and beach-side scenery.
</P>
<P>
The new programs are offered specially in response to
Visit-China-1997 perceived by tourism authorities of the central
government, provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since Hebei in north China is the birthplace of ancient culture
of the Three Kingdoms (220-280), which is depicted in one of
China's most famous classics "Romance of the Three Kingdoms",
tourists who are interested in the history of this period will
have a chance to visit a lot of sites of historical interests of
the period.
</P>
<P>
As the province also boasts the best-protected sections of the
world-famous Great Wall, special routes have designed for tourists
to see the numerous historical sites and ancient architecture.
</P>
<P>
The beach-side route will mainly highlight viewing well-bred
birds in reserves along the coast of the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Other special programs include touring the vast grasslands in
the north, where ancient emperors used to go hunting and summer
vacationing, and visiting the numerous temples rich in Buddhist
culture.
</P>
<P>
People interested in Wushu can go to Cangzhou, a birthplace of
the art, to watch and learn in over 100 Wushu schools.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds up Construction of Comfortable Housing Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to speed up
construction of high-quality comfortable houses for thousands of
families and exemplary housing projects will form the basis for
the country's drive for better homes for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Ye Rutang, vice-minister of construction, who is also
responsible for the implementation of comfortable housing
projects, has announced the initiative in Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
He came here to participate in the ground-breaking event for
two exemplary comfortable housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Ye described the real estate sector as still a fledgling
industry in China, and said that greater efforts should be made to
use advanced science and technology to update the country's
traditional housing pattern and bring about a healthy housing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese housing consists of four categories: transitional
houses, practical houses, comfortable living apartments and luxury
houses.
</P>
<P>
Among the four categories of housing, comfortable housing
projects represent the future direction for development of housing
for the masses of residents, said Ye.
</P>
<P>
On the two "exemplary comfortable housing projects for the year
2000", which just started construction, living flats with a total
of floor space of 274,000 square meters and 223,000 sq m will be
built, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Both projects will be built with essential basic community
facilties, including primary schools, kindergartens, cultural and
recreational centers, commercial service networks and property
management offices, to provide good social and management services.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nanjing, construction of 12 other similar exemplary
comfortable housing projects has also been carried out swiftly in
other cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.2 billion yuan has been invested for this construction
throughout China. Flats with a total floor space of one million
sq m are now under construction, and flats with a floor space of
220,000 sq m have been completed, of which 188,000 sq m have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, progress has also been made in scientific research in
this regard. So far, some 440 housing designs have been selected
for recommendation, and trademarks for comfortable housing
projects have won approval from the relevant authorities of the
central government.

<HEADLINE> New Regulation in Guangdong to Enhance Labor Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong, an economically
booming province in south China, will soon introduce a local
regulation to enhance supervision over labor protection, a local
legislator said.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, which will go into effect on
October 1, the province's labor departments will be given more
power to step up supervision over the protection of laborers'
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at implementing the country's Labor Law,
which went into effect on January 1 last year, said Ouyang
Shuqian, deputy director of the Financial and Economic Committee
of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is the first of its kind formulated across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province has been leading China's economic reforms
for more than a decade. As a result, its labor departments started
supervision of labor affairs as early as 1989.
</P>
<P>
And soon after the Labor Law was put into effect, a fairly
complete supervision network, consisting of specific personnel
with the labor departments, was established.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the province has carried out four
large-scale investigations on the implementation of the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 employing enterprises were urged to rectify
their operations, and were obliged to sign more than 2.2 million
labor contracts with their employees, so as to meet requirements
of the law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 8,000 enterprises were found to have
illegally extended the work hours of their workers.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denounces Israeli Opening of Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
said Tuesday that Israel's excavations and opening of a tunnel
along Al Aqsa wall in Arab east Jerusalem was a blatant
provocation of Arab and Moslem sentiments.
</P>
<P>
The 488-meter tunnel runs along the Western Wall, the
retaining wall along the side of the compound housing the Dome of
the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque, which is the third Islamic holy
places.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince said the Israeli actions also violated the
sanctity of the Holy City and the historical Arab and Islamic
architecture there, the English daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli actions, Hassan added, undermines all the
legitimate aspirations of all believers to maintain Jerusalem as
a "spiritual and civilization citadel" as well as a symbol of
hope for future generations.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem symbolizes peace for all the believers in God,"
the Crown Prince said. "The Israeli authorities must not
disregard Arab and Moslem feelings for the city of Jerusalem
as the bond for peace."
</P>
<P>
"It was the cause of wars just as it it the uniting
symbol for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the Washington Declaration in which Israel
recognized Jordan's special role vis-a-vis the holy places in
Jerusalem and all agreements signed that recognize Arab
custodianship over the holy places and ban any annexation of the
Holy City or any change to its status.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Jordan would address "this political crisis
that affects the Holy City and the life of the followers of
the three monotheistic religions."
</P>
<P>
The kingdom would also contact the Israeli authorities after
the ongoing Jewish holiday in the Jewish State, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
A separate government statement also condemned the Israeli
actions in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"As the Jordanian government condemns these measures, which
undermine the structure of Al Aqsa Mosque, change the features
of the Holy City and harms the feelings of Arabs and
Moslems, it asks the Israeli government to adhere to agreements
signed to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the
region," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The government called on all Arab and Islamic countries to
exert "all possible efforts to preserve the Holy City and not
to harm the Al Aqsa Mosque."
</P>
<P>
It also called on the international community, the U.N.
General Assembly and U.N. Security Council and the co-sponsors
of the peace process to "shoulder their moral, political and
legal responsibilities to stop these practices and ensure that
they are not repeated in the future."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company to Set up Branch In Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September (Xinhua) -- The Israel Can Company,
Caniel, has announced its plans to establish a factory in Jordan
in partnership with an unnamed, publicly-traded Jordanian partner
at a total investment of 6 million U.S. dollars, reported The
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which will be the company's first overseas
branch, is to be built in equal partnership between its
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
According to Caniel, the Jordanian company's representative
refused to publicize his company's involvement in the venture. It
engaged in other businesses with Israeli firms.
</P>
<P>
Caniel, a leading local supplier of metal packaging for the
processed canned foods and drinks industries, has 625 employees,
and its turnover last year was 77 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company is also a major supplier of metal packaging
for a variety of industrial and household products.
</P>
<P>
Caniel completed the first half of the year with a slight rise
in sales to 137 million shekels (45.6 million dollars) from 135
million shekels (45 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Caniel's decision to set up a factory in Jordan is in
line with the company's plans to enter new markets. The
Jordanian factory is expected to serve as a bridge to
neighboring Arab countries, with which Israel does not have
trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales turnover from the Jordanian factory, which is
expected to start operations in a year, is forecast at 9 million
dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to give a high
priority to aid-the-poor projects with the help of science and
technology in its central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
It is part of China's effort to solve food and clothing
problems for the country's 65 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, Vice Minister of State Commission for Science and
Technology said today in Beijing that her commission will place 60
percent of its funds in the next five years for science and
technology promotion projects in central and western areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
She said at the opening session of a National Spark Program
Conference that the commission will draft preferential policies in
establishing Spark Program projects in central and western areas,
and providing loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that in the coming five years 100 counties in central
and western areas will be chosen to introduce each year 100 items
of advanced technology from 100 rural enterprises in the highly
developed eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
She added that her commission will also launch 100 Spark
Program projects, and technically upgrade another 100 rural
enterprises in central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old Spark Program, initiated by the government, is
China's first nationwide plan to encourage economic development in
rural areas with the help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Big gaps exist between China's eastern and western areas
because of historical, geographical, economic and social
reasons. Eighty-seven percent of China's 600 poor counties are
located in the central and western areas, and 80 percent of
China's 65 million poor population also reside in the two areas.
</P>
<P>
The three-day National Spark Program Conference will draft
concrete measures for implementation of Spark Program Development
Plan during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, China will encourage the technical
advancement of rural enterprises, especially those high and new
technology regional pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The country will also establish 100 science and technology
intensive zones during the same period.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia to End Free Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- From the first day of next
month, the Zambian government will start sale of its pool houses
to sitting tenants as part of its new housing policy to support
home ownership, thus making free housing the past.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in the 1960s, Zambians have enjoyed free
housing or housing allowances.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is one of the five biggest copper-producing countries
in the world, and copper earned it large amounts of foreign
exchanges and propped up the generous social welfare for a decade
after the independence.
</P>
<P>
However, since mid-1970s copper prices in the world market has
been falling and the country's copper output has been dropping.
Hence the country's economy has suffered badly and the decreasing
copper revenue can't prop the generous allowances any more.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays many houses are in a deplorable state of repair due
to lack of proper maintenance and care but councils have no fund
to repair them.
</P>
<P>
Free housing policy has reduced the individual's propensity to
purchase or build his own house. Low rents have left housing
construction in a moribund state.
</P>
<P>
Due to desparity between urban and rural areas, more and more
people are flowing into cities. About 40 percent of Zambians are
living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The task facing Zambia in housing is mammoth and the country
is not only faced with an enormous housing backlog but also lacks
an effective housing delivery system.
</P>
<P>
The solution to the housing problem is to commercialize houses
and to give incentives to induviduals and institutions to invest
directly into housing or directly through an approved housing
finance system.
</P>
<P>
Houses are free of charges but once you are retired or out of
work you have to move out of the houses. Many retired people are
forced to go back to their original villages and thus a lot of
Zambians have been calling the government to sell them houses.
</P>
<P>
Many employers have urged the government to repeal the law
which obliges them to provide their employees with accommodation
or housing allowances.
</P>
<P>
The idea of selling houses to the sitting tenants was mooted
in 1992. As part of consultative process on the issue, workshops
were held in every province and interested persons from all walks
of life were invited to the workshops to air their opinions.
</P>
<P>
These workshops led to the national conference on housing held
in 1995 and a national housing policy was announced by President
Frederick Chiluba early this year.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the sitting tenants to buy houses the government
will provide some loans for them and offer considerable
discounts.
</P>
<P>
Successful applicants have been offered a discount of two
percent for each year served in the civil service up to a maximum
of 40 percent of the purchase price of the house.
</P>
<P>
Sitting tenants with good track record of rent payment for a
continuous period of not less than 20 years will get an
additional 20 percent discount. Those who shall pay the full
purchase price within 60 days from the date of offer will enjoy a
further 20 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
These having no intention to purchase the house shall pay
rent, which will not be put under control under the national
housing policy.
</P>
<P>
Two ad hoc committees have already been set up to supervise
the sale of the pool houses.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced that civil servants, retirees and
retrenchees who will not benefit from the sale of the pool or
council houses will be given priority to acquire land and loans
to build houses.
</P>
<P>
The govenment valuation department in carrying out the
valuation exercise will take into account age, physical condition
and supply and demand of the houses to be sold, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
The council shall open a "housing development revolving fund
account" where part of the proceeds from sale of houses shall be
deposited for continued housing development and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The government will not allow illegal tenants and those
conducting illicit business in council houses, harboring
criminals or engaging in criminal activities to buy houses.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Hits Lijiang, Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring
5.7 on the Richter Scale hit quake-stricken Lijiang County in
southwest China's Yunnan Province early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The quake happened at exactly the same spot as an earthquake in
February which left 200 people dead.
</P>
<P>
A report from the local seismological monitoring network
indicated the earthquake occurred at 3:24 am, Beijing time, and
the epicenter of the earthquake is located at 27.2 degrees north
latitude and 100.3 degrees east longitude, the same place where a
magnitude 7.0 earthquake swept on February 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
In the three poverty-ridden mountainous villages, where the
epicenter is located, some houses were seen to have collapsed, and
cracks have been found in many buildings, but so far there is no
information on casualties or deaths.
</P>
<P>
Local officials also reported a landslide in an ethnic minority
county about 100 kilometers away from the seat of Lijiang County
at dawn this morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the local government were sent to the
disaster-hit areas, and measures were taken to monitor aftershocks
and help local residents to rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake in February of earlier this year killed at least
200 people and caused a damage of several billion yuan in Lijiang
County.

BELGRADE -- Bosnian Serbs today threatened to declare the
results of the September 14 general election invalid unless ballot
irregularities were cleared up.

HARARE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest financial

economic growth in 1996 following last year's disastrous
performance, during which GDP growth fell by three percent.

UDC said given another wet season this summer, growth during

The company, a market leader in the provision of lease hire

growth, but warned a delicate balance had to be struck between
fiscal and monetary policies to sustain the predicted recovery.

Economists have estimated GDP growth in 1996 to reach seven

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka, World's largest Cinnamon Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 25 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka, famous for a
variety of spices for centuries, is the largest cinnamon exporting
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Spices of economic importance in Sri Lanka are cinnamon,
cloves, cardamom, pepper, nutmeg and mace. Almost all spices are
grown in home gardens, except cinnamon and cardamom that are grown
on a commercial scale.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's annual exports of spices to the world market is
around 13,500 metric tons (MT) which amounts to around 3 percent
of the quantity traded in the world market. Cinnamon constitutes
almost 65 percent of volume of export of spices from Sri Lanka and
has for long enjoyed 90 percent of the world's cinnamon market.
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon played a significant role in the island country's
history. A treaty entered into by the King of Ceylon with the
Portuguese in the 16th Century requested the Ceylonese to furnish
the Portuguese with 250,000 ponds of cinnamon annually. This
testifies that the country's annual production of cinnamon at that
time was over a thousand tons.
</P>
<P>
The world's major cinnamon importers are Mexico, USA and other
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, there has been a rapid expansion in the
export of cinnamon. The availability of a climate that facilitates
the growth of diverse spices and a relatively inexpensive and
skilled work force has contributed to the rapid development of
this sector, according to Export Development Board sources.
</P>
<P>
The annual average volume of export of Cinnamon in 1980's was
7,100 MT. And it increased to an average of 8,100 MT in the
1990-1994 period with a peak of 9,850 MT in 1995. This indicates
cinnamon production has been increasing steadily in the last two
decades, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in production has been achieved largely by
improving productivity of the existing lands, which stands at
16,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the assistance schemes for replanting,
rehabilitation and productivity improvement may also be credited
for this increasing trend.
</P>
<P>
Economic analyses here show that cinnamon is as good as tea for
 returns on investment per rupee and per unit area of land.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day Fourth Meeting of the International Spice Group
sponsored by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development Board in
collaboration with the Sri Lankan Export Development Board is
going on in Colombo and continues till Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Meeting is reviewing the world demand and supply position,
trends in individual markets for specific spices, developments
affecting trade in spices and implication of the Uruguay Round
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food K.
Wickremaratne said at the opening ceremony that the meeting will
provide a forum for spice producing and consuming countries to
exchange views and information on production, export marketing and
consumption trends and to recommend solutions for short and
long-term implementation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that by hosting this international event
in the country, the Sri Lankan spice trade which is mainly focused
on the export market will benefit from the subject matter that is
to be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Bombardments in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel continued overnight and
this morning shellings at suspected hilltop bases of Lebanese
Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon, causing damages to civilian
houses, security sources in the area said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery in the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon sporadicly fired this morning at Jebal al-Rafih in
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Proinve of Apple, a mountain area opposite the
Israeli buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces in the position of Souida on the front line of
the border strip swept its vicinities with 12.7mm machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Since the weekend, the Israeli forces in south Lebanon have
concentrated its bombardments at targets in Iglim Al-Toffah, which
is often used by Moslem guerrillas as a springboard for launching
attacks at the 850-square-kilometer buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
When the bombardment was at its height on Tuesday, the Israeli
forces used cluster shells and inflaming bombs, causing several
big fires in the vicinities of Arab Salim town and Iglim
Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigades of the Civil Defense were forced to rush to the
areas in order to put out of the fires, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets and helicopters carried frequent reconnaissance
flights over south Lebanon in the daytime of Tuesday and over
the night, especially over Iglim Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that they launched an attack at 7:30 p.m. at Tuesday
night at a patrol of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
that one group of its fighters carried out the attack on the
road between the towns of Deir Siryan and Alman in the occupied
border strip.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla organization said that an armored personnel
carrier of the SLA patrol was destroyed in the fighting, and
the crew inside were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the SLA militia confirmed this morning the
guerrilla operation against its patrol, and admitted that four
militiamen were injured in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas announced earlier that they thwarted two
infiltrating attempts of the Israeli occupation forces from
Souida towards the town of Habboush over Monday night and on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli client militia's radio claimed that two Hezbollah
guerrillas were killed in the clash with Israeli forces near
Souida over Monday night.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investments Flow to Malaysia in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct
investments (FDI) flows to Malaysia increased from 4.3 billion US
dollars in 1994 to 5.8 billion last year, according to Malaysia's
official news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was the second largest recipient of FDI in Asia last
year after China which received a whopping 37.5 billion dollars,
Bernama quoted the World Investment Report (WIR) released
yesterday by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investments by Malaysian companies overseas were
equally impressive, almost doubling from 1.8 billion dollars in
1994 to 2.6 billion last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian firms were increasingly participating in the world
market not only through trade but through FDI, with a steady
upward trend from a mere 532 million dollars in 1990 to an
impressive 2.6 billion in 1995, WIR principal author Karl Sauvant
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It really shows that Malaysian companies are becoming active
players in the world market," investing mainly in the region but
slowly venturing out to Europe and Africa, Sauvant said.
</P>
<P>
The outward investment showed that Malaysian companies were
acquiring tangible assets which would make them competitive
internationally and allow them to be successful in the foreign
market, Sauvant commented.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, last year four ASEAN countries --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand -- attracted 14
billion dollars compared with the 8.6 billion in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Upgrade Telephone Numbers to Eight Digits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the north China
harbor city neighboring Beijing, is to become the country's fourth
city to have eight-digit telephone number. The extra-digit will be
introduced in the first quarter or 1997, said the journal China
Telecomworld.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's telecommunications business has experienced a soaring
growth in infrastructure construction over the past few years. The
city has a switching capacity of one million lines in
program-controlled telephone, 180,000 lines for mobile phones, and
700 terminals for long-distance phone.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the city has more than 900,000 telephone
users, increasing its telephone density to 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the seven-digit phone number system, which has a limited
number ability, has hindered the telecom industry from developing
at a more rapid speed, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
The city's plan of telephone number upgrading has been approved
by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the watchdog of
the country's telephone business.
</P>
<P>
At present, only three Chinese cities, Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, have eight-digit telephone numbers in use.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Attracts Little Foreign Investment in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh received a poor 125
million US dollars in 1995 as foreign direct investment (FDI)
although a significant rise from 1994 level of 11 million dollars
poured into the country.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted a World Investment Report as saying
that despite an increase in absolute dollar terms, levels of FDI
flows into South Asian countries including Bangladesh remain quite
modest, at 2.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the world FDI surged by 40 percent to
a record 315 billion dollars in 1995, but most of the capital --
203 billion dollars -- went to the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Bangladesh's poor performance in FDI, an
economist at Dhaka university said, "This is due to various
factors. Bangladesh still has a negative image in the outer world
while the administration and legal system remain problematic."
</P>
<P>
The country would achieve a higher amount of foreign private
capital if the government takes some bold steps, addressing the
law and order situation and legal system, he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Still On Track to Achieve Target, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy is
"on track" to achieve the seven to eight percent growth forecast
for this year, despite a drop in trade figures in August, Minister
for Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong has said.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times reported today that Yeo said at the opening
of an American company's disk media plant here Tuesday that the
electronics sector is also set to stage a comeback in the early
months of next year.
</P>
<P>
"The trade figures are going to be fairly volatile for the next
few months. From the present trend, I think we are still pretty
much on track for the seven to eight percent," the minister said,
referring to the revised growth for the economy this year.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government said last month that its earlier
estimate for economic growth this year had been trimmed by half a
percentage point to between seven and eight percent. This was due
to uncertainty over the impact of the global electronics slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also said that based on the discussions between the
government and the industry leaders, the government expected to
see some recovery taking place early next year, in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
"It should translate into higher trade growth for us as well,"
he said. "So we are watching the first half of next year with
great interest, just as the companies are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports have been see-sawing over
the past three months as the key manufacturing indicator fell 6.3
percent last month, rose 6.3 percent in July and declined 6.1
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said that the slowdown in the electronics industry was
expected. "The electronics downturn can be very rapid, just as the
upturn can be equally rapid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Electronics exports accounted for about two-thirds of
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports while electronics output
contributes about 12 percent to the country's Gross Domestic
Product.

Rong said Sino-Peruvian relations have grown remarkably since
the two countries established diplomatic ties nearly 25 years ago.

cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total trade volume between China and Peru reached
600 million US dollars, according to Rong.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said he believes China-Peru cooperation has
broad prospects as long as the two countries conduct extensive
exchanges and learn from each other's strong points.
</P>
<P>
Torres said Peru and China now enjoy very good relations in
political, cultural and other fields. This, he added, provides
favorable conditions for the two countries to further develop
their economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries take the
opportunity of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the
diplomatic relations to expand their cooperation, particularly
economic and trade ties.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Bank Launches High-Return Philippines Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The OCBC Asset Management
of the OCBC (Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) group, one of
Singapore's Big Four banking groups, launched today its Savers
Philippines Fund, Singapore's only open-ended fund which focuses
its investments on the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The fund aims to achieve medium- to long-term capital
appreciation by investing in the securities of companies with
primary listings in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Retail investors may find this fund interesting as they may
have seen positive news about the Philippines in the papers lately
but find it difficult to invest there because of a lack of
information, and also because brokers generally don't cover the
Manila stock market," OCBCAM executive director Tay Boon Kuan
said.
</P>
<P>
Tay said that she believed that the timing is right at the
moment as the Philippines is undergoing significant economic and
structural changes and is entering a period of sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank has forecast that the Philippines'
Gross Domestic Product will grow at an annual rate of about 5.5
percent this year and 5.7 percent next year, up from less than one
percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Savers Philippines Fund will initially invest in those
sectors which would benefit most from the growing Philippine
economy and rising affluence. However, exports pointed out that
the fund belonged to the high-risk and high-return category and
might not be for the faint-hearted.
</P>
<P>
The fund is the eighth country-specific fund to enter the local
unit trust market, which has a total of more than 60 funds. Some
of the other country funds are devoted to investment in Malaysia,
Japan, the United States, India and China.

BANGKOK, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States prefers
that the admission of new members into the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) should be further delayed, a US official said

The commission will file a report of recommendations to US
President Bill Clinton and Congress in the weeks before the

BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs today
threatened to declare the results of the September 14 general
election invalid unless ballot irregularities were cleared up.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha gave the warning at a
news conference after meeting Robert Frowick, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
was responsible for running the election.
</P>
<P>
Buha, chief of the leading Bosnian Serb party, charged that
230,000 refugee votes came in from abroad after the polls closed
on September 14 and without proper documentation.
</P>
<P>
The validity of these ballot papers was therefore in doubt and
there could be a margin of error involving 130,000 votes in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Biljana Plavsic the president elect of the Bosnian Serb entity
in Bosnia, Republika Sprska, has already written a letter to
Frowick protesting at the result of the ballot. She said these
votes had altered the make-up of the new Bosnian assembly.
</P>
<P>
She warned that if the irregularities were not cleared up, she
may not keep her promise to help the OSCE organize municipal
elections scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
The prestige of the OSCE would be damaged by the irregularities
in the election, the president said.
</P>
<P>
But Frowick said the Bosnian election had been an extremely
difficult election to run and some errors in the collection and
counting of the votes had to be expected.
</P>
<P>
Given the importance of the September 14 election, any problems
would be sorted out before the election result was declared final,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls For Mass Protest Against Opening Of Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Following an emergency
meeting in Gaza Tuesday night, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
called on Palestinians to stage mass demonstrations and
commercial strikes in protest against the opening of a tunnel
under Temple Mount, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Arafat declared
furiously, "This is a crime, a big crime, against our religious
and holy places. And it is completely against the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"It is a breach of what has been agreed upon and what has been
signed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, leading to the Western Wall under Temple Mount in
the Old City of Jerusalem, was opened on Monday night. It sparked
a fierce reactions from Palestinians in east Jerusalem Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say that the tunnel endangers the security and
integrity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third largest in the Islamic
world, and of the foundations of the Islamic structures existing
above the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian schools in east Jerusalem will also shut down in
protest and tens of thousands of youngsters are expected to join
the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLO observer to the U.N. called on the Security
Council to close the tunnel. In a letter to the Security Council
president and U.N. secretary general, the PLO observer pointed
out that the Israel's action is obviously another measure aimed
at Judaization of the Old City and the whole Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Curb Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will
control lending through its Bangkok international banking
facilities (BIBF) beginning later this month, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Out-in lending (loans from abroad for local clients) will be
fixed at a percentage of out-out lending (funds from aboard loaned
to third parties abroad) in a bid to reduce Thailand's exposure to
risk from short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
The latest step would encourage Thailand's development as a
financial center as out-out lending by the BIBF would be promoted,
said Central Bank Governor Rerngchai Maraganond.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of out-in and out-out lending had been fixed and
would be submitted for Finance Ministry approval in a few days,
Rerngchai said, adding that the Thai Bankers Association had
already agreed to the terms.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank would allow the BIBF to provide more out-in
loans in baht, he said. It would also ask the 15 Thai banks to
submit their records of offshore fund raising for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank earlier said that the majority of the
country's short-term funds had been recorded through the BIBF
since its establishment in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Build Three More Research Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
planning to build three scientific and technological research
centers in addition to the existing one at Serpong, West Java, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing the four research centers is a real need for our
country as we prepare for the next century," State Minister of
Research and Technology B.J. Habibie said at a hearing with the
House of Representatives Tuesday, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The three centers would be set up in Bandung (West Java),
Pare-Pare (South Sulawesi) and Ambon (Maluku) respectively,
Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
The center in Bandung, where the plant of Indonesia's
aircraft-making company IPTN is located, would be for aerospace
research. The one in Pare-Pare would be dedicated to
interplanetary and outer space and the one in Ambon to maritime
research, he added.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, however, could not yet say when the centers would be
set up and how much money would be spent on them.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's only existing research center in Serpong is engaged
in multi-disciplinary research work such as biotechnology, nuclear
power, energy, thermo-dynamics, electronics and construction
tests.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Raise Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will raise exchange
rates while further cutting interest rates in the coming months, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review said the adjustments were part of
the State Bank's plan for the coming year, which would be
submitted to the government for approval.
</P>
<P>
Cao Si Kiem, Governor of the State Bank, was quoted as saying
that the adjustment to the exchange rate was necessary as Vietnam
had suffered a large trade deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the trade deficit for the
January-August period stood at 3.26 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Kiem did not say to what level the exchange rate would
be raised from the current rate of 11,020 Vietnamese dong for one
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said the real purchasing power of the dong had decreased by
32 percent since 1993, while the exchange rate between the dong
and U.S. dollar rose only two percent.
</P>
<P>
Kiem told a bankers' conference in Hanoi last week that the
exchange rate would be "raised gradually to save the economy from
shock."
</P>
<P>
The State Bank itself would buy the greenback to create a
higher demand for the currency and improve the foreign reserve
funds of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review said that while some supported
the planned increase in the exchange rate, others were concerned
about the impact of deferred letters of credit on imported goods.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov today repeated his nation's opposition
to the eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York,
Primakov said Russia did not "accept either the idea of the
expansion of the NATO military infrastructure to the area of the
former and now extinct Warsaw Treaty, or the efforts to transform
this alliance into an axis of a new European system."
</P>
<P>
His remarks are regarded as a new warning to the United States
and its European allies who are actively promoting the process of
NATO's eastwards enlargement.
</P>
<P>
United States officials disclosed that the 16-nation NATO
planned to call a summit next spring or summer to name the first
former Warsaw Pact countries to be accepted by the Western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia accepted that NATO would have an important
place in European security but it believed the alliance should
coexist with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Says "No" to Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
would not tolerate, under any circumstance, foreign intervention
in the country's internal affairs, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono told the house of
representatives during a hearing Tuesday that this was a principle
which can not be broken in any situation, official sources here
said today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fundamental principle which the government always
clings to," he said when asked about the controversy surrounding
Washington's plan to reconsider the sale of f-16 jet fighters to
Indonesia due to alleged human rights violations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless he maintained that in defending the principle,
Jakarta would not go so far as to say "go to hell with your aid".
</P>
<P>
Jakarta is currently in the process of negotiating the purchase
of several f-16s which Washington had offered it.
</P>
<P>
However, several congressmen in Washington raised objections to
the sale because of the alleged human rights violations in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono reasserted Jakarta's position that it has no qualms
about the deal falling through.

<HEADLINE> EU Makes Breakthrough in Economic, Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) economic
and trade ministers have reached consensus on some issues of a new
monetary system, paving the way to an economic and monetary union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting Saturday in Dublin, Ireland,
participants set the legal underpinnings of "Euro," the single
currency to be launched in 1999, by agreeing to make it the sole
legitimate currency among qualifying EU members.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also laid the basis for the operation of a new
exchange rate system linking the single currency to non-members of
the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank would then not be able to support
non-EMU members should they be hit by a financial crisis,
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the budget stability pact, proposed by German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel, was an important measure to ensure
the credibility and stability of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
EMU members which run deficits above 3 percent of the gross
domestic product would be punished. But details of possible
punishments remain unresolved, such as the size of fines.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht treaty, EU members can join the EMU only
after meeting tough criteria for budget deficits, debt and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts are sceptical that many EU members will
be able to meet the criteria. Even Germany has acknowledged its
public deficit will surpass the ceiling of 3 percent of the GDP in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Many EU members, seeing that the single currency will come into
effect at the scheduled time, have taken an austere financial
policy to make themselves qualified members as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops Against Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States dollar
slipped to the lower half of 109 yen in Tokyo early Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
That follows an overnight drop in New York in response to the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board's inaction on key short-term interest
rates, the Kyodo news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 109.32-35 yen at 9 a.m.,
slightly up from late Tuesday's quote of 109.15-25 yen in New
York, but down from 109.70-80 yen in London late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 109.67-70 yen at 5 p.m. in Tokyo on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the dollar, however, had solid support at the
downside and they expected monetary authorities from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations, who were scheduled to meet in
Washington on Saturday, to agree to cooperate in supporting a
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved marginally in New York before the Federal
Reserve announced its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee
had left the target for the federal funds rate intact at 5.25
percent, and the discount rate at 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. currency dropped by a half yen minutes after the
Federal Reserve Board's decision, apparently reflecting
speculation that a further interest rate gap was unlikely between
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As market players factored in a 0.25 percentage point rise in
the rates, the Federal Reserve's inaction surprised the market,
prompting players to unload their holdings of U.S. currency,
traders said.

DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) will announce "fresh agitation programs"

<HEADLINE> Exxon Affiliates to Team up on Materials Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese oil companies
affiliated with Exxon Corp. of the United States will join forces
in procuring materials and ordering engineering work, the Kyodo
News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted a spokesman of Esso Sekiyu K.K., a Tokyo branch of
Exxon, as saying that the company and two other Exxon affiliates
General Sekiyu K.K. and Tonen Corp. will set up an office on
October 1 to jointly order service station construction, procure
refinery equipment and maintenance services, and purchase
materials for producing and transporting oil products.
</P>
<P>
The move was an effort to beef up competition amid rising crude
oil prices and slumping gasoline prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources estimated the partnership would reduce each
company's costs by 200 million yen (1.83 million US dollars) to
500 million yen (4.59 million dollars) in the first year.
</P>
<P>
Esso spokesman added that the three companies would persuade an
Exxon affiliate in Singapore to join them in procuring materials
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Esso and General Sekiyu are already supplying oil products to
each other, while General Sekiyu and Tonen are jointly operating
crude oil tankers, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Says Indonesia's Literacy Up, But Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's success in
fighting illiteracy may have won it international praise, but it
is being undermined by the poor reading habits of its people,
President Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
"At independence in 1945, 90 out of 100 people were illiterate.
Fifty years later, we had brought the illiterate rate down, and by
1995 only 14 out of 100 people could not read," Soeharto said in a
speech to mark the International Literacy Day in Bogor, 60 km
south of Jakarta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, we are concerned about the poor reading
habits of our people. Compared to advanced countries in Asia, our
reading habits are poor,' the local press today quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the government has declared May the "Book Month"
and September "I Love Reading Month," and now it is up to the
people to take advantage of these campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot instill reading habits if there isn't any reading
material around,' he said, urging the Ministry of Education and
Culture and other government agencies to step up related efforts.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition of Tibetan Folk Culture Held in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of nearly 2,000
rare items of Tibetan folk culture is being held in Lhasa, capital
city of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits are from the collection of Ye Xingsheng, a painter
who has been living in Tibet for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
With money earned from his paintings, Ye devotes himself
entirely to collecting antiquities from business people in the
well-known Bargor Street of Lhasa, and from roving pedlars.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the exhibition, with various and abundant
rare items about Tibetan folk culture, displays items rarely
seen. The items tell about Tibet's ancient civilization, folk
utensils, Tangka (or scroll paintings), architectural techniques
and eating habits.
</P>
<P>
Many of the items indicate that Tibet has been in close contact
with the inland areas of China for the past 1,300 years.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to build a folk museum in Tibet, so that all these
folk items can be well preserved in Tibet forever," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He said the splendid folk culture not only belongs to Tibet,
but also to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"We are duty-bound to let more people know about Tibet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last until October 10 this year.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo Formulates Regulation on Funeral and Interment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo City in east China's
Zhejiang Province is about to bring in a new regulation aimed at
halting superstitious burial rites and encouraging cremation.
</P>
<P>
The city has formulated a local regulation to take effect on
October 1, to step up cremation, reduce burials, stop
superstitious funeral and interment customs, and advocating
economical and civilized ways for families to lay their departed
to rest.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo is among the first group of coastal cities in the
country that have been opened up to the outside world. But its
outstanding economic achievements are in sharp contrast to its
backward traditional funeral and interment customs.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 percent of the city's deceased are cremated, far below
the national average. At the same time, there has been a rampant
occupation of land for burials.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, compulsory cremation will be
carried out throughout the city's administrative territory, except
for some remote mountainous areas and islands.
</P>
<P>
In the areas where cremation is carried out, ground burials
will not be allowed, and coffins can not be produced, sold or
used. Cemeteries and halls containing the ashes of the deceased
can be built.
</P>
<P>
However, the regulation stresses respect for the funeral and
interment customs of local minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that land must be saved as much
as possible, even in places where ground burials are
permitted. Tombs will have to be built in arid hills or other land
not fit for cultivation.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Tries Enterprise-Oriented Operation in Land Management (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A land management experiment
that has transformed thousands of hectares of wasteland in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been
declared a success.
</P>
<P>
Now officials say that enterprise-oriented operations in land
use could be one answer to reclaiming unused land throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The region, in China's northwest corner, introduced the
experiment in 1993. It involves the introduction of an
enterprise-oriented operation -- the establishment of land
development companies -- for land management.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the land development company of the region's Awat
County signed a contract with county authorities to develop 7,000
hectares of state-owned wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The company raised funds to reclaim the wasteland and transform
it into farmland with trees, irrigation canals and roads, and then
re-leased the land to farmers, united households and institutions
for agricultural cultivation by charging 1,500 yuan to 4,500 yuan
per hectare each year.
</P>
<P>
The company is also responsible for providing related services
to land renters when necessary.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the company handed over one million
yuan obtained from its land operation earnings to the local
financial department, according to the stipulations of the
contract. This sum of money was only one third of the company's
total earnings for that year.
</P>
<P>
The experiment is the first step in China to hand over large
tracts of state-owned land in rural areas to specialized
enterprises with independent legal status for land development.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials a dozen land development companies
have already been set up across the region since 1993, when the
autonomous region started to allow some prefectures to pilot the
practice. These companies are now responsible for the development
of 14,000 hectares of land in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Tries Enterprise-Oriented Operation in Land Management (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the pilot schemes local governments gave land development
companies greater decision-making power for the development of
large tracts of state-owned land, carrying lease terms ranging
from 30 years to 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The companies are allowed to again lease the land to farmers,
united households or institutions for cultivation by charging
appropriate prices.
</P>
<P>
Local governments, which are the true property rights
representives for the state-owned land, do not interfere in the
legal economic operations of the land development companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China on October 1, 1949, the rights
for the operation of state-owned land in rural areas has been in
the hands of relevant local governments in different areas,
forcing farmers --land users-- to have direct economic relations
with local governments without any intermediary links. The system
has proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The past practice of not separating land property rights and
land operation rights made it difficult to conduct open and fair
transfer of the rights for development and operation of wasteland
according to the law of value.
</P>
<P>
The combination of administrative and enterprise functions in
the development and operation of wasteland has caused severe
losses for state-owned land assets. Because of this factor,
Xinjiang suffered the loss of 430 million yuan in its state-owned
land assets each year.
</P>
<P>
The latest practice of establishing land development companies
has effectively curbed this trend, and made it easier to solve
many problems in wasteland development, including the division of
profits, development quality, scale of efficiency and repayment of
loans, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Authorities with the regional state-owned land administration
have submitted a report calling for the spreading of the practice
of introducing enterprise-oriented operations -- land development
companies -- for land development on a larger scale, especially in
reclaiming wasteland in west China.
</P>
<P>
If this suggestion is adopted, the 400,000 hectares of
wasteland reclaimed over the past decade in Xinjiang alone will
make the region's total local finance increase by 50 percent a
year, said the officials.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Report: Investment Flows Grow in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) in Asian countries boomed in 1995 on the back of
deregulation, privatization and the growth of multinational
companies headquartered in the region, a United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries in Asia accounted for almost two-thirds of
total FDI flows into all developing countries last year, said the
UNCTAD report, which was released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total investment inflows in 1995 surged by 40 percent to an
unprecedented 315 billion U.S. dollars over the previous year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The FDI volume to Asia's developing countries rose by 21
percent to 65 billion U.S. dollars last year. China was the
largest recipient, with FDI inflows of 37.5 billion U.S. dollars,
up 10 percent from 1994's figures.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia received the second largest FDI inflow, 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars, up 35 percent from the previous year, while
Singapore ranked third with 5.3 billion U.S. dollars, down from
5.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said Indonesia came in fourth, with an FDI inflow of
4.5 billion U.S. dollars. Thailand was fifth with 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Developing Asia is rapidly becoming home to multinational
corporations which are increasing their FDI flows, especially
within Asia, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, FDI outflows in Asian developing countries amounted to
43 billion U.S. dollars, representing 90 percent of all developing
countries' outflows, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the sheer size and dynamism of the
region has made developing Asia most important to multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
This is accentuated by liberalization and deregulation policies
that a number of countries in the region are pursuing, added the
report.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Won't Resign, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin has no
plans to resign even though he will have a heart operation soon,
says Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark to the Interfax news agency on
Tuesday. while visiting a textile company in Vyshny Volochyok, 295
kilometers northwest of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin "reacts painfully (to talk of resignation),
does not accept it at all, and in general such a thing is out of
the question now."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister met with the President Yeltsin earlier
Tuesday at Moscow Central Clinical Hospital, where Yeltsin is
preparing for a heart bypass operation. Their meeting lasted about
40 minutes and documents were signed during it, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Kremlin said the two Russian leaders discussed
the situation in the breakaway Chechen republic and in the Far
Eastern Maritime territory, where large-scale strikes are
currently under way.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on the same
day that a medical council was due to meet on Wednesday noon at
the hospital to discuss Yeltsin's coming heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
The council was expected to discuss "the tactics of preparing
the operation on Yeltsin, its time and the scale of surgery," the
spokesman said. He added that the meeting would involve "quite a
broad circle of specialists" and the famous U.S. heart surgeon
Michael DeBakey would take part.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky once again criticised the article published by
the Financial Times of London, which claimed that Yeltsin's
capacity to work was extremely limited due to his heart trouble.

<HEADLINE> China Launches 43m US Dollar Priority Ocean Research Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to spend 360 million
yuan (43 million US dollars) on a five-year ocean research program.
</P>
<P>
The top priority work is aimed at paving the way for oceanic
development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech research has been included in China's "Program
863", a key long-term high technology research and development
program, according to the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-year Plan period(1996-2000) China will
focus its oceanic hi-tech research on three main fields, ocean
monitoring technology, oceanic biology, and seabed surveys and
development.
</P>
<P>
Three subject groups have been set up to take charge of the
research work in the three fields, which is a starting point for
the development of oceanic hi-tech research.
</P>
<P>
The pace of oceanic development is expected to be accelerated
in the 21st century, and the capabilities in the fields of oceanic
resources, environment, and disaster relief rely heavily on the
level of oceanic hi-technology.
</P>
<P>
China is a big ocean nation with a sea area of three million
square kilometers and bountiful oceanic resources. The output of
China's oceanic industry hit 230 billion yuan last year. But China
has already had a population of 1.2 billion which is expected to
grow to 1.6 billion in the mid part of the next century, making it
an urgent task for China to develop hi-technologies to make better
use of its oceanic resources.
</P>
<P>
Program 863, launched a decade ago, is focused on the seven key
fields of biology, space, information, laser, automation, energy,
and new materials. The plan is designed to provide advanced
science and technology for the national economy and defense.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Executives' Pay Jumps 32 Percent in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Pay and perks earned by
Canadian bosses have risen by nearly a third over the last three
years, while workers salaries have barely kept up with inflation,
according to a survey released today.
</P>
<P>
Top executives now earn an average of 566,000 U.S. dollars a
year, with increased use of bonuses to reward strong corporate
performance helping push up average salaries by almost 150,000
dollars since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The survey of chief executives of 268 of Canada's largest
companies shows that chief executives are gaining a greater
portion of their pay checks as bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Their basic salaries have jumped just 19 percent in the past
three years, from an average 305,000 to 365,000 dollars, while
incentive pay has grown by 61 percent, which increased from an
average 158,000 to 255,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
But wage increases for ordinary Canadian workers have fallen
behind or barely kept up with inflation, now running at 1.4
percent.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen told his Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda
Tuesday that there is no change in the basic policy of China to
develop good relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also vice-premier, made the remarks during their
talks at the U.N. headquarters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the words and deeds recently of some Japanese
politicians had badly hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people. Paying homage to the Yashukuni Shrine and seeking excuses
for militarism had aroused great indignation among the people of
China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the way of understanding and treating the
Japanese military invasion in history was always a very sensitive
and important issue which was related to the political foundation
of the Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
He urged Tokyo to follow the principles set in the Japan-China
Joint Declaration and forbid anything that would harm the feeling
of the Chinese people and the political foundations of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated that the Diaoyu Islands and the affiliated
islands had been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the
Chinese position on the issue was consistent and firm.
</P>
<P>
Taking the interests of the whole into account, Beijing and
Tokyo had agreed to put aside the issue for future settlement when
they decided to normalize their diplomatic ties in 1972.
</P>
<P>
But recently some Japanese right-wing activists had repeatedly
landed on the islands and built installations illegally, violating
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of China.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the Japanese government take effective measures
to eliminate the harmful influence of these acts and prevent such
things from happening again."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Ikeda said that the Japanese
government attached great importance to Japan-China relations,
and there had been no change in the country's policy of friendship
toward China.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past, Japan's external aggression and
colonial rule brought great suffering to the people of many
countries, and the people in China in particular. Japan should
acknowledge the fact and undergo a thorough self-examination on
it. It should also apologize to victimized countries.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Tomiichi Murayama once made a formal
statement on this issue. And the government of Hashimoto had fully
carried over the understanding and position of its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Based on this stand, Ikeda said, the Japanese government would
continue to develop its relations with China and deal in earnest
with the homage paid by Japanese high-ranking officials at the
Yasukuni Shrine, where the memorial plaques of seven class-A war
criminals are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his government would follow the principles
and spirit of the Japan-China Joint Declaration and the
Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said the Japanese side hoped to have the disputes settled
in a calm manner. The Japanese government would neither get
involved in nor support the right-wing activities, which, it
believed, would damage relations between Japan and China and
should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Qian also urged Japan to take a responsible attitude towards
the issue of chemical weapons left over in China by the Japanese
aggressors during the Second World War, and to speed up the
settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said his country attached importance to the issue and was
willing to hold formal consultations with China on it in
November.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Holds Working Meeting with Chernomyrdin in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin, who
is awaiting a heart by-pass operation, held a regular weekly
working meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
His doctors are to meet Wednesday to decide whether and when to
perform the operation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and the prime minister met for about 40 minutes and
discussed "a broad range of issues," especially socio-economic
problems, regional by-elections and the situation in rebel
Chechnya, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The two men were particularly concerned about the
socio-economic difficulties in the far-eastern Maritime (Primorye)
territory and decided to send a governmental team there to
invstigate the problems, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry today allocated 450 billion rubles (853
million U.S. dollars) to help overcome the energy crisis there,
according to an Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that a team of doctors will meet
Yeltsin at noon (0800 GMT) Wednesday and discuss a possible date
for his planned heart operation.
</P>
<P>
"The council (of doctors) will discuss the date, tactics and
the extent of the forthcoming operation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old ailing Yeltsin has been at the Central Clinical
Hospital since September 13 for what aides say are tests ahead of
the planned heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already handed over some powers to Chernomyrdin and
said he would put the prime minister in complete charge during his
surgery.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Yeltsin would be replaced by the prime
minister in case of incapacity or death.

<HEADLINE> Retail Commerce Diversifies in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China's retail sector,
dominated for years by large and medium sized department stores,
is undergoing a shopping revolution.
</P>
<P>
The rise of chain stores and specialized markets have created a
competitive challenge for the big stores, market analysts point
out.
</P>
<P>
The traditional department stores, which experienced a boom in
the past few years have now entered a stage of normal development.
</P>
<P>
Facing fiercer competition from chain stores and specialized
markets, the State-owned department stores are making efforts to
enliven their business to lure customers, resulting in a better
service.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale State-owned department stores in Nanjing scored
a 20 percent growth in sales between January and July, thanks to a
winning formula of better service.
</P>
<P>
To meet the competition department stores in Beijing and
Shanghai have resorted to brand-name products to attract
buyers. As a result the big-name brands top 40 percent of their
sales.
</P>
<P>
The commitment to crack-down on fake and counterfeit goods has
constituted another important edge.
</P>
<P>
The chain stores, already 9,000 strong, are becoming
increasingly popular because of their convenient locations in
neighborhood areas and longer opening hours.
</P>
<P>
The specialized markets are welcomed, not only because of the
choice of goods available, but also by the competitive prices they
can offer because of direct or close connections with the
producers.

<HEADLINE> Incorrect Treatment Contributed to Hemingway's Suicide: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway
was the victim of medical treatment that aggravated his depression
and led him to commit suicide, a U.S. pharmacologist claimed here
today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of specialists, entitled "Ernest
Hemingway: Tough Journalism," Alex Cardoni put forward the
hypothesis that "Hemingway's depressive state became more acute
because of taking reserpine."
</P>
<P>
Cardoni said he believed the use of this medication worsened
the American novelist's manic-depression and brought on
paranoid psychosis.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. for
psychological, not physical, reasons although various illnesses
such as liver disease, hypertension and impotence were later
ascribed to him, Cardoni said.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the reserpine-based treatment was a mistake, as was
the later use of electric shock treatment, which was inappropriate
for a person with such an intense intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
The method only produced a temporary "improvement" during which
Hemingway committed suicide in July 1961, he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Heminway's links to the media, which will end
on Thursday, is being attended by some 20 scholars from Bolivia,
the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Earnest Hemingway, born in 1899, won the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1954. He was famous for a number of works such The
Old Man and the Sea, For Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to
Arms. He committed suicide in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Progress in China's All-round Diplomacy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China has displayed an
all-round and vigorous diplomacy in the first seven months of the
year, with Chinese top leaders traveling to more than 20 countries
in five continents.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made successful trips to six
African countries in May, and six countries in Europe and Central
Asia in June. Premier Li Peng visited France and participated in
the first Europe-Asia Meeting in Thailand, and the eighth National
Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, China received many top leaders from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's 38,000-km tour of Africa was the first ever visit there
by a Chinese president and Party chief since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Through their meetings, the Chinese and African leaders agreed
that it is necessary as well as possible for the two sides to
become each other's "all-weather friend."
</P>
<P>
Jiang proposed a four-point policy for China-Africa ties, which
stressed treating each other as equals, seeking common development
on the basis of mutual benefit, increasing consultation and
cooperation in international affairs, and creating a more splendid
world with a forward-looking approach.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's trip to three central Asian countries, following their
presidents' visit to China in April, also marks the first ever
state visit by a top Chinese leader to the area.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng's visit to France is believed to be an
important move enhancing relations between China and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, visited Cuba, Greece and Canada; and
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji visited Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
China has been putting priority on strengthening friendship and
cooperation with neighboring countries and other developing
countries. Of the 20 heads of state and government leaders who
visited China from January to July, 12 were from China's
neighboring countries and other countries in Asia, Africa and the
Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and the
establishment of Sino-Russian strategic relations of cooperation
facing the 21st century, ushered in a new chapter in the history
of Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
The new type of relationship between the two countries featured
the principles of "non alignment, non antagonism and not directed
against any third party."
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed in late April between China, Russia,
Kazakstan, Kyrghyzstan, and Tajikstan on strengthening military
trust in border areas, the first of its kind in human history,
will promote global as well as regional peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
China has shared with many nations the view that all countries,
big or small, should choose their own social systems and
development mode in line with their specific conditions, oppose
external interference in a country's internal affairs, as well as
hegemonism and power politics, and stand for developing
cooperative relations among all countries on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The active and effective diplomatic moves have also generated a
momentum to reinforce economic cooperations.
</P>
<P>
The talks between China and the United States on the protection
of intellectual property in June ended in success, thus avoiding a
trade war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In June, US President's national security advisor Anthony Lake
visited Beijing. President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng met
with Lake, which signaled a relaxation of the rather tense
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) has stepped up
contacts with political parties of other countries, including
countries which are yet to establish diplomatic relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
By its 75th birthday on July 1 this year, the CPC had forged
official ties with more than 300 political parties in some 120
countries, including 50 political parties in 36 African countries,
and 24 political parties in 10 Latin American countries which have
not yet diplomatically linked with China.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and cooperation between the armed forces of China
and other countries have also been playing a positive role in
obtaining international understanding of and sympathy for China's
modernization drive on its national defense.
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors were impressed that China is not posing nor
will pose a threat to the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Oil Exports to Increase by 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Oil exports in
Colombia are expected to increase by 30 percent this year to
nearly 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, an oil company president said
today.
</P>
<P>
Luis Bernardo Flores, president of the Colombian state oil
company, ECOPETROL, said good prices in the world market and the
growth in oil production from the Cusiana wells were among the
factors behind the increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Colombia's oil sales overseas totalled 1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both ECOPETROL and the foreign oil companies operating in this
country have benefited from the constant increase in international
prices, said the oil executive.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil from Cusiana oil fields in the eastern plains
rose to 24 U.S. dollars per barrel one week ago from 18 dollars at
the beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> Training Enables More Deaf-Mute People to Speak In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of young deaf
youngsters in China are now able to speak, thanks to a special
training program launched in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 20 million deaf people among its 1.2
billion population, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Until recently nine of ten deaf people were also mute, but that
figure is changing since training was introduced to enable people
to speak, according to a senior official of the China Deaf
People's Association.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony to mark the 39th International Deaf People's Day
in Tianjin, Fu Zhiwei, vice-chairman of the association, said that
in the past five years, nearly 60,000 deaf-mute children have
learned to speak after receiving special language training.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China currently has 20.57
million deaf people, including more than 40,000 deaf and mute
students who are studying in 1,000 special schools all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
Before the China Disabled Persons' Federation was founded in
1988, China had only 400 schools for deaf and mute children.
</P>
<P>
Many TV stations in China, including the China Central
Television (CCTV), provide special programs for the deaf in sign
language.
</P>
<P>
Fu expressed the hope that all deaf people in China should
persist in studying and try to increase legal awareness to protect
their own legitimate rights and interests.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,356 new HIV
cases were confirmed in Malaysia in the first seven months of this
year, bringing the total HIV cases in the country to 16,774, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total HIV infected victims, 476 acquired AIDS and
406 died, the reports quoted Health Minister Chua Jui Meng as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chua said figures for the first seven months of the year showed
an average of 337 people being infected a month and one
AIDS-related death in every three days.
</P>
<P>
He said there was an urgent need to address the situation as
the majority of the cases involved the youth below the age of 39.
</P>
<P>
He said an education program which will eventually involve 2.7
million youths in the country would help young people face the
AIDS epidemic in schools, workplaces and social organizations.
</P>
<P>
The policy of screening all drug addicts has helped to keep
track of the situation as they happened to form the largest number
of newly discovered HIV cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the trend continued unchecked, the country
could expect to see a doubling of figures by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A special emergency police
patrol in China's capital Beijing have seized three suspects
involved in an armed robbery, and smashed another car robbery
syndicate since they started their operation a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Emergency police vehicles began patrolling the capital's
streets on August 20 to help maintain social order and to serve
the people more quickly.
</P>
<P>
Three suspects, armed with knives and hand-made pistols, tried
to rob a taxi, but they were captured within ten minutes by
officers in an emergency police car.
</P>
<P>
In another case, police in an emergency vehicle checked on six
people suspected of stealing, and found 30,000-yuan (about 3,614
US dollars) cash in their car.
</P>
<P>
In later investigations it was found that the cash were the
proceeds from selling a stolen car, and the suspects belonged to a
robbery syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Emergency police vehicles in Beijing are now connected to the
110 police call system, and are co-ordinated with motorcycle,
bicycle and foot patrols for round-the-clock response to
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Police sources claim this move will make easier to reporting
crime and call for help from police, and will expand patrol areas.
</P>
<P>
The local police patrol system started in May 1995.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Striving to Become Regional Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, provincial
capital of Guangdong in South China, is making strenuous efforts
to become the regional financial center.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Dongrong, deputy director of the provincial
branch of People's Bank of China, the city now has 53 foreign bank
branches or representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou now ranks second to Shanghai in foreign investment,
while the city leads all Chinese cities in terms of assets owned
by banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, banking institutions in Guangzhou had
total deposits of 188.6 billion yuan, and outstanding loans of
116.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year State bonds with a face-value of 2.2 billion yuan
were sold, and 20 billion yuan's worth of other bonds and
securities were traded in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, insurance companies in the city earned over
two billion yuan from sales of insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
Some local economists hold that Guangzhou has formed its own
banking network, which consists of state-owned commercial banks,
regional banks, insurance firms, trust and investment companies
and urban credit cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The city now has nearly 2,500 banking institutions, averaging
one for every 3,000 local residents. A total of 1.5 million bank
cards have been issued in the city, and meanwhile, there are over
560 ATM cash dispensers throughout the city, linked to the
provincial ATM network, making it the largest ATM network in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Economists suggest that Guangzhou is eligible to be the
regional financial center with its strong economy and it great
potential for future development.

<HEADLINE> Negative Population Growth in Beijing's Four Districts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has
achieved negative population growth in four of its 18 districts
and counties in the past year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This makes Beijing the second city in China to announce
negative population growth following Shanghai, the country's
largest metropolis. But exact figures are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
The four local districts with negative growth are Dongcheng,
Xicheng, Chongwen and Xuanwu, all downtown commercial areas,
according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yanjun, director of local family planning commission, said
the city's total population surpassed 11 million last year. In the
past five years, 480,700 babies were born, 155,300 fewer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
The natural population growth rate last year in Beijing were
2.8 per 1,000, compared with the 10.55 per 1,000 national average.
</P>
<P>
More than 99 percent of couples of reproductive age use
contraception, and over 84 percent of marriageable people are
marrying later.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 1.35 million, or nearly 60
percent of the young couples in the municipality, had applied for
one-child certificates.
</P>
<P>
Xiao attributed these achievements to the promotion of public
awareness of population problems.
</P>
<P>
So far, the capital has set up 15,000 family planning
associations at different levels, and registered 2.24 million
members.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai reported negative population growth, first in some
districts, then in the whole city, starting in 1991. The negative
growth rate for last year was minus 1.2 per 1,000.

<HEADLINE> Province Helps Dabie Mountain Open to Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The old revolutionary base of
the Dabie Mountain area in China is set to enjoy a massive boom,
thanks to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei Province is building a transportation
network to help Dabie Mountain to open wider to the outside.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, located in an area bordering the provinces of
Hubei, Henan, Hunan and Anhui, is one of the poorest areas in
central China.
</P>
<P>
The once out-of-the-way mountain has become a promising area
with the completion of the Beijing-Kowloon railway, which
stretches from north to south. The railway traverses eight cities
and counties and one farm in the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Road traffic conditions in the mountain have also been improved
by the Shanghai-Chengdu expressway and two Yangtze bridges in
Jiujiang and Huangshi. The government has also approved a third
Yangtze bridge.
</P>
<P>
Now the mountain has become a center at the junction of
Beijing-Kowloon railway and Yangtze Economic Belt.
</P>
<P>
There are 20 stations along the railway in the Dabie
mountainous area. In the first half of this year, the province
invested 452 million yuan (about 54 million US dollars) in
building infrastructure facilities for the areas surrounding the
stations.
</P>
<P>
In the areas, the province has built 25 highways leading to the
stations and a number of power stations, waterworks, as well as
telecommunications, power and water supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of infrastructure facilities has increased the
Dabie Mountain's self-development capability and attractiveness to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
At present, mountainous areas along the railway have set up 40
development zones, which are expected to generate an additional
output value of 3.1 billion yuan (about 373 million US dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months, 15 Sino-foreign joint ventures, with
a total investment of 50 million US dollars, were given approval
in the areas.

BUENOS AIRES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A cook from the
northern province of Misiones last night was able to fry what she
considers is the largest breaded veal cutlet in the world and
hopes to enter the Guiness book of records with it.
</P>
<P>
According to a report today from the Telam news agency, the
super cutlet prepared by the cook, Mirta Irene Arenhardt,
weighed 8,750 grams, was 1.11 meters long and 53 centimeters
wide, all of which was certified by a notary.
</P>
<P>
This cutlet consisted of one piece of meat, carefully
carved from a single cut of beef, explained Mirta Irene to two
witnesses and a large number of journalists.
</P>
<P>
To cook the super cutlet, she used an huge skillet
especially made for the occasion, 60 liters of oil, 60 eggs,
three kilos of batter, garlic and parsley.
</P>
<P>
After tasting the super cutlet, served with fried potatoes and
"empanadas" (turnover pastries), a typical Argentinian menu, the
journalists were convinced that they had not only eaten the
largest cutlet in the world but also probably the most delicious.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson was stripped
of his world heavyweight title of the World Boxing Council, the
boxing governing body said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the headquarters here, WBC declared
its heavyweight title vacant and a new title bout will be fought
between Lennox Lewis of Britain and Oliver McCall of the United
States here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WBC motion was in accordance with the order by a New Jersey
court earlier this year that Tyson had to fight Lewis first before
facing World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Bruce Seldon.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tyson's promoter Don King challenged the order by setting
a fight against Seldon prior to a promised bout with Lewis, and
Tyson stopped Seldon in the first minutes to win the WBC title.
</P>
<P>
Although Don King pledged to pay Lewis 4 million US dollars for
his step-aside, both camps failed to reach the deal.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, Tyson is scheduled to take the challenge from former
undisputed champion Evander Holyfield on November 9 in Las Vegas
for his WBA title.

UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre Moussa said here today that a just and comprehensive
peace is the cornerstone of stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he said that peace in the Middle East will not
be completely comprehensive and will not be lasting until a strict
regime for regional security is established.
</P>
<P>
"The region must be totally free from all weapons of mass
destruction, be they nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and
their delivering vehicles," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are following closely the huge Israeli arsenal that
includes weapons of mass destruction, missiles and anti-missiles.
We wonder about the rational and the reasons behind it," he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing arms control and regional security as one of
the pillars of peace and stability in the Middle East, Egypt
believes that economic and regional cooperation under a just peace
constitutes another pillar of stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
On solution of the Gulf Area issue, he listed the principles as
following:
</P>
<P>
-- strict complaince with Security Council resolutions on Iraq
without any default or transgression;
</P>
<P>
-- maintaining its unity and respecting the rights and
well-being of the Iraqis, be they Arabs or Kurds;
</P>
<P>
-- putting into effect the oil-for-food formula without any
further delay;
</P>
<P>

-- no intervention policy nor manipulation of ethnic and
religious minorities in the Gulf area.

<HEADLINE> Non-Aligned Movement Condemns New Interventionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ernesto Samper,
president of Colombia and chairman of Non-Aligned Movement, today
strongly condemned new interventionism and other obstacles to
progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commemorative meeting of the 35th anniversary
of the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement, he said that
poverty, isolation, environmental plundering, as well as
commercial and technological restrictions continue to be obstacles
to developing countries' pursuit of progress though the cold war
is over.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are living in a post-war era, the winds of
interventionism continue to blow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aggravating relationships with the industrialized nations a new
and dangerous form of interventionism is emerging: conditionality,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Conditionality of international relations takes advantage of
the new openness and economic globalization to impose demands that
ignore territorial barriers and limit growth opportunities, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The social, environmental and political conditions burden
commerce and restrict multilateral financial flows. They are
motivated by internal politics and expressed as international
rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are not military actions nor economic embargoes: they
are subtle forms of intervention, paper missiles in fact, that are
creating war-like situations of low and painful intensity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include domestic measures with extraterritorial
effects, protectionist laws, immigration restrictions and
selective visa measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today highly
evaluated the Non-Aligned Movement which consists of 113 countries
at present.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for a renaissance of non-alignment" as the
goal of just, peaceful and equitable global order is far from
being realized, he said.

<HEADLINE> Diet Changes as Economy Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- With constantly rising living
standards the Chinese people are turning to more nutritious, fresh
and simple food.
</P>
<P>
Breakfasts are in the forefront of the eating revolution, with
steam buns and simple porridge making way for milk, bread, cakes
and eggs.
</P>
<P>
The transformation in the traditional eating diet began in the
late 1980s when for the first time China announced the ending of
shortage of grain with output per head reaching 400 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
It proved that the country can feed 22 percent of the world's
population, with only seven percent of the world arable land.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the urban population consumed per person a daily
average of 387 grams of grain, 78.3 grams of meat and poultry,
36.1 grams of fish and shrimps, 24.2 grams of milk, and 76.1 grams
of egg.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that while grain consumption remained
basically unchanged, other indicators all rose by a range of 10 to
20 percent in comparison with the figures for 1990.
</P>
<P>
While most people in the past relied on rice and steam buns to
feed themselves, now they think meat and eggs are more
indispensible.
</P>
<P>
Another change is that while in the past people depended on
different vegetables in different seasons, now they can have all
kinds of vegetables all the year round, thanks to a revolution in
growing methods and the increase in output.
</P>
<P>
As the pace of life quickens, more and more people now buy
half-prepared food, or go more often to restaurants, instead of
simply relying on cooking in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a recent survey showed, Chinese six-year-old
children are now on average 4.8 centimeters higher than six-year
olds in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Global FDI Flows Hit Record High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Global foreign direct
investment (FDI) flows in 1995 hit a record high of 315 billion
U.S. dollars, 40 percent more than that in 1994, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Transnational corporations (TNCs) from the United States,
Germany, Britain, Japan and France accounted for two thirds of the
global FDI flows in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sharp competition has pushed TNCs to increase cross-border
investment and production. Increasing liberalization, trade
regionalization as well as privatization and investment-friendly
policies in more countries also have played a role in the increase
of the global FDI flows.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD predicted the momentum to continue in the next few
years, basing this on analysis of future investment plans of the
world's top 100 TNCs.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States remained both the biggest
destination and home country of FDI, with inflows over 60 billion
dollars and outflows 96 billion.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable increase was registered last year in developed
countries in both FDI inflows and outflows, up from 1994 by 53
percent and 42 percent respectively to reach 203 billion and 271
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to a boom of mergers and acquisitions
between leading European corporations and that between U.S. and
Western European businesses, UNCTAD said in its newly released
1996 World Investment Report.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries received a total of 99.7 billion dollars
in FDI, 15 percent more than in 1994, with 65 percent of them
flowing into Asia and 38 percent to China alone.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD sees FDI to Africa increasing, noting that more and more
African countries are endeavoring to attract FDI by improving
regulatory framework, including measures to protect FDI and avoid
double taxation.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to Central and Eastern Europe last year doubled the
1994 volume to total 12.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD deems economic performance in the region a key factor in
determining future FDI levels, adding that many uncertainties
there will continue to influence investments by TNCs.

<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine central bank has expressed concerns over the
widening trade imbalance and its inflationary effects, admitting
that this could hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Fidel Ramos said Tuesday that the zone
of peace and development to be established in Mindanao will be the
focus of intensive development efforts in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- At least five members of the Moro National Liberation Front
were killed Tuesday when hundreds of former Muslim rebels attacked
their camp on a southern island in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer:
</P>
<P>
-- Direct Foreign Investments in the Asian countries steadily
increased in the last five years. The 1995 level reached 65
billion US dollars, or 20.6 percent of total global equity of 315
billion dollars during the period, the World Investment Report
1996 showed.

<HEADLINE> Asia Strengthens Role of Host of Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South, East and South-East
Asia have strengthened their role as the largest host developing
region for foreign direct investment (FDI), according the World
Investment Report 1996 released by the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The FDI inflows to these areas, standing at an estimated 65
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, accounted for two thirds of all
inflows to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
East and South-East Asia alone received an estimated 62 billion
U.S. dollars, while South Asia saw a doubling of the inflows, to
an estimated 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, mainly as a result of a
tripling of inflows into India.
</P>
<P>
Although inflows are soaring in other countries in whole Asia,
the report deemed China as the principal drive behind the boom.
</P>
<P>
With FDI inflows increasing from 33.8 billion U.S. dollars in
1994 to about 38 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, China remained the
world's second largest recipient country, just after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The report said recent FDI policy changes in China may
temporarily dampen its FDI inflows, which could fall below 30
billion U.S. dollars in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
However, given China's outstanding growth performance and the
continued opening of new areas to FDI, such as infrastructure, its
attractiveness to foreign investors is unlikely to be affected
seriously. "China will remain one of the top FDI destinations in
the world," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that with increasing numbers of Asian
countries now actively encouraging FDI into infrastructure
projects and moving ahead with privatization, FDI flows to the
entire region should continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
An increasingly important new element in the Asia picture is
the mounting interest of European investors, partly stimulated by
global competitive pressures, and partly by official actions by
the European Union and the Europe Investment Promotion Action
Plan to be launched as a result of the Asia-Europe Summit in March.
</P>
<P>
"European transnational corporations, after neglecting Asia in
the past, are now changing course and investing more," the UNCTAD
report said.

HAVANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- In the last year Cuban health
authorities have recorded a total of 500,000 blood donations,
thanks to the collaboration of the nation's Committees in Defense
of the Revolution (CDR).
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented figure will be a motive for celebration in
the upcoming 36th anniversary of the foundation of the Committees,
CDR sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The total blood donations over the last 34 years since the
count began to be made in the October 1962 is 7,653,000.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Cuba achieved the objective of the World
Health Organization (WHO) of one donation for every twenty
inhabitants set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The CDRs plan to maintain the 1-20 ratio in the next century
solely with the donations made through these groups, without
including those from patients' families.

<HEADLINE> Japan Suggests "New Development Strategy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATION, September 24 (xinhua) -- The Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto put forward a "new development
strategy" as part of its efforts to facilitate the U.N. schemes of
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of development to bring about the growth and
stability of developing countries is one of the pillars Japan
suggested for the creation of a better world for future
generation, the Japanese prime minister said this Tuesday during
the general debate of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The central ideas in Japan's strategy are an emphasis on the
ownership by developing countries of the development process and
on the establishment of a "new global partnership."
</P>
<P>
Under such a partnership, he said, developed and developing
countries would be released from the North-South confrontational
mind-set, and cooperate with each other.
</P>
<P>
Japan will work to further enhance its official development
assistance in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said it is also important to address
development, not simply with such an assistance, but also by
organically combining various elements including trade,
investment, economic policy, debt relief, technology transfer, and
the development of social infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Japan attaches particular importance to the development of
Africa, according to the Japanese prime minister. "This is because
poverty and conflict are particularly acute in Africa," he added.
The country hopes to host the Tokyo International Conference on
African Development in 1998, following a preparatory meeting that
will take place, also in Tokyo, next year.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav PM Urges Eliminating Outer Wall of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic said on Tuesday there were no more reasons for
maintaining the "outer wall of sanctions" and preventing a return
of Yugoslavia to international organizations.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating six international fair exhibitions in
Belgrade, he said a large number of foreign participants was a
sign that Yugoslavia's international position was being
strengthened and that foreign partners were determined not only to
renew severed business ties with Yugoslav firms but also to
upgrade them through new projects and in new spheres.
</P>
<P>
After the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the
imposition of the U.N.-sanctions against Belgrade, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has failed to join the United Nations and
many international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said he was pleased the Yugoslav economy had showed
vitality in difficult conditions and that it was recovering from
the adverse effects of the sanctions, whose definite removal is
expected to take place this week in line with the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's economic trends in the past few months are
encouraging because the national currency Dinar's rate has been
stable and the black foreign currency market has been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Restricted budget expenditure, determination to cover budget
spending from real sources and good supply of fuel and consumer
goods on the market also contribute to overall stability, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Yugoslav government would invest maximum
efforts to obtain the good functioning of the economic system.
</P>
<P>
Recently adopted laws in the field of economy, which were
adjusted to European Union regulations and those of the world
trade organization, will also contribute to such efforts, Kontic
added.

The combined market shares being low, the EC has decided that
the operation does not create or strengthen a dominant position on

<HEADLINE> U.S., South Korea might Resume Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
inclined to consider South Korea's call for a resumption of joint
Team Spirit military maneuvers, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials' remarks came as the South Korean Defense
Ministry issued a statement, saying: "We plan to strongly propose
to the U.S. side resuming the joint Team Spirit exercises as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that is the subject of consultations between
the United States and South Korea. Our inclination is to talk to
the South Koreans about this and see where they stand," State
Department spokesman Glyn Davies said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Democratic People's Republic of Korea has said that one of its
submarines carrying 26 crew ran aground off South Korea on an
routine mission last week and demanded South Korea to return the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea, seeing it as a spy submarine and the crewmen
as infiltrators, called the incident "deliberate military
provocation" and urged the United States to resume the military
exercises, which has not been held since 1993 as a result of
easing tension at the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his South Korean
counterpart Gong Ro-mung were expected to discuss the issue during
a meeting at the United Nations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean President Kim Young-Sam is considering
a review of his country's policy toward Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
He has told a group of Japanese newspaper editors in an
interview that he is "seriously considering reviewing our policy
toward North Korea".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zaire, Rwanda Agree to Observe Border Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Zaire and Rwanda today agreed
to observe a ceasefire on their common border after the two
countries exchanged artillery, rocket and machine-gun fires for two
nights Sunday and Monday, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Radio Agatashya, an independent radio which is based in Bukavu,
eastern Zaire, quoted Pastor Kyembwa Wa Lumona, the governor of
the Zairean province of Sud-Kivu bordering Rwanda, as saying that
he would respect this decision.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Rwandan Defense Ministry also confirmed the
ceasefire, but he refused to call the agreement as one of
ceasefire as the two countries "are not at war."
</P>
<P>
"The Zaireans began to shoot and have decided to stop. This is
a big difference. If they begin to shoot again, we will shoot
back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the humanitarian groups working in refugee camps in
eastern Zaire have evacuated most of their staff to the Kenyan
capital Nairobi by planes.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi, the representative of a major organization of Hutu
refugees, the RDR, said that the objective of the shootings was to
drive away humanitarian groups working in the refugee camps which
are sheltering some 300,000 Hutu refugees, most of whom fled
Rwanda in 1994 following a genocide in the country.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed and several others -- all of them civilians
-- were wounded on the Zairean side during the shootings which
lasted for several hours, according to the governor of Sud-Kivu.
Rwanda reported no casualty or damage.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has lately accused Rwanda of supporting armed Tutsi bands
to launch "operation of destabilization" in Zaire's eastern
Uvira region. Rwanda rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
In an message to the local population of Sud-Kivu today, the
governor of the Zairean province said that "one should put an end
to the conflictual situation which has not fundamental reason to
be."
</P>
<P>
He called on the civilians "to maintain calmness, vigilance
and confidence in the soldiers."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav PM Urges Eliminating Outer Wall of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic said on Tuesday there were no more reasons for
maintaining the "outer wall of sanctions" and preventing a return
of Yugoslavia to international organizations.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating six international fair exhibitions in
Belgrade, he said a large number of foreign participants was a
sign that Yugoslavia's international position was being
strengthened and that foreign partners were determined not only to
renew severed business ties with Yugoslav firms but also to
upgrade them through new projects and in new spheres.
</P>
<P>
After the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the
imposition of the U.N.-sanctions against Belgrade, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has failed to join the United Nations and
many international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said he was pleased the Yugoslav economy had showed
vitality in difficult conditions and that it was recovering from
the adverse effects of the sanctions, whose definite removal is
expected to take place this week in line with the Dayton peace
accords.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada to Raise Capacity This Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada is boosting
capacity on transatlantic and Asian routes by 41 percent and 29
percent this coming winter.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal-based airline said that for the season starting
October 28, it will add two flights a week between Vancouver and
Osaka, Japan, providing year-round daily non-stop service.
</P>
<P>
On the Vancouver-Hong Kong route, one more flight a week will
be offered, for a total of four weekly non-stop flights.
</P>
<P>
It will also offer daily service between Canada and Seoul, with
five weekly flights from both Toronto and Vancouver, according to
local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Air Canada's domestic capacity will rise 9
percent, while the capacity on Canada-U.S. routes will remain
flat.
</P>
<P>
The reports said this move by Air Canada confirms a trend to
seek revenues from foreign routes and less from the saturated and
competitive domestic market.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the airline got more than half of its
revenues from foreign operations last month, and the trend is
likely to continue.

<HEADLINE> Perot Seeks FCC Help Regarding Prime Air Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party presidential
nominee Ross Perot on Tuesday asked the Federal Communications
Commission to intervene on his behalf with the TV networks.
</P>
<P>
Perot said he hasn't been able to buy desirable broadcast times
for his 30-minute infomercials during the fall TV season.
</P>
<P>
"There is an absolute obligation to sell adequate prime time --
not just in the times they choose to sell," The Associated Press
quoted Perot's attorney Kim Askew as saying at a Dallas news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Perot campaign coordinator Russ Verney said that in 1992, the
campaign had ample opportunity to purchase the time it wanted, but
in 1996 it was being offered "marginal time slots when there is
very little viewership."
</P>
<P>
Network representatives stressed that Perot already has aired
several infomercials and said they were still holding discussions
about additional purchases.
</P>
<P>
Verney said the campaign was asking the FCC "to intervene on
our behalf and speak with the networks about providing equal time
and reasonable access."
</P>
<P>
FCC spokesman Bobby Baker said he could not comment on the
filing until the commission had time to review it.
</P>
<P>
Perot has appeared in five 30-minute broadcasts, some in prime
time, and scheduled two others since he received the Reform Party
nomination on August 18.
</P>
<P>
Perot was hoping to buy about 15 half-hour time blocks between
Labor Day and the elections. His campaign has now turned to
negotiating for 30-second ads, and has had problems getting time
slots for those as well.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Calls for Integration of Transport Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An EU (European Union)
official today called for closer integration of national transport
policies and urged more spending for the TransEuropean Transport
Networks (TEN).
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, the EU transport commissioner, made the appeal in
a speech delivered here Tuesday to the Irish Belgian Business
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Just as in the last century the creation of national single
markets required compatible transport systems and common rules, so
in our generation a growing international single market needs much
the same," Kinnock said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU was facing a transport challenge if it was
really serious about building a wider Europe, integrating its
economies and increasing competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"A large part...of the answer must come from investment in new
infrastructure for land, water and air transport," the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the dislocations which came from inadequate
infrastructure and fragmented administration must be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said that failure to get on with the task of
strengthening and updating Europe's transport networks meant extra
cost burdens, late delivery and more danger and environmental
damage though the need for finance was now posing special
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said that TEN's development in the next three years would
require the EU to spend an extra billion ECUs (some 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commissioner insisted that the money should come from
within ceilings already agreed instead of from any new
contributions from EU member states.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu held talks
here this evening and both leaders hailed the state of the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks at the Downing Street
this evening, Major said, "the bilateral relations between Israel
and the United Kingdom is in as good a shape today as I can ever
remember it being."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived here this afternoon for his first visit
to Britain since becoming Israeli Prime Minister, also said that
he was satisfied with bilateral relations between Britain and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the Israeli Prime Minister
has pledged to continue the search for peace "on all fronts" with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also expressed his conviction that "the basis of
proceeding here is good faith and reciprocity and fulfilment of
commitments on both sides."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the commitment he and Major shared toward peace
was guided by two principles -- the idea of security as a basis
for peace and the importance of both sides fulfilling their
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader is due to hold separate talks with Labor
leader Tony Blair and former prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Wednesday before flying to Paris.
